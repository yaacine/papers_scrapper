1057611,Magnetically actuated microstructured surfaces can actively modify cell migration behaviour,2016,F Khademolhosseini and C-C Liu and CJ Lim and M Chiao,18,Biomedical microdevices,1,13,Springer US,We present a study on the application of magnetically actuated polymer micropillar surfaces in modifying the migration behaviour of cells. We show that micropillar surfaces actuated at a frequency of 1 Hz can cause more than a 5-fold decrease in cell migration rates compared to controls. whereas non-actuated micropillar surfaces cause no statistically significant alterations in cell migration rates. The effectiveness of the micropillar arrays in impeding cell migration depends on micropillar density and placement patterns. as well as the direction of micropillar actuation with respect to the direction of cell migration.

SL,Recently. nano devices have been developed which use Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) as structural elements. To define the range of applicability of CNTs in such devices. it is important to investigate failure modes such as the axial buckling limit. Classical continuum models are inaccurate as they are unable to account for the size-effects in such devices. In this work. a modified nonlocal continuum shell model for the axial buckling of CNTs is proposed and compared with a nonlocal model for torsional buckling. This is done through modifying classical continuum models by incorporating basic concepts from nonlocal elasticity. Furthermore. molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed on a range of nanotubes with different diameters. Compared to classical models. the modified nonlocal models provide a much better fit to MD simulation results. Using MD simulation results for axial buckling. values of the nonlocal constant and shell thickness are calculated.,True,BQASG-oAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,5,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.432.4661&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=93,4106787038840553357,/scholar?cites=4106787038840553357,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.432.4661&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=93,0,0,0

1057614,Nonlocal continuum shell models for torsion of single-walled carbon nanotubes,2009,Farzad Khademolhosseini,,,,,,Description Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention from scientists and engineers because of their relevance to a wide range of applications. Various approaches have been used for the characterization of CNT properties. among which continuum modeling has generated much interest due to computational efficiency. However. at the nanoscale the dimensions of a system are comparable to the inter-atomic or inter-molecular spacing of that system. and the material cannot be modeled as a continuum. This is known as the “size-effect”. To overcome the limitations of classical continuum mechanics. modified continuum models have been proposed. among which models based on the concept of nonlocal elasticity have proven effective in quantifying the size-dependent mechanical response of CNTs. This thesis investigates the “small-size” effects in the torsional response of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by developing a modified nonlocal continuum shell model for their torsion. The purpose is to facilitate the design of devices based on CNT torsion by providing a simple. accurate and efficient continuum model that can predict the torsional buckling loads. the frequency of torsional vibrations and the propagation speed of torsional waves. To this end. Eringen’s equations of nonlocal elasticity are incorporated into the classical models for torsion of cylindrical shells given by Timoshenko and Donnell.

Low frequency dielectric relaxation modes corresponding to collective behavior of molecules (Goldstone- and soft-modes) in the SmC* phase have been found to be masked by the ionic conductance. Two slow modes of dielectric relaxation due to the ionic conductance have been detected (below 15 Hz) in planar-aligned samples. It has been observed that the effect of ionic conductance decreases with the number of thermal annealing cycles on the materials. With large number of thermal annealing cycles it has been possible to wipe out the effects of ionic conductance and then to detect other weak modes of dielectric relaxation which are otherwise masked.,True,75XC5x8AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,44,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01411590310001596400,3676620750024468647,/scholar?cites=3676620750024468647,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ravindra_Dhar/publication/236980953_Low_frequency_dielectric_spectroscopy_of_room_temperature_chiral_liquid_crystal_mixtures/links/0deec531b4da82e919000000/Low-frequency-dielectric-spectroscopy-of-room-temperature-chiral-liquid-crystal-mixtures.pdf,0,0,0

IBD have two main conditions. Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. and have been extensively investigated in recent years. Antibiotics derived from salicylates. steroids. immunosuppressors. and anti-TNF therapy are part of the therapeutic arsenal for IBD. However. very often patients stop responding to treatments over the time. In this context. searching for alternative agents is crucial for IBD clinical management. Natural products derived from medicinal plants are an interesting therapeutic alternative. since several studies have proven effective treatments in animal models of intestinal inflammation. Several naturally occurring compounds are potent antioxidants. both as free radical scavengers and as modulators of antioxidant enzymes expression and activity. A number of natural compounds have also been proved to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines. decreasing the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). which is important to the inflammatory response in IBD.

The current concept relies in the fact that TNF‐α stimulates the cascade release of other pro‐inflammatory cytokines. such as IL‐1β. IL‐6. and IL‐8 (CINC‐1 in rats). triggering the release of the final inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and sympathetic amines that directly sensitize the nociceptors. However. this may not be the sole mechanism involved as the blockade of TNF‐α synthesis by thalidomide prevents hyperalgesia without interrupting the synthesis of IL‐1β. IL‐6. and CINC‐1.

Advanced biophysical approaches revealed a critical role for structural rearrangements in the cytoplasmic loop and dimerization of the C-terminal tail. resulting in binding of the C-terminal tail to the cytoplasmic loop and Cx43 gap junction channel closure during cellular acidosis. This has spurred the development of Cx43-mimetic peptides and peptidomimetics that interfere with these loop/tail interactions. thereby preventing the closure of Cx43 gap junctions. e.g. in the heart upon ischemia.

Most connexins are characterized by a very rapid turn-over in a variety of cell systems. The regulation of connexin turn-over by phosphorylation and ubiquitination events has been well documented. Moreover. different pathways have been implicated in connexin degradation. including proteasomal and lysosomal-based pathways. Only recently. autophagy emerged as an important connexin-degradation pathway for different connexin isoforms. As such. conditions well known to induce autophagy have an immediate impact on the connexin-expression levels. This is not only limited to experimental conditions but also several pathophysiological conditions associated with autophagy (dys)function affect connexin levels and their presence at the cell surface as gap junctions. Finally. connexins are not only substrates of autophagy but also emerge as regulators of the autophagy process. In particular. several connexin isoforms appear to recruit pre-autophagosomal autophagy-related proteins. including Atg16 and PI3K-complex components. to the plasma membrane. thereby limiting their availability and capacity for regulating autophagy.,True,j6F2B-sAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,28,https://bmcmolcellbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12860-016-0093-9,9576219682723436855,/scholar?cites=9576219682723436855,,https://bmcmolcellbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12860-016-0093-9,0,0,0

Studying the characteristics of Ca2+-wave propagation in BCECs. an important form of intercellular communication. in response to physiological signaling events has led to the discovery of important insights in the functional properties and regulation of native Cx43 hemichannels. Together with ectopic expression models for Cx43 hemichannels and truncated/mutated Cx43 versions. it became very clear that loop/tail interactions play a key role in controlling the activity of Cx43 hemichannels. Interestingly. the negative regulation of Cx43 hemichannels by enhanced actin/myosin contractility seems to impinge upon loss of these loop/tail interactions essential for opening Cx43 hemichannels. Finally. these molecular insights have spurred the development of novel peptide tools that can selectively inhibit Cx43 hemichannels but not Cx43 gap junctions or hemichannels formed by other Cx isoforms. These tools now set the stage to hunt for novel physiological functions for Cx43 hemichannels in primary cells and tissues and to tackle disease conditions associated with excessive. pathological Cx43-hemichannel openings.,True,j6F2B-sAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,24,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00348/full,18399475997844635854,/scholar?cites=18399475997844635854,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00348/full,0,0,0

This is enabled by the direct interaction of CD81 with the deoxynucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase SAMHD1. This interaction prevents endosomal accumulation and favours the proteasome-dependent degradation of SAMHD1. Consequently. CD81 depletion results in SAMHD1 increased expression. decreasing the availability of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) and thus HIV-1 reverse transcription. Conversely. CD81 overexpression. but not the expression of a CD81 carboxy (C)-terminal deletion mutant. increases cellular dNTP content and HIV-1 reverse transcription.

Patients with initial diagnosis of distant disease have a worst 5-year survival compared to patients with localized disease. Therapies that target primary tumors fail to eradicate distant dissemination of cancer. Recently. immunotherapies have improved the survival of patients with metastatic disease. such as melanoma and lung cancer. However. only a fraction of patients responds to immunotherapy modalities that target the host immune system. The need to identify new druggable targets that inhibit or prevent metastasis is therefore much needed. Tetraspanins have emerged as key players in regulating cell migration. invasion and metastasis. By serving as molecular adaptors that cluster adhesion receptors. signaling molecules. and cell surface receptors; tetraspanins are involve in all steps of the metastatic cascade. They regulate cell proliferation. participate in EMT transition. modulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion. and participate in angiogenesis and invasion processes. Tetraspanins have also been shown to modulate metastasis indirectly through exosomes and by regulating cellular interactions in the immune system. Importantly. targeting individual tetraspanin with antibodies have impacted tumor progression.

Although several FDA approved drugs targeting the HCV serine protease and polymerase have shown promising results. there is a need for better drugs that are effective in treating a broader range of HCV genotypes and subtypes without being used in combination with interferon and/or ribavirin. Recently. two crystal structures of the core of the HCV E2 protein (E2c) have been determined. providing structural information that can now be used to target the E2 protein and develop drugs that disrupt the early stages of HCV infection by blocking E2’s interaction with different host factors. Using the E2c structure as a template. we have created a structural model of the E2 protein core (residues 421–645) that contains the three amino acid segments that are not present in either structure. Computational docking of a diverse library of 1.715 small molecules to this model led to the identification of a set of 34 ligands predicted to bind near conserved amino acid residues involved in the HCV E2: CD81 interaction. Surface plasmon resonance detection was used to screen the ligand set for binding to recombinant E2 protein. and the best binders were subsequently tested to identify compounds that inhibit the infection of Huh-7 cells by HCV.

Therefore. the crucial role of this enzyme in cell division makes it a potential target for designing drugs that inhibit cell growth for cancer therapy. An increased interest in RR as a target for cancer therapy has been documented since the discovery that human RR is regulated by p53 enzyme and that a mutation in p53 leads to several forms of cancer. Cell proliferation stops if normal RR is inhibited. A new strategy to kill the cancer cells would be using specific inhibitors that inhibit the action of RR enzyme. The inhibitor must be a radical scavenger which destroys the tyrosyl radical or an iron metal scavenger (which affects iron center).

The wide distribution range of this species renders it susceptible to coastal and oceanic fishing operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) consider this species to be highly vulnerable. especially due to its biological parameters. which are different from those of other sharks that occupy the same niche (e.g.. Prionace glauca). Consequently. considerable declines in abundance have been detected over various parts of its range. most of which are linked to oceanic longline fishing. The species has conflicting life history parameters in studies conducted in the last 30 years. especially with regard to age and growth. The main discrepancies regard the interpretation of the periodicity of the deposition of band pairs (BPs) on vertebrae and the possibility of ontogenetic variations in growth. Shortfin mako sharks (n = 1325) were sampled by onboard observers of the Brazilian chartered pelagic longline fleet based in northeast Brazil from 2005 to 2011. Lengths were 79 to 250 and 73 to 296 cm (fork length.

To analyze the adaptation process of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a high ethanol concentration. repetitive cultivation was performed with a stepwise increase in the ethanol concentration in the culture medium.Methodology/Principal FindingsFirst. a laboratory strain of S. cerevisiae was cultivated in medium containing a low ethanol concentration. followed by repetitive cultivations. Then. the strain repeatedly cultivated in the low ethanol concentration was transferred to medium containing a high ethanol concentration and cultivated repeatedly in the same high-ethanol-concentration medium. When subjected to a stepwise increase in ethanol concentration with the repetitive cultivations. the yeast cells adapted to the high ethanol concentration; the specific growth rate of the adapted yeast strain did not decrease during repetitive cultivation in the medium containing the same ethanol concentration. while that of the non-adapted strain decreased during repetitive cultivation. A comparison of the fatty acid composition of the cell membrane showed that the contents in oleic acid (C18:1) in ethanol-adapted and non-adapted strains were similar. but the content of palmitic acid (C16:0) in the ethanol-adapted strains was lower than that in the non-adapted strain in media containing ethanol.

This uncommon trait for a RNA virus provides influenza with the advantage of access to the nuclear machinery during replication. However. it also increases the complexity of the intracellular trafficking that is required for the viral components to establish a productive infection. The influenza genome segmentation makes the additional trafficking requirements especially challenging. as each viral RNA (vRNA) gene segment must navigate the network of cellular membrane barriers during the processes of entry and assembly. To accomplish this goal. influenza A viruses (IAVs) utilize a combination of viral and cellular mechanisms to coordinate the transport of their proteins and the eight vRNA gene segments in and out of the cell. The aim of this review is to present the current mechanistic understanding for how IAVs facilitate cell entry. replication. virion assembly and intercellular movement. in an effort to highlight some of the unanswered questions regarding the coordination of the IAV infection process.,True,Smece4EAAAAJ:4kG_yR6n1dAC,160,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01581/full,11217827755418466240,/scholar?cites=11217827755418466240,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01581/full,0,0,0

We applied this method to identify influenza A virus (IAV) infections in cells and lung tissue with single-nucleotide specificity and to classify entry and replication stages by gene segment localization.

Influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) exemplifies this concept. as it retains enzymatic function upon proteolytic release from the membrane. However. the subtype 1 NA TMDs have become increasingly more polar in human strains since 1918. which suggests that selection pressure exists on this domain. Here. we investigated the N1 TMD-head domain relationship by exchanging a prototypical “old” TMD (1933) with a “recent” (2009). more polar TMD and an engineered hydrophobic TMD. Each exchange altered the TMD association. decreased the NA folding efficiency. and significantly reduced viral budding and replication at 37°C compared to at 33°C. at which NA folds more efficiently.

This places stringent hydrophobicity requirements on transmembrane domains (TMDs) from single-spanning membrane proteins. On examining the single-spanning influenza A membrane proteins. we found that the strict hydrophobicity requirement applies to the Nout-Cin HA and M2 TMDs but not the Nin-Cout TMDs from the type II membrane protein neuraminidase (NA). To investigate this discrepancy. we analyzed NA TMDs of varying hydrophobicity. followed by increasing polypeptide lengths. in mammalian cells and ER microsomes.

In this study. we show how the regions coding for the ER-targeting sequences of the influenza glycoproteins NA and HA also function as translational regulatory elements that are controlled by the viral RNA-binding protein (RBP) NS1. The translational increase depends on the nucleotide composition and 5′ positioning of the ER-targeting sequence coding regions and is facilitated by the RNA-binding domain of NS1. which can associate with ER membranes. Inserting the ER-targeting sequence coding region of NA into different 5′ UTRs confirmed that NS1 can promote the translation of secretory protein mRNAs based on the nucleotides within this region rather than the resulting amino acids.

However. it remains unclear why influenza NAs evolved to function as Ca 2+-dependent tetramers that display variable stability. Here. we show that the Ca 2+ ion located at the centre of the NA tetramer is a major stability determinant. as this Ca 2+ ion is required for catalysis and its binding affinity varies between NAs. By examining NAs from 2009 pandemic-like H1N1 viruses. we traced the affinity variation to local substitutions that cause residues in the central Ca 2+-binding pocket to reposition. A temporal analysis revealed that these local substitutions predictably alter the stability of the 2009 pandemic-like NAs and contribute to the tendency for the stability to vary up and down over time.

For example. dolphin sounds specific to social interactions. courtship. agonistic behaviour. travel and predation have been identified (Díaz López. 2011; Dudzinski. 1996; Herzing. 1996). The songs of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus. Croll et al.. 2002). bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus.

1057795,Pinniped hearing in a changing acoustic environment,2015,Kane Alexander Cunningham,,,,,,Increasing levels of anthropogenic noise in the world’s oceans are a matter of concern for the conservation of pinnipeds (seals. sea lions. and walruses).  Sound from noise-generating human activities—such as marine construction. oil exploration. and shipping traffic—may alter the lives of pinnipeds in a variety of ways.  For example. anthropogenic noise can interfere with an individual’s ability to detect calls from conspecifics or the sound of an approaching predator; and loud. aversive sounds can cause animals to abandon preferred habitats.  Laboratory studies of hearing in pinnipeds over the past 50 years have expanded knowledge of the basic auditory capabilities of certain species. and data from these studies are currently being used to predict how specific noise-generating activities may affect wild animals.  However. predicting the effects of anthropogenic noise is a complex process. and certain knowledge gaps must be addressed before accurate predictions can be made.  First. it is unclear how well standard hearing data—which are generated using simple. synthetic sounds—can predict pinniped auditory sensitivity to spectrally and temporally complex anthropogenic sounds.  Second. hearing sensitivity data above 80 kHz are scarce for most species. which is problematic given the recent proliferation of high-frequency. high-energy acoustic marine technologies such as commercial sonar and recreational fish finders.

1057798,Satellite tracking of sympatric marine megafauna can inform the biological basis for species co-management,2014,Christian Gredzens and Helene Marsh and Mariana MPB Fuentes and Colin J Limpus and Takahiro Shimada and Mark Hamann,9,PloS one,6,e98944,Public Library of Science,Context Systematic conservation planning is increasingly used to identify priority areas for protection in marine systems. However. ecosystem-based approaches typically use density estimates as surrogates for animal presence and spatial modeling to identify areas for protection and may not take into account daily or seasonal movements of animals. Additionally. sympatric and inter-related species are often managed separately. which may not be cost-effective. This study aims to demonstrate an evidence-based method to inform the biological basis for co-management of two sympatric species. dugongs and green sea turtles. This approach can then be used in conservation planning to delineate areas to maximize species protection.  Methodology/Results Fast-acquisition satellite telemetry was used to track eleven dugongs and ten green turtles at two geographically distinct foraging locations in Queensland. Australia to evaluate the inter- and intra-species spatial relationships and assess the efficacy of existing protection zones. Home-range analysis and bathymetric modeling were used to determine spatial use and compared with existing protection areas using GIS. Dugong and green turtle home-ranges significantly overlapped in both locations. However. both species used different core areas and differences existed between regions in depth zone use and home-range size. especially for dugongs. Both species used existing protection areas in Shoalwater Bay. but only a single tracked dugong used the existing protection area in Torres Strait.

Achieving the intended conservation benefits will depend. in part. on whether or not the released animals remain at the new human-selected location. The present study tested the hypothesis that hard-shelled sea turtles along the coast of north-eastern Australia (9–28°S. 142–153°E) would not remain at new locations and would attempt to return to their original areas.

The lack of knowledge of new foraging sites means there is risk associated with a decision to relocate (e.g. poor foraging) as well as a potential benefit (e.g. improved foraging). Using a unique long‐term satellite tracking dataset for several sea turtle species. combined with capture–mark–recapture data extending over 50 years. we show how. across species. individuals generally maintain tight fidelity to specific foraging sites after extended (up to almost 10.000 km) migration to and from distant breeding sites as well as across many decades.

Guisan and Zimmermann 2000). particularly because understanding a species’ spatial ecology and identifying the spatial scale that is biologically meaningful provides the necessary information for optimal management (Levin 1992. Dungan et al. 2002. Nams et al. 2006). Tracking using acoustic. VHF. satellite-linked telemetry. or archival tags (for examples see Mate 1995. Read and Westgate 1997. Hatase et al. 2002.

However. tracking animals. especially cetaceans and sirenians that spend all of their lives in the water. can be difficult as there are numerous challenges associated with the tag deployment (Irvine 1982.

Dugong dugon (Müller. 1976). is a sirenian that has to be caught prior to deployment of satellite transmitters (Marsh and Rathbun 1990). Unless they are in clear shallow water. dugongs can be difficult to capture (Marsh and Rathbun 1990. Lanyon et al. 2006. Holley 2006). Since the late 1980s. dugongs have mostly been caught using the standard “rodeo method.” first used by Marsh and Rathbun (1990) and described in detail by Lanyon et al.(2006).

1057805,Spatial ecology and conservation of sea turtles in coastal foraging habitat,2015,Takahiro Shimada,,,,,,Spatial ecology investigates mechanisms in nature by examining spatial patterns. Developing our knowledge of spatial ecology will improve our approaches to the conservation of threatened species. Our understanding of spatial ecology is limited for marine species such as sea turtles. due to the complexity and methodological challenges involved in the investigation at-sea behaviour. Most sea turtle species are conservation-dependent due to historical and current anthropogenic threats. but a lack of ecological knowledge in the marine environment may hinder or prevent appropriate actions being taken by conservation practitioners.  Important knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of spatial and temporal movement of sea turtles in coastal foraging habitats where anthropogenic threats are high. These turtles may be relocated from their home habitats due to injury (e.g. from fisheries and boat strikes). following disasters (e.g. oil spills or extreme weather events). or following habitat loss (e.g. port expansion and dredging); thus. it is critical to understand the degree of fidelity and homing ability of turtles that have been displaced. For instance. if displaced turtles return to an oil spill area too soon after displacement. alternative conservation actions might be required. Additionally. if a turtle returns to its home habitat after displacement. as past studies have indicated. another question arises: how do the navigation mechanisms of sea turtles work? Current hypotheses theorise that sea turtles use geomagnetic cues for long-distance migration. but that they are likely to use non-geomagnetic cues during the last part of their migration.

Its capacity to deliver these outcomes is challenging. particularly for marginalized groups. This is especially true if the introduction of novel technologies is applied with incomplete understanding of socio-economic and bio-physical contexts. We examined what socio-economic factors affect people’s perceptions of adoption of lobster aquaculture in rural households in Indonesia. We used multiple linear regression with model averaging to test the influence of five capital assets (human. social. natural. physical. and financial). including agency. equity. and household sensitivity. on people’s perceived ability to adopt lobster aquaculture. Agency and sensitivity had the greatest influence on the dependent variable. We then used correlation analysis to develop a heuristic model of potential indirect causal mechanisms affecting people’s perceptions of adoption. Our results point to the existence of a ‘sensitivity trap’. where more sensitive or marginalized households are less likely to engage in new economic opportunities. We emphasize the value of multifaceted programs for improving livelihoods. particularly for poorer. more vulnerable households as one way to support the UN’s commitment to using aquaculture as a pathway to achieving sustainable development.

The activities have included detailed prelaunch sensor calibration and characterization experiments. in situ measurement protocol definition and development. calibration round-robins. advanced instrument technology development. and advanced atmospheric correction algorithm development.

However many spectrophotometric instruments equipped with 10cm cells are not sensitive enough to measure light attenuation from CDOM in open ocean or case 1 waters. One solution is to significantly increase the optical path length. which gives the photons of light a greater probability of being absorbed before reaching the detector. Liquid waveguide capillary cells (LWCC). integrating cavity absorption meters (ICAM). and Wetlabs absorption attenuation meters have all become prominent instruments in the community for making long path length measurements. However limitations arise due to the loss of light from scattering. spectral offsets caused by temp and salinity offsets. and cell contamination with subsequent microbubble formation. An extensive round robin comparison was carried out with versions of all these instruments at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in the fall of 2013. It was part of an ongoing CDOM workshop with an international committee.

If such shelters are eliminated by anthropogenic activities. such as rock removal for landscaping. the only way to restore these nonrenewable habitats may be to replace them with artificial rocks. To construct artificial rock habitats. we need to understand which rock attributes are important for faunal use and develop methods to mimic these important natural retreat site characteristics.

Another obvious. but harder to measure. factor that may affect retreat site selection is the size and structure of the three-dimensional crevice beneath the rock. We developed a novel technique to quantify crevice structure beneath rocks and compared crevices used by snakes and lizards with unused crevices. Multiple attributes of crevice structure such as the height of the crevice above the substrate. the area of the crevice suitable for fitting the entire body of the animal. the degree of closure of the crevice and the amount of fragmentation within the crevice affected the suitability of a crevice as a retreat site.

Distinguishing between habitat selection at these two spatial scales is complicated by co-variation among microhabitat factors (i.e.. the attributes of individual retreat sites often correlate with their proximity to landscape features). Disentangling this co-variation may facilitate the restoration or conservation of threatened systems. To experimentally examine the role of landscape attributes in determining retreat-site quality for saxicolous ectotherms. we deployed 198 identical artificial rocks in open (sun-exposed) sites on sandstone outcrops in southeastern Australia. and recorded faunal usage of those retreat sites over the next 29 months. Several landscape-scale attributes were associated with occupancy of experimental rocks. but different features were important for different species. For example. endangered broad-headed snakes (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) preferred retreat sites close to cliff edges. flat rock spiders (Hemicloea major) preferred small outcrops. and velvet geckos (Oedura lesueurii) preferred rocks close to the cliff edge with higher-than-average sun exposure.

For many endangered species. information on habitat use either is sparse. or is based upon studies from a small part of the species’ range. The broad-headed snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) is restricted to a specialized habitat (sandstone outcrops and nearby forests) within a small geographic range in south-eastern Australia. Previous research on this endangered taxon was done at a single site in the extreme south of the species’ geographic range. We captured and radio-tracked 9 adult broad-headed snakes at sites in the northern part of the species’ distribution. to evaluate the generality of results from prior studies. and to identify critical habitat components for this northern population. Snakes spent most of winter beneath sun-warmed rocks then shifted to tree hollows in summer. Thermal regimes within retreat-sites support the hypothesis that this shift is thermally driven. Intervals between successive displacements were longer than in the southern snakes but dispersal distances per move and home ranges were similar. Our snakes showed non-random preferences both in terms of macrohabitat (e.g.. avoidance of some vegetation types) and microhabitat (e.g.. frequent use of hollow-bearing trees).

Inc.,Doubled haploid (DH) lines have become widely used in maize (Zea mays L.) breeding. Haploid genome doubling is an important step in developing DH lines. The low rate of spontaneous genome doubling. which causes low haploid male fertility (HMF). seriously limits the largescale application of DH breeding without colchicine treatment. Our objective was to gain new insights into the genetics controlling HMF to improve the rate of HMF in DH breeding procedures. Haploid populations of 20 inbreds and their 31 single crosses derived from Chinese elite maize germplasm were screened for four traits related to HMF: anther emergence rate. pollen production rate. anther emergence score. and pollen production score.

In previous studies. almost all maize LW-related mutants have extreme effect on leaf development or accompanied unfavorable phenotypes. In addition. the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) has been resolution-limited. with cloning and fine-mapping rarely performed. Here. we constructed a bin map for 670 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) using ~1.2 billion 100-bp re-sequencing reads. QTL analysis of the LW trait directly narrowed the major effect QTL. qLW4. to a ~270-kb interval. A fine-mapping population and near-isogenic lines (NILs) were quickly constructed using a key RIL harboring heterozygous genotypes across the qLW4 region. A recombinant-derived progeny testing strategy was subsequently used to further narrow down qLW4 to a 55-kb interval. Examination of NILs revealed that qLW4 has a completely dominant effect on LW. with no additional effect on leaf length. Candidate gene analysis suggested that this locus may be a novel LW controlling allele in maize. Our findings demonstrate the advantage of large-population high-density bin mapping. and suggest a strategy for efficiently fine-mapping or even cloning of QTLs.

For these experiments. maize plants underwent dual pollination. first by the inducers and then by self-pollination at different time intervals. We found that PCA strongly influenced heterofertilization. as measured by the resulting ratio of hybrid kernels to selfed kernels. When log10 (hybrid kernel/selfed kernel) was close to 0. i.e.. when pollen from the different parents arrived at the embryo sac nearly simultaneously. the heterofertilization rate (HFR) was high. Haploid inducers with a high HIR. such as CAU5 and CAUB73. led to not only more haploids and embryo aborted kernels but also more heterofertilized kernels. as compared with a non-inducer or with a haploid inducer with a low HIR.

1057852,Patterns of nocturnal movement of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum (Philippi) in Gran Canaria (the Canary Islands. central East Atlantic Ocean),2004,F Tuya and JA Martin and A Luque,58,Helgoland Marine Research,1,26-31,BioMed Central,We tagged individuals of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum (Philippi) around the island of Gran Canaria (The Canary Islands) during winter 2001–2002 using a new technique. consisting of the insertion of a hook fastened to a fishing line into the aboral pole (periproctal membrane). This allowed individual identification of tagged sea urchins. The goals were: (1) to quantify nocturnal movements and the homing behaviour of this echinoid on shallow rocky bottoms. and (2) to assess short term spatial and temporal variability of these movements. Tagged sea urchins displayed clear homing behaviour. The mean distance travelled at night was 3.7±1.2 m (range 1.0–5.1 m). Mean speed of nocturnal movement was 33±26 cm h−1 (range 5–110 cm h−1). We observed greater movement at midnight than at the beginning and the end of the night.,True,2A_thTgAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,65,https://hmr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s10152-003-0164-0,16160875641782707647,/scholar?cites=16160875641782707647,,https://hmr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s10152-003-0164-0,0,0,0

Dyctiota dychotoma. Cystoseira abies-marina. Lobophora variegata and Halopteris filicina) have been studied using caging field experiments on Gran Canaria Island during August to October 2000. Results of three assays of both single and multiple diet experiments rejected the null hypothesis that Diadema does not feed selectively on the five selected algal species. In the multiple diet assays. Diadema consumed an average of 68–98 mg algae urchin−1 h−1 and 4–120 mg algae urchin−1 h−1 in the single diet experiments. On the basis of consumption. the five species of algae eaten can be divided into three groups. Thus Halopteris. Lobophora and Dyctiota were considered preferred algae. while Padina was considered an intermediate alga.

GABA A receptors are heteropentameric GABA-gated chloride channels and responsible for fast inhibitory neurotransmission. GABA B receptors are heterodimeric G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) that mediate slow and prolonged inhibitory transmission. The extent of inhibitory neurotransmission is determined by a variety of factors. such as the degree of transmitter release and changes in receptor activity by posttranslational modifications (eg. phosphorylation). as well as by the number of receptors present in the plasma membrane available for signal transduction.

In this study. we identify and characterize two new posttranslational modifications of gephyrin. SUMOylation and acetylation. We demonstrate that crosstalk between SUMOylation. acetylation and phosphorylation pathways regulates gephyrin scaffolding.

Excitotoxicity is believed to be the main cause for ischemia-induced neuronal death. Although a role of glutamate receptors in this process has been firmly established. the contribution of metabotropic GABAB receptors. which control excitatory neurotransmission. is less clear. A prominent characteristic of ischemic insults is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated with the up-regulation of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). After inducing ER stress in cultured cortical neurons by sustained Ca2+ release from intracellular stores or by a brief episode of oxygen and glucose deprivation (in vitro model of cerebral ischemia). we observed an increased expression of CHOP accompanied by a strong reduction of cell surface GABAB receptors.

Here we report that the activity-dependent transcription factor Npas4 selectively regulates the structure and strength of MF-CA3 synapses by restricting the number of their functional synaptic contacts without affecting the other synaptic inputs onto CA3 pyramidal neurons. Using an activity-dependent reporter. we identified CA3 pyramidal cells that were activated by contextual learning and found that MF inputs on these cells were selectively strengthened. Deletion of Npas4 prevented both contextual memory formation and this learning-induced synaptic modification.

The strength of receptor signaling depends on the number of cell surface receptors. which is thought to be regulated by trafficking and degradation mechanisms. Although the mechanisms of GABAB receptor trafficking are studied to some extent. it is currently unclear whether receptor degradation actively controls the number of GABAB receptors available for signaling. Here we tested the hypothesis that proteasomal degradation contributes to the regulation of GABAB receptor expression levels. Blocking proteasomal activity in cultured cortical neurons considerably enhanced total and cell surface expression of GABAB receptors. indicating the constitutive degradation of the receptors by proteasomes.

We previously showed that proteasomal degradation of GABAB receptors via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery determines the number of cell surface GABAB receptors and thereby GABAB receptor-mediated neuronal inhibition.

The metabotropic GABAB receptor is an important component of the inhibitory system and is highly expressed in primary nociceptors and intrinsic dorsal horn neurons to control their excitability. Activation of GABAB receptors with the orthosteric agonist baclofen effectively reliefs neuropathic pain but is associated with severe side effects that prevent its widespread application. The recently developed positive allosteric GABAB receptor modulators lack most of these side effects and are therefore promising drugs for the treatment of pain.

They control the excitability of neurons via activation of different downstream effector systems in pre- and postsynaptic neurons and as such regulate all major brain functions including synaptic plasticity. neuronal network activity. and neuronal development. Accordingly. GABAB receptors have been implicated in a variety of neurological disorders and thus are regarded as promising drug targets. A key factor determining the extent of GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition is the level of receptors at the cell surface available for signaling. There is increasing evidence that cell surface expression of functional GABAB receptors is affected in neurological diseases.

Here we use a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM) to test both the structure and the dynamics of relationships of three groups of wild vervet monkeys. We found that triadic closure (i.e. the friend of a friend is a friend) was significant in all three groups while degree popularity (i.e. the willingness to associate with individuals with high degree of connections) was significant in only two groups (AK.

The results show significant differences with respect to the position (i.e. centric. peripheral) and role (i.e. implication in the network cohesiveness) of an individual within a social network and hence interactional patterns. Females are more central. more active. and have a denser ego network in the affiliative social network tan males; thus. they contribute in a greater way to the cohesive structure of the network. High-ranking individuals are likely to receive fewer agonistic behaviors than low-ranking individuals. and high-ranking females receive more allogrooming.

Rocamadour,2014,Sebastian Sosa,85,Folia primatologica,3,154-163,Karger Publishers,For a decade. technological or natural networks have appeared to have a common mathematical architecture. This type of architecture has a node connectivity which follows a power law distribution. This architecture confers to these networks a resistance property to the loss of nodes. Such properties are advantageous for evolutional networks through time. Thus. this architecture can be expected in animal social networks.

Acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing and signalling have been associated with virulence and biofilm formation in numerous bacterial pathogens. In the canonical acyl-homoserine lactone signalling paradigm. AHLs are detected by a response regulator. B. pseudomallei encodes three AHL synthases. encoded by bpsI1. bpsI2 and bpsI3. and five regulator genes. In this study. we mutated the B. pseudomallei AHL synthases individually and in double and triple combination. Five AHLs were detected and quantified by tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The major AHLs produced were N-octanoylhomoserine lactone and N-(3-hydroxy-decanoyl)homoserine lactone. the expression of which depended on bpsI1 and bpsI2. respectively. B. pseudomallei infection of macrophage cells causes cell fusion. leading to multinucleated cells (3 or more nuclei per cell). A triple mutant defective in production of all three AHL synthases was associated with a striking phenotype of massively enhanced host cellular fusion in macrophages. However. neither abrogation of host cell fusion. achieved by mutation of bimA or hcp1. nor enhancement of fusion altered intracellular replication of B. pseudomallei. Furthermore. when tested in murine models of acute melioidosis the AHL synthase mutants were not attenuated for virulence.

Epinephelus marginatus is a long-lived. sedentary. reef-associated protogynous hermaphrodite with high commercial and recreational value that is at risk of extinction throughout its global distribution. Based on global trends. population substructuring and gaps in local knowledge this has led to an increased interest in evaluation of local stock. Assessment of Maltese demography was based on historical and contemporary catch landings data whilst genetic population structure and regional connectivity patterns were evaluated by examining 175 individuals collected within the central Mediterranean region between 2002 and 2009 using 14 nuclear microsatellite loci. Demographic stock assessment of Maltese E. marginatus’ revealed a 99% decline in catch landings between 1947 and 2009 within the Fisheries Management Zone. A contemporary modest mean size was observed. 3 ± 3 kg. where approximately 17% of the population was juvenile. 68% female/sex-changing and 15% were male with a male-to-female sex ratio of 1:5.

Recent research points to the importance of considering the distribution of body sizes of species when exploring the response of communities to such perturbations. Here. we present a new size‐based approach for assessing the sensitivity and elasticity of community structure (species equilibrium abundances) and resilience (rate of return to equilibrium) to changes in the intrinsic growth rate of species and in the strengths of species interactions. We apply this approach on two natural systems. the pelagic communities of the Baltic Sea and Lake Vättern. to illustrate how it can be used to identify potential keystone species and keystone links.

1058083,Community robustness analysis: theoretical approaches to identifying keystone structures in ecological communities,2013,Sofia Berg,,,,,,Most of the world’s ecosystems suffer from stress caused by human activities such as habitat destruction. fragmentation. overexploitation of species and climate change. These factors affect the reproduction and/or survival of individual species as well as interactions between species in ecological communities. Forthcoming effects of this are altered abundances. direct species loss. and indirect cascading extinctions. with yet largely unknown consequences on community structure and functioning. Today. biodiversity loss is of global concern since human society and welfare depend upon resources and services provided by ecosystems. The importance of considering entire ecological communities as a target for conservation and management has been increasingly recognized due to the interdependencies of species. Our ability to make predictions of the response of ecological communities to stress and biodiversity loss is in need of a deeper understanding of how structure and dynamical processes contributes to the functioning and stability of a community. In this thesis I use mathematical theory and dynamical models to study the response of community structure and resilience to a variety of disturbances affecting species and species interactions. ranging from small perturbations (Papers I-II) to large perturbations (species extinctions.

Or put another way: are some species more important than others in upholding the structure and functioning of ecological systems? Despite the urgency of this question. our understanding of the contribution of different species to community structure and functioning is incomplete and contradictory. For example. some models describing patterns in ecosystems suggest that all species are “equivalent”(ie. differences are neutral with respect to community properties. eg. MacArthur and Wilson. 1967; Hubbell. 2001). while others suggest that some nodes are disproportionately important for maintaining community structure and functioning (Saavedra et al.. 2011) and can be considered keystone species (Paine. 1966. 1969; Cottee-Jones and Whittaker. 2012).

PAI-1 plays a pivotal role in many physiologic processes. including fibrinolysis and cell migration. and has been implicated in many pathophysiological conditions including thrombosis and cancer. The association of PAI-1 with these syndromes has made it an attractive target for drug development. However. the structural mechanism of the PAI-1 inhibitors is largely unknown. We have previously determined the crystal structure of PAI-1 in complex with catalytic site inactivated uPA (S195A mutant)(1). Recently. we identified a new class of PAI-1 inhibitor from a natural product compound library (2). Here. we determined the crystal structure of PAI-1 in complex with one of the PAI-1 inhibitor. Embelin. at 2.7?. The crystal structure of PAI-1 in complex of Embelin showed that Embelin binds near the beta strand 2A of PAI-1. and suggest that Embelin may act by preventing the insertion-sheet A and the subsequent covalent complex formation. In addition. we also determined the crystal structure of PAI-1: uPA (S195A) Michaelis complex at 2.3? resolution. The structure reveals extensive interactions between the PAI-1 reactive center loop (RCL) and the uPA catalytic site. and demonstrates that the 37-loop and 147-loop of uPA are important for the initial Michaelis complex formation. These structural studies lays down a foundation to understand the specificity of PAI-1 for uPA and tPA. and to design new class of PAI-1 inhibitors.,True,JFtxHJcAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://cpfd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CPFDTOTAL-ZGWI201303001015.htm,,,,,0,0,0

However. whether longevity mechanisms counteract the effects of aging continually throughout life. or whether they act during specific periods of life. preventing changes that precede mortality is unclear. Here. we uncover transcriptional drift. a phenomenon that describes how aging causes genes within functional groups to change expression in opposing directions. These changes cause a transcriptome-wide loss in mRNA stoichiometry and loss of co-expression patterns in aging animals. as compared to young adults. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model. we show that extending lifespan by inhibiting serotonergic signals by the antidepressant mianserin attenuates transcriptional drift. allowing the preservation of a younger transcriptome into an older age. Our data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of serotonergic signals slows age-dependent physiological decline and the associated rise in mortality levels exclusively in young adults. thereby postponing the onset of major mortality.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08833.001,True,gBv8rFEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,65,https://elifesciences.org/articles/08833,14515728271656539855,/scholar?cites=14515728271656539855,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/08833.pdf,0,0,0

Sequencing reads that pass through the junction of the two joined ends of a 3–5-kb DNA fragment are not easy to identify and pose problems during mapping and de novo assembly. Longer read lengths increase the possibility that a read will cross the junction. To solve this problem. we developed a mate-paired protocol for use with Illumina sequencing technology that uses Cre-Lox recombination instead of blunt end circularization. In this method. a LoxP sequence is incorporated at the junction site. This sequence allows screening reads for junctions without using a reference genome. Junction reads can be trimmed or split at the junction. Moreover. the location of the LoxP sequence in the reads distinguishes mate-paired reads from spurious paired-end reads.

Because the proton concentration is minuscule. exquisite selectivity for protons over other ions is critical to H V 1 function.

After salt treatment. compared with the controls. the number of DEGs in XJ (19373) was about four times of that in ZM (4833). We also detected specific differential gene expression patterns: In response to salt stress. compared with XJ. ZM maintained relatively more stable expression levels of genes related to the ROS and Ca2+ pathways. phytohormone biosynthesis. and Na+/K+ transport. Notably. several salt resistance-associated genes always showed greater levels of expression in ZM than in XJ. including a transcription factor. Consistent with the suppression of plant growth resulting from salt stress. the expression of numerous photosynthesis- and growth hormone-related genes decreased more dramatically in XJ than in ZM. By contrast. the expression levels of photosynthetic genes were lower in ZM under low-salt conditions. Compared with XJ.

Various insects attack maize plants causing large yield loss. Here. we investigated the responses of maize B73. a susceptible line. and Mo17. a resistant line. to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi on metabolite and transcriptome levels. R. padi feeding had no effect on the levels of the defensive metabolites benzoxazinoids (Bxs) in either line. and Mo17 contained substantially greater levels of Bxs than did B73. Profiling of the differentially expressed genes revealed that B73 and Mo17 responded to R. padi infestation specifically. and importantly. these two lines showed large gene expression differences even without R. padi herbivory. Correlation analysis identified four transcription factors (TFs) that might account for the high Bx levels in Mo17. Similarly. genome-wide alternative splicing (AS) analyses indicated that both B73 and Mo17 had temporally specific responses to R. padi infestation. and these two lines also exhibited large differences of AS regulation under normal condition. and 340 genes. including ten TFs. were constantly differentially spliced.

However. there is still uncertainty about whether or not they were capable of jumping like true anurans as their postcranial features have so far provided only equivocal evidence. Although previous work has concentrated on the anatomy of the hind limb. here we examine the anatomy of the forelimb. comparing stem and crown-group anurans to other amphibians. The forelimb and pectoral girdle of Triadobatrachus share several features with modern frogs. including a frog-like deltoid attachment of the scapula.

1058133,New Bohaiornis-like bird from the Early Cretaceous of China: enantiornithine interrelationships and flight performance,2019,Luis M Chiappe and Meng Qingjin and Francisco Serrano and Trond Sigurdsen and Wang Min and Alyssa Bell and Liu Di,7,PeerJ,,e7846,PeerJ Inc.,During the last decade. several Bohaiornis-like enantiornithine species—and numerous specimens—have been recognized from the celebrated Jehol Biota of northwestern China. In this paper. we describe the anatomy of another “bohaiornithid” species from the 125 million-year-old Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province. China. The new taxon differs from previously recognized “bohaiornithids” on a number of characters from the forelimb and shoulder girdle. We also provide a new phylogenetic framework for enantiornithine birds. which questions the monophyly of the previously recognized bohaiornithid clade and highlights ongoing challenges for resolving enantiornithine interrelationships. Additionally. we offer the first assessment of the flight properties of Bohaiornis-like enantiornithines. Our results indicate that while “bohaiornithids” were morphologically suited for flying through continuous flapping. they would have been unable to sustain prolonged flights. Such findings expand the flight strategies previously known for enantiornithines and other early birds.,True,S9qg9W8AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,10,https://peerj.com/articles/7846/fig-7,1076441704747497733,/scholar?cites=1076441704747497733,,https://peerj.com/articles/7846/fig-7,0,0,0

However. morphological specializations indicative of specific ecological roles are not well known for this clade. Here we report on an exquisitely well-preserved specimen from the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group of northeastern China. which pedal morphology is suggestive of a unique ecological specialization within Enantiornithes. The morphology of the new specimen is largely indistinguishable from that of the holotype of the bohaiornithid enantiornithine Zhouornis hani. albeit the latter is somewhat larger. The new specimen provides important and previously unknown details of the skull of Zhouornis hani. which add to the limited knowledge about the cranial anatomy and evolution of enantiornithines. The information offered by the new specimen also augments our understanding of the postcranial morphology of bohaiornithid enantiornithines. a clade that has been only recently recognized. With the description of this specimen. Zhouornis hani becomes one of the most anatomically complete known enantiornithine species. which will facilitate future morphological studies.,True,S9qg9W8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,10,https://peerj.com/articles/407/fig-8,11059430760400137837,/scholar?cites=11059430760400137837,,https://peerj.com/articles/407/fig-8,0,0,0

In this thesis. a study of the skeletal anatomy of Doleserpeton is presented. and the interrelationships of dissorophoids are discussed. The relationships of modern amphibians and Paleozoic tetrapods are studied using phylogenetic analyses based on both Bayesian inference and parsimony. The skull of Doleserpeton is preserved in such detail that it allows the first description of the inner ear of an amphibamid temnospondyl. It is found to house a posteriorly positioned perilymphatic duct. a feature which is today restricted to amphibians. Evidence for the presence of a frog-like tympanic annulus is also described. During the studies of the limb skeleton of Doleserpeton. it was realized that important features of the forelimb of modern salamanders were misinterpreted in previous anatomical descriptions.

1058136,Disparity and macroevolutionary transformation of the maniraptoran manus,2020,SERGIO M Nebreda and GUILLERMO Navalón and Iris Menendez and Trond Sigurdsen and Luis M Chiappe and JESÚS Marugán-Lobón,,Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist,,,,Multiple factors involved in the evolutionary transformation of the manus across the maniraptoran radiation. including its current morphology in modern birds. remain unexplored. Specifically. the morphological disparity of the manus has never been studied quantitatively. and there are no hypotheses about the possible mechanisms and constraints underlying its evolution. Morphological disparity is best studied with shape-analysis tools based on Procrustes methods. because they guarantee the independence of shape from size while depicting the results in expressive graphics. However. this methodology compares fixed configurations of coordinates. preventing their use in highly articulated and movable structures such as the maniraptoran manus. Here. we propose a new protocol. the one-dimensional Procrustes analysis (OPA). for transforming the chord lengths of these bones into unidimensional Cartesian coordinates. enabling treatment of the data under the operational advantages of the Procrustes methods. Our results applying this new method on a sample encompassing 174 maniraptoran dinosaurs manus. including 79 fossils (both avialan and nonavialan taxa) and 95 extant paleognathans and neognathans. document the morphological transition between early-diverging maniraptorans. nonavialan paravians. and birds over morphospace. highlighting an unexpectedly low disparity in the crown group when compared to early-diverging taxa. Within this transition. we show a common trend of proportional reduction and loss of distal elements. mostly in the minor and alular digits.

Here. we provide functional insights into how successive structural re-arrangements in ribosomal protein S3 promote maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. We show that S3 dimerizes and is imported into the nucleus with its N-domain in a rotated conformation and associated with the chaperone Yar1. Initial assembly of S3 with 40S precursors occurs via its C-domain. while the N-domain protrudes from the 40S surface. Yar1 is replaced by the assembly factor Ltv1. thereby fixing the S3 N-domain in the rotated orientation and preventing its 40S association. Finally.

Therefore the fast production of ribosomal proteins. their efficient delivery to the nucleus and correct incorporation into ribosomal subunits are prerequisites for optimal growth rates. Here. we report that the ankyrin repeat protein Yar1 directly interacts with the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps3 and accompanies newly synthesized Rps3 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where Rps3 is assembled into pre-ribosomal subunits. A yar1 deletion strain displays a similar phenotype as an rps3 mutant strain. showing an accumulation of 20S pre-rRNA and a 40S export defect. The combination of an rps3 mutation with a yar1 deletion leads to an enhancement of these phenotypes. while increased expression of RPS3 suppresses the defects of a yar1 deletion strain.

1058151,New twist to nuclear import: when two travel together,2013,Gert Bange and Guillaume Murat and Irmgard Sinning and Ed Hurt and Dieter Kressler,6,,4,e24792,Taylor & Francis,Ribosomes are the nanomachines that synthesize all cellular proteins from mRNA templates. In eukaryotes. ribosomes. which are composed of ribosomal proteins and rRNA. are mainly assembled in the nucleus. Thus. ribosomal proteins require a nuclear transport step from their place of synthesis in the cytoplasm to their site of assembly in the nucleus. Recognition of import substrates is mediated by different types of nuclear localization signals. which are either directly recognized by import receptors or recruited to these via adaptor proteins. The novel transport adaptor Syo1 (Symportin). which is dedicated to the synchronous import of two functionally related ribosomal proteins. has recently been described. In this review. we highlight and discuss these findings in the context of our current knowledge of ribosome assembly and nucleocytoplasmic transport.

1058152,Mak5 and Ebp2 act together on early pre-60S particles and their reduced functionality bypasses the requirement for the essential pre-60S factor Nsa1,2013,Dagmar Pratte and Ujjwala Singh and Guillaume Murat and Dieter Kressler,8,PLoS One,12,e82741,Public Library of Science,Ribosomes are the molecular machines that translate mRNAs into proteins. The synthesis of ribosomes is therefore a fundamental cellular process and consists in the ordered assembly of 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) into a small 40S and a large 60S ribosomal subunit that form the translating 80S ribosomes. Most of our knowledge concerning this dynamic multi-step process comes from studies with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. which have shown that assembly and maturation of pre-ribosomal particles. as they travel from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. relies on a multitude (>200) of biogenesis factors. Amongst these are many energy-consuming enzymes. including 19 ATP-dependent RNA helicases and three AAA-ATPases. We have previously shown that the AAA-ATPase Rix7 promotes the release of the essential biogenesis factor Nsa1 from late nucleolar pre-60S particles. Here we show that mutant alleles of genes encoding the DEAD-box RNA helicase Mak5. the C/D-box snoRNP component Nop1 and the rRNA-binding protein Nop4 bypass the requirement for Nsa1. Interestingly. dominant-negative alleles of RIX7 retain their phenotype in the absence of Nsa1. suggesting that Rix7 may have additional nuclear substrates besides Nsa1. Mak5 is associated with the Nsa1 pre-60S particle and synthetic lethal screens with mak5 alleles identified the r-protein Rpl14 and the 60S biogenesis factors Ebp2.

Due to their physicochemical properties. they need protection from aggregation on this path. Newly synthesized ribosomal protein Rps3 forms a dimer that is associated with one molecule of its specific chaperone Yar1. Here we report that redundant pathways contribute to the nuclear import of Rps3. with the classical importin α/β pathway (Kap60/Kap95 in yeast) constituting a main import route. The Kap60/Kap95 heterodimer mediates efficient nuclear import of Rps3 by recognition of an N-terminal monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). This Rps3-NLS is located directly adjacent to the Yar1-binding site and. upon binding of Kap60 to Rps3. Yar1 is displaced from the ribosomal protein in vitro.

Using functional analyses and cryo-EM. we show that ribosomal protein Rps20 orchestrates communication between two multi-step maturation events across the pre-40S subunit. Our study reveals that during pre-40S maturation. formation of essential contacts between Rps20 and Rps3 permits assembly factor Ltv1 to recruit the Hrr25 kinase. thereby promoting Ltv1 phosphorylation. In parallel. a deeply buried Rps20 loop reaches to the opposite pre-40S side. where it stimulates Rio2 ATPase activity. Both cascades converge to the final maturation steps releasing Rio2 and phosphorylated Ltv1.

We show that deletion of this extension partially impairs cell growth and 40S subunit biogenesis and confers hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Moreover. the extension harbours a nuclear localization signal that promotes active nuclear import of S31. which associates with pre-ribosomal particles in the nucleus.

The molecular mechanism underlying this numerical control. however. remains enigmatic. Using the model species Shewanella putrefaciens. we show that FlhG links assembly of the flagellar C ring with the action of the master transcriptional regulator FlrA (named FleQ in other species). While FlrA and the flagellar C-ring protein FliM have an overlapping binding site on FlhG. their binding depends on the ATP-dependent dimerization state of FlhG.

DNA-binding sites have been uncovered for many transcription factors through a number of experimental approaches. but it has proven difficult to use this binding site information to reliably predict transcription factor target genes in genomic sequence space. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and other related nematode species as a starting point. we describe here a bioinformatic pipeline that identifies potential transcription factor target genes from genomic sequences. Among the key features of this pipeline is the use of sequence conservation of transcription-factor-binding sites in related species.

Thus. phytolith content should be reflected in dental wear. Because native phytoliths show lower indentation hardness than phytoliths extracted by dry ashing. we propose that the hydration state of plant tissue will also affect dental abrasion. To assess this. we performed a controlled feeding experiment with 36 adult guinea pigs. fed exclusively with three different natural forages: lucerne. timothy grass. and bamboo with distinct phytolith/silica contents (lucerne < grass < bamboo). Each forage was fed in fresh or dried state for 3 weeks. We then performed 3D surface texture analysis (3DST) on the upper fourth premolar.

There has been confusion about the definition of sexual segregation. since segregation can occur in at least three ways: spatially. socially and by habitat. Causes and consequences of sexual segregation have been topic of researches for more than 40 years now. but we still gain new insights into this field of animal biology. Studies on several ungulate species have shown that sexual segregation often leads to differential habitat use. which may result in remarkable differences in forage selection of the two sexes. This phenomenon has been referred to as “ecological segregation”. Conradt (2005) and Ruckstuhl (2007) argued that sexual differences in microhabitat use and thus differences in the dietary regimes should better be described as “sexual divergence”. In our study we will focus on this divergence. We use the swedish moose (Alces alces) as a test case for a dimorphic ungulate displaying spatial segregation. The moose is the largest member of the family Cervidae and inhabits northern forest across Eurasia (Scandinavia to Russia) and North America (Alaska to Nova Scotia).

To test this hypothesis. we fed guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus; n = 36 in six groups) for three weeks exclusively on dry or fresh forage of low (lucerne). moderate (fresh timothy grass) or very high (bamboo leaves) silica content representing corresponding levels of phytoliths.

1058199,Structural morphology of molars in large mammalian herbivores: enamel content varies between tooth positions,2015,Daniela E Winkler and Thomas M Kaiser,10,PloS one,8,e0135716,Public Library of Science,The distribution of dental tissues in mammalian herbivores can be very different from taxon to taxon. While grazers tend to have more elaborated and complexly folded enamel ridges. browsers have less complex enamel ridges which can even be so far reduced that they are completely lost. The gradient in relative enamel content and complexity of structures has so far not been addressed within a single species. However. several studies have noted tooth position specific wear rates in small mammals (rabbits. guinea pigs) which may be related to individual tooth morphology. We investigate whether differentiated enamel content by tooth position is also to be found in large herbivores. We use CT-scanning techniques to quantify relative enamel content in upper and lower molar teeth of 21 large herbivorous mammal species. By using a broad approach and including both perissodactyls and artiodactyls. we address phylogenetic intraspecific differences in relative enamel content. We find that enamel is highly unevenly distributed among molars (upper M1. M2. M3 and lower m1. m2. m3) in most taxa and that relative enamel content is independent of phylogeny. Overall. relative enamel content increases along the molar tooth row and is significantly higher in lower molars compared to upper molars. We relate this differential enamel content to prolonged mineralisation in the posterior tooth positions and suggest a compensatory function of m3 and M3 for functional losses of anterior teeth.,True,CIsF6JUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135716,15748771911017715495,/scholar?cites=15748771911017715495,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135716,0,0,0

The ability of light field microscopy to simultaneously capture image data from a volume of interest. such as a functioning brain or a beating heart. is compromised by inadequate contrast and effective resolution. due. in large part. to light scattering by the tissue. Surprisingly. a major contribution to the image degradation is the signal scattered into the volume of interest by the typical wide-field illumination that excites the sample region outside the volume of interest. Here. we minimize this degradation by employing selective volume illumination. using a modified light sheet approach to illuminate preferentially the volume of interest. This minimizes the unavoidable background generated when extraneous regions of the sample are illuminated. dramatically enhancing the contrast and effective resolution of the captured and reconstructed images. Light Field Selective Volume Illumination Microscopy (LF-SVIM.

Previous studies have shown that the mRNA expressions of numerous genes are regulated by nitrogen supplies; however. little is known about the expressed non-coding elements. for example long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that control the response of maize (Zea mays L.) to nitrogen. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs larger than 200 bp. which have emerged as key regulators in gene expression. In this study. we surveyed the intergenic/intronic lncRNAs in maize B73 leaves at the V7 stage under conditions of N-deficiency and N-sufficiency using ribosomal RNA depletion and ultra-deep total RNA sequencing approaches. By integration with mRNA expression profiles and physiological evaluations. 7245 lncRNAs and 637 nitrogen-responsive lncRNAs were identified that exhibited unique expression patterns. Co-expression network analysis showed that the nitrogen-responsive lncRNAs were enriched mainly in one of the three co-expressed modules. The genes in the enriched module are mainly involved in NADH dehydrogenase activity. oxidative phosphorylation and the nitrogen compounds metabolic process. We identified a large number of lncRNAs in maize and illustrated their potential regulatory roles in response to N stress.

However. as an understudied crop. improvement of crambe has been hampered by the lack of genetic and genomic information to enhance its yield. oil quality and resistance against biotic and abiotic stress. Development of molecular markers is therefore of great significance to facilitate genetic improvement of crambe. In this study. high-throughput sequencing was performed to generate sequences for the transcriptome and genome of a widely planted crambe cultivar. Galactica. A total of 186.778 expressed sequence tag (EST) contigs as 8.130.350 genomic contigs were assembled as well.

The omega-6 fatty acid desaturase enzyme (FAD2) is known to be involved in PUFA biosynthesis. In crambe. three CaFAD2 genes. CaFAD2-C1. CaFAD2-C2 and CaFAD2-C3 are expressed. The individual effect of each CaFAD2 gene on oil composition was investigated through studying transgenic lines (CaFAD2-RNAi) for differential expression levels in relation to the composition of seed-oil. Six first generation transgenic plants (T1) showed C18:1 increase (by 6% to 10.5%) and PUFA reduction (by 8.6% to 10.2%). The silencing effect in these T1-plants ranged from the moderate silencing (40% to 50% reduction) of all three CaFAD2 genes to strong silencing (95% reduction) of CaFAD2-C3 alone. The progeny of two T1-plants (WG4-4 and WG19-6) was further analysed. Four or five transgene insertions are characterized in the progeny (T2) of WG19-6 in contrast to a single insertion in the T2 progeny of WG4-4. For the individual T2-plants of both families (WG19-6 and WG4-4). seed-specific silencing of CaFAD2-C1 and CaFAD2-C2 was observed in several individual T2-plants but. on average in both families. the level of silencing of these genes was not significant. A significant reduction in expression level (P < 0.01) in both families was only observed for CaFAD2-C3 together with significantly different C18:1 and PUFA levels in oil.

Materials and methods: Classical biochemical methods were used to determine plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). nitric oxide (NO). glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). catalase (CAT). superoxide dismutase (SOD). and glutathione (GSH) levels. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine plasma insulin levels and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of brain antioxidant enzymes (SOD. CAT. and GSH-Px). Results: It was found that the diabetes-related increase in blood glucose levels was reduced by supplementation of lycopene over an 8-week period. Plasma NO levels and brain tissue GSH levels were meaningfully reduced in the treatment group compared to the diabetic group. In the hemolysate samples. it was determined that the treatment group's SOD. CAT. and GSH-Px activities significantly increased compared to the diabetic group. In the brain tissue homogenates. CAT and SOD activity did not show a significant change. whereas GSH-Px activity was increased in the treatment group compared to the diabetic group. SOD. CAT. and GSH-Px mRNA transcription levels were suppressed in the diabetic group compared to the control. and this suppression was stopped and increases were significantly induced by the supplementation of lycopene.

Hyssopus officinalis. Hypericum perforatum. Mentha piperita. and Mentha smithiana. and (ii) to determine the effectiveness of these essentials oils tested against 7 common food-related bacteria and fungus at four different dosages (5. 10. 15 and 20µL/disc. respectively). Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis indicates that the EOs obtained from these Romanian medicinal plants have a great variability in their chemical composition. The study reports for the first time the antibacterial activity of the M. smithiana EO. All the essential oils screened showed antimicrobial activity. the most active being M. smithiana and M. piperita. in contrast to A. millefolium and C. officinalis. Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited a low degree of sensitivity. while Candida albicans was the most susceptible to the action of EOs.

The determination of the rheological characteristics of the dough is obtained by alveographic method. The addition of proteolytic enzymes allows adjustment of the rheological characteristics of dough according to the needs of the technological process. The specific effect of proteases on the physical properties of gluten shows that by proteolysis there is a break and a reorientation of protein chains that form the gluten network.

1058300,On the influence of bed forms on flood levels.,2013,Biswa Bhattacharya and Md Shamim Shams and Ioana Popescu,12,Environmental Engineering & Management Journal (EEMJ),5,,,Flood inundation modelling and flood risk mapping are primary cornerstones of flood risk assessment and management. Modelling activities generally assume that the morphology of the conveyance does not change. which certainly is not true for alluvial rivers. River bed elevations can quickly change during flood events. Flood water can induce different bed-forms (ripples. dunes. plain bed. etc.). which affects the flow resistance and as a result the flood water level. As a result integrating the river bed dynamics in flood risk management has the benefit of providing more realistic representation of flood levels. The paper presents an analysis of a measured dataset of River Rhine in the Netherlands to show the variation of dune heights during a flood in 2004. In another case study a hydraulic model. capable of simulating the changes in bed forms and the corresponding friction. has been developed for the Nzoia River in Kenya. This case study as well shows the development of dunes with flood and the corresponding effects on roughness and flood water level. Both case studies substantiate the importance of incorporating the changes in bed resistance due to the formation of bed forms in flood inundation modelling.,True,WLel4YoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Md_Shams2/publication/288799734_On_the_influence_of_bed_forms_on_flood_levels/links/5c54cfb792851c22a3a25c9c/On-the-influence-of-bed-forms-on-flood-levels.pdf,4033253758818765216,/scholar?cites=4033253758818765216,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Md_Shams2/publication/288799734_On_the_influence_of_bed_forms_on_flood_levels/links/5c54cfb792851c22a3a25c9c/On-the-influence-of-bed-forms-on-flood-levels.pdf,0,0,0

RNA-sequencing of whole eyes was done to study early gene expression changes in Abca4−/− Rdh8−/− mice.Methods: Abca4−/− Rdh8−/− mice at 4 weeks of age were exposed to intense light. Total RNA was extracted from whole eyes and used to generate RNA libraries that were paired-end sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 device. Differentially expressed genes were annotated using Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Selected genes in enriched pathways exhibiting differential expression were validated using quantitative qRT-PCR and ELISA.Results: Transcriptome analysis of the whole eye identified 200 genes that were differentially expressed 24 hours after light exposure compared to no light in Abca4−/− Rdh8−/− mice.

Pichia guilliermondii and Candida ethanolica against bacterial wilt disease of tomato,2011,Mai Thanh Nguyen and Senaratne L Ranamukhaarachchi and David B Hannaway,3,Journal of Phytology,2,,,Bacterial wilt disease (BWD) caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is a serious and widespread disease in tomato. The persistence and its wide host range often restrict the effectiveness of cultural and chemical control measures. Four antagonists: Bacillus megaterium. Enterobacter cloacae. Pichia guillermondii and Candida ethanolica were tested and found significantly antagonistic to R. solanacearum in in vivo conditions with unsterilized soils and hence possess potential to control BWD in tomato. Enterobacter cloacae. Pichia guillermondii and Candida ethanolica also increased growth and fruit yield compared to the control. Disease severity varied with antagonist and time of application; compared with the control. disease severity was reduced 41.6-77.1% when antagonists were applied one week prior to transplanting tomato seedlings.

Ranamukhaarachchi,23,Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences,3,223-230,Asian Network for Scientific Information,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oyster mushroom Pleurotus is one of the most aromatic edible mushrooms. This study evaluated a few selected determinants for promoting mycelial growth and spawn production of P. eryngii and P. ostreatus such as culture media. grain sources and alternate substrates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven different substrate formulations were evaluated. viz: TS1 (100% wheat straw-S). TS2 (100% cardboard-C). TS3 (100% spent coffee ground-SCG). TS4 (50% S+ 50% C). TS5 (50% S+ 50% SCG). TS6 (80% S+ 20% C) and TS7 (80% S+ 20% SCG). The efficiency of different culture media potato dextrose agar (PDA). yeast malt agar (YMA) and malt extract agar (MEA) and selected grains (wheat. rye. barley and oat) was investigated. Each study was arranged in the complete randomized design with 4 replicates. RESULTS: PDA media was the most suitable for mycelial growth of P. eryngii while P. ostreatus had a better mycelial growth on YMA and MEA media. Barley and rye grains were the most favourable for the mycelium growth of P. eryngii while oat grains were the best source that enhanced both of mycelial extension and density levels of P. ostreatus. The supplement of wheat straw (S) with SCG substrate improved mycelial extension while the substrate containing 50% S+ 50% C was the most favourable for both of mycelial growth and primordia formation in P. eryngii and P. ostreatus.

An effective tool to identify necessary nutrients for the production of fruiting bodies on the specialty substrates is mycelium growth. Hence. mycelium of king oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) were experimentally evaluated on cardboard and spent coffee ground (SCG) substrates for the mycelial growth rate. density and primordial formation. Studies were carried out using five different substrate formulations viz.. 100% cardboard (TS1). 100% SCG (TS2). 50% cardboard+ 50% SCG (TS3). 70% cardboard+ 30% SCG (TS4) and 30% cardboard+ 70% SCG (TS5). The efficiency of different yeast extract concentrations (ie 1. 5. 10. 20. 30 and 50 g/l) as a supplement in potato dextrose agar media (PDA) on P. eryngii growth was also determined. The concentration of 1 g/l of yeast extract showed the best effects on mycelial growth and primordia formation of P. eryngii. while high concentration of yeast extract (5-50 g/l) did not show any beneficial influence. Combination between cardboard and SCG. especially substrate formulations of 30% cardboard+ 70% SCG increased mycelial density and number of primordial formations of P. eryngii compared to the substrates of cardboard or SCG alone.

1058326,Positronium negative ions for monitoring work functions of surface plasma source,2017,V Dudnikov and A Dudnikov,1869,AIP Conference Proceedings,1,020007,AIP Publishing LLC,Cesiation is addition of a small admixture of cesium to a gas discharge to increase negative ion emission and decrease electron emission. Cesiation decreases the surface work function and increases the probability of back scattered and sputtered particles escaping as negative ions. It is difficult to control the surface work function during the discharge. A positronim negative ion is a bound system consisting of a positron and two electrons that is created when a positronium atom escaping from metal captures an electron from the surface. As in the case of H- formation. the probability of formation of a positronium negative ion strongly depends on the surface work function.

The muonium atom is made up of an antimuon and an electron and is given the chemical symbol Mu. A second electron with binding energy or electron affinity of 0.75 eV makes the Mu-ion. which is in many ways almost identical to the H-ion that is used for charge-exchange injection into most proton particle accelerators. Muonium negative ions were observed in 1987 [1. 2] by interaction of muons with a foil. Using the foil charge-exchange approach. the efficiency of transformation of muons to negative muonium ions has been very low~ 10-4. However. by using a hot tungsten or palladium single crystal foil treated by cesium deposition. the production efficiency can be improved up to 50%. The process described here has surface muons focused onto a tungsten or palladium single crystal foil (that can be heated up to 2000 Celsius) and partially covered by a cesium layer up to minimal work function.

In O. miniata and P. birandi all measured structures (body. tegmina. pronotum. and hind femur) were smallest at the highest altitude for both sexes. Hence. in these species. different structures covaried in the same direction. with increasing altitude. In contrast. there was no clear relationship between altitude and size in C. vagans. and different structures covaried in different directions in males and females (i.e.. some structures became larger at higher elevations. whereas others became smaller. and this differed with sex).

Tettigonioidea. Phaneropterinae). The taxonomy of the group has for a long time been controversial; once these species were transferred to Eupoecilimon and many new species have been described since the revision by Ramme (1933) or synonyms have been suggested/re-established. This study aims to test the classification of the group presently based on morphological characters by bioacoustic data. The following results were obtained or conclusions arrived. First. several qualitative morphological characters previously used in descriptions/diagnoses of the species are variable and overlap between species. Those are the elevation and widening of pronotum in metazona. the emargination of caudal margin of pronotal disc and the structure of male subgenital plate at caudal margin. Thus. still the male cercus. especially the orientation of denticles. is the most productive structure may allow more objective delimitation of species. As in qualitative morphology the general morphometry seems uninformative for the taxonomy of the group. Second. male calling song and partly the number of stridulatory pegs are more useful characters both for delimitation of species and describing their relationships. Especially. the pattern of the syllable. the number of impulses per syllable and the duration of early part of syllable in species group allow us a more objective delimitation of the species and definition of relationships.

Heidelberg,Functional identification of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) is one of the current focus areas of pharmaceutical research. Although thousands of GPCR sequences are known. many of them are orphan sequences (the activating ligand is unknown). Therefore. classification methods for automated characterization of orphan GPCRs are imperative. In this study. for predicting Level 1 subfamilies of GPCRs. a novel method for obtaining class specific features. based on the existence of activating ligand specific patterns. has been developed and utilized for a majority voting classification. Exploiting the fact that there is a non-promiscuous relationship between the specific binding of GPCRs into their ligands and their functional classification. our method classifies Level 1 subfamilies of GPCRs with a high predictive accuracy between 99% and 87% in a three-fold cross validation test.

Homozygous mutations in the GPR56 gene. which regulates migration of neural precursor cells. are associated with bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP) syndrome including white matter changes. brainstem and cerebellar involvement. Herein. we describe three siblings of consanguineous parents with a homozygous germline mutation (p. R271*) located in the seventh exon of the GPR56 gene that was previously detected in only one Portuguese patient. Phenotypic/genotypic relationships were analysed according to the clinical characteristics in only index patient. While earlier reported patient was exhibiting seizures provoked by hot water. macrocephaly. cerebellar/brainstem hypoplasia and corpus callosum abnormalities. the index patient showed only hypoplasia of brainstem. focal onset bilateral tonic clonic seizure. Despite the phenotypic similarities in two patients. the potential causes of the variation in the expression of the p. R271* variant between the two affected families might be genetic or epigenetic factors beyond the GPR56 gene. Consequently. the present findings show that the same mutation in GPR56 gene can have different phenotypic effects. Therefore. additional functional studies are needed to detect the phenotypic spectrum of the p.

This cost will be reduced even further in the following years. That means personal genomics will be very possible in the near future. How and where genetic information is stored is the biggest problem for individuals. Furthermore. privacy of genomic data has a great importance because it can be used to identify an individual and it contains privacy-sensitive data. Therefore. privacy-preserving methods for the use of genomic data should be developed. In this paper. we present a method for storing some parts of human genome needed for the disease risk computation in a smart card. Our method uses variations that separate any genome from the reference genome. It selects the variations corresponding to the exonic regions and filters them according to their variant quality and genotype quality. We show that our method can reduce a single whole human genome to the size small enough to be stored in a smart card without abusing the genomic privacy of individuals. Furthermore. we also propose a simple system in which genomic smart cards are used to perform privacy preserving disease risk test.,True,aqFNfy8AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,2,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69c9/27c105d3117690ca2f9233c17dbf475c727a.pdf,10311253461554676389,/scholar?cites=10311253461554676389,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/69c9/27c105d3117690ca2f9233c17dbf475c727a.pdf,0,0,0
