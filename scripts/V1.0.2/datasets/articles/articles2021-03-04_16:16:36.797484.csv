In 2001 the discovery that small interfering RNA (siRNA) can induce gene silencing without immunoresponse turned RNAi into a promising technique for the control of post-transcriptional gene expression. Nowadays. the major challenge remains infusion in vivo. Therefore. vehicles providing protection and selective transport are to be developed for efficient systemic delivery. The most used vectors are lipid-based. offering a wide range of biocompatible formulations. Here their application in molecular medicine is discussed. especially with regard to recent clinical trials where conventional therapies have failed.

Micelles were formed by two types of divalent cationic surfactants. i.e. Gemini bis(quaternary ammonium) bromide with variable spacer length (12-3-12. 12-6-12. 12-12-12) and a weak electrolyte surfactant (SH14) with triazine head. Immediately after mixing (t < 50 ms). new large aggregates appeared in solution and the scattering intensity at low q increased. Concomitantly. the presence of a quasi-Bragg peak at q ∼ 1.5 nm−1 indicated core structuring within the complexes. We hypothesize that siRNA and micelles are alternately arranged into “sandwiches”. forming domains with internal structural coherence.

In this paper. we present a simple biophysical model which we link to the concept that societies collapse because of the “diminishing returns of complexity” proposed by Tainter (The collapse of complex societies. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. 1988). Our model is based on the description of a socio-economic system as a trophic chain of energy stocks which dissipate the energy potential of the available resources. The model is based on the idea that we observe that the exploitation of a non-renewable resource stock (“production”) has a strongly nonlinear relation with the complexity of the system. assumed to be proportional to the size of the stock termed “The Economy” (or “capital”). producing various trajectories of …,True,-n-8eHEAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,8,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s41247-018-0049-0.pdf,10973463478121422194,/scholar?cites=10973463478121422194,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.07056,0,0,0

With the Roadmap 2050 mitigation measures. the European Union has a target to reduce emissions by 80% of their 1990 value by 2050 but without giving an estimation or a maximum ceiling for the total amount of cumulative greenhouse gases emissions over that period. Thus. the impact of the EU regulations on global warming remains unestimated. The aim and the novelty of this study are to develop a set of potential European emissions trajectories. within the Global Carbon Budget and at the same time satisfying the Roadmap 2050 goals. The result of the study highlights the urgency to reinforce mitigation measures for Europe as soon as possible because any delay in policy implementation risks the Roadmap 2050 mitigation package being insufficient to achieve the objectives of the Paris treaty.

1133570,Evidence of a Possible Double Hybrid Origin for Two Malagasy Species of Piper L.(Piperaceae),2020,Enrico Palchetti and Massimo Gori and Stefano Biricolti and Alessandro Calamai and Lorenzo Bini and Sara Falsini and Emilio Corti and Alessio Papini,,,,,Preprints,Two new species of genus Piper L. from Madagascar: Piper malgassicum Papini. Palchetti. M. Gori & Rota Nodari and Piper tsarasotrae Papini. Palchetti. M. Gori & Rota Nodari. were analyzed to investigate their phylogenetic position and evolutionary history. Both plastidial and nuclear markers were used for sequencing. The plastidial markers (ndhF and trnL intron) showed a close relationship between the two species with respect to the other species of Piper. Both species appeared phylogenetically related to the African P. guineense and the Malagasian/Mascarenhas endemic P. borbonense. The nuclear marker (G3pdh) amplification produced two separate sets of sequences:“long” sequences and “short” sequences. characterized by some long deletions. Analyzing together the nuclear sequences. we observed that the “long” sequence of P. tsarasotrae had a stricter relationship to the African accessions of P. guineense. while the accession of P. malgassicum was more strictly related to P. borbonense. On the contrary both “short” sequences of P. malgassicum and P. tsaratsotrae resulted phylogenetically related to Asian accessions and more distantly related to the formerly cited species. This unexpected result was tentatively explained with a more ancient hybridization event between an ancestor of P. malgassicum and P. tsarasotrae (and possibly P. borbonense) and an Asian species of Piper. The Asian contribution would have produced the ancestors carrying the “short” sequences. A more recent hybridization event would have led to the separation of P. malgassicum from P. tsarasotrae with an African pollen-derived genome contribution …,True,-n-8eHEAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC,0,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202009.0083,,,,https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202009.0083/download/final_file,0,0,0
1133571,Lipid-Based Nanoformulations from Plants for Sustainable Drug Delivery,2019,Ilaria Clemente and Ilaria Colzi and Sara Falsini,,Novel Drug Delivery Systems for Phytoconstituents,,301,CRC Press,Over the years. lipid-based nanovectors have been widely studied to carry drugs for their favorable properties. since they are biocompatible. versatile. and easy to scale-up (Chen et al.. 2015. Esposito et al.. 2005. Falsini et al.. 2014. Kim et al.. 2015. Milak and Zimmer. 2015. Negrini and Mezzenga. 2011). This type of nanoformulations includes liposomes. micelles. vesicles. and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs). with mean size in the range of nanometer scale (5–500 nm). Their natural amphiphilicity can be exploited to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules. thus improving bioavailability and making them extremely adaptable to different fields of application (ie. cosmetics. food. medicine. agriculture)(Angelova et al.. 2017. Nazaruk et al.. 2015. Rodrigues et al.. 2016). Moreover. the easy manipulation of the carrier to improve the efficacy of cargo loading. its release to the target. and in vivo clearance have paved the way to novel sustainable technologies for vector production and applications. One of the main critical aspects for nanoparticle manufacturing is the request for raw materials and energy. especially if they are produced on a large scale (Falsini et al.. 2018). Recently. among greener possibilities. plant derivatives for lipid nanocarriers have received particular attention. Indeed. plant-derived materials represent a promising source to reduce the use of chemical reagents. thus enhancing safety. eco-friendliness. and limiting costs. Various plant-derived materials such as leaves. edible fruits. and seed oils have been reported in the literature for biomedical applications. food. and cosmetics.

The experimental data have been analysed with a simple Lotka–Volterra type model including an allelopathic term. Based on the population dynamics of the two species in unialgal and mixed cultures. the model has been simplified and solved analytically. The best fit of the allelopathy parameter (γ≈ 1 0− 5 to 1 0− 6) provides a good agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental data for the two highest initial concentrations of C. polylepis but. interestingly. shows a less accurate fit for low initial concentrations of the toxic alga.

This approach is particularly useful when the image under study corresponds to a scalar variable submitted to a turbulent flow because. in that case. the arrangement of singularity manifolds corresponds to the multifractal hierarchy from the underlying turbulent flow.

Classical techniques for time-series analysis rely too strongly on having a constant sampling rate. which poorly adapts to the uneven time recording of paleoclimatic variables; new. more flexible methods issued from Non-Linear Physics are hence required. In this paper. we have used Huang's Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for the analysis of paleoclimatic series. We have studied three different time series of temperature proxies. characterizing oscillation patterns by using EMD. To measure the degree of temporal correlation of two variables. we have developed a method that relates couples of modes from different series by calculating the instantaneous phase differences among the associated modes. We observed that when two modes exhibited a constant phase difference. their frequencies were nearly equal to that of Milankovich cycles. Our results show that EMD is a good methodology not only for synchronization of different records but also for determination of the different local frequencies in each time series.

When the blooming species are directly or indirectly noxious for humans. these proliferations are denoted as harmful algal blooms (HAB). The importance of biological interactions for the appearance of HABs. in particular when the proliferating microalgae produce toxins that affect other organisms in the food web. remains still poorly understood. Here we analyse the role of toxins produced by a microalgal species and affecting its predators. in determining the success of that species as a bloom former. A three-species predator–prey model is used to define a criterion that determines whether a toxic microalga will be able to initiate a bloom in competition against a non-toxic one with higher growth rate.

Consequences for the spawning and nursery habitats of European anchovy,2011,D Macías and Ignacio Alberto Catalán and Jordi Solé and Beatriz Morales-Nin and J Ruiz,58,Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers,12,1175-1188,Pergamon,The north-western Alboran Sea is a highly dynamic region in which the hydrological processes are mainly controlled by the entrance of the Atlantic Jet (AJ) through the Strait of Gibraltar. The biological patterns of the area are also related to this variability in which atmospheric pressure distributions and wind intensity and direction play major roles. In this work. we studied how changes in atmospheric forcing (from high atmospheric pressure over the Mediterranean to low atmospheric pressure) induced alterations in the physical and biogeochemical environment by re-activating coastal upwelling on the Spanish shore. The nursery area of European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the NW Alboran Sea. confirmed to be the very coastal band around Malaga Bay. did not show any drastic change in its biogeochemical characteristics. indicating that this coastal region is somewhat isolated from the rest of the basin.

Statistical analysis of species occurrences and their relationships with associated environmental factors is used to predict how likely a species is to occur in unsampled locations as well as future conditions. However. it is known that environmental factors alone may not be sufficient to account for species distribution. Other ecological processes including species interactions (such as competition and predation). and the impact of human activities. may affect the spatial arrangement of a species.

The analysis is done in three steps. First. we split the seasonal and residual contribution for the fields under study. Second. we calculate the corresponding empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) for the seasonal and residual parts. Finally. we relate each pair of variables for both seasonal and residual contribution EOFs. The results reported here allow the links between wind and Chl a to be quantified. We explain these links in terms of the ocean velocity field acting as a driver of Chl a variability. The results show that. although the seasonal part of the Chl a field is modulated by the vertical velocity. the residual component is modulated by the horizontal velocity components.

Our method is based in considering the warm periods known as Dansgaard–Oeschger (D/O) events and posterior returns to the cold stage as a climatic cycle. After the warming phase. D/O events relax to the initial cold state in three different ways. what gives rise to three classes of cycles. Also. the Younger/Dryas–Bolling/Allerod (Y/D–B/A) cycle corresponds to one of the classes obtained.

With the Roadmap 2050 mitigation measures. the European Union has a target to reduce emissions by 80% of their 1990 value by 2050 but without giving an estimation or a maximum ceiling for the total amount of cumulative greenhouse gases emissions over that period. Thus. the impact of the EU regulations on global warming remains unestimated. The aim and the novelty of this study are to develop a set of potential European emissions trajectories. within the Global Carbon Budget and at the same time satisfying the Roadmap 2050 goals.

Using the most highly correlated pair (Chl-zonal wind. with r = 0.63). a simple linear relationship is proposed to reconstruct and forecast the Chl field.

Mostly. the studies focus on the shallow hydrodynamics in or around a single canyon. In the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. knowledge of the deep-sea circulation and its spatial variability in three contiguous submarine canyons is limited. We used a Lagrangian framework with three-dimensional velocity fields from two versions of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to study the deep-bottom connectivity between submarine canyons and to compare their influence on the particle transport. From a biological point of view. the particles represented eggs and larvae spawned by the deep-sea commercial shrimp Aristeus antennatus along the continental slope in summer. The passive particles mainly followed a southwest drift along the continental slope and drifted less than 200 km considering a pelagic larval duration (PLD) of 31 d. Two of the submarine canyons were connected by more than 27 % of particles if they were released at sea bottom depths above 600 m. The vertical advection of particles depended on the depth where particles were released and the circulation influenced by the morphology of each submarine canyon. Therefore. the impact of contiguous submarine canyons on particle transport should be studied on a case-by-case basis and not be generalized. Because the flows were strongly influenced by the bottom topography. the hydrodynamic model with finer bathymetric resolution data. a less smoothed bottom topography. and finer sigma-layer resolution near the bottom should give more …,True,T2QX1zEAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,5,https://os.copernicus.org/articles/15/1745/2019/,16175727563080098327,/scholar?cites=16175727563080098327,,https://os.copernicus.org/articles/15/1745/2019/,0,0,0

Recent events have highlighted that (lack of) access to critical resources. including food. energy and water. can. in certain circumstances. lead to violent demonstrations. In this paper. we assess a number of political fragility indices to see whether they are good indicators of propensity to food riots. We found that the most accurate is the Political Instability and Absence of Violence Indicator of the Worldwide Governance Indicators by the World Bank. We compute a likelihood of experiencing a food riot for each quartile of this index. We found that the self-sufficiency of food does not seem to affect the likelihood of the occurrence of food riots. but that the level of political stability of a country does have a role. In addition. we identify a monthly and annual threshold for the Food and Agriculture Organisation Food Price Index. above which food riots in fragile states are more likely to occur.

This is partly due to the lack of theory about how to represent such as actors. and because they are not static over the time-scales typical for social changes to have …,True,G81FlMQAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,25,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10707-018-00337-8?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_source=ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst&utm_medium=email&utm_content=AA_en_06082018&ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst_20190122&error=cookies_not_supported&code=33858ba2-f7a3-4d3f-90ee-55c0c24cb9a6,10860365625900570107,/scholar?cites=10860365625900570107,,http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/850343/1/Using%20Agent-based%20modelling.pdf,0,0,0

This has resulted in negative consequences for the world economy. partly causing international food price spikes and social upheavals. In this paper we present statistical findings along with a preliminary version of an original agent-based model called the Dawe Global Security Model that simulates the global food market and the political fragility of countries. The model simulates the effects of food insecurity on international food prices and how these. coupled with national political fragility and international food trade can. in turn. increase the probability of food riots in countries.

1133631,Encouraging sustainable transport choices in American households: Results from an empirically grounded agent-based model,2014,Davide Natalini and Giangiacomo Bravo,6,Sustainability,1,50-69,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The transport sector needs to go through an extended process of decarbonisation to counter the threat of climate change. Unfortunately. the International Energy Agency forecasts an enormous growth in the number of cars and greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Two issues can thus be identified:(1) the need for a new methodology that could evaluate the policy performances ex-ante and (2) the need for more effective policies. To help address these issues. we developed an Agent-Based Model called Mobility USA aimed at:(1) testing whether this could be an effective approach in analysing ex-ante policy implementation in the transport sector; and (2) evaluating the effects of alternative policy scenarios on commuting behaviours in the USA. Particularly. we tested the effects of two sets of policies. namely market-based and preference-change ones. The model results suggest that this type of agent-based approach will provide a useful tool for testing policy interventions and their effectiveness.

1133632,A hybrid System Dynamics–Agent Based model to simulate Complex Adaptive Systems: a new methodological framework for sustainability analysis,2014,IRENE MONASTEROLO and ALED JONES and FLAVIO TONELLI and DAVIDE NATALINI,5,Proceedings of the System Dynamics Society Annual Conference,,,,Sustainability analysis represents a form of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) because it involves multiple sectors and agents displaying non-linear and non-rational interacting behaviours characterized by feedbacks and time lags. Thus. it cannot be properly addressed with classical econometric models such as General Equilibrium Models (GEM). nor with traditional simulation models alone including System Dynamics (SD). Dynamic Systems (DS). Discrete Event Simulation (DES). Agent Based Models (ABM). We present a hybrid SD-ABM approach and argue that this may potentially better address such issues in a more informative and effective way because they exploit the strengths of both of these forms of models. In particular. we describe how this emerging modelling framework can contribute to understanding complex systems. increasing modelling accuracy and computational efficiency. Then. we highlight the methodological challenges of SD-ABM integration. Among the relevant applications. this new modelling approach would aid the understanding of the characteristics and evolution of the resources-economic growth-population nexus. There is an increasing need to research this nexus to help define the processes involved in the changes in prices of global commodities like oil and cereals since middle of the last decade which has partly been driven by a supply-demand mismatch.

With the Roadmap 2050 mitigation measures. the European Union has a target to reduce emissions by 80% of their 1990 value by 2050 but without giving an estimation or a maximum ceiling for the total amount of cumulative greenhouse gases emissions over that period. Thus. the impact of the EU regulations on global warming remains unestimated. The aim and the novelty of this study are to develop a set of potential European emissions trajectories. within the Global Carbon Budget and at the same time satisfying the Roadmap 2050 goals. The result of the study highlights the urgency to reinforce mitigation measures for Europe as soon as possible because any delay in policy implementation risks the Roadmap 2050 mitigation package being insufficient to achieve the objectives of the Paris treaty.

1133635,Estimating the role of scarcity. prices and political fragility in food and fuel riots: a quantitative and agent-based modelling approach,2016,Davide Natalini,,,,,,Climate and environmental changes are argued to increase the occurrence of conflict. In particular. two types of conflict seem to be driven by underlying environmental processes: food and fuel riots. Although research focussed on understanding the dynamics that cause food riots exists. the evidence is mixed and a solid quantitative analysis on the factors that cause these type of events is missing. Research on fuel riots is currently non-existent. The aim of this research was hence to identify. quantify and simulate the interconnections between scarcity of natural resources. international prices. political fragility and the occurrence of food and fuel riots. The approach implemented was mainly quantitative. with use of statistics. econometrics and Agent-Based Modelling (ABM). These methods allowed a parameterisation of these relationships and inclusion of the results in three different version of an ABM: Food. Fuel and Food and Fuel ABMs. The findings show that national availability of resources does not significantly impact the occurrence of food and fuel riots. while international prices and national political fragility do. Thresholds above which riots are more likely to happen were identified for both the price of food and fuel. For food. volatility was found to have a bigger impact than absolute prices. while for fuel the evidence was mixed and more research is required. In addition. food and fuel riots increase the likelihood of one another. Although the introduction of these parameters in the ABMs did not add to the predictive power of the underlying statistical models. the ABMs form the basis for further developments. in particular as regards the evolution of …,True,G81FlMQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,4,http://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/701893/,5217035646095002197,/scholar?cites=5217035646095002197,,https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/701893/1/Natalini_2016.pdf,0,0,0

We provide the first fuel riots database and explore their social. economic and environmental drivers. The analysis demonstrates links between fuel riots and high international crude oil prices in countries characterised by weak state capacity. deficient governance. fuel scarcity and poor economic performance. We suggest a potential causal pathway for fuel riots: when international fuel prices spike. net fuel-importing countries bear higher costs. If these countries are politically unstable and their government inefficient. the likelihood of fuel riots is high. Wealthier countries can absorb price increases and maintain subsidies. as opposed to poorer societies where fuel riots are more likely. Our findings demonstrate the role of state capacity and socio-economic conditions in enabling conflict. and will inform policy by identifying fertile ground for fuel riots. i.e. societies …,True,G81FlMQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421520306005,,,,https://osf.io/download/5e5844e7ef5d8900ed069918/,0,0,0

This is most obvious when looking at the ways in which governments have focuses on economic growth. Recently. the awareness that we live in a finite-resources world has been rising (eg Rockström et al. 2009) and some works tried to model the possible implications for the future growth (eg Meadows et al. 2004; Randers 2012; Jones et al. 2013). These works. and many others. tentatively investigated the interconnections between several dimensions (eg population. GDP. climate change. resources availability. etc…). but the approaches implemented were limited and the results obtained were either partial or non-transparent.In addition to that. an increasing need to understand the multidimensionality and nonlinearity of resources insecurity has been observed (Monasterolo and Jones TBP). particularly because of the international political instability that can be worsened by an unequal distribution of scarce resources and price volatility (eg Lati et al. 2012).

The effect of resveratrol on human health is the topic of numerous studies. In fact this molecule has shown anti-cancer. anti-inflammatory. blood-sugar-lowering ability and beneficial cardiovascular effects. However. for many polyphenol compounds of natural origin bioavailability is limited by low solubility in biological fluids. as well as by rapid metabolization in vivo. Therefore. appropriate carriers are required to obtain efficient therapeutics along with low administration doses. Liposomes are excellent candidates for drug delivery purposes. due to their biocompatibility. wide choice of physico-chemical properties and easy preparation. In this paper liposome formulations made by a saturated phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) and cholesterol (or its positively charged derivative DC-CHOL) were chosen to optimize the loading of a rigid hydrophobic molecule such as resveratrol. Plain and resveratrol loaded liposomes were characterized for size. surface charge and structural details by complementary techniques. i.e. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Zeta potential and Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Nuclear and Electron Spin magnetic resonances (NMR and ESR. respectively) were also used to gain information at the molecular scale.

On these premises. we previously described the synthesis of SS14 redox-sensitive gemini surfactant for gene delivery. Although others have attributed the beneficial effects of intracellular reducing environment to reduced glutathione (GSH). these observations cannot rule out the possible implication of the redox milieu in its whole on transfection efficiency of bioreducible transfectants leaving the determinants of DNA release largely undefined.  Methodology/Principal Findings With the aim of addressing this issue. SS14 was here formulated into binary and ternary 100 nm-extruded liposomes and the effects of the helper lipid composition and of the SS14/helper lipids molar ratio on chemical-physical and structural parameters defining transfection effectiveness were investigated. Among all formulations tested. DOPC/DOPE/SS14 at 25∶50∶25 molar ratio was the most effective in transfection studies owing to the presence of dioleoyl chains and phosphatidylethanolamine head groups in co-lipids. The increase in SS14 content up to 50% along DOPC/DOPE/SS14 liposome series yielded enhanced transfection. up to 2.7-fold higher than that of the benchmark Lipofectamine 2000. without altering cytotoxicity of the corresponding lipoplexes at charge ratio 5.

Besides being safe and non-toxic. drug carriers with improved performance should meet the requirements of (i) appropriate size and shape and (ii) cargo upload/release with unmodified properties. Structural issues are of primary importance to control the mechanism of action of loaded vectors. Overall properties. such as mean diameter and surface charge. can be obtained using bench instruments (Dynamic Light Scattering and Zeta potential). However. techniques with higher space and time resolution are needed for in-depth structural characterization. Small-angle X-ray (SAXS) and neutron (SANS) scattering techniques provide information at the nanoscale and have therefore been largely used to investigate nanovectors loaded with drugs or other biologically relevant molecules. Here we revise recent applications of these complementary scattering techniques in the field of drug delivery in pharmaceutics and medicine with a focus to liposomal carriers.

The objective has been to come up with a formula that can be used to calculate particle size and zeta potential from dynamic mobility measurements in concentrated suspensions. Some of these theories are based on cell models. others are based on coupled phase models and another involves the use of experimentally determined parameters.

Recent events have highlighted that (lack of) access to critical resources. including food. energy and water. can. in certain circumstances. lead to violent demonstrations. In this paper. we assess a number of political fragility indices to see whether they are good indicators of propensity to food riots. We found that the most accurate is the Political Instability and Absence of Violence Indicator of the Worldwide Governance Indicators by the World Bank. We compute a likelihood of experiencing a food riot for each quartile of this index. We found that the self-sufficiency of food does not seem to affect the likelihood of the occurrence of food riots. but that the level of political stability of a country does have a role. In addition. we identify a monthly and annual threshold for the Food and Agriculture Organisation Food Price Index. above which food riots in fragile states are more likely to occur.

Cham,The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) bring together environmental. social and economic concerns. They therefore have the potential to move society away from the dominant model of prosperity as purely economic toward a more holistic and ‘sustainable’ prosperity. But. the success of such a transformative agenda rests on its implementation. At the heart of planned implementation of the SDGs is a set of 230 indicators. Indicators have been strongly critiqued in a range of literatures. However. in the context of the SDGs. indicators have been described as ‘essential’ with little critical assessment of their role in implementation. Therefore. this chapter aims to provide this critical voice. To do this. the chapter reviews critiques of indicators from sustainability science. anthropology and sociology and provides illustrative cases of indicators implementation.

It used the World3 model to better understand the dynamics of global systems and their relationship to finite resource availability. land use. and persistent pollution accumulation. The trends of resource depletion and degradation of physical systems which were identified by Limits to Growth have continued. Although World3 forecast scenarios are based on key measures and assumptions that cannot be easily assessed using available data (ie. non-renewable resources. persistent pollution). the dynamics of growth components of the model can be compared with publicly available global data trends. Based on Scenario 2 of the Limits to Growth study. we present a calibration of the updated World3-03 model using historical data from 1995 to 2012 to better understand the dynamics of today’s economic and resource system. Given that accurate data on physical limits does not currently exist. the dynamics of overshoot to global limits are not assessed. In this paper we offer a new interpretation of the parametrisation of World3-03 using these data to explore how its assumptions on global dynamics. environmental footprints and responses have changed over the past 40 years.

As a result. growing public and political pressures are likely to further target air transportation to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The key challenges faced by policy makers and air transportation industry stakeholders is to reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions while sustaining mobility for passengers and time-sensitive cargo as well as meeting future demand for air transportation in developing and emerging countries.

The upfront energy invested in constructing a RE infrastructure subtracts from the net energy available for societal energy needs. a fact typically neglected in energy projections. Modeling feasible energy transition pathways to provide different net energy levels we find that they are critically dependent on the fossil fuel emissions cap and phase-out profile and on the characteristic energy return on energy invested of the RE technologies. The easiest pathway requires installation of RE plants to accelerate from 0.12 TW p yr–1 in 2013 to peak between 7.3 and 11.6 TW p yr–1 in the late 2030s. for an early or a late fossil-fuel phase-out …,True,EUaSHDYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,70,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/094009/meta,18139237419385036162,/scholar?cites=18139237419385036162,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/094009/pdf,0,0,0

Switching from an economy based on energy stocks to one based on energy flows requires a social paradigm shift. This paper defines Sustainable Energy Transition (SET) and introduces a set of five propositions that prescribe its sustainability. The propositions are comprehensive. spanning environmental constraints. resource availability. equity. and the transition dynamics from an energy and economic accounting perspective aimed at addressing all three pillars of sustainability. In order to rigorously define the constraints of SET a theoretical energy economy framework is introduced along with the concept of the renewable energy investment ratio. The paper concludes with a practical application of the SET propositions on the global energy system and identifies an order of magnitude underinvestment in the renewable energy investment ratio in comparison to the estimated level needed for a controlled transition that satisfies all propositions. The option of drastically increasing this ratio in the future may not be available as it would reduce societally available energy. imposing unacceptably high energy prices that would induce either fossil resource extraction beyond the safely recoverable resources or energy poverty.

1133716,Defusing the energy trap: the potential of energy-denominated currencies to facilitate a sustainable energy transition,2014,Sgouris Sgouridis,2,Frontiers in Energy Research,,8,Frontiers,The universal adoption of fiat currencies and of the fractional reserve banking system coincided with access to and ability to utilize energy-dense fossil fuels leading to unprecedented rates of economic expansion. The depletion of economically recoverable fossil fuels though sets the stage for systemic crises as it is not adequately priced in the current market system. An energy-based system of exchange can be adopted in parallel to or in place of fiat currencies in order to facilitate a sustainable energy transition (SET) and mitigate the impacts of such crises. Energy-backed and energy-referenced currencies are discussed as two possible variants for their ability to realign the economic system to the thermodynamic limits of the physical world. The primary advantage of an energy-referenced currency over the current mechanisms for SET (like feed-in tariffs or carbon taxes) is realized with the decoupling of the monetary and credit functions. especially when debt is tied to future energy availability. While energy-backed (credit) systems can be easier to adopt on a regional scale. the full transition to an energy-reference currency system requires significant reform of the financial and monetary system although it would not radically disrupt the current economic valuations given the high degree of correlation between value and embodied energy.,True,EUaSHDYAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,18,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2014.00008/full,15822759670541994544,/scholar?cites=15822759670541994544,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2014.00008/full,0,0,0

Fossil fuels may have limited life and a history of fluctuating costs. which will lead to multiple issues that can affect the energy security of this country in the long-term. Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) is a concept different to “energy security”. which must consider the solar and wind energy as basic sources of energy supplies in Saudi Arabia. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and Brownian Motion (BM) approaches were employed to predict the future behaviour of solar and wind energy. along with long-term temperature performance. based on 69 years of historical daily data. MCS and BM were employed to provide a wide range of options for future prediction results. A validation exercise showed that the north-western region was the most highly recommended region for deployment of solar and wind energy applications due to an abundance of solar and wind energy resources with low temperature supported by a clearer sky during the year. This is followed by the southern region. which exhibited good solar and wind energy resources. This study can be considered as a roadmap to meet the climate and sustainability goals by providing a long-term overview of solar energy. wind energy. and temperature performance in some countries that have a lack of long-term future prediction analysis such as Saudi Arabia.,True,1u1nA44AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,6,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/3/588,1073090420958308520,/scholar?cites=1073090420958308520,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/3/588/htm,0,0,0

Here. we argue that the transition can be seen as a process similar to the challenge faced by ancient farmers who had to save some of their harvest as seed for the next harvest. In the present case. during the initial phase of the transition. we need to save and invest part of the energy produced by fossil fuels in order to build their own replacement in the form of renewable energy plants. This strategy is called here “the Sower’s Way”. The needs for the transition can be quantified in terms of the “energy return for energy invested”(EROI or EROEI) in order to estimate the amount of “seed” that’s necessary to invest before either fossil fuels become too expensive to be profitably extracted or the temperature rise caused by greenhouse gases exceed the safe limits. as they are understood today. Taking into account that it is necessary to maintain a minimum level of energy supply for a growing human population and for improving the living standards of people living in poor countries. the calculations indicate that a considerable increase in the investments in renewable energy is necessary. and that it is necessary to start as soon as possible.,True,1u1nA44AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilaria_Perissi2/publication/309726467_The_Sower's_Way_A_Strategy_to_Attain_the_Energy_Transition/links/5fecc07a92851c13fed7c4c1/The-Sowers-Way-A-Strategy-to-Attain-the-Energy-Transition.pdf,7072971728997681372,/scholar?cites=7072971728997681372,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilaria_Perissi2/publication/309726467_The_Sower's_Way_A_Strategy_to_Attain_the_Energy_Transition/links/5fecc07a92851c13fed7c4c1/The-Sowers-Way-A-Strategy-to-Attain-the-Energy-Transition.pdf,0,0,0

Africa has received some US $500 million of international donor funding to increase law enforcement in protected areas (go. nature. com/2h76smi). However. poaching is still rife. particularly where rangers are sparse. Even well-resourced parks in southern Africa are not immune. Poaching of Asian elephants was stopped across Cambodia’s Cardamom Rainforest Landscape in 2001. and has been kept at bay at an annual cost of $200 per square kilometre. Assuming similar factors operate in Africa. and given that the estimated range of the African elephant is 3 million km2. on-the-ground action at poaching sites would need some $600 million annually. Although daunting. this sum is less than $1.500 a year for each live African elephant—much lower than even conservative estimates of its value to ecosystem services and ecotourism.

1133731,Modeling Dynamic Transitions in the Global Air Transportation System,2013,Denes Csala and Sgouris Sgouridis,,,,1127,System Dynamics Society,The air transportation system needs to change drastically if it is to transition into a sustainable state. The stakes for the needed technology-driven change–innovation–are extremely high for the lead adopters given the high cost of R&D in manufacturing and the need to change parts of the existing infrastructure and operational procedures if a significant improvement in high energy efficiency is to be achieved. We assess different transition options. using the Global Aviation Industry Dynamics Transition (GAIDT) system dynamics model of the industry that extends a previous implementation in the ability to test how such changes will cascade through the global aviation system accounting for airline and aircraft manufacturer competition across a variety of aircraft product lines. The GAIDT model exhibits advanced features of modularity. extensibility. autocalibration and a visual user interface. some considered unique in system dynamics. such as a dynamic modular structure or compatibility with other simulation modeling techniques. We conduct a quantitative strategy assessment using a composite indicator 𝑉̅ (normalized strategy value). that combines the economic and environmental benefits of different strategies. It has been found that the normalized strategy values will highly depend on the fuel prices. However. if the fuel prices continue to rise. any kind of innovation option is beneficial. When decoupled from fuel prices. it has been found that early transition options are preferred.

1133738,Switching Economics for Physics and the Carbon Price Inflation: Problems in Integrated Assessment Models and their Implications,2016,Sgouris Sgouridis and Abdulla Kaya and Denes Csala,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.06196,,,,Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are mainstay tools for assessing the long-term interactions between climate and the economy and for deriving optimal policy responses in the form of carbon prices. IAMs have been criticized for controversial discount rate assumptions. arbitrary climate damage functions. and the inadequate handling of potentially catastrophic climate outcomes. We review these external shortcomings for prominent IAMs before turning our focus on an internal modeling fallacy: the widespread misapplication of the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) function for the technology transitions modeled by IAMs. Applying CES. an economic modeling approach. on technical factor inputs over long periods where an entire factor (the greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuel inputs) must be substituted creates artifacts that fail to match the S-curve patterns observed historically. A policy critical result. the monotonically increasing cost of carbon. a universal feature of IAMs. is called into question by showing that it is unrealistic as it is an artifact of the modeling approach and not representative of the technical substitutability potential nor of the expected cost of the technologies. We demonstrate this first through a simple but representative example of CES application on the energy system and with a sectoral discussion of the actual fossil substitution costs. We propose a methodological modification using dynamically varying elasticity of substitution as a plausible alternative to model the energy transition in line with the historical observations and technical realities within the existing modeling systems.

It presents the results of the first. net-energy based model that can generate dynamic global and national sustainable energy transition paths. ie time series of energy generation capacity installation rates for all renewable energy sources. phase-out profiles for fossil fuels. as well as bidirectional flows of energy trade. for the period 2015-2100. under various societal energy demand assumptions. These paths comply by design with the greenhouse gas emissions limits put forward by the International Panel on Climate Change in their RCP2. 6 global warming scenario. equivalent to a 66% confidence of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial era (1850) levels–currently the accepted upper limit to avoid catastrophic change to human life on Earth. Our energy-based results provide an alternative to existing economic. costdriven models and analyses–collectively referred to as integrated assessment models–as we highlight that energy replacement curves of historical energy transitions do not follow the substitution laws of these models. First. we develop a mathematical framework and a differential equation-based. recursive. numerical model for the topdown calculation of global sustainable energy transition paths. followed by a bottomup calculation of regional and/or national paths.

The latter were based on the total amount of rainfall. which was cumulated considering different time intervals: 1-. 2- and 3-day cumulates took into account the critical rainfall influencing shallow movements. whilst a variable time interval cumulate (up to 240 days) was used to consider the triggering of deep-seated landslides in low permeability terrains. A prototypal version of the model was initially set up to define statistical thresholds. Then. thresholds were calibrated using a database of past georegistered and dated landslides.

SAMM is based on two modules modelling the snow accumulation and the snowmelt processes.

The model depends on 13 empirical parameters. whose optimal values were defined with an optimisation algorithm (simplex flexible) using calibration measures of snowpack thickness. From an operational point of view. SAMM uses as input data only temperature and rainfall measurements. bringing about the additional benefit of a relatively easy implementation.

The proposed method exploits the procedures widely used to model chemical reactions. but still uncommon in behavioural studies. We applied this methodology to the interpretation of experimental observations of battles between two species of ants (Lasius neglectus and Lasius paralienus). but this scheme may have a wider applicability and can be extended to other species as well. We performed two types of experiment labelled as interaction and mortality. The interaction experiments are designed to obtain information on the combat dynamics and lasted one hour. The mortality ones provide information on the casualty rates of the two species and lasted five hours. We modelled the interactions among ants using a chemical model which considers the single ant individuals and fighting groups analogously to atoms and molecules. The mean-field behaviour of the model is described by a set of non-linear differential equations. We also performed stochastic simulations of the corresponding agent-based model by means of the Gillespie event-driven integration scheme. By fitting the stochastic trajectories with the deterministic model. we obtained the probability distribution of the reaction parameters. The main result that we obtained is a dominance phase diagram. that gives the average trajectory of a generic battle. for an arbitrary number of opponents. This phase diagram was validated with some extra experiments. With respect to other war models (e.g..

We used a molecular dynamics (MD) approach. similar to the discrete element method (DEM). that is suitable to model granular material and to observe the trajectory of a single particle. so to possibly identify its dynamical properties. We consider that the triggering of shallow landslides is caused by the decrease of the static friction along the sliding surface due to water infiltration by rainfall. Thence the triggering is caused by the two following conditions: (a) a threshold speed of the particles and (b) a condition on the static friction. between the particles and the slope surface. based on the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion. The latter static condition is used in the geotechnical model to estimate the possibility of landslide triggering.

1133751,Particle based method for shallow landslides: modeling sliding surface lubrication by rainfall,2011,Emanuele Massaro and Gianluca Martelloni and Franco Bagnoli,,CMSIM Int J Nonlinear Sci,,147-158,,Landslides are a recurrent phenomenon in many regions of Italy: in particular. the rain-induced shallow landslides represent a large percentage of this type of phenomenon. responsible of human life loss. destruction of assets and infrastructure and other major economical losses. In this paper a theoretical computational mesoscopic model based on interacting particles has been developed to describe the features of a granular material along a slope. We use a Lagrangian method similar to molecular dynamic (MD) for the computation of the movement of particles after and during a rainfall. In order to model frictional forces. the MD method is complemented by additional conditions: the forces acting on a particle can cause its displacement if they exceed the static friction between them and the slope surface. based on the failure criterion of Mohr-Coulomb. and if the resulting speed is larger that a given threshold. Preliminary results are very satisfactory; in our simulations emerging phenomena such as fractures and detachments can be observed. In particular. the model reproduces well the energy and time distribution of avalanches. analogous to the observed Gutenberg-Richter and Omori distributions for earthquakes. These power laws are in general considered the signature of self-organizing phenomena. As in other models. this self organization is related to a large separation of time scales between rain events and landslide movements.

As we can see in [1] a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total infected and the deaths. In this article our goal is to study the missing peak. i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7. the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model. introducing new parameters. Moreover. we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way. introducing a simple conservation law. we define a model with 4 populations: total infected. currently positives. recoveries and deaths. Therefore. we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 …,True,rmwEDz8AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920304616,7737257452041828506,/scholar?cites=7737257452041828506,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7328650/,0,0,0

Since this species can cause environmental damage of various kinds. it is necessary to evaluate its expected in not yet infested areas. A structured discrete model is built. taking into account all biological information we were able to find. including the environmental variability implemented by means of stochastic parameters (coefficients of fertility. death. etc.). This model is based on a structure with 7 age classes. ie a Leslie mathematical population modeling type and it is calibrated with laboratory data provided by the Department of Evolutionary Biology (DEB) of Florence (Italy). The model presents many interesting aspects: the population has a high initial growth. then it stabilizes similarly to the logistic growth. but then it exhibits oscillations (a kind of limit-cycle attractor in the phase plane). The sensitivity analysis shows a good resilience of the model and. for low values of reproductive female fraction. the fluctuations may eventually lead to the extinction of the species: this fact might be exploited as a controlling factor. Moreover. the probability of extinction is valuated with an inverse Gaussian that indicates a high resilience of the species. confirmed by experimental data and field observation: this species has diffused in Italy since 1989 and it has shown a natural tendency to grow. Finally. the spatial mobility is introduced in the model. simulating the movement of the crayfishes in a virtual lake of elliptical form by means of simple cinematic rules encouraging the movement towards the banks of the …,True,rmwEDz8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,7,https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3970,4047229483200498554,/scholar?cites=4047229483200498554,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3970,0,0,0

Indeed. in spite of the fact that the AO is able to achieve. at present. excellent levels of wavefront corrections (a Strehl ratio up to 90 per cent in H band). its performances strongly depend on the atmospheric conditions. Knowing in advance the atmospheric turbulence conditions allows an optimization of the AO use. It has already been proven that it is possible to provide reliable forecasts of the OT ( profiles and integrated astroclimatic parameters such as seeing. isoplanatic angle. wavefront coherence time. etc.) for the next night.

Berlin. Heidelberg,In this work we present a regional scale warning system (named SIGMA) for rainfall induced landslides. The system combines rain gauges measurements and rainfall forecasts and compares them with a series of statistical rainfall thresholds based on the total amount of rainfall. The system was specifically built to take into account both shallow and deep seated landslides. A decisional algorithm integrated in the warning system automatically provides a criticality level depending on which thresholds are exceeded. The model was integrated in the regional warning system of the Emilia Romagna region (Italy) for civil protection purposes.

We perform the analysis with 4 different models and we think that the best candidate to correctly described the italian situation is a generalized Logistic equation. We use two coupled differential equations that model the evolution of the severe infected and the dead. This choice is due to the fact that in Italy the pharyngeal swabs are made only to severe infected. therefore we have no information about asymptomatic people.

The model depends on 13 empirical parameters. whose optimal values were defined with an optimization algorithm (simplex flexible) 10 using calibration measures of snowpack thickness. From an operational point of view. SAMM uses as input data only temperature and rainfall measurements. bringing the additional advantage of a relatively easy implementation.

1133771,Fractional and fractal dynamics approach to anomalous diffusion in porous media: application to landslide behavior,2016,Gianluca Martelloni and Franco Bagnoli,18,EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts,,17206,,In the past three decades. fractional and fractal calculus (that is. calculus of derivatives and integral of any arbitrary real or complex order) appeared to be an important tool for its applications in many fields of science and engineering. This theory allows to face. analytically and/or numerically. fractional differential equations and fractional partial differential equations. In particular. one of the several applications deals with anomalous diffusion processes. The latter phenomena can be clearly described from the statistical viewpoint. Indeed. in various complex systems. the diffusion processes usually no longer follow Gaussian statistics. and thus Fick’s second law fails to describe the related transport behavior. In particular. one observes deviations from the linear time dependence of the mean squared displacement (x2 (t))∝ t.(1) which is characteristic of Brownian motion. ie. a direct consequence of the central limit theorem and the Markovian nature of the underlying stochastic process [1-17]. Instead. anomalous diffusion is found in a wide diversity of systems and its feature is the non-linear growth of the mean squared displacement over time. Especially the power-law pattern. with exponent γ different from 1 (x2 (t))∝ tγ.(2) characterizes many systems [18. 19]. but a variety of other rules. such as a logarithmic time dependence. exist [20]. The anomalous diffusion. as expressed in Eq.(2) is connected with the breakdown of the central limit theorem. caused by either broad distributions or long-range correlations. eg. the extreme statistics and the power law distributions. typical of the self-organized criticality [42. 43].

Consequently. significant levels of hydrogen production can only be obtained with an electrical energy consumption exceeding 45 kWhkg-1 H 2. Electrochemical reforming allows the overcoming of such thermodynamic limitations by replacing oxygen evolution with the oxidation of biomass-derived alcohols. Here we show that the use of an original anode material consisting of palladium nanoparticles deposited on to a three-dimensional architecture of titania nanotubes allows electrical energy savings up to 26.5 kWhkg-1 H 2 as compared with proton electrolyte membrane water electrolysis. A net energy analysis shows that for bio-ethanol with energy return of the invested energy larger than 5.1 (for example. cellulose). the electrochemical reforming energy balance is advantageous over proton electrolyte membrane water …,True,pcTjn24AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,185,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5036?origin=ppub,12519357026294457673,/scholar?cites=12519357026294457673,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5036.pdf?origin=ppub,0,0,0

Complete removal of Pt is a difficult if not impossible task for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM‐FCs). The anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEM‐FC) has long been proposed as a solution as non‐Pt metals may be employed. Despite this. few examples of Pt‐free AEM‐FCs have been demonstrated with modest power output. The main obstacle preventing the realization of a high power density Pt‐free AEM‐FC is sluggish hydrogen oxidation (HOR) kinetics of the anode catalyst. Here we describe a Pt‐free AEM‐FC that employs a mixed carbon‐CeO2 supported palladium (Pd) anode catalyst that exhibits enhanced kinetics for the HOR.

First they are much easier to handle. store. and transport due to the fact that they are liquid at room temperature. Furthermore. they have a high energy density. for example. ethanol 24 MJLÀ1 and methanol 15.6 MJLÀ1. In virtue of these advantages. alcohols have been extensively tested in fuel cells. Up till now direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been the subject of the most development.[1–3] DMFCs have been technologically exploited for powering small portable electronic devices. however the toxicity of methanol. together with its flammability and high vapor pressure at room temperature severely hampered full technological exploitation. Moreover. methanol oxidation occurs via pathways involving the formation of adsorbed CO. which causes electrocatalyst poisoning and ultimately results in significant performance degradation. Consequently. high loadings of PtRu/C alloy electrocatalysts are required to achieve sufficient performance. Additionally. concerns about the overall energy efficiency of DMFCs have also been recently raised.[4. 5] The substitution of methanol with ethanol in fuel cells is advantageous. as ethanol is far less toxic and volatile and it can be obtained from biomass conversion through low energy processes.

1133826,Coating thickness determination using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy: monte carlo simulations as an alternative to the use of standards,2019,Walter Giurlani and Enrico Berretti and Massimo Innocenti and Alessandro Lavacchi,9,Coatings,2,79,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,X-ray fluorescence is often employed in the measurement of the thickness of coatings. Despite its widespread nature. the task is not straightforward because of the complex physics involved. which results in high dependence on matrix effects. Thickness quantification is accomplished using the Fundamental Parameters approach. adjusted with empirical measurements of standards with known composition and thickness. This approach has two major drawbacks:(i) there are no standards for any possible coating and coating architecture and (ii) even relying on standards. the quantification of unknown samples requires the precise knowledge of the matrix nature (eg. in the case of multilayer coatings the thickness and composition of each underlayer). In this work. we describe a semiquantitative approach to coating thickness measurement based on the construction of calibration curves through simulated XRF spectra built with Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations have been performed with the freeware software XMI-MSIM. We have assessed the accuracy of the methods by comparing the results with those obtained by (i) XRF thickness determination with standards and (ii) FIB-SEM cross-sectioning.

Due to the high brilliance of synchrotron light. FEXRAV can investigate deeply buried surfaces. More specifically. we directly analyzed the evolution of the Pd/C catalytic layer during a voltammetric cycle. through a specifically designed electrochemical cell. Still. we observed a complex interfacial chemistry of Pd. which impairs a straightforward interpretation of FEXRAV data. Exploiting thermodynamic chemical speciation modelling we were able to overcome this issue. The study leads to three main results: 1) the confirmation of the relationship between the change of the Pd/Pd (II) ratio and the change of the Fluorescence intensity 2) the investigation of the deactivation mechanism 3) the identification of the relevant species leading to the electrodissolution of Pd under operative conditions.

These solvents have a much larger electrochemical window than water that expands the potential of electrodeposition. However. mass transport in Ionic Liquids is slow. The slow mass transport dramatically affects the rate of reactions at the solid–liquid interface. hampering the exploitation of Ionic Liquids in high-throughput electrodeposition processes.

Among all the renewables. photovoltaic energy (PV) is one of the most researched technology. because of the availability of its primary energy source (the sun) and the possibility of a direct conversion of solar energy into electric energy. However. the growth of a p-n junction involving non-abundant elements (e.g. CIGS). could have an important drawback in its full life cycle assessment when considering the shortage of the elements and the energy required to assemble the device. Electrodeposition is known for its low energy requirements and facile growth of thin-films of semiconducting materials.

The disappearance of the voltammetric peak of redox species in solution is a classical test for the formation of full layers of thiols. Similar studies on semiconductors are still very limited. We used silver surfaces covered by an ultrathin layer of CdS as substrate for self-assembling of n-hexadecanethiol (C 16 SH). and we compared the experimental results with those obtained by using the bare silver surface as substrate. The strong insulating effect of C 16 SH deposited on Ag (III) is shown by the inhibition of the voltammetric peak of Ru (NH 3) 6 3+/2+. On the contrary. the voltammogram obtained on CdS-covered Ag (III) is very similar to that obtained on the bare Ag (III) electrode. thus suggesting that the presence of CdS exerts a contrasting effect on the passivation of the silver electrode. A crucial point of our work is to demonstrate the effective formation of C 16 SH monolayers on Ag (III) covered by CdS. The formation of full layers of C 16 SH was strongly suggested by the inhibition of the stripping peak of Cd from the CdS deposit covered by C 16 SH. The presence of C 16 SH was confirmed by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements as well as by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) analysis.

Reaction-diffusion systems hosted on directed graphs are in particular relevant for their widespread applications. from computer networks to traffic systems. Due to the peculiar spectrum of the discrete Laplacian operator. homogeneous fixed points can turn unstable. on a directed support. because of the topology of the network. a phenomenon which cannot be induced on undirected graphs. A linear analysis can be performed to single out the conditions that underly the instability. The complete characterization of the patterns. which are eventually attained beyond the linear regime of exponential growth. calls instead for a full nonlinear treatment.

To this aim. we developed and combined two mathematical methods that allow us to (i) classify promoters into groups characterized by specific global structural features. and (ii) recover. in full generality. any regular sequence in the different classes of promoters. One of the main findings of this analysis is that H. sapiens promoters can be classified into three main groups. Two of them are distinguished by the prevalence of weak or strong nucleotides and are characterized by short compositionally biased sequences. while the most frequent regular sequences in the third group are strongly correlated with transposons. Taking advantage of the generality of these mathematical procedures. we have compared the promoter database of H. sapiens with those of other species. We have found that the above-mentioned features characterize also the evolutionary content appearing in mammalian promoters. at variance with ancestral species in the phylogenetic tree. that exhibit a definitely lower level of differentiation among promoters.,True,xgUyJ6kAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,9,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085260,7523160393811855067,/scholar?cites=7523160393811855067,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085260,0,0,0

The discovery of small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) in specific motifs of the genetic regulatory network has led to identifying noise buffering as the possible key function they exert in regulation. Recent in vitro and in silico studies have corroborated this hypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is hampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here. using stochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van Kampen's expansion. we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the miRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL). a small module that is widespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes. in order to account for the effects of intermittency in …,True,xgUyJ6kAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844015305636,1536252327548118384,/scholar?cites=1536252327548118384,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844015305636,0,0,0

However. this view is mainly based on analyses in relatively simple laboratory settings. Here we show that a heterotrophic marine bacterium. Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis. can use both strategies simultaneously when multiple possible nutrients are provided in the same growth experiment. The order of nutrient uptake is partially determined by the biomass yield that can be achieved when the same compounds are provided as single carbon sources.

The model accounts for the role played by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A in regulating the oxygen intake. VEGF-A is dynamically controlled by the HIF-1 α concentration. If not degraded. HIF-1 α can bind to the subunit termed HIF-1 β and so experience translocation to the nucleus. to exert its proper transcriptional activity. The delicate balance between these opposing tendencies translates into the emergence of distinct macroscopic behaviors in terms of the associated molecular concentrations that we here trace back to normoxia. hypoxia and death regimes.

Various systems in physics. biology. social sciences and engineering have been successfully modelled as networks of coupled dynamical systems. where the graph links describe pairwise interactions. This is. however. too strong a limitation. as recent studies have revealed that higher-order many-body interactions are present in social groups. ecosystems and in the human brain. and they actually affect the emergent dynamics of all these systems. Here. we introduce a general framework that allows to study coupled dynamical systems accounting for the precise microscopic structure of their interactions at any possible order. We consider the most general ensemble of identical dynamical systems. organized on the nodes of a simplicial complex. and interacting through synchronization-non-invasive coupling function. The simplicial complex can be of any dimension. meaning that it can account. at the same time. for pairwise interactions. three-body interactions and so on. In such a broad context. we show that complete synchronization exists as an invariant solution. and we give the necessary condition for it to be observed as a stable state in terms of a Master Stability Function. This generalizes the existing results valid for pairwise interactions (ie graphs) to the case of complex systems with the most general possible architecture. Moreover. we show how the approach can be simplified for specific. yet frequently occurring. instances. and we verify all our theoretical predictions in synthetic and real-world systems.

Of the most valuable production systems. the Japanese lean production system (LPS) is the best known and studied. but is still not the most widely applied with success outside Japan. The reason for the low level of success of lean production outside its native country is the lack of understanding of the strong interactions which hold between enterprises and business systems. In order to fill this gap in our knowledge. we investigate the systemic interactions according to the viable system view.

Marketing studies have widely focused on the value cocreation concept. but so far. the mechanism through which consumers can be involved in the process of value cocreation through product development had found little space in marketing studies.

1133933,Decoding the xxi century’s marketing shift: An agency theory framework,2016,Gandolfo Dominici and Maurice Yolles,4,Systems,4,35,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Since the beginning of the XXI century. marketing theory has moved through a series of epistemological shifts from modern positivism to postmodern constructivism. This has resulted in a series of changes to the main concepts of “traditional” marketing such as: market. product. customer. and value. These shifts can be better viewed under a social cybernetics approach such as agency theory. This is because there is now a view that the linear concept of value creation needs to give way to the more complex process of value cocreation. where value is created collectively. Agency theory is one approach that is able to shed light on how customers and providers are able to recursively create collective value during interaction in a market. The theoretical framework provided here is able to provide improved understanding of the interactions betfween (and among) customers and providers in the value cocreation process. In this theory. value cocreation is depicted as an interactive process between a set of “living system” agencies (providers and customers) in a given market arena. The framework can be an effective tool for the managers involved in marketing to contribute to providers’ policies by supplying a clearer portrait of the systemic relations involved in the value cocreation dynamics.

1133941,A novel cooperative opportunistic routing scheme for underwater sensor networks,2016,Seyed Mohammad Ghoreyshi and Alireza Shahrabi and Tuleen Boutaleb,16,Sensors,3,297,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Increasing attention has recently been devoted to underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) because of their capabilities in the ocean monitoring and resource discovery. UWSNs are faced with different challenges. the most notable of which is perhaps how to efficiently deliver packets taking into account all of the constraints of the available acoustic communication channel. The opportunistic routing provides a reliable solution with the aid of intermediate nodes’ collaboration to relay a packet toward the destination. In this paper. we propose a new routing protocol. called opportunistic void avoidance routing (OVAR). to address the void problem and also the energy-reliability trade-off in the forwarding set selection. OVAR takes advantage of distributed beaconing. constructs the adjacency graph at each hop and selects a forwarding set that holds the best trade-off between reliability and energy efficiency. The unique features of OVAR in selecting the candidate nodes in the vicinity of each other leads to the resolution of the hidden node problem. OVAR is also able to select the forwarding set in any direction from the sender. which increases its flexibility to bypass any kind of void area with the minimum deviation from the optimal path. The results of our extensive simulation study show that OVAR outperforms other protocols in terms of the packet delivery ratio. energy consumption. end-to-end delay. hop count and traversed distance.

However. it is now demonstrated that they are mutually related problems that must be tackled in an integrated way. Hence. in this paper a new integrated production and distribution planning model for perishable products is formulated. The proposed model considers a supply chain network consisting of a production facility and multiple distribution centers. The facility produces a single perishable product that is storable only for predetermined periods. A homogenous fleet of vehicles is responsible for delivering the product from facility to distribution centers. The decisions to be made are the production quantities. the distribution centers that must be visited. and the quantities to be delivered to them. The objective is to minimize the total cost. where the trip minimization is considered simultaneously. As the proposed formulation is computationally complex. a heuristic method is developed to tackle the problem. In the developed method. the problem is divided into production submodel and distribution submodel. The production submodel is solved using LINGO. and a particle swarm heuristic is developed to tackle distribution submodel.

Electrochemical methods of analysis have become one of the important methods in environmental monitoring. medicine. biotechnology. and industrial process control. 1 The use of bare electrode for such analysis has several limitations. such as lack of reproducibility and electrode fouling. sluggish electron transfer. high overpotential. and low selectivity and sensitivity. 2–4 Therefore. a modification of the electrode surface with suitable electrocatalyst compounds is an important objective in this field. The modification of bare electrodes is less prone to surface fouling and oxide formation compared to bare electrodes. 5 Different substances and methods have been used to modify electrodes. 5–8 Recent research into developing new electrode materials is now focused on conductive polymers and nano-sized metal colloids. 7–12 They behave as an ensemble of closely spaced. but isolated microelectrodes. and act as an electron relay. thus catalyzing the redox reactions.

1134088,A sensitive and selective voltammetric sensor based on multiwall carbon nanotubes decorated with MgCr2O4 for the determination of azithromycin,2013,Ali A Ensafi and Ali R Allafchian and B Rezaei,103,Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces,,468-474,Elsevier,In this report. we synthesized MgCr2O4 nanoparticles and then multiwall carbon nanotubes were decorated with the MgCr2O4 nanoparticles. The characteristics of the new materials were studied with different techniques such as transmission electron microscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. atomic force microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The multiwall carbon nanotubes decorated with MgCr2O4 nanoparticles were used as a new mediator for voltammetric determination of azithromycin. The oxidation peak of azithromycin was appeared at a potential of about 720 mV at a surface of the modified electrode. Differential pulse voltammetry exhibited two wide linear dynamic ranges of 0.25–4.0 and 4.0–10.0 μmol L−1 azithromycin with a detection limit of 0.07 μmol L−1 at pH 7.0. The influence of potential interfering compounds on the selectivity was studied. Finally. the modified …,True,HouJI5MAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC,26,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776512006662,15001037959935180828,/scholar?cites=15001037959935180828,,,0,0,0
1134089,Synthesis and characterization of basil seed mucilage coated Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles as a drug carrier for the controlled delivery of cephalexin,2018,Ali Rayegan and Alireza Allafchian and Ismaeil Abdolhosseini Sarsari and Parviz Kameli,113,International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,,317-328,elsevier,A novel drug delivery system. loaded the drug cephalexin on the basil seed mucilage coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@BSM-CPX) was prepared and characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD). Furier Transform Infrared (FTIR). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM). Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). and Anti-bacterial. and Specific Surface (BET). By comparing the size of the uncoated nanoparticles (12 nm) and the size of the coated magnetite nanoparticles (6 nm). it was found that with the mucilage coating being put on the magnetite nanoparticles. the size of the nanoparticle cores has also decreased. The optimum pH results showed that the higher adsorption capacity occurs when cephalexin is cationic at pH 2.5 because the NH3+ group of cephalexin interacts better with negative functional groups of the basil seed mucilage.
