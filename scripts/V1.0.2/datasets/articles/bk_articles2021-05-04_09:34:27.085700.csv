1286084,On the performance of VSI Shewhart control chart for monitoring the coefficient of variation in the presence of measurement errors,2019,Huu Du Nguyen and Quoc Thong Nguyen and Kim Phuc Tran and Dang Phuc Ho,104,The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology,1,211-243,Springer London,In this paper. we propose a variable sampling interval Shewhart control chart to monitor the coefficient of variation (CV) squared. denoted by VSI SH-γ2. The new model overcomes the ARL-biased (average run length) property of the control chart monitoring the CV in a previous study by designing two one-sided charts rather than one two-sided chart. Moreover. the effect of measurement error on the performance of the VSI SH-γ2 control chart is investigated. The incorrect formula for the distribution of the CV in the presence of measurement error in a former study is fixed. Numerical simulations show that the precision errors and accuracy errors do have negative influences on the VSI SH-γ2 chart. An appropriate strategy based on the obtained results is suggested to reduce these negative effects.,True,z-CXulMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,23,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-019-03352-7,16993879647687712395,/scholar?cites=16993879647687712395,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02005536/file/MS_JAMT.pdf,0,0,0
1286085,Monitoring the ratio of two normal variables using variable sampling interval exponentially weighted moving average control charts,2018,Huu Du Nguyen and Kim Phuc Tran and Cédric Heuchenne,35,Quality and Reliability Engineering International,1,439-460,Wiley Online Library,We investigate in this paper a new type of control chart called VSI EWMA‐RZ by integrating the variable sampling interval feature (VSI) with the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme to monitor the ratio of two normal random variables. Because the distribution of the ratio is skewed. we suggest designing two separated one‐sided charts instead of one two‐sided chart. A new coefficient is introduced allowing us to be free to choose a sampling interval provided that it optimizes the performance of the control chart. We also make a direct comparison between the VSI EWMA‐RZ charts and standard EWMA‐RZ control charts. The numerical simulations show that the proposed charts outperform the standard EWMA charts in detecting process shifts. An application is illustrated for the implementation of the VSI EWMA‐RZ control charts in the food industry.,True,z-CXulMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,17,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qre.2412,16017199694137519843,/scholar?cites=16017199694137519843,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/qre.2412,0,0,0

The measurement errors are supposed to follow a linear covariate error model. The obtained results show that the precision error ratio and the accuracy error have negative impact on the chart performance. Moreover. in order to overcome the difficulty in predetermining a specific value for the process shift size. we suggest to optimize the parameters of the charts according to the random shift size in a given interval. The robustness of the proposed method is studied.

In general. this assumption is not realistic: measurement error always exists in quality control applications and may considerably affect the performance of control charts in detecting the occurrence of an out-of-control condition. In this paper. the effect of measurement error on the statistical performance of Shewhart t and EWMA t control charts is investigated. Several tables are provided to show how the statistical performance of these control charts changes with different sources of the measurement error.

One can find many practical applications in this area. especially in the field of health care. Many machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees. Support Vector Machine. Naive Bayes.

Thus.  monitoring this ratio is an important task that is well worth considering. In this paper. we combine a variable sampling interval (VSI) strategy with a cumulative sum (CUSUM) scheme to create a new type of control chart for purpose of tracking the ratio between two normal variables. The average time to signal (ATS) and the expected average time to signal (EATS) criteria are used to evaluate the performance of the new VSI CUSUM RZ control chart.

This ratio is called the coefficient of variation (CV). A lot of control charts have been designed for monitoring the CV of univariate quantity in the literature. However. the CV control charts for multivariate quantity have not received much attention yet. In this paper. we investigate a variable sampling interval (VSI) Shewhart control chart for monitoring multivariate CV. The time between two consecutive samples is allowed to vary according to the previous value of the multivariate CV. which will help the chart to detect the process shifts faster. The comparison with the fixed sampling interval Shewhart chart is implemented to highlight the advantage of the VSI method.

Computational aspects of maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are investigated. An Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates is suggested to deal with missing data inherent for common-cause failures.

In this paper. we suggest designing two one‐sided Shewhart control charts monitoring this ratio. The numerical results show that the one‐sided charts have more advantages compared with the two‐sided Shewhart chart proposed previously in the literature. Moreover. we investigate the effect of measurement error on the performance of these control charts where the measurement error is supposed to follow a linear covariate error model. The change of model parameters from an in‐control condition to an out‐of‐control is presented without using a strict assumption about the independence of the shift size from measurement errors.

1286096,Smart IoTs based urine measurement system.,2018,Rushan Arshad,,,,148,,Urine Measurement is one of the most important processes for diagnosis in the hospitals nowadays. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is usually diagnosed by taking patient’s urine samples for a specific period of time. It has been suggested that the average Urine Output of a patient depends upon his weight. As we are all aware that currently the means to monitor the major vital signs of the human body in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) or various clinical settings such as Heart Rate. Blood Pressure. Central Pressure etc. is done by the means of a continuous recording of impulses and its digital display. It is utmost necessary to record and continuously monitor a patients’ fluid input. administered mostly by electronic devices (e.g. Syringe infusion pumps). At the same time. it is also important to monitor patients’ fluid outputs. in which. urine volume is one of the major components. Currently. it is obtained intermittently (per hour) from urine meters and urine collection bags. and a visual assessment is made and recorded manually relying heavily on the nurse's capability and skills. Therefore. even after so much technological advancement the measurement of urine output is literally the only critical parameter constantly recorded and monitored non-electronically by the medical staff.

1286105,A Proposal for Intelligent Agents with Episodic Memory,2020,David Murphy and Thomas S Paula and Wagston Staehler and Juliano Vacaro and Gabriel Paz and Guilherme Marques and Bruna Oliveira,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.03182,,,,In the future we can expect that artificial intelligent agents. once deployed. will be required to learn continually from their experience during their operational lifetime. Such agents will also need to communicate with humans and other agents regarding the content of their experience. in the context of passing along their learnings. for the purpose of explaining their actions in specific circumstances or simply to relate more naturally to humans concerning experiences the agent acquires that are not necessarily related to their assigned tasks. We argue that to support these goals. an agent would benefit from an episodic memory; that is. a memory that encodes the agent's experience in such a way that the agent can relive the experience. communicate about it and use its past experience. inclusive of the agents own past actions. to learn more effective models and policies. In this short paper. we propose one potential approach to provide an AI agent with such capabilities. We draw upon the ever-growing body of work examining the function and operation of the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) in mammals to guide us in adding an episodic memory capability to an AI agent composed of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Based on that. we highlight important aspects to be considered in the memory organization and we propose an architecture combining ANNs and standard Computer Science techniques for supporting storage and retrieval of episodic memories.

Dada uma imagem arbitrária ou um frame arbitrário. o objetivo do reconhecimento facial é determinar se existem faces na imagem e. se existirem. obter a localização e a extensão de cada face encontrada. Tal detecção é facilmente feita por seres humanos. porém continua sendo um desafio em Visão Computacional. O alto grau de variabilidade e a dinamicidade da face humana tornam-a difícil de detectar. principalmente em ambientes complexos. Recentementemente. abordagens de Aprendizado Profundo começaram a ser utilizadas em tarefas de Visão Computacional com bons resultados. Tais resultados abriram novas possibilidades de pesquisa em diferentes aplicações. incluindo Reconhecimento Facial. Embora abordagens de Aprendizado Profundo tenham sido aplicadas com sucesso para tal tarefa. a maior parte das implementações estado da arte utilizam detectores faciais off-the-shelf e não avaliam as diferenças entre eles. Em outros casos. os detectores faciais são treinados para múltiplas tarefas. como detecção de pontos fiduciais. detecção de idade. entre outros. Portanto. nós temos três principais objetivos.

Manual observation of different stages of the crop is a difficult and challenging task as the height and density of the crop increases day by day. To reduce human efforts. researchers have used computer vision approach to detect and count the number of tassels in the images captured from the static camera. To reduce human efforts. computer vision based approaches are proposed wherein [1]-[2]. color. shape. and texture based features used while in [3]. convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach used for tassel detection and counting in images from a static camera.

In this paper. a framework is proposed to detect and count tassel at different stages using UAV as it is hard to collect data from a static camera in large fields. UAVs have the potential to provide a feasible solution for the large scale and high throughput phenotyping. The processing techniques of static images will be incompatible for images acquired via UAV due to the difference in spatial resolution. variation in background and moment of UAV.

Unlike previous image-based methods which focus on RGB feature extracted from 2D images. our method solves this problem in the reconstructed 3D space in order to exploit 3D contexts explicitly. To this end. we first leverage a stand-alone module to transform the input data from 2D image plane to 3D point clouds space for a better input representation. then we perform the 3D detection using PointNet backbone net to obtain objects' 3D locations. dimensions and orientations. To enhance the discriminative capability of point clouds. we propose a multi-modal feature fusion module to embed the complementary RGB cue into the generated point clouds representation. We argue that it is more effective to infer the 3D bounding boxes from the generated 3D scene space (ie. X. Y. Z space) compared to the image plane (ie. R. G. B image plane).

In this work. by intensive diagnosis experiments. we quantify the impact introduced by each sub-task and found thelocalization error'is the vital factor in restricting monocular 3D detection. Besides. we also investigate the underlying reasons behind localization errors. analyze the issues they might bring. and propose three strategies. First. we revisit the misalignment between the center of the 2D bounding box and the projected center of the 3D object. which is a vital factor leading to low localization accuracy. Second. we observe that accurately localizing distant objects with existing technologies is almost impossible. while those samples will mislead the learned network. To this end. we propose to remove such samples from the training set for improving the overall performance of the detector.

Among data augmentation methods. regional dropout or replacement strategies such as [3]. [4]. [5] have been proved effective in recognition and localization performance. However. such methods suffer from unintended content corruption like informative pixel loss. For example. cutting and pasting a random patch may consist of areas that are not important and even if a new cutout patch consists of informative pixels. it could be pasted at useful locations of input covering the interest of the object. Therefore. this operation can cause too much or meaningless regularization. Motivated by this. we propose a new data augmentation method strategy. called FocusMix. which exploits informative pixels based on proper sampling techniques.

Some work investigated context-dependent word token embeddings motivated by word sense disambiguation. using sequential context and large lexical resources.

1286163,From lexical towards contextualized meaning representation,2019,Diana-Nicoleta Popa,,,,,,Continuous word representations (word type embeddings) are at the basis of most modern natural language processing systems. providing competitive results particularly when input to deep learning models.  However. important questions are raised concerning the challenges they face in dealing with the complex natural language phenomena and regarding their ability to capture natural language variability.To better handle complex language phenomena. much work investigated fine-tuning the generic word type embeddings or creating specialized embeddings that satisfy particular linguistic constraints. While this can help distinguish semantic similarity from other types of semantic relatedness. it may not suffice to model certain types of relations between texts such as the logical relations of entailment or contradiction.The first part of the thesis investigates encoding the notion of entailment within a vector space by enforcing information inclusion. using an approximation to logical entailment of binary vectors. We further develop entailment operators and show how the proposed framework can be used to reinterpret an existing distributional semantic model. Evaluations are provided on hyponymy detection as an instance of lexical entailment.Another challenge concerns the variability of natural language and the necessity to disambiguate the meaning of lexical units depending on the context they appear in.  For this. generic word type embeddings fall short of being successful by themselves. with different architectures being typically employed on top to help the disambiguation.

Accurate detection of copy number alterations is necessary for discovering cancer-causing genes. Whole-exome sequencing has become a widely used technology in the last decade for detecting various types of genomic aberrations in cancer genomes. However. there are several major issues encountered in these detection problems. including normal cell contamination. tumor aneuploidy. and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Especially. deciphering the intra-tumor heterogeneity is imperative for identifying clonal and subclonal copy number alterations. We introduce CloneCNA. a novel bioinformatics tool for efficiently addressing these issues and automatically detecting clonal and subclonal somatic copy number alterations from heterogeneous tumor samples.

These aberrations are continuously accumulated during the procedure of clonal evolution and patterned by phylogenetic branching. This invariably results in the emergence of multiple cell populations with distinct complement of mutational landscapes in tumor sample. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology. inference of subclonal populations has become one of the focused interests in cancer-associated studies. and is usually based on the assessment of combinations of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNV). CNA and LOH. However. cancer samples often have several inherent issues. such as contamination of normal stroma. tumor aneuploidy and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Addressing these critical issues is imperative for accurate profiling of clonal architecture. We present CLImAT-HET. a computational method designed for capturing clonal diversity in the CNA/LOH dimensions by taking into account the intra-tumor heterogeneity issue. in the case where a reference or matched normal sample is absent. The algorithm quantitatively represents the clonal identification problem using a factorial hidden Markov model. and takes an integrated analysis of read counts and allele frequency data. It is able to infer subclonal CNA and LOH events as well as the fraction of cells harboring each event.

Instead of making access to limited training samples which likely leads to sub-optima. our SADAL seeks sets of unobserved and plausible hard-examples based on existing training samples. which typically reinforces the discriminativeness of the learned feature descriptor for ages. Motivated by the fact that age labels are usually correlated in the real-world applications. we carefully develop a similarity-aware function in our approach. which dynamically measures each face pair with different weights based on different age value gaps. During the learning process. we jointly optimize both procedures of generating hard-examples and learning age estimator via a sequence of adversarial-game iterations.

Unlike existing fully supervised methods which rely on numerous annotations by hand. our learner exploits large scale unlabeled videos plus available labeled data to generate auxiliary plausible training annotations. Motivated by the fact that neighbouring facial landmarks are usually correlated and coherent across consecutive frames. our approach automatically reasons about discriminative spatial-temporal relationships among landmarks for stable face tracking. Specifically. we carefully develop an interpretable and efficient network module. which disentangles facial geometry relationship for every static frame and simultaneously enforces the bi-directional cycle-consistency across adjacent frames. thus allowing the modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal relations from raw face sequences.

Analgesics are widely used in the treat of arthritis. which may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 20% to 50% overall.There are few studies on the side effects of OA medication. especially the risk prediction models on side effects of analgesics. In addition. most prediction models do not provide clinically useful interpretable rules to explain the reasoning process behind their predictions. In order to assist OA patients. we use the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method to balance the accuracy and interpretability of the prediction model. In this study we used the XGBoost model as a classifier. which is a supervised machine learning method and can predict side effects of analgesics for OA patients and identify high-risk features (RFs) of cardiovascular diseases caused by analgesics. The Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). which were derived from public knee OA studies. were used to train the model. The performance of the XGBoost model is superior to four well-known machine learning algorithms and identifies the risk features from the biomedical literature. In addition the model can provide decision support for using analgesics in OA patients.

This study is aiming to explore the multimodality in a multi-temporal set-up for a better understanding of the collaborative sensor wide information completion; we propose a pairwise learning approach consisting on a pseudo-Siamese network architecture based on two partly uncoupled parallel network streams. Each stream represents itself a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that encodes the input patches. The overall Change Detector (CD) model includes a fusion stage that concatenates the two encodings in a single multimodal feature representation which is then reduced to a lower dimension using fully connected layers and finally a loss function based on the binary cross entropy is used as a decision layer. The proposed pseudo-Siamese pairwise learning architecture allows to the CD model to capture the spatial and the temporal dependencies between multimodal input image pairs. The model processes the two multimodal input patches at one-time under different spatial resolutions. The evaluation performances on different real multimodal datasets reflecting a mixture of CD conditions with different spatial resolutions. confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CD architecture.,True,RzoGVhkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Redha_Touati/publication/340037962_Partly_Uncoupled_Siamese_Model_for_Change_Detection_from_HeterogeneousRemote_Sensing_Imagery/links/5ee6cfe092851ce9e7e3b21d/Partly-Uncoupled-Siamese-Model-for-Change-Detection-from-HeterogeneousRemote-Sensing-Imagery.pdf,15426069496500718414,/scholar?cites=15426069496500718414,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Redha_Touati/publication/340037962_Partly_Uncoupled_Siamese_Model_for_Change_Detection_from_HeterogeneousRemote_Sensing_Imagery/links/5ee6cfe092851ce9e7e3b21d/Partly-Uncoupled-Siamese-Model-for-Change-Detection-from-HeterogeneousRemote-Sensing-Imagery.pdf,0,0,0

1286197,Paraphrasing complex network: Network compression via factor transfer,2018,Jangho Kim and SeoungUK Park and Nojun Kwak,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.04977,,,,Deep neural networks (DNN) have recently shown promising performances in various areas. Although DNNs are very powerful. a large number of network parameters requires substantial storage and memory bandwidth which hinders them from being applied to actual embedded systems. Many researchers have sought ways of model compression to reduce the size of a network with minimal performance degradation. Among them. a method called knowledge transfer is to train the student network with a stronger teacher network. In this paper. we propose a method to overcome the limitations of conventional knowledge transfer methods and improve the performance of a student network. An auto-encoder is used in an unsupervised manner to extract compact factors which are defined as compressed feature maps of the teacher network. When using the factors to train the student network. we observed that the performance of the student network becomes better than the ones with other conventional knowledge transfer methods because factors contain paraphrased compact information of the teacher network that is easy for the student network to understand.,True,R5Q2b2UAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,100,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04977,2520473274058783123,/scholar?cites=2520473274058783123,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04977,0,0,0

However. previous online knowledge distillation methods only utilize the class probabilities. Thus in this paper. we propose an online knowledge distillation method that transfers not only the knowledge of the class probabilities but also that of the feature map using the adversarial training framework. We train multiple networks simultaneously by employing discriminators to distinguish the feature map distributions of different networks. Each network has its corresponding discriminator which discriminates the feature map from its own as fake while classifying that of the other network as real. By training a network to fool the corresponding discriminator. it can learn the other network’s feature map distribution. We show that our method performs better than the conventional direct alignment method such as L1 and is more suitable for online distillation. Also. we propose a novel cyclic learning scheme for training more than two networks together. We have applied our method to various network architectures on the classification task and discovered a significant improvement of performance especially in the case of training a pair of a small network and a large one.,True,R5Q2b2UAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,14,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chung20a.html,16816599832360988251,/scholar?cites=16816599832360988251,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chung20a/chung20a.pdf,0,0,0

It can use either a teacher with high capacity or an ensemble of multiple teachers. However. the latter is not convenient when one wants to use feature-map-based distillation methods.

Among the feature-map-level distillation methods. using several non-linear transformations in parallel for transferring the knowledge of the multiple teachers helps the student find more generalized solutions. We name this method as parallel FEED. and experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our method has clear performance enhancements. without introducing any additional parameters or computations at test time.

However. the identification of UAVs is difficult due to their characteristics such as low altitude. slow speed. and small radar cross-section (LSS). With the existing deterministic approach. the algorithm becomes complex and requires a large number of computations. making it unsuitable for real-time systems. Hence. effective alternatives enabling real-time identification of these new threats are needed. Deep learning-based classification models learn features from data by themselves and have shown outstanding performance in computer vision tasks. In this paper. we propose a deep learning-based classification model that learns the micro-Doppler signatures (MDS) of targets represented on radar spectrogram images. To enable this. first. we recorded five LSS targets (three types of UAVs and two different types of human activities) with a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar in various scenarios. Then. we converted signals into spectrograms in the form of images by Short time Fourier transform (STFT). After the data refinement and augmentation. we made our own radar spectrogram dataset. Secondly. we analyzed characteristics of the radar spectrogram dataset with the ResNet-18 model and designed the ResNet-SP model with less computation. higher accuracy and stability based on the ResNet-18 model.

CT images can be used to assist in the detection and diagnosis of lesions and to facilitate follow-up treatment. However. CT images are vulnerable to noise. Actually. there are two major source intrinsically causing the CT data noise. i.e.. the X-ray photo statistics and the electronic noise background. Therefore. it is necessary to doing image quality assessment (IQA) in CT imaging before diagnosis and treatment. Most of existing CT images IQA methods are based on human observer study. However. these methods are impractical in clinical for their complex and time-consuming. In this paper. we presented a blind CT image quality assessment via deep learning strategy.

With the low radiation dose in data acquiring during the scans. the image quality will degrade due to the excessive quantum noise if there is no adequate noise treatment in processing the data for image reconstruction. For conventional low-dose CT (LdCT) reconstruction. much effort has been spend on the preservation of edges while removing the noise. and not enough attention is paid to texture preserving. However. the image textures are usually recognized as imaging biomarker and play an important role for the tasks. such as lung cancer and nodule detections.

To find the sparse representation of a vector wrt a dictionary. an ℓ 1 minimization problem. which is convex. is usually solved in order to overcome the computational difficulty. However. to guarantee that the ℓ 1 minimizer is close to the sparsest solution. strong incoherence conditions should be imposed. In comparison. nonconvex minimization problems such as those with the ℓ p (0< p< 1) penalties require much weaker incoherence conditions and smaller signal to noise ratio to guarantee a successful recovery. Hence the ℓ p (0< p< 1) regularization serves as a better alternative to the popular ℓ 1 one. In this paper. we review some typical algorithms. Iteratively Reweighted ℓ 1 minimization (IRL1).

In this approach. the encoder is given a NL question and one individual column. which perfectly aligns with the original tasks BERT/RoBERTa is trained on. and hence we avoid any ad-hoc pooling or additional encoding layers which are necessary in prior approaches.

During the last few decades. the research community has proposed a large number of techniques for describing. retrieving and classifying texture images. Local Binary Patterns (LBP) coding is a state-of-the-art technique characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Due to its success. several LBP-variants are proposed in recent literature. In this paper we show that the performance of LBP-based methods can be further improved by introducing a simple modification to the feature extraction process. We suggest building two different LBP histograms one for edge pixels and the second for non-edge pixels. The final feature vector is a weighted combination of the two histograms. This idea is mainly inspired by the results of several research works on vision indicating that when looking at objects. human attention focuses more on salient regions (where changes in intensity. color. etc. occur). The experiments that have been conducted on Brodatz and Outex databases show that implementing this modification on LBP-based techniques (LBP.

This study describes a hybrid region-based active contours technique that uses global means to define the global fitting energy and local means and variances to define the local fitting energy. The optimisation of the functional is performed by applying a sweeping-principle algorithm. which avoids solving any partial differential equation and removes the need for any stability conditions. Furthermore. sweeping-principle algorithm is not based on the computation of derivatives. which allows using a binary level set function during the minimisation process instead of the signed distance function. consequently this removes the need for the distance regularisation term. avoiding its subtle side effects and speeding up the optimisation process.

However. extract a meaningful image feature is a complicated and time-consuming task. This makes fine tuning of the overall performance of traditional CAD more difficult. Currently. the deep learning was considered the most advanced technology in image classification. The main benefit of deep learning is decreasing the feature selection and classification burden of generating a transformation function set and feature of the image from the data directly. We bring up a modified deep learning algorithm in classifying the benign and malignant patients in breast ultrasound image.Methods: There are 150 benign breast tumor patients and 120 malignant patients were enrolled from January 1. 2017 to December 31. 2018.

The region of the lesion is usually manually created by the physician according to their clinical experience; therefore. contouring tumors on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is difficult and time-consuming. For this purpose. an automatic contouring method for breast tumors was developed for less burden in the analysis and to decrease the observed bias to help in making decisions clinically. In this study. a multiview segmentation method for detecting and contouring breast tumors in MRI was represented.

However. the lack of high frame rate test content has previously restricted the scope of research in this area-especially in the context of immersive video formats. This problem has been addressed through the publication of a high frame rate video database BVI-HFR. which was captured natively at 120 fps.

Building footprint is one of the most important attributes for risk modeling. This often consumes a significant amount of time and money when developed manually. Image processing techniques such as segmentation and pattern recognition can be used to extract footprint information from satellite images automatically and quickly. This paper highlights the importance of using a modified framework with segmentation and pattern recognition algorithms to automatically extract building footprints from high resolution satellite images. The modified framework uses a watershed algorithm followed by a pattern recognition method using the moment invariant algorithm. The modified moment invariant algorithm not only computes moments which are invariant to translation. rotation. and uniform scaling but also works in non uniform scaling conditions. The region-based pattern recognition descriptors such as circularity. triangularity. and rectangularity are used to identify building patterns. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on Quick Bird images of Orange and Santa Clara counties in the state of California. USA.

In the case of floods. precise information about the flood extent is essential to identify damage. and estimate overall losses. Furthermore. understanding the historical extent of floods enables us to reconstruct and validate the results from catastrophe models. In this case study. we are proposing a semi-automated approach to extract high resolution flood extents by using the medium resolution Landsat-5 images and high resolution NearMap aerial images. The high resolution images are used to generate the flood extent along with filtering the extra pixels that are classified in flood extents (due to the use of aerial images). This method is implemented in two phases. In the first phase. the medium resolution images of Landsat-5 are used to develop flood extent and its buffer. In the second phase. NearMap aerial images are used to develop high resolution flood extents. The results from phase one are used to fine-tune high resolution flood extents developed in the second phase and filter out classification errors.

This demands operation of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) in an ungated continuous mode. A gating grid can not be used to prevent ions drifting back into the drift volume. Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) offer intrinsic suppression of the ion backflow. To keep distortions due to space-charge at a manageable level an ion yield of 10 to 20 back drifting ions per incoming electron is required.

Motion classification based on pattern recognition with a multi-electrode array allows multiple joints to be controlled simultaneously. Previous pattern recognition studies are difficult to compare. because individual research groups use their own data sets. To resolve this shortcoming and to facilitate comparisons. open access data sets were analysed using components of BioPatRec and Netlab pattern recognition models. Performances of the artificial neural networks. linear models. and training program components were compared. Evaluation took place within the BioPatRec environment. a Matlab-based open source platform that provides feature extraction. processing and motion classification algorithms for prosthetic control. The algorithms were applied to myoelectric signals for individual and simultaneous classification of movements. with the aim of finding the best performing algorithm and network model. Evaluation criteria included classification accuracy and training time. Results in both the linear and the artificial neural network models demonstrated that Netlab’s implementation using scaled conjugate training algorithm reached significantly higher accuracies than BioPatRec.  It is concluded that the best movement classification performance would be achieved through integrating Netlab training algorithms in the BioPatRec environment so that future prosthesis training can be shortened and control made more reliable. Netlab was therefore included into the newest release of BioPatRec (v4.0).,True,scrR7e4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,7,https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-016-2232-y,13862214433889180021,/scholar?cites=13862214433889180021,,,https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-016-2232-y,0,0,0

Hence. for high-dimensional data. dimensionality reduction through feature selection (not extraction) is very important. Our objective. here. is not to find an optimal rule base for classification but to select a set of useful features that may solve the classification problem. For this. we present an integrated mechanism for simultaneous extraction of fuzzy rules and selection of useful features. Since the feature selection method is integrated into the rule base formation. our scheme can account for possible subtle nonlinear interaction between features. as well as that between features and the tool. and. consequently. can select a set of useful features for the classification job.

Here we present a novel unsupervised method. called Motif Finder (in short. F-Motif) for identification of phosphorylation motifs. F-Motif uses clustering of sequence information represented by numerical features that exploit the statistical information hidden in some foreground data. Furthermore. these identified motifs are then filtered to find “actual” motifs with statistically significant motif scores.   Results and Discussion We have applied F-Motif to several new and existing data sets and compared its performance with two well known state-of-the-art methods. In almost all cases F-Motif could identify all statistically significant motifs extracted by the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly. in addition to this. F-Motif uncovers several novel motifs. We have demonstrated using clues from the literature that most of these new motifs discovered by F-Motif are indeed novel. We have also found some interesting phenomena. For example. for CK2 kinase. the conserved sites appear only on the right side of S. However. for CDK kinase. the adjacent site on the right of S is conserved with residue P. In addition. three different encoding methods. including a novel position contrast matrix (PCM) and the simplest binary coding. are used and the ability of F-motif to discover motifs remains quite robust with respect to encoding schemes.

However. since there may be high correlation or nonlinear dependence between such good features. we may obtain a comparable performance even when we use only a few of those good features. Thus. a feature selection method should select useful features with controlled redundancy. In this paper. we propose a novel learning method that imposes a penalty on the use of dependent/correlated features during system identification along with feature selection. This feature selection scheme can choose good features. discard indifferent. and derogatory features. and can control the level of redundancy in the set of selected features.

Cham,Massive tourism is becoming a big problem for some cities. such as Barcelona. due to its concentration in some neighborhoods. In this work we gather Instagram data related to Barcelona consisting on images-captions pairs and. using the text as a supervisory signal. we learn relations between images. words and neighborhoods. Our goal is to learn which visual elements appear in photos when people is posting about each neighborhood. We perform a language separate treatment of the data and show that it can be extrapolated to a tourists and locals separate analysis. and that tourism is reflected in Social Media at a neighborhood level. The presented pipeline allows analyzing the differences between the images that tourists and locals associate to the different neighborhoods. The proposed method. which can be extended to other cities or subjects. proves that Instagram data can be used to train multi-modal (image and text) machine learning models that are useful to analyze publications about a city at a neighborhood level.

These richly annotated datasets help the network learn discriminative visual features. Collecting and annotating such datasets requires a tremendous amount of human effort and annotations are limited to popular set of classes. As an alternative. learning visual features by designing auxiliary tasks which make use of freely available self-supervision has become increasingly popular in the computer vision community.In this paper. we put forward an idea to take advantage of multi-modal context to provide self-supervision for the training of computer vision algorithms. We show that adequate visual features can be learned efficiently by training a CNN to predict the semantic textual context in which a particular image is more probable to appear as an illustration.

Recent works assume that images descriptors can be disentangled into a domain-invariant content representation and a domain-specific style representation. Thus. translation models seek to preserve the content of source images while changing the style to a target visual domain. However. synthesizing new images is extremely challenging especially in multi-domain translations. as the network has to compose content and style to generate reliable and diverse images in multiple domains.

We propose a method that works in three stages. First. the ExtraTrees classifier is used to select relevant features for each type of attack individually for each (ELM). Then. an ensemble of ELMs is used to detect each type of attack separately. Finally. the results of all ELMs are combined using a softmax layer to refine the results and increase the accuracy further. The intuition behind our system is that multi-class classification is quite difficult compared to binary classification. So. we divide the multi-class problem into multiple binary classifications. We test our method on the UNSW and KDDcup99 datasets. The results clearly show that our proposed method is able to outperform all the other methods. with a high margin. Our system is able to achieve 98.24% and 99.76% accuracy for multi-class classification on the UNSW and KDDcup99 datasets. respectively.

The method that we propose is based on the implicit stochastic optimization (ISO) framework. using direct policy search methods combined with deep neural networks (DNN). The findings from a real-world two-reservoir hydropower system in southern Norway suggest that DNNs can learn how to map input (price. inflow. starting reservoir levels) to the optimal production pattern directly. Due to the speed of evaluating the DNN. this approach is from an operational standpoint computationally inexpensive and may potentially address the long-standing problem of high dimensionality in hydropower optimization. Further on. our method may be used as an input for decision-theoretic planning. suggesting the policy that will give the highest expected profit.

Cham,In this paper. we propose a hybrid model consisting of a Deep Convolutional feature extractor followed by a fast and accurate classifier. the Extreme Learning Machine. for the purpose of fire detection in images. The reason behind using such a model is that Deep CNNs used for image classification take a very long time to train. Even with pre-trained models. the fully connected layers need to be trained with backpropagation. which can be very slow. In contrast. we propose to employ the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as the final classifier trained on pre-trained Deep CNN feature extractor. We apply this hybrid model on the problem of fire detection in images. We use state of the art Deep CNNs: VGG16 and Resnet50 and replace the softmax classifier with the ELM classifier.

A single ELM classifier can however generate faulty or skewed results due to random initialization of weights between input and hidden layer. To overcome this instability problem ensemble methods can be employed. Ensemble methods may have problem of redundancy i.e. ensemble may contain several redundant classifiers which can be weak or highly correlated classifiers. Ensemble pruning can be used to remove these redundant classifiers. The pruned ensemble should not only be accurate but diverse as well in order to correctly classify boundary instances.

After splitting. a meta-heuristic technique is used to optimize the actions. and the dataset is split again until a split contains only one instance (timestep). The unique values to be optimized during each iteration is equal to the number of splits which makes it very fast and requires fewer computations.

We assume that FRBs are extra-Galactic events coming from distances d ≲ 100 Mpc and that most of the dispersion measure (DM) comes from the material in the freshly ejected SNR shell. We then predict that for a given burst the DM should decrease with time and that FRBs are not expected to be seen below ∼300 MHz due to free–free absorption in the expanding ejecta. A supernova might have been detected years before the burst; FRBs are mostly associated with star-forming galaxies.

In this paper. we first propose a time-frequency cepstral (TFC) feature vector. which is obtained by performing a temporal discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the cepstrum matrix and selecting the transformed elements in a zigzag scan order. Beyond this. we increase discriminability through a heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA) on the full cepstrum matrix. By utilizing block diagonal matrix constraints. the large HLDA problem is then reduced to several smaller HLDA problems. creating a block diagonal HLDA …,True,eHjg60kAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,23,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5444973/,7790920401379517162,/scholar?cites=7790920401379517162,,,https://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&context=electric_fac,0,0,0

One is to use the language model scores of phone sequences to do SVM training. The other is to use the n-gram probabilities of those phones to train SVM models. For the second approach. we propose a new effective normalization method. In the experiments of 30 s test for 5 languages. our new normalization method shows a relative reduction of 15.8% in terms of equal error rate (EER) compared with the traditional one.

1286342,Modeling Multi-speaker Latent Space to Improve Neural TTS: Quick Enrolling New Speaker and Enhancing Premium Voice,2018,Yan Deng and Lei He and Frank Soong,,,,,,Neural TTS has shown it can generate high quality synthesized speech. In this paper. we investigate the multi-speaker latent space to improve neural TTS for adapting the system to new speakers with only several minutes of speech or enhancing a premium voice by utilizing the data from other speakers for richer contextual coverage and better generalization. A multi-speaker neural TTS model is built with the embedded speaker information in both spectral and speaker latent space. The experimental results show that. with less than 5 minutes of training data from a new speaker. the new model can achieve an MOS score of 4.16 in naturalness and 4.64 in speaker similarity close to human recordings (4.74). For a well-trained premium voice. we can achieve an MOS score of 4.5 for out-of-domain texts. which is comparable to an MOS of 4.58 for professional recordings. and significantly outperforms single speaker result of 4.28.,True,eHjg60kAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,13,https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05253,4041036954107472116,/scholar?cites=4041036954107472116,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05253,0,0,0

This article demonstrates a novel architecture for embedding phone based language recognition into a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder by sharing the same decoding process but generating separate lattices. To compensate for the prior bias introduced by the pronunciation dictionary and the language model of the LVCSR decoder. three different phone lattice reconstruction algorithms are proposed. The underlying goals of these algorithms are to override pronunciation and grammar restrictions to provide richer phonetic information. All of the new algorithms incorporate a vector space modeling backend for improved LRE accuracy. Evaluated on a Mandarin/English detection task. the proposed integrated LVCSR-LRE system using frame-expanded N-best phone lattice achieves comparable performance to a state-of-the-art phone recognition-vector space modeling (PRVSM) system. but with an added computational cost three times lower than that of a separate PRVSM system.,True,eHjg60kAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://asmp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-4722-2012-15,46300685230669061,/scholar?cites=46300685230669061,,,https://asmp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-4722-2012-15,0,0,0

To improve the performance of the recognizers. this paper investigates the use of new acoustic features and discriminative training techniques for phone recognizers. The commonly used features are static ceptral coefficients appended with their first and second order deltas. This configuration may be not optimal for phone recognition in phonotactic language recognition systems. In this paper. a time-frequency cepstral (TFC) feature is proposed based on our previous work in acoustic language recognition systems. The feature is extracted as follows: first a temporal discrete cosine transform (DCT) is carried out on the cepstrum matrix. and then select the transformed elements in a specific area using the variance maximization criterion. Different parameters are tested to obtain the optimal configuration. Also. we adopt the feature minimum phone error (fMPE) method for discriminative training of phone models to obtain better phone recognition results for further improvement.

Information and Communication Engineers,One typical phonotactic system for language recognition is parallel phone recognition followed by vector space modeling (PPRVSM). In this system. various phone recognizers are applied in parallel and fused at the score level. Each phone recognizer is trained for a known language. which is assumed to extract complementary information for effective fusion. But this method is limited by the large amount of training samples for which word or phone level transcription is required. Also. score fusion is not the optimal method as fusion at the feature or model level will retain more information than at the score level. This paper presents a new strategy to build and fuse parallel phone recognizers (PPR). This is achieved by training multiple acoustic diversified phone recognizers and fusing at the feature level.
