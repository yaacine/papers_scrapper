Autophagy activation and the development of hypoxic regions within the tumors are known to promote cancer cell resistance. Therefore. we sought to evaluate the role of autophagy and hypoxia on the taxol-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results showed that taxol induced apoptosis after 16 h of incubation. and that hypoxia protected MDA-MB-231 cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. In parallel. taxol induced autophagy activation already after 2 h of incubation both under normoxia and hypoxia. Autophagy activation after taxol exposure was shown to be a protective mechanism against taxol-induced cell death both under normoxia and hypoxia. However. at longer incubation time. the autophagic process reached a saturation point under normoxia leading to cell death. whereas under …,True,neB0dvMAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,78,https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2013167,3919263229387725226,/scholar?cites=3919263229387725226,,https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2013167,0,0,0

In this work. we studied in details the apoptotic pathways induced in HepG2 cells by t-BHP. DNA fragmentation. activation of caspases and cytochrome c release were demonstrated. Permeability transition pore inhibitors prevented the DNA fragmentation and caspase activation induced by t-BHP. In addition. changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected: hyperpolarization preceded loss of membrane potential. It also preceded caspase activation which occurred before the induction of DNA fragmentation. Taken together. these results emphasize the central role played by mitochondria in the initiation of apoptosis in HepG2 cells exposed to oxidant agents.,True,neB0dvMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,77,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295203007597,7574137320424886455,/scholar?cites=7574137320424886455,,,0,0,0
117733,Hypoxic human umbilical vein endothelial cells induce activation of adherent polymorphonuclear leukocytes,1994,Thierry Arnould and Carine Michiels and José Remacle,83,,12,3705-3716,,Several pieces of evidence are reported for the accumulation of activated neutrophils in ischemic and reperfused tissues leading to the transformation of the ischemic tissue into an inflammatory territory and to an enhancement of tissue damages during reoxygenation. However. the molecular mechanisms responsible for these observations and the precise role played by endothelial cells in this process are still poorly understood. In this study. an in vitro model that mimics this situation was used to investigate the effects of hypoxia-incubated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions. A strong PMN activation characterized by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration as well as by superoxide anion release and leukotriene B4 production was observed when these cells were coincubated with hypoxic HUVEC.

117734,Hypoxia-induced activation of endothelial cells as a possible cause of venous diseases: hypothesis,1993,Carine Michiels and Thierry Arnould and José Remacle,44,Angiology,8,639-646,Sage Publications,Blood stasis in leg veins is a situation commonly linked to the development of venous diseases such as varicoses. Such a stasis will provoke an ischemia. thus decreasing oxygen availability to tissues. Owing to its localization between blood and tissue. endothelium is the first target of this insult. The authors develop here a hypothesis in which the effect of oxygen deprivation on the functional state of the endothelium is the starting point of a cascade of events leading to the disorganization of the vessel wall typical of these pathologies. When venous human endothelial cells obtained from umbilical cords (HUVEC) are exposed to hypoxic conditions they become activated without change in their viability. The synthesis of a proinflammatory molecule (PAF. platelet-activating factor) and the adhesion of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) on HUVEC are markedly increased during hypoxia incubation.

Inc.,Hypoxia is a common denominator of many vascular disorders. especially those associated with ischemia. To study the effect of oxygen depletion on endothelium. we developed an in vitro model of hypoxia on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Hypoxia strongly activates HUVEC. which then synthesize large amounts of prostaglandins and platelet‐activating factor. The first step of this activation is a decrease in ATP content of the cells. followed by an increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) which then activates the phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The link between the decrease in ATP and the increase in [Ca2+]i was not known and is investigated in this work. We first showed that the presence of extracellular Na+ was necessary to observe the hypoxia‐induced increase in [Ca2+]i and the activation of PLA2.

However. the exact mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Moreover. according to the cell lines. hypoxia differently influences cell death. The study of the effects of hypoxia on the apoptosis induced by 5 chemotherapeutic drugs in 7 cancer cell types showed that hypoxia generally inhibited the drug-induced apoptosis. In most cases. the effect of hypoxia was the same for all the drugs in one cell type. The expression profile of 93 genes involved in apoptosis as well as the protein level of BCL-2 family proteins were then investigated. In HepG2 cells that are strongly protected against cell death by hypoxia. hypoxia decreased the abundance of nearly all the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins while none of them are decreased in A549 cells that are not protected against cell death by hypoxia. In HepG2 cells. hypoxia decreased NOXA and BAD abundance and modified the electrophoretic mobility of BIMEL. BIM and NOXA are important mediators of etoposide-induced cell death in HepG2 cells and the hypoxia-induced modification of these proteins abundance or post-translational modifications partly account for chemoresistance. Finally. the modulation of the abundance and/or of the post-translational modifications of most proteins of the BCL-2 family by hypoxia involves p53-dependent and –independent pathways and is cell type-dependent. A better understanding of these cell-to-cell variations is crucial in order to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance and to ameliorate cancer therapy.,True,neB0dvMAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,60,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047519,15882780588535023575,/scholar?cites=15882780588535023575,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047519,0,0,0

The innate immune system. which is the first line of defence against invading pathogens. relies on the recognition of molecular patterns conserved among pathogens. Pathogen associated molecular pattern binding to pattern recognition receptor triggers the activation of several signalling pathways leading to the establishment of a pro-inflammatory state required to control the infection.In addition. pathogens evolved to subvert those responses (with passive and active strategies) allowing their entry and persistence in the host cells and tissues.

Although this process was originally considered a mitochondrial dysfunction. the identification of UCP-1 as an endogenous physiological uncoupling protein suggests that the process could be involved in many other biological processes. In this review. we first compare the mitochondrial uncoupling agents available in term of mechanistic and non-specific effects. Proteins regulating mitochondrial uncoupling. as well as chemical compounds with uncoupling properties are discussed. Second. we summarize the most recent findings linking mitochondrial uncoupling and other cellular or biological processes. such as bulk and specific autophagy. reactive oxygen species production. protein secretion. cell death. physical exercise. metabolic adaptations in adipose tissue. and cell signaling.

Previous studies showed that modified forms of pectin. a complex polysaccharide present in the primary plant cell wall. possess anticancer properties. Nevertheless. the mechanism of action of modified pectin and the pathways involved are unclear. Here. we show that citrus pectin modified by heat treatment induced cell death in HepG2 and A549 cells. The induced cell death differs from classical apoptosis because no DNA cleavage was observed. In addition. Z-VAD-fmk. a pan-caspase inhibitor. did not influence the observed cell death in HepG2 cells but appeared to be partly protective in A549 cells. indicating that heat-modified citrus pectin might induce caspase-independent cell death. An increase in the abundance of the phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated Light Chain 3 (LC3) protein and a decrease in p62 protein abundance were observed in both cell types when incubated in the presence of heat-modified citrus pectin. These results indicate the activation of autophagy. To our knowledge. this is the first time that autophagy has been revealed in cells incubated in the presence of a modified form of pectin. This autophagy activation appears to be protective. at least for A549 cells. because its inhibition with 3-methyladenine increased the observed modified pectin-induced cytotoxicity.

To provide a rational basis for recommended daily allowances (RDA) of dietary phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and menaquinone (vitamin K2) intake that adequately supply extrahepatic (notably vascular) tissue requirements. Background. Vitamin K has a key function in the synthesis of at least two proteins involved in calcium and bone metabolism. namely osteocalcin and matrix Gla-protein (MGP). MGP was shown to be a strong inhibitor of vascular calcification. Present RDA values for vitamin K are based on the hepatic phylloquinone requirement for coagulation factor synthesis.

In experimental animal models as well as humans. VKA have been shown to promote medial elastocalcinosis. As vascular calcification is considered an independent risk factor for plaque instability. we here investigated the effect of VKA on coronary calcification in patients and on calcification of atherosclerotic plaques in the ApoE−/− model of atherosclerosis.   Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 266 patients (133 VKA users and 133 gender and Framingham Risk Score matched non-VKA users) underwent 64-slice MDCT to assess the degree of coronary artery disease (CAD). VKA-users developed significantly more calcified coronary plaques as compared to non-VKA users. ApoE−/− mice (10 weeks) received a Western type diet (WTD) for 12 weeks. after which mice were fed a WTD supplemented with vitamin K1 (VK1. 1.5 mg/g) or vitamin K1 and warfarin (VK1&W; 1.5 mg/g & 3.0 mg/g) for 1 or 4 weeks. after which mice were sacrificed. Warfarin significantly increased frequency and extent of vascular calcification. Also. plaque calcification comprised microcalcification of the intimal layer. Furthermore. warfarin treatment decreased plaque expression of calcification regulatory protein carboxylated matrix Gla-protein. increased apoptosis and. surprisingly outward plaque remodeling. without affecting overall plaque burden.
