1142457,Size-dependent physicochemical and optical properties of silica nanoparticles,2009,IA Rahman and P Vejayakumaran and CS Sipaut and J Ismail and CK Chee,114,Materials Chemistry and Physics,1,328-332,Elsevier,The size-dependent physicochemical and optical properties of silica nanoparticles have been studied. Significant increase in the specific surface area (SSA). concentration of silanol groups (δOH) and apparent density (Da) were observed as the particle size reduced from ∼130 to ∼7 nm. The decrease in the silanol number (αOH) and Si–O–Si bond angle in smaller particle size suggest that the silica structure. especially the surface has been significantly altered at nanoscale. This finding is supported by the presence of defect sites such as E′ centers and oxygen deficient centers (OCD). The stability of E′ centers (UV–vis analysis) increase linearly with the increase in particle size. The increase in the intensity of blue and green bands (PL analysis) with the decrease in the particle size are attributed to the higher silanol concentration and increased in the number of self-trapped exciton (STE)/OCD. respectively.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Several parameters. such as crosslinking agent concentration. blowing agent concentration. and temperature. were varied to evaluate their effects on the structure and mechanical properties of low‐density polyethylene (LDPE) foams. Dicumyl peroxide (DCP) was used as crosslinking agent. while azodicarbonamide (ADC) was utilized as the blowing agent at different levels. The formulations were prepared by using a thermostatically controlled heated two‐roll mill and foamed by using a compression molding technique via a single‐stage foaming process at three foaming temperatures (165. 175. and 185°C). The resultant LDPE foams were characterized and found to have a closed cell structure.

The blowing agent used in this study was sodium bicarbonate. The rubber compositions were expanded and cured using conventional compression moulding technique via heat transfer foaming process. The morphology of EPDM foam was characterized with respect to the cell size. relative foam density and crosslink density. Meanwhile the compressive properties were characterized using compression load-deflection and compression set testing. Increase in foaming temperature resulted in larger cell size. The crosslink densities in EPDM foam were determined using Flory-Rhener equation and results indicated that the crosslink density has slightly decreased with increasing foaming temperature. The relative foam density also showed decreasing when the foaming temperature was increased. For mechanical properties. the highest foam density has resulted in the highest compressive stress. Compression stress at 50% strain decreased with increasing foaming temperature. It was also found that the compression set decreased with increasing foaming temperature.

Substrate promiscuity is a hallmark of P-gp activity. thus a structural description of poly-specific drug-binding is important for the rational design of anticancer drugs and MDR inhibitors. The x-ray structure of apo P-gp at 3.8 angstroms reveals an internal cavity of ∼6000 angstroms cubed with a 30 angstrom separation of the two nucleotide-binding domains. Two additional P-gp structures with cyclic peptide inhibitors demonstrate distinct drug-binding sites in the internal cavity capable of stereoselectivity that is based on hydrophobic and aromatic interactions. Apo and drug-bound P-gp structures have portals open to the cytoplasm and the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer for drug entry.

Here we demonstrate that the growth of graphene on epitaxial iron films can be realized by chemical vapor deposition at relatively low temperatures. and that the formation of carbides can be avoided in excess of the carbon-containing precursors. The resulting graphene monolayer creates a novel periodically corrugated pattern on Fe (110). Using low-energy electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. we show that it is modulated in one dimension forming long waves with a period of∼ 4 nm parallel to the [001] direction of the substrate. with an additional height modulation along the wave crests. The observed topography of the graphene/Fe superstructure is well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. and found to result from a unique combination of the lattice mismatch and strong …,True,eCQD_QsAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,106,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.026101,14849766998007151922,/scholar?cites=14849766998007151922,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:543103,0,0,0

Co forms small nanoparticles in the pores (bonding parts) of the h-BN nanomesh. which start to agglomerate at elevated temperatures without any considerable intercalation. However. even a tiny amount of coadsorbed oxygen reduces cobalt agglomeration and greatly promotes its intercalation and trapping under h-BN.

The nuclear out-of-plane motion inside the NO 3− group has been shown to be observable by resonant Auger spectroscopy as a strongly non-Raman dispersion of individual participator features upon tuning the photon energy across the N 1 s→ 2 a 2 ″(π) and O 1 s→ 2 a 2 ″(π) resonances.

Na4Fe(CN)6. K3Cr(CN)6. K3Mn(CN)6. K3Fe(CN)6. and K3Co(CN)6 have been measured by detecting the total electron yield. The N K spectra of the complexes are very similar and differ only in intensity of the lowest-energy absorption band. The intensity of this feature systematically decreases and its energy position systematically shifts to lower energies along the [Cr(CN)6]3−–[Mn(CN)6]3−–[Fe(CN)6]3− series. In the spectra of [Co(CN)6]3− and [Fe(CN)6]4− this band is lacking. A similar lowest-energy band is also observed in the 3d metal L2.3 absorption spectra of the complexes.

1142558,Bottom Up Synthesis Of Structurally Precise Two-Dimensional Polymers For Organic Photovoltaics,2014,John Colson,,,,,,Polymerization methods that provide linear or branched macromolecules with outstanding functional group tolerance and molecular weight control are well studied. In contrast. polymerization strategies that yield two-dimensional (2D) periodic structures remain in their infancy (Chapter 1). Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are polymer networks that organize molecular building blocks into well-defined porous. layered structures linked by covalent bonds. These materials are usually synthesized as insoluble and unprocessable powders. limiting their utility in applications such as organic optoelectronics. This dissertation describes efforts to overcome the challenges associated with this powder morphology. Initially. COF films were prepared using single-layer graphene (SLG) as a substrate (Chapter 2) and these conditions generalized to a family of 2D COFs with tunable pore size (Chapter 3). Synthetic conditions were developed that provide access to patterned COFs (Chapter 4). COF films that incorporate semiconductors may serve as important precursors for organic optoelectronics. As proof-of-concept. organic photovoltaics fabricated using a variety of COF active-layers were fabricated and characterized (Chapter 5). These results provide a blueprint for incorporating COFs as materials in organic optoelectronic devices. iii,True,tpgdWDUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/38848,,,,https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/38848/jwc244.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The absorption maximum for the encapsulated Reichardt's dye in water was indicative of a relatively high dielectric constant present within the dye/dendrimer complex. 1H NMR of the encapsulated complex showed the presence of aromatic protons from Reichardt's dye along with the aliphatic protons of the dendrimer. Additionally. there were substantial changes in T1 and T2 times of the encapsulated dye when compared with the free dye. and 1H NOESY spectra for the complex showed a significant number of intermolecular NOE cross-peaks.

Although palladium is the best known metal for this purpose. the special properties of its third‐row cousin platinum (strong metal–ligand bonds and slow substitution kinetics) have enabled the development of transformations that are initiated by addition to the CC bonds by protic carbon. nitrogen. oxygen. and phosphorus nucleophiles. as well as alkene or arene nucleophiles. Additionally. reactivity profiles. which are often unique to platinum. provide wholly new reaction products.

This electrochemical DNA sensor exploits electron‐transfer dynamics that alter as a consequence of a large structural rearrangement (hairpin‐to‐duplex) induced by hybridization of the target DNA sequence.

A review of the subject has just recently appeared. 1 Advantages of giant vesicles over the much more intensively investigated “small vesicles” or “large vesicles”(ranging from 200-2000 Å) are multifold:(a) Giant vesicles resemble cell membranes in their curvature. a parameter critical in determining membrane properties. 2 (b) Morphological changes (eg fusion and fission) need not be deduced implicitly; 3 they can be seen directly.(c) Giant vesicles can be manipulated (eg biomolecules can be injected inside them using standard cytological methods4).(d) Giant vesicles lend themselves to certain experiments (eg elucidating rates of wound healing4) that are almost impossible to carry out with submicroscopic vesicles.A question inevitably arises with all vesicle systems. and the giant vesicle …,True,8libjrcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,36,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/la960370u,6556989560433724715,/scholar?cites=6556989560433724715,,,0,0,0

1142584,Supramolecular assemblies with DNA,2005,Philippe Barthélémy and Stephen J Lee and Mark Grinstaff,77,Pure and applied chemistry,12,2133,Blackwell Science; 1999,Information storage in chemical and biological systems involves recognition processes occurring at the molecular and macromolecular level. The implementation of a “code” can consist of multiple noncovalent interactions. which include hydrogen bonds. π-stacking. hydrophobic interactions. and appropriate molecular and supramolecular architectures. With the double-helical DNA structure stabilized by Watson–Crick hydrogen bond base-pairing and aryl π− π stacking interactions. nature provides to scientists an example of one of the most sophisticated supramolecular systems. Molecular organization using these types of processes has become a very powerful strategy for the construction of well-defined nanostructures. Self-assemblies using noncovalent interactions have been designed to build fibers. membranes. two-dimensional monolayers. hydro. organo gels. etc. This paper highlights the research presented at the workshop entitled DNA Supramolecular Assemblies. which was held in Avignon. France on 5–6 May 2004. In this article. we first focus on the recent progress achieved in the design of supramolecular self-assemblies that mimic the molecular recognition functionalities found with nucleic acids. Second. we present several synthetic-DNA supramolecular assemblies currently developed to transport nucleic acids into cells. The marriage of supramolecular chemistry with nucleic acids as illustrated through examples in this article will open new avenues for designing artificial molecular devices and expand the current repertoire of supramolecular assemblies available.,True,8libjrcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,27,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.508.1573&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6451562725178526475,/scholar?cites=6451562725178526475,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.508.1573&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

It is a most remarkable mammal. not only because it lays eggs but also because it is venomous. Rather than delivering venom through a bite. as do snakes and shrews. male platypuses have venomous spurs on each hind leg. The platypus genome sequence provides a unique opportunity to unravel the evolutionary history of many of these interesting features. While searching the platypus genome for the sequences of antimicrobial defensin genes. we identified three Ornithorhynchus venom defensin-like peptide (OvDLP) genes. which produce the major components of platypus venom. We show that gene duplication and subsequent functional diversification of beta-defensins gave rise to these platypus OvDLPs.

1142614,The β-defensin-fold family of polypeptides,2004,Allan M Torres and Philip W Kuchel,44,,6,581-588,Pergamon,Polypeptides adopting a fold very similar to that of β-defensins are found in diverse organisms. including sea anemones. snakes. platypus and humans. These molecules of ∼35–50 amino acid residues possess disparate activities. such as anti-microbial. myonecrotic. analgesic. and ion-channel inhibiting. The family of β-defensin-fold structures generally consists of a short helix or turn followed by a small twisted anti-parallel β-sheet. The six cysteine residues which are paired in a 1–5. 2–4. 3–6 fashion are crucial for determining and maintaining the compact core configuration of the structures. The primary structural similarity between members of the family suggests that the global fold is robust and that the nature of the side-chains determine the functional specificity. The distinct compact fold shared by these polypeptides may be useful in the design of molecules with desired pharmacological activity.,True,ICEl4tcAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,113,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010104003149,5042928869475994368,/scholar?cites=5042928869475994368,,,0,0,0

The aim of the present work was to determine which water population gives rise to the respective features.

The macrocycles. with their backbones rigidified by three-center hydrogen bonds. were found to form in high yields that deviate dramatically from the theoretically allowed value obtained from kinetic simulation of a typical kinetically controlled macrocyclization reaction. The folding of the uncyclized six-residue oligomeric precursors. which belong to a class of backbone-rigidified oligoamides that have been demonstrated by us to adopt well-defined crescent conformations. plays a critical role in the observed high efficiency. Out of two possible mechanisms. one is consistent with experimental results obtained from the coupling of crescent oligoamides of different lengths. which suggests a remote steric effect that discourages the formation of oligomers …,True,RnbUcMkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,117,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja807935y,5627010503042073952,/scholar?cites=5627010503042073952,,,0,0,0

Efforts to create porous molecular structures have led to the establishment of an effective strategy for enforcing the folding of unnatural aromatic oligoamide strands based on an especially robust three-center (bifurcated) hydrogen-bonding interaction. Based on such a strategy. aromatic oligoamides adopting crescent and helical conformations that contain non-collapsible cavities of tunable diameters have been created. Extending the same folding principle to the preparation of aromatic polyamides that would adopt pore-containing helical conformation instead led to the discovery of a highly efficient. one-pot macrocyclization process.

In agreement with the Sheldrick rule. the presence of heavy atoms can also play a nonnegligible role in the success of direct methods. The increased efficiency of the Patterson methods and the advent of new phasing techniques based on extrapolated reflections have changed the state of the art. In particular. it is not clear how much the resolution limit and the structural complexity may be pushed in the presence of heavy atoms. In this paper. it is shown that the limits fixed by the Sheldrick rule may be relaxed if the structure contains heavy atoms and that ab initio techniques can succeed even when the data resolution is about 2 Å. a limit unthinkable a few years ago. The method is successful in solving a structure with 7890 non-H atoms in the asymmetric unit at a resolution of 1.65 Å. a …,True,O6sSdZEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,34,https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ce5037,186707924390938524,/scholar?cites=186707924390938524,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43866101/Caliandro_R._et_al._Ab_initio_phasing_of20160318-6410-r7jc2q.pdf,0,0,0

The method uses the diffraction data of the native and of one isomorphous derivative. The main limitation of the approach was the small number of phased reflections rather than the quality of the assigned phases. In this paper. it is shown that the phasing process can be extended to about 40% of the measured reflections (up to the derivative resolution) without reducing significantly the quality of the new phases.

These membranes. based on polymers of intrinsic microporosity containing Tröger’s base or amidoxime groups. demonstrate that exquisite control over subnanometre pore structure. the introduction of hydrophilic functional groups and thickness control all play important roles in achieving fast ion transport combined with high molecular selectivity …,True,Y5BRXHoAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,34,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-019-0536-8,3888767197911201719,/scholar?cites=3888767197911201719,,https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1616156,0,0,0

In one case we tried to face some long standing problems of the asymmetric aminocatalysis as the activation of encumbered carbonyl compounds and the control of the diastereoisomeric ratio in the diastero- and enantioselective construction of all carbon substituted quaternary stereocenters adjacent a tertiary one. In this section (Challenges) was described the asymmetric aziridination of .-unsaturated ketones. the activation of .-unsaturated -branched aldehydes and the Michael addition of oxindoles to enals and enones. For the activation via iminium ion formation of sterically demanding substrates. as .-unsaturated ketones and .-unsaturated -branched aldehydes. we exploited a chiral primary amine in order to overcome the problem of the iminium ion formation between the catalyst and encumbered carbonylic componds. For the control of diastereoisomeric ratio in the diastero- and enantioselective construction of all carbon substituted quaternary stereocenters adjacent a tertiary one we envisaged that a suitable strategy was the Michael addition to 3 substituted oxindoles to enals activated via LUMO-lowering catalysis. In this synthetic protocol we designed a new bifunctional catalyst with an amine moiety for activate the aldehyde and a tioureidic fragment for direct the approach of the oxindole. This part of the thesis (Challenges) could be considered pure basic research. where the solution of the synthetic problem was the goal itself of the research.  2.

N-hydroxytryptamine. indole-3-acetaldoxime. indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld). IAA. Recently. this pathway has been characterized by the YUCCA genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and their homologs in other species. YUCCA is thought to be responsible for the conversion of tryptamine to N-hydroxytryptamine. Here we complement the genetic findings with a compound-based approach in pea (Pisum sativum). detecting potential precursors by gas chromatography/tandem-mass spectrometry.

The characteristic quinone group can accept electrons from various biological sources and is converted by a one electron transfer to the unstable semiquinone or by a two electron transfer to the more stable hydroquinone. This feature makes CoQ10 the bona fide cellular electron transfer molecule within the mitochondrial respiratory chain and also makes it a potent cellular antioxidant. These activities serve as justification for its popular use as food supplement. Another quinone with similarities to the naturally occurring CoQ10 is idebenone. which shares its quinone moiety with CoQ10. but at the same time differs from CoQ10 by the presence of a much shorter. less lipophilic tail.

1142788,Evidence for a higher oxidation state of manganese in the reaction of dinuclear manganese complexes with oxidants. Comparison with iron based Gif chemistry,1998,Derek HR Barton and Seung-Yong Choi and Bin Hu and Jason A Smith,54,Tetrahedron,14,3367-3378,Pergamon,Binuclear manganese complexes mimic the catalase enzyme by converting hydrogen peroxide rapidly and efficiently to oxygen and water. The complex (1) may be activated by either periodic acid or Oxone® and can oxidize selected organic substrates. Potassium manganate gave similar oxidation products suggesting that the manganese is transformed to a higher oxidation state. Kinetic studies with the MnIV-MnIV complex show an induction period indicating that it is not the active catalyst. Further studies suggested that the actual catalytic species is a MnIII-MnIV complex. These complexes show similar properties to the activation of FeCl3 with hydrogen peroxide. This is particularly evident by the formation of a new and unusual peroxide from ergosterol acetate.,True,-8c8k8wAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,43,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040402098000969,12751009625851523033,/scholar?cites=12751009625851523033,,,0,0,0

In pea (Pisum sativum). the reverse reaction. phenylpyruvate to Phe. is also demonstrated. However. despite similarities between the pathways leading to IAA and PAA. evidence from mutants in pea and maize (Zea mays) indicate that IAA biosynthetic enzymes are not the main enzymes for PAA biosynthesis.

In the case of pyrroles. reductive methods (such as the Birch reduction) have been most widely exploited. while oxidative methods are generally dismissed as too difficult or unpredictable to be useful. However. since the early twentieth century considerable research has been carried out on the controlled oxidation of pyrroles to give highly functionalized products. using a variety of oxidants. This review presents a summary of all work up until the present day in the area of pyrrole oxidation. looking at the use of peroxide. singlet oxygen. hypervalent iodine reagents. a range or organic and inorganic oxidants. and electrochemical approaches.

Inc.,This experiment describes a method for cyclohexene oxidation to trans-1.2-cyclohexanediol using p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH) as promoter and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant in a biphasic system. This method allows conversions up to 97.9% (monitored by 1H NMR). trans-1.2-Cyclohexanediol was not easily separated from the aqueous solution owing to formation of an azeotropic mixture with water. Destruction of the azeotropic mixture was observed in the presence of sodium p-toluenesulfonate salt (p-TsONa). Therefore. water could be removed by simple distillation after p-TsOH neutralization.

Polar organic solvents. such as pyridine. dimethylsulfoxide and dimethyformamide. are the few solvents able to dissolve carbohydrates however they have a higher impact in the environment and provide a less efficient solvent media due to deactivation in biocatalysis. for instance. A way to overcome these problems is to use Ionic Liquids (ILs). Data suggest that ILs can be acceptable solvents for carbohydrate dissolution and that they lead to higher yield and more selective reactions. In this review. we will focus mainly on monosaccharide dissolution and functional transformation. despite some references to polysaccharides. as an attempt to demonstrate ILs can be a suitable media for carbohydrate chemistry.,True,29KNm-gAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,7,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cos/2011/00000008/00000006/art00006,10165398574941453040,/scholar?cites=10165398574941453040,,,0,0,0

In this report we have clearly established a correlation between an observed room temperature ferromagnetism and defects at zinc sites for Mn-doped ZnO (Zn0.93Mn0.03O) samples prepared by the solid state reaction method and subject to post-annealing under reducing atmosphere. Detailed microstructural analysis was carried out to exclude the presence of extrinsic sources of ferromagnetism.

On the basis of the lamivudine saccharinate structure reported in the literature. maleic acid was chosen to synthesize a salt with the anti-HIV drug because of the structural similarities between the salt formers. Maleic acid has an acid-ionization constant of the first proton and an arrangement of their hydrogen bonding functionalities similar to those of saccharin. Likewise. there is a saccharin-like conformational rigidity in maleic acid because of the hydrogen-bonded ring formation and the Z-configuration around the CC double bond.

Thus. motivated by the interest in improving the comprehension of this important issue. it a framework is proposed for explaining the origin of the relaxor state in ordinary ferroelectrics induced via the isovalent-ion substitution.

This results in a gradual transformation of ferroelectric domain patterns from a micrometer polydomain structure (twins). through single domains. to nanometer-polar-“tweed” structures with glasslike behavior. that are. in turn. strongly driven by point defects and surface effects. The electrical interaction between these weakly coupled polar-tweed structures leads to a …,True,YZjIDYsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,29,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.73.054106,666078493452324343,/scholar?cites=666078493452324343,,http://nanotecnologia.com.br/redecmdmc/lab/arquivos_publicacoes/1434_Induction%20of%20relaxor%20state%20in%20ordinary%20ferroelectrics%20by%20isovalent%20ion%20substitution.pdf,0,0,0

The vapour pressure is controlled by sequential computer-driven injection of precise micro amounts of liquid in an evaporator. where flash volatilization occurs. During deposition. the precursors are maintained at room temperature under inert gases in an hermetically closed vessel: even thermally unstable precursors may be used. The results reported here are focused on the OMCVD deposition of Ta 2 O 5. The growth rate increases up to 11µm/h at 650 C (amorphous layers). and decreases above (crystallized layers).

The Raman signature of ferroelectric thin films is complex when used for stress analysis. Raman spectroscopy of a stress-free polydomain PbTiO 3 single crystal reveals that the profile of phonon modes can be significantly modified by the existence of quasimodes. The different potential origins of quasimodes are discussed. and it is emphasized that quasimodes should be taken into account for an accurate estimation of residual stress values in ferroelectric films via Raman scattering. We finally propose and illustrate that the E (3 TO) hard mode is more reliable for the estimation of biaxial residual stress in PbTiO 3 than the commonly used E (1 TO) soft mode.,True,TczDk5wAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC,34,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.104104,16880077493286002233,/scholar?cites=16880077493286002233,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adulfas_Abrutis/publication/235508103_Residual_stress_estimation_in_ferroelectric_PbTiO_3_thin_films_by_Raman_spectroscopy/links/561635e708aed47facf080c5.pdf,0,0,0

These days. the simple fact that chemical synthesis is at the heart of these wondrous achievements is practically shrouded in secrecy. In fact. most of the society equates chemistry with pollution and being part of a problem rather than celebrating the almost magical solutions it continually provides.

Although numerous approaches have been reported over the last several decades. the synthesis of a one monomer unit thick. covalently bonded molecular sheet with a long‐range ordered (periodic) internal structure has yet to be achieved. This Review provides an overview of these approaches and an analysis of how to synthesize 2D polymers. This analysis compares polymerizations in (initially) a homogeneous phase with those at interfaces and considers structural aspects of monomers as well as possibly preferred connection modes. It also addresses issues such as shrinkage as well as domain and crack formation. and briefly touches upon how the …,True,6cJqXB0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,620,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.200801863,1851493792826604120,/scholar?cites=1851493792826604120,,,0,0,0

1142908,Knotting and threading of molecules: chemistry and chirality of molecular knots and their assemblies,2005,Oleg Lukin and Fritz Vögtle,44,,10,1456-1477,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,How and why do molecules tangle or thread? Investigations of molecular knots (knotanes) may shed some light on the mechanisms of (supra)molecular templation and the folding of molecules that result in intertwining. The topological chirality of these fascinating molecules leads to new types of isomerism and paves the way to nanosized molecular motors. Their preparation and derivatization makes high demands on modern synthetic methods and analytical separation since molecular knots are formed in a more or less planned design based on metal coordination or hydrogen‐bonding patterns. This Review describes the development of templation techniques for the synthesis of knotanes and their chiral resolution as well as their selective functionalization and use as building blocks in the synthesis of higher knotane assemblies.

In contrast. the presence of Lewis acids promotes formation of the cycloadducts through a highly diastereoselective process with opposite stereochemistry. Subsequent transformations of the imidazolidines including oxidative. reductive. and hydrolytic processes that provide easy access to vicinal diaminoalcohols have been explored. Among these. reductive cleavage of the aminal with LiAlH4 is an extremely efficient and general reaction for the synthesis of enantiopure N‐sulfinyl‐N′‐benzyldiaminoalcohols.,True,q371VJgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,72,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.200204674,8731686894672874741,/scholar?cites=8731686894672874741,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50507213/chem.20020467420161123-6611-1xdzcas.pdf,0,0,0

This work was based on a reaction found by Smorada and Truce in 1979.[3] which described the reactivity of commercial organolithiums or organoACHTUNGTRENNUNGmagnesium (less reactive) with arylsulfonylacetylenes. to give alkynes through addition followed by elimination of the sulfone group (Scheme1).

Truce describes the synthesis. under very mild conditions. of only seven compounds with the alkyne moiety joined to aryl (phenyl and p-tolyl) and alkyl (nBu and tBu) residues. Despite the potential interest. to our knowledge. other contributions based on this work were never reported. Although this work has been cited only few times in some reviews.[4] this reaction has been considered rather as a scientific curiosity. scarcely used with synthetic [5] or mechanistic [6] purACHTUNGTRENNUNGposes in the 1990s and has been inexplicably forgotten. After considering the scope and limitations of the main alkynylation methods currently used for the construction of the Csp2ÀCsp and Csp3ÀCsp bonds (see below). we realized that the reaction conditions were much milder than those usually required by the current methods.

The utilization of these data allowed for a more complete de-scription of the structure and dynamics of BDOG than had previously been accomplishedfor other glycolipids. The results so obtained are more satisfactory not only because of their ex-actness but because a description of molecular order allows a more explicit physical chemical rationalization of the motional re-striction. The methodology employed to facilitate measurement of the dipolar splittings for BDOG should be readily extendable to more complicated membrane-associated glycoforms. although labeling may be restricted by resolution to only one or two of the sugar rings at a time unless more sophisticated NMR techniques are used.

Association constants K in water with di‐ and tripeptides reach up to 200 M −1. and after protection at the N‐terminus up to 680 M −1. Appreciable binding occurs only in the presence of lipophilic amino acid side‐chains. with preference for this at the C‐terminus. A moderate sequence and side‐chain selectivity is observed with 1. 2 and 3. but less so with the highly charged 4 where ion pairing dominates.

Instead of this direct substitution process. the alternative addition–elimination (AE) pathway is favored energetically. This AE mechanism rationalizes the preferred ortho and para substitution orientation of anisole easily. Moreover. neither the SEAr nor the AE mechanisms involve the formation of a σ-complex (Wheland-type) intermediate in the rate-controlling stage. Contrary to the conventional interpretations. the substitution (SEAr) mechanism proceeds concertedly via a single transition state.

One of these signals proved to be 2-ethyl-5-propylcyclohexan-1.3-dione (chiloglottone1). a new natural product that was shown to be most important in the relations between orchids of the genus Chiloglottis. native to Australia. and corresponding pollinator species. Systematic investigations on the mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern of 2.5-dialkylcyclohexan-1.3-diones identified key ions providing information about the structures of the substituents at positions 2 and 5.

Wie vielfältig die Form der chemischen Informationsübertragung sein kann. zeigt sich insbesondere bei den sozialen Hymenopteren (HÖLLDOBLER & WILSON 1990). Während einige der als Pheromone bezeichneten Substanzen (KARLSON & LÜSCHER 1959) überwiegend im direkten Kontakt oder über sehr kurze Distanzen übertragen werden (z. B.

CuIn3Se5 and CuIn5Se8 have been synthesized in vacuum under different cooling conditions resulting in different phases. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement of the diagrams have been used to characterize the different structures obtained. The two former compounds were refined using two different types of structure: stannite (S.G.: I4̄2m) and the proposed P–chalcopyrite (S.G.: P4̄2c). The determined bond distances after refinements indicate a higher tetragonal distortion for stannite type structure than P–chalcopyrite structure. These results seem to indicate that the Cu–In–Se structure with these two stoichiometries belongs to the P4̄2c S.G.

The most satisfactory convergence was achieved at R p = 0.0666. R wp = 0.0884. R B = 0.0106 and R F = 0.0102. The derived structural parameters at 26.5°C are: a = 0.602348(7). c = 1.193979(2) nm and x(Te) = 0.256(6). The ratio between lattice parameters. η = c/2a = 0.9911 (0). differs from 1.0. indicating a tetragonal distortion. and non-ideal anion displacements. x(Te)≠1/4. is manifested by the existence of bond alternation of Cu-Te and Ga-Te with interatomic distances of 0.262(5) and 0.2578(5) nm. respectively.

Different heating rates were applied during the thermal treatments. The chemical composition and structural properties of the deposited layers as well as the distribution of the elements through the kesterite thin film have been investigated. The initial growth of a SnS secondary phase during evaporation led to the formation of this secondary phase next to the Mo back contact. Solar cell power conversion efficiencies were limited to values about 3% due to this secondary phase.

The nanocrystals of ferrite are coated with a protecting layer of undecanoate which beyond stabilizing the nanoparticles allows their organization on silicon directly reacting with Si–H surface through its vinyl end group. The organic coat was obtained during the synthesis of cobalt ferrite using sodium undecanoate as protective agent. This synthetic strategy avoids the exchange monolayer reaction generally required to bind the NPs on the substrate.

The prevascularization results in the adequate supply of nutrients to transplanted hepatocytes. However. the concurrent tissue ingrowth causes the reduction of potential space for transplanted cells. Here. the rates of tissue ingrowth and vascularity were studied for PLGA scaffolds implanted in the mesentery of Fisher rats for a period of time up to 35 days. The extent of vascularization and decrease of available space for hepatocyte engraftment were related to the PLGA copolymer ratio. degree of crystallinity. porosity. and average pore size.,True,2FcAdwwAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,4,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11362218513394883998&hl=en&oi=scholarr,11362218513394883998,/scholar?cites=11362218513394883998,,,0,0,0

It has been shown that die parameters play an important role in the magnitude and homogeneity of effective strain.

1143145,Identification of bolted-joint interface models,2002,H Ahmadian and M Ebrahimi and JE Mottershead and MI Friswell,4,Proceedings of ISMA,,1741-1747,,A linear dynamic model is developed for bolted joints and interfaces that can be incorporated into existing commercial finite element codes. The joint interface is modelled using a thin layer of solid elements with isotropic material properties. The material properties of the layer are functions of normal and tangential stiffness of the joint interface and are identified using experimentally measured data. It is critical to determine only the simplest model possible which also captures the dominant physics of the joint. The objective is to develop guidelines in designing models for bolted joints under different pre-stress conditions of the interface zone. This work provides insight on how the model should be designed in the joint region.,True,g0MvV9kAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,52,http://michael.friswell.com/PDF_Files/C150.pdf,5536304244010116705,/scholar?cites=5536304244010116705,,http://michael.friswell.com/PDF_Files/C150.pdf,0,0,0

Constrained groove pressing (CGP) process is one of the severe plastic deformation methods to fabricate ultrafine grain sheet materials. In this research. wear behavior of brass sheet subjected to CGP process was investigated. Generally it is shown that CGP process enhances the wear resistance of the material and this behavior is improved by increasing pass number. Also. the effect of initial pass and lower applied normal load on the wear resistance is more profound than subsequent passes and higher applied normal load. respectively. In addition. the influence of normal load is more profound than pass number at the increment of friction force.

The transducer could cyclically cleave fluorescence-quenched probes to yield activated fluorescence signal. while protein binding to the small molecule label would prevent Fok I from approaching and cleaving the fluorescence-quenched probes. Because of the efficient signal amplification from the cyclic cleavage operation. the developed strategy could offer high sensitivity for detecting small molecule–protein interactions.

This study delineates the principal pharmacological features of kurarinol 3 that lead to inhibition of the oxidation of l-tyrosine to melanin by mushroom tyrosinase (IC50 of 100 nM). The inhibition kinetics analyses unveil that compounds 1 and 2 are noncompetitive inhibitors. However similar analysis shows kurarinol 3 to be a competitive inhibitor. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited potent antibacterial activity with 10 μg/disk against Gram-positive bacteria. whereas kurarinol 3 did not ostend any antibacterial activity. Interestingly. kurarinol 3 inhibits production of melanin in S. bikiniensis without affecting the growth of microorganism.

When no CdCl2 is added. the synthesis of multipods has a low reproducibility. and the side nucleation of CdS nanorods is often observed. At a suitable concentration of CdCl2. octapods are formed and they are stable in solution during the synthesis. Our experiments indicate that Cl– ions introduced in the reaction reduce the availability of Cd2+ ions in solution. most likely via formation of strong complexes with both Cd and the various surfactants. This prevents homogeneous nucleation of CdS nanocrystals. so that the heterogeneous nucleation of CdS pods on top of the CdSe seeds is the preferred process.

We report a new route to these nanostructures that exploits the oxidation of Cu2–xSe/Cu2–xS core/shell nanocrystals with various etchants. Even though the Cu2–xSe core is encased in a thick Cu2–xS shell. the initial effect of oxidation is the creation of a void in the core. This is rationalized in terms of diffusion of Cu+ ions and electrons from the core to the shell (and from there to the solution). Differently from the classical Kirkendall effect. which entails an imbalance between in-diffusion and out-diffusion of two different species across an interface. the present mechanism can be considered as a limiting case of such effect and is triggered by the stronger tendency of Cu2–xSe over Cu2–xS toward oxidation and by fast Cu+ diffusion in copper chalcogenides.

Consequently. in the following step of cation exchange. which is performed by directly dipping the substrate in a solution containing the new cations. the regions that have not been exposed to the electron beam are chemically transformed. while the exposed ones remain unchanged.

CW PIA spectra show strong bleaching due to the one-dimensional (1D) CdS pod states (480 nm) and the zero-dimensional (0D) CdSe core states (690 nm). The agreement with previously reported ultrafast pump–probe experiments indicates that this strong bleaching signal may be assigned to state filling.

The short alkyloxy side chain not only affords effective π−π stacking in polar solvents for self-assembling but also provides sufficient solubility in nonpolar solvents for solution processing. As revealed by both AFM and electron microscopies. the nanobelts have an approximately rectangular cross section. with a typical thickness of about 100 nm and a width in the range of 300−500 nm. The length of the nanobelts ranges from 10 to a few tens of micrometers.

Linear free energy relationships for the halogen bond donor ability of substituted iodoperfluoroarenes XC6F4I are described. demonstrating that both substituent constants (σ) and calculated molecular electrostatic potential surfaces are useful for constructing such relationships. An electrostatic model is. however. limited in its ability to provide correlation with a more comprehensive data set in which both halogen bond donor and acceptor abilities are varied: the ability of computationally derived binding energies to accurately model such data is elucidated.

Such studies have provided insight into the interactions employed. and have offered new opportunities to achieve selectivity in anion recognition.

1143299,Palladium‐catalyzed cyclization of 2‐alkynyl‐N‐ethanoyl anilines to indoles: synthesis. structural. spectroscopic. and mechanistic study,2015,Mohammad Mazharol Hoque and Mohammad A Halim and Mohammed G Sarwar and Md Wahab Khan,28,Journal of Physical Organic Chemistry,12,732-742,,This study reports a facial regio‐selective synthesis of 2‐alkyl‐N‐ethanoyl indoles from substituted‐N‐ethanoyl anilines employing palladium (II) chloride. which acts as a cyclization catalyst. The mechanistic trait of palladium‐based cyclization is also explored by employing density functional theory. In a two‐step mechanism. the palladium. which attaches to the ethylene carbons. promotes the proton transfer and cyclization. The gas‐phase barrier height of the first transition state is 37 kcal/mol. indicating the rate‐determining step of this reaction. Incorporating acetonitrile through the solvation model on density solvation model reduces the barrier height to 31 kcal/mol. In the presence of solvent. the electron‐releasing (–CH3) group has a greater influence on the reduction of the barrier height compared with the electron‐withdrawing group (–Cl).

The TiO2 nanotubes. serving as the photocatalyst and the support of the electrocatalyst. were directly grown on both sides of a Ti plate by anodic oxidation. Pt nanoparticles were loaded on one side of TiO2 nanotubes by the photoreduction method. For the COD determination. the bifunctional electrode exhibits a low detection limit (9.5 mg/L). high sensitivity of 3.55×10−3 mA/(mg/L COD) and high Cl− tolerance (1400 mg/L).

However. tailoring the metal-support interfaces to realize full utilization remains a large challenge. In this work. we propose a graceful strategy to maximize the metal-oxide interfaces by coating confined nanoparticles with an ultrathin oxide layer. This is achieved via sequential deposition of ultrathin Al2O3 coats. Pt. and a thick Al2O3 layer on carbon nanocoils templates by atomic layer deposition (ALD). followed by removal of the templates. Compared with the Pt catalysts confined in Al2O3 nanotubes without the ultrathin coats. the ultrathin coated samples have larger Pt-Al2O3 interfaces. The maximized interfaces significantly improve the activity and the protecting Al2O3 nanotubes retain the stability for hydrogenation reactions of 4-nitrophenol. We believe that applying ALD ultrathin coats on confined catalysts is a promising way to achieve enhanced performance for other catalysts.Heterogeneous catalyst systems comprising metals and oxide supports are widely used. The metal oxides not only work as supports to help the dispersion of supported metal nanoparticles. but also affect catalytic performance through interaction with the supported metal nanoparticles. The recognition that important catalysis is localized at the metal-oxide interfaces suggests that the rational design and engineering of metal-oxide interfaces are critical in developing highly efficient catalytic systems.[1] However. in conventional supported metal catalysts. the density of the metal-oxide interfaces is limited because of the small contact areas between the metal and the oxide (Fig. 1a).

Oxygen or nitrogen gas was used as a purging gas. Overall. the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) decreased as the solution pH increased. The removal of Cr(VI) by UV/TiO2 increased by decreasing the solution pH because of the increased potential difference between the conduction band of TiO2 and Cr(VI)/Cr(III) as well as the anionic-type adsorption of Cr(VI) onto the TiO2 surface. The removal efficiency of Cr(VI) increased in purging of nitrogen gas compared to that of oxygen gas because of less competition between dissolved oxygen and Cr(VI) in the reaction with the electron in the conduction band of TiO2.

Here we elucidate the origin of this complex solvent effect using operando solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

1143399,Measurement of the reactive surface area of clay minerals using solid-state NMR studies of a probe molecule,2010,Rebecca L Sanders and Nancy M Washton and Karl T Mueller,114,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,12,5491-5498,American Chemical Society,Understanding the surface reactivity of clay minerals is necessary for accurate prediction of natural weathering rates due to the ubiquity of clays in the environment as weathering products of primary minerals. However. the reactivity of the heterogeneous surfaces of a clay can be difficult to characterize as clay mineral edge sites often react at different rates or via different mechanisms than sites on the basal planes. Ultimately. a method is needed to probe quantitatively the reactive surface sites in order to predict clay mineral dissolution rates. In this study. solid-state NMR spectroscopy has been utilized to investigate surface hydroxyl species and their relation to clay surface reactivity. The surfaces of two kaolinite samples (KGa-1b and KGa-2) and two montmorillonite samples (STx-1b and SWy-2) were reacted with the probe molecule (3.3.3-trifluoropropyl)dimethylchlorosilane (TFS). which binds selectively to reactive …,True,cpLPuwMAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,41,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp906132k,4269084781580641998,/scholar?cites=4269084781580641998,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48089078/jp906132k20160816-29070-xy0uj9.pdf,0,0,0

Due to differences in the reactive species present on the surfaces of these glasses. variations in the rate of acid-mediated dissolution (pH 4) for samples in this suite cannot be explained by variations in geometric or BET-measured surface area.

MIEX® anion exchange resin and two nanofiltration membranes was measured. Whereas treatability of NOM surrogates was explained in terms of their physicochemical properties. the same was not true of DBP formation. Hence it was not possible to selectively remove compounds which generate high amounts of DBPs. Instead. precursor removal strategies based upon empirical DBP formation potential testing are more apt.

The objective of this review was to investigate relationships between the molecular properties of NOM surrogates and DBP formation using data collated for 185 compounds. While formation of THMs correlated strongly with chlorine substitution. no meaningful relationships existed between compound physicochemical properties and DBP formation. Thus non-empirical predictors of DBP formation are unlikely in natural waters. Activated aromatic compounds are well known to be reactive precursors; in addition DBP formation from β-dicarbonyl. amino acid and carbohydrate precursors can be significant.

The work investigated ways of reducing the organic load on water treatment works (WTWs) with a view to treating ‘in-reservoir’ or ‘in-pipe’ before the water reaches the WTW. The efficiency of each process in terms of NOM removal was determined by measuring UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

The extent of fouling due to the different fractions of NOM from surface water has been examined in dead-end ultrafiltration using criteria such as flux decline and irreversibility in regard with organic matter rejection. The most important flux decline was observed during the filtration of the hydrophilic acids fraction whereas fulvic acids led to the most irreversible fouling.

To investigate this further. the water was fractionated using resin adsorption techniques into its hydrophobic (fulvic and humic acid fractions) and hydrophilic (acid and non-acid fractions) components.

1143427,Natural organic matter character and reactivity: assessing seasonal variation in a Moorland water,2003,Emma Harriet Goslan,,,,,Cranfield University,Natural organic matter (NOM) is described as an intricate mixture of organic compounds that occurs universally in ground and surface waters. After treatment for potable use. there is NOM remaining in the water that reacts with the chlorine used for disinfection to form disinfection by-products (DBPs). Some of the DBPs. trihalomethanes (THMs) are regulated. Several water treatment works (WTWs) in the Yorkshire Water and United Utilities (previously North West Water) region in England have recently experienced difficulty in meeting THM limits (100 µg L-1) in their finished drinking water at certain times of the year.  An investigation into how NOM changes seasonally. pragmatic methods of NOM analysis and its reactivity with chlorine was undertaken. By separating the NOM using adsorbent resins into fractions. it was possible to gain an insight into the seasonality of NOM. It was observed that a particular. difficult to remove fraction was always more reactive with respect to THM formation in autumn.  Some of the methods proposed in the literature were used here with varying successes. It was found that High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatographic methods were most useful to the WTW operators for optimising treatment processes.  It is known that the formation of DBPs is very complex. An attempt was made to predict the reactivity of a raw water in terms of THM-FP by looking at the NOM makeup. However. it was found that the fluorescence spectra combined with the fluorescence index of raw water and chlorinated samples gave more insight into the reactivity of the raw water at a particular time than knowing the fraction distribution.

Although. NOMs are considered harmless but they have been recognized disinfection by-products precursors (DBP (s)) during the chlorination process. Formation of DBP (s) highly depends on the composition and concentration of NOM. which can be broadly divided into two fractions of hydrophobic (humic) and hydrophilic (non-humic) substances. The objective of this study was to determine Natural organic matter and its fractions concentration in the surface water sources of Tehran. Water sampling was conducted monthly between May to July 2006 in three rivers Lar. Jajrood and Karaj as the main drinking water supplying sources in Tehran. Quantitative parameters of pH. EC. UV254 and DOC were studied based on to standard methods. The XAD-7 resin method was used for fractionation of NOM. Results showed that NOM concentrations in Lar.

This pesticide has proven to be unaffected by conventional water treatment processes such as granular activated carbon and is responsible for many of the water company compliance failures in the UK. The potential of UV/H2O2 is further demonstrated to offer an alternative approach for the removal of recalcitrant organic matter to ensure DBP compliance as long as extended UV doses of over 10.000 mJ cm−2 are applied at the optimum peroxide dose of 8 mM.

The lowland water reacted as expected to changes in pH but the upland water did not. The greatest impact of pH was observed in the formation of THMs in the lowland water.

In the context of a study on the evaluation of the asbestos risk in this area. the possible role played by the associated asbestiform minerals in the overall toxicity of the airborne fraction has been examined. The first mineral investigated was balangeroite [(Mg.Fe2+.Fe3+.Mn2+)42Si16O54(OH)36]. an iron-rich asbestiform contaminant of chrysotile from the Balangero mine (Piedmont). which crystallizes as rigid and brittle fibers.

The aggregates were stable and characterized using transmission electron microscopy. dynamic light scattering. nitrogen adsorption. small-angle X-ray scattering. infrared spectroscopy. and electron paramagnetic resonance. Human red blood cells were used for assessing the membranolytic activity of aggregates. We found a decreasing hemolytic activity for increasing hydrodynamic diameter of the nanoparticle aggregates. in contrast to trends observed for isolated particles. We propose here a qualitative model that considers the fractal structure of the aggregates and its influence on membrane deformation to explain these observations.

Micrometric TiO 2 is generally considered a safe material. while there is concern on the possible health effects of nanometric titania.

We aimed to compare tissue bioluminescence. tissue cultures and clinical scores of BALB/c mice as potentially complementary outcome measures of Salmonella disease progression In Balb/c mice. The clinical status of the mice was assessed by visual examination for motility. ruffled fur. hunched position. feeding. ataxia and tremor. Patterns of bioluminescent light emission indicated the progression of infection from the abdominal region (initial site) to secondary tissue sites. which was indicative of systemic infection. As the severity and progression of infection increased. the bioluminescence signal became both more prominent and more anatomically disseminated. Bioluminescent Imaging (BLI) of Salmonella that have been genetically engineered to be bioluminescent is a new method that gives the opportunity to track Salmonella dissemination in mice. BLI is a helpful method to estimate tissue Salmonella concentration and may reduce the number of mice used in experiments. providing the opportunity to obtain serial assessments of disease progression in a single mouse subject.

In order to explore this possible biological action we have investigated whether 4a and some of its structurally related analogues had inhibitory effects on the CYP1A enzymes. During our study 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation activity of CYP1A isoenzymes was measured in liver microsomes prepared from 3-methylcholanthrene treated male rats. Inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined by using different concentrations of 7-ethoxyresorufin and the investigated chalcones (1).

However. evidence of immunological efficacy of mistletoe extracts (MEs) used in clinical trials is often lacking. Mechanisms involved in anti-tumor properties of ME and mistletoe lectins (MLs) modify both innate and adaptive immune systems. according to animal model experiments. In the background of these effects. a selective binding of ML on CD75 ganglioside receptors of interleukin 12 (IL-12)-producing macrophages or dendritic cells can play an important role. Immunological effects of ME correlate with their lectin activity. showing a bell-shaped dose-response curve of efficacy. Therefore. a correct determination of MLs for the standardization of commercial ME is essential. However. plant MLs exhibit heterogeneity. which most likely results from post-translational processing. In addition. amino acid analysis of ML has revealed numerous conservative substitutions along their amino acid sequence. Consequently. ML research needs new perspectives. and the advantages and disadvantages of purified and biologically better defined ML preparations are also discussed in this article.,True,K6J73t0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,31,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/298972/abs/,9097026235400425162,/scholar?cites=9097026235400425162,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/298972/abs/,0,0,0

Our approach against drug resistant M.tb. as well as other intracellular pathogens. is by targeted drug delivery using nanoformulations of drugs already in use. as well as drugs in development. Among the latter are gallium (III) (Ga)-based compounds. In the current work. six different types of Ga and rifampin nanoparticles were prepared in such a way as to enhance targeting of M.tb infected-macrophages. They were then tested for their ability to inhibit growth of a fully pathogenic strain (H37Rv) or a non-pathogenic strain (H37Ra) of M.tb. Encapsulating Ga in folate- or mannose-conjugated block copolymers provided sustained Ga release for 15 days and significantly inhibited M.tb growth in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Nanoformulations with dendrimers encapsulating Ga or rifampin also showed promising anti-tuberculous activity. The nanoparticles co-localized with M.tb containing phagosomes. as measured by detection of mature cathepsin D (34 kDa. lysosomal hydrogenase). They also promoted maturation of the phagosome. which would be expected to increase macrophage-mediated killing of the organism. Delivery of Ga or rifampin in the form of nanoparticles to macrophages offers a promising approach for the development of new therapeutic anti-tuberculous drugs.,True,gvmA1MAAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C,28,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177987,15183473831199790984,/scholar?cites=15183473831199790984,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177987,0,0,0

O3. and NO3 have been investigated in a discharge flow reactor at room temperature and pressures between 1 and 3 mbar. The reaction products were detected by mass spectrometry with electron-impact ionization. The product pattern observed is explained in terms of the decomposition of an intermediately formed. chemically activated ethoxy radical. It is shown that. with this assumption. the experimentally determined branching ratios of the different product channels can be reproduced nearly quantitatively by RRKM calculations based on ab initio results for the stationary points of the potential energy surface of C2H5O. For C2H5 + O and C2H5 + O3. the existence of an additional. parallel channel leading to OH has to be assumed. High-pressure Arrhenius parameters for the unimolecular reactions of the ethoxy radical are given and discussed. ,True,AczhWVcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,65,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp9900436,14302963816829900459,/scholar?cites=14302963816829900459,,,0,0,0

1143564,Glutathione–hydroxyl radical interaction: A theoretical study on radical recognition process,2013,Béla Fiser and Balázs Jójárt and Imre G Csizmadia and Béla Viskolcz,8,PloS one,9,e73652,Public Library of Science,Non-reactive. comparative (2×1.2 μs) molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to characterize the interactions between glutathione (GSH. host molecule) and hydroxyl radical (OH•. guest molecule). From this analysis. two distinct steps were identified in the recognition process of hydroxyl radical by glutathione: catching and steering. based on the interactions between the host-guest molecules. Over 78% of all interactions are related to the catching mechanism via complex formation between anionic carboxyl groups and the OH radical. hence both terminal residues of GSH serve as recognition sites. The glycine residue has an additional role in the recognition of OH radical. namely the steering. The flexibility of the Gly residue enables the formation of further interactions of other parts of glutathione (e.g. thiol. α- and β-carbons) with the lone electron pair of the hydroxyl radical. Moreover. quantum chemical calculations were carried out on selected GSH/OH• complexes and on appropriate GSH conformers to describe the energy profile of the recognition process. The relative enthalpy and the free energy changes of the radical recognition of the strongest complexes varied from −42.4 to −27.8 kJ/mol and from −21.3 to 9.8 kJ/mol. respectively. These complexes. containing two or more intermolecular interactions. would be the starting configurations for the hydrogen atom migration to quench the hydroxyl radical via different reaction channels.,True,AczhWVcAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,25,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073652,2690840127048553654,/scholar?cites=2690840127048553654,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073652,0,0,0

Since ZrFe2 is harder than the starting material LiNH2 and MgH2. pulverization effect produced by ZrFe2 assists in the synthesis of pure phase. The formation of pure Mg(NH2)2/LiH has been examined by XRD and confirmed by FTIR.

Al65Cu20Fe15 icosahedral quasicrystal and mechanically activated carbon (graphite) composite have been investigated. The low intensity milling (100 rpm) of quasicrystalline phase with mechanically activated carbon (MAC) showed to conserve the quasicrystalline (QC) phase as well as the small amount of nano crystalline B2 phase. Mechanical behavior of the sintered samples (200 °C) showed an increase in the hardness of the composite materials up to 5 at.% of MAC. The hardness value is nearly 0.37 times higher than that for stable Al–Cu–Fe quasicrystal. The high hardness value may be attributed to the microstructural variation resulting due to 5 at.% MAC addition.

Their synthesis is partly based on classical methodologies such as Pechmann reaction or Knoevenagel condensation. but it also sparked the discovery of completely new pathways. In very recent years so-called vertically expanded coumarins were synthesized. effectively expanding the portfolio of existing architectures. A subtle relationship exists between the structure of fused coumarins and their optical properties. Although absorption of UV-radiation and light is a unifying theme among these π-expanded coumarins. the fluorescence properties strongly depend on the structure. The mode of fusion. the type of additional ring and the presence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents all influence the photophysical parameters.

We report the highly beneficial effects of using SCD for preparation of photoluminescent pSi powders. Significantly higher surface areas and pore volumes have been realized by utilizing SCD (with CO2 solvent) instead of air-drying. Correspondingly. the pSi powders better retain the porous structure and the nano-sized silicon grains. thus minimizing the formation of non-radiative defects during liquid evaporation (air drying). The SCD process also minimizes capillary-stress induced contact of neighboring nanocrystals. resulting in …,True,NCgzmA4AAAAJ:QtA78RmWg5MC,43,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4947084,6356823178280936215,/scholar?cites=6356823178280936215,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/267291886.pdf,0,0,0

The linear and bent shaped dipolar benzocoumarins showed contrasting luminescence behavior in solution and in the solid state. Single crystal structures of both compounds showed π-stacking patterns with eclipsing but opposite dipole moments when viewed orthogonal to the stacking plane. Although the bent molecules are stacked in parallel in the solid state. they behave as independent molecules owing to the unfavorable excited state resonance interaction and hence emit strong fluorescence because each dipolar molecule now is in a hydrophobic environment surrounded by other molecules. This is an unusual example where the shape-dependent stacking governs the solid-state luminescence of dyes. being suggested here as a nonresonant π-stacking system.,True,NCgzmA4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,31,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cg501567s,7210271004836968673,/scholar?cites=7210271004836968673,,,0,0,0

The standard SCR reaction is a coupling of the activation of NO by O2 with the fast SCR reaction. enabled by the release of NO2. According to the scheme. the SCR reaction can be divided into an oxidation of the catalyst by NO + O2 and a reduction by NO + NH3; these steps together constitute a complete catalytic cycle. Furthermore. both NO and NH3 are required in the reduction. and finally. oxidation by NO + O2 or NO2 leads to the same state of the catalyst.

The hierarchical ZSM-5 was synthesized via the desilication reassembly technique using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant. The catalysts differed significantly in the catalytic behavior after the reactivation procedure. This is ascribed to a different coke location in the deactivated catalysts arising from the difference in the porosity. The microporous ZSM-5 showed a coke gradient over the particle with a stronger accumulation of carbonaceous species in the outer particle layers. whereas a homogeneous coke distribution was observed for the deactivated hierarchical ZSM-5.

Its monotonic increasing trend is at the basis of the increasing research interest in materials that capture CO2. either by physical ad-sorption or by dissociative chemi-sorption. Nevertheless. being the annual amount of CO2 released of the order of gigatons [1]. to find an effective way to reuse it as valuable chemical reagent is a key point in the global warming research. However. the high valence of carbon (+ 4) strongly hinders CO2 reactivity. In the present work. different original strategies aimed to increase the performances of materials used in all the steps of carbon dioxide recycling life are presented. In particular. the possibility to increase affinity of microporous materials for storage and separation toward CO2 was explored by introduction of chemical functionally as amines and by metal oxide coating.

Phys,32,13363-13370,,Zeolites are microporous aluminosilicates used in various applications within ion-exchange. sorption processes and catalysis. The trivalent aluminium cations are present in 25 tetrahedral positions in the same manner as silicon. Due to the four oxygen bonds aluminium induces a net negative charge to the framework which can be compensated by a proton. The proton is present on a hydroxyl bridge next to the aluminium and is a strong Brønsted acid site responsible for acid base catalysis 30 within the material.ZSM-5 is a zeolite of the MFI-framework and is responsible for a large fraction of catalysed petrochemical reactions for instance in the methanol-to-gasoline process. 2 The particle size of the crystallites varies in the µm range. ZSM-5 have two types of 35 channels along the a-(zigzag channel) and b-(straight channel) crystallographic axis which intersects to form a three dimensional internal pore system. Microporosity imposes constraints to the size of the molecules able to enter inside the pores. moreover diffusion constrains of reagents and products can only be partially 40 overcome by reducing the dimension of the crystallites. In order to partially overcome these problems. that limits use of zeolites in some industrial applications. research has lately been focused on hierarchical zeolites in order to ensure fast diffusion in and out of the micropores via mesopores. 3 Carbon templating 45 and post synthetic desilication are two pathways studied in order to achieve better diffusion.,True,y38o-c8AAAAJ:zdjWy_NXXwUC,0,https://aperto.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/138401/22242/PCCP_Nanosheet_Open%20Access.pdf,,,,https://aperto.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/138401/22242/PCCP_Nanosheet_Open%20Access.pdf,0,0,0

The hierarchical ZSM-5 was synthesized via the desilication reassembly technique using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant. The catalysts differed significantly in the catalytic behavior after the reactivation procedure. This is ascribed to a different coke location in the deactivated catalysts arising from the difference in the porosity. The microporous ZSM-5 showed a coke gradient over the particle with a stronger accumulation of carbonaceous species in the outer particle layers. whereas a homogeneous coke distribution was observed for the deactivated hierarchical ZSM-5. Due to the diverging coke distribution. the irreversible damage of the zeolitic structure caused by reactivation differs for both catalysts. This fact is assumed to be the reason for the different deactivation/reactivation behaviors of these two zeolitic systems.,True,y38o-c8AAAAJ:-DxkuPiZhfEC,0,https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/141784,,,,,0,0,0

The study of Cu-speciation occurring upon thermal dehydration is a key step for the understanding of the enhanced catalytic properties of this material and for identifying the SCR active sites and their redox capability. Herein. we combined FTIR. X-ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies with DFT computational analysis to elucidate the nature and location of the most abundant Cu-sites in the activated catalyst. Different Cu species have been found to be dominant as a function of the dehydration temperature and conditions. Data analysis revealed that the dehydration process of Cu cations is essentially completed at 250 C. with the formation of dehydrated [CuOH]+ species hosted in a close proximity of 1 Al sites in both d6r and 8r units of the SSZ-13 matrix. These species persist at higher temperature only if a certain amount of O2 is present in the gas feed. while in inert conditions they undergo virtually total “self-reduction” as a consequence of an OH extra-ligand loss. resulting in bicoordinated bare Cu+ cations. Synchrotron characterization supported by computational analysis allowed a unprecedented quantitative refinement of local environment and structural parameters of these Cu (II) and Cu (I) species.,True,y38o-c8AAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a33f/6c5a97f76eef184fedf2823b22362661689f.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a33f/6c5a97f76eef184fedf2823b22362661689f.pdf,0,0,0

The solvents used were 3-methoxypropionitrile. ethylene glycol. dimethylsulfoxide. sulfolane. phenol. and nitrobenzene. The parameters studied were operating temperature (range 20°-125°C). solvent-to-oil ratio (range 1:1-3:1). selectivity. and solvent capacity. The results indicate that sulfolane exhibits excellent extraction properties in comparison with other solvents.

Result shows that the addition of H 2 upto 20% does not exhibit any change in the flame length. However. when hydrogen level is varied from 20% to 40%. a reduction in flame length is observed which may be attributed to the enhanced diffusivity caused due to the increased gas temperature. It is also observed that the SFLF increases as H 2 is added to fuel stream. This might have caused due to the reduction in the C/H ratio in the flame which is favorable to attenuate PAH formation rate. Moreover. the reduction in radiant fraction with hydrogen addition is pertinent with the reduction in soot concentration level.

Ge. P. and As-NHC complexes have recently been synthesized. The focus of this study is to predict whether it is possible to stabilize the elusive E2 molecule via formation of L-E-E-L beyond the few known examples. and if the ligand set for this class of compounds can be extended from the NHC to the phosphine class of ligands. It is predicted that thermodynamically stable L-E-E-L complexes are possible for all group 14 and 15 elements. with the exception of nitrogen.

(2) C–N bond expansion of the NHC with insertion of the main-group hydride into the ring. and (3) migration of a second hydrogen atom to the carbene carbon. The synthetically important NHC·BH3 adduct is also predicted to be thermodynamically unstable with respect to this transformation but is kinetically stabilized with a high barrier to the first hydrogen atom migration.

1143739,On the bonding in bis-pyridine iodonium cations,2013,Dayne C Georgiou and Phillip Butler and Elisse C Browne and David JD Wilson and Jason L Dutton,66,Australian Journal of Chemistry,10,1179-1188,CSIRO PUBLISHING,A study on the bonding in bis-pyridine halonium cations has been carried out using both theoretical and synthetic techniques. The primary thrust for the study is to highlight the opportunities potentially afforded by considering iodine as a Lewis acid in a classic coordination sense. Our results suggest that the iodine dipyridine complex ([pyr-I-pyr]+) can be considered as a coordination complex of [I]+. The lighter bromine and chlorine analogues are more towards the covalent rather than the dative side of bonding. while [pyr-F-pyr]+ is best described as an ion-molecule complex with one strong covalent F-pyr bond and one weak F-pyr dispersion interaction. Finally. theoretical and synthetic studies suggest that the commercially available [pyr-F]+ cation cannot be considered as a coordination complex of ‘F+’. despite its use as a source of electrophilic fluorine.,True,cldt95gAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,35,https://www.publish.csiro.au/CH/fulltext/CH13202?subscribe=false,3454378615194077268,/scholar?cites=3454378615194077268,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.937.8643&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The complexes are uncharged. with square-planar coordination geometries. and the ligands are bound via the NHC groups and the deprotonated amide nitrogen atoms. Pd(II) complexes were prepared for the bidentate ligands. and in each case. two chelating bidentate ligands were bound to the metal center. yielding cis/trans geometric isomeric forms. The Pd(II) complexes of the tetradentate ligands were obtained as a series of constitutional isomeric forms that were separable by fractional crystallization. The constitutional isomers differed in the coordination mode of the NHC groups. which were bound as either “normal” (nNHC) or “abnormal” (aNHC) carbenes.

Density-gradient ultracentrifugation has recently emerged as a technique for sorting as-grown mixtures of single-walled nanotubes into their distinct (n. m) structural forms. but to date this approach has been limited to samples containing only a small number of nanotube structures. and has often required repeated density-gradient ultracentrifugation processing. Here. we report that the use of tailored nonlinear density gradients can significantly improve density-gradient ultracentrifugation separations. We show that highly polydisperse samples of single-walled nanotubes grown by the HiPco method are readily sorted in a single step to give fractions enriched in any of ten different (n. m) species.

We found that beneficial optical changes in SWCNTs resulted from introducing low concentrations of oxygen atoms. Stable covalently oxygen-doped nanotubes were prepared by exposure to ozone and then light. Treated samples showed distinct. structure-specific near-infrared fluorescence at wavelengths 10 to 15% longer than displayed by pristine semiconducting SWCNTs. Dopant sites harvest light energy absorbed in undoped nanotube regions by trapping mobile excitons. The oxygen-doped SWCNTs are much easier to detect and image than pristine SWCNTs because they give stronger near-infrared emission and do not absorb at the shifted emission wavelength.,True,fxP6Kp0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,310,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6011/1656.abstract,14147397170419991869,/scholar?cites=14147397170419991869,,,0,0,0

Chemical functionalization of nanotube sidewalls generates background absorption while broadening and red-shifting the resonant transitions. Extensive ultrasonic agitation induces a similar background component that may reflect unintended chemical changes to the SWCNTs. No major differences are found between spectral backgrounds in sample fractions with average lengths between 120 and 650 nm. Broad background absorption from amorphous carbon is observed and quantified. Overlapping resonant absorption bands lead to elevated backgrounds from spectral congestion in samples containing many SWCNT structural species.

Pump-and-probe measurements performed with fs pulses reveal the effects of strong Coulomb interactions between carriers on their dynamics. Biexciton formation by optical transition from exciton population results in an induced absorption line (binding energy 130 meV). Exciton-exciton annihilation process is shown to evolve at high densities towards an Auger process that can expel carriers from nanotubes. The remaining carriers give rise to an induced absorption due to trion formation (binding energy 190 meV).

The acoustic velocity of alumina in silica is shown to be a very strong function of its mass density. which can vary significantly from sample-to-sample and likely originates from the observed linear relationship between the longitudinal elastic modulus and the mass density. Further. the refractive index versus the alumina concentration provides a very sensitive probe of this mass density. and can be used to derive other structural details about the alumina.

A facile dip-coating method is reported that produces thin homogeneous films in which the carbon nanotubes are not covered by surfactants or shortened by sonication. Photophysical. electrical. chemical. and morphological properties of these SWCNT films have been characterized. When prepared at low densities. the films exhibit near-IR photoluminescence from individualized SWCNTs. whereas when prepared at high densities the films behave as transparent conductors.

To meet regulations. at least the Kr needs to be removed from these off-gas streams. Two metal organic framework (MOF) materials were investigated to determine the removal efficiency and capacity of MOF materials for krypton recovery from air at noncryogenic temperatures. Our two-column breakthrough measurements on nickel dioxobenzenedicarboxylic acid and a partially fluorinated MOF with copper indicate that these materials can capture and separate parts per million levels of Xe and Kr from air. In a two-column system. the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity for Kr on these two MOFs were further increased upon removal of Xe on the first bed.

In particular. CO2 separation from flue gas in post-combustion processes is one of the main focuses of research among the scientific community. One of the major issues that are preventing the successful commercialization of these novel materials is their high affinity towards water that not only compromises gas sorption capacity but also the chemical stability. In this paper. we demonstrate a novel post-synthesis modification approach to modify MOFs towards increasing hydrophobic behaviour and chemical stability against moisture without compromising CO2 sorption capacity. Our approach consists of incorporating hydrophobic moieties on the external surface of the MOFs via physical adsorption.

This behavior is described by the model proposed by Coudert and co‐workers showing that the material seems to undergo two phase transitions that are temperature‐dependent. The isosteric heats of adsorption at high pressures show a minimum that is concurrent with the region of CO2 loadings where the second pressure step occurs. It was deduced that these lower enthalpy values are a consequence of the energy cost related to the expansion or reopening of the framework …,True,T6tmwqIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,19,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cphc.201200243,5979668299733371188,/scholar?cites=5979668299733371188,,https://www.academia.edu/download/61257148/cphc.20120024320191118-8788-1mddbnc.pdf,0,0,0

1143795,A novel medium for the enhanced cell growth and production of prodigiosin from Serratia marcescens isolated from soil,2004,Anuradha V Giri and Nandini Anandkumar and Geetha Muthukumaran and Gautam Pennathur,4,BMC microbiology,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Prodigiosin produced by Serratia marcescens is a promising drug owing to its reported characteristics of having antifungal. immunosuppressive and antiproliferative activity. From an industrial point of view the necessity to obtain a suitable medium to simultaneously enhance the growth of Serratia marcescens and the pigment production was the aim of this work. The usage of individual fatty acid as substrate in industries would be cost-effective in the long run and this paved the way for us to try the effect of different fatty acid-containing seeds and oils of peanut. sesame and coconut as source of substrate. The addition of sugars only showed slight enhancement of prodigiosin production in nutrient broth but not in fatty acid containing seed medium. The powdered peanut broth had supported better growth of Serratia marcescens and higher yield of prodigiosin when compared with the existing nutrient broth and peptone glycerol broth. A block in prodigiosin production was seen above 30°C in nutrient broth. but the fatty acid seed medium used by us supported prodigiosin production upto 42°C though the yields were lower than what was obtained at 28°C. From the results. the fatty acid form of carbon source has a role to play in enhanced cell growth and prodigiosin production. We conclude by reporting that the powdered and sieved peanut seed of different quality grades were consistent in yielding a fourty fold increase in prodigiosin production over the existing media. A literature survey on the composition of the different media components in nutrient broth. peptone glycerol broth and the fatty acid containing seeds and oils enabled us to propose that …,True,UZrbz6IAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,237,https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-4-11,5828249872526292977,/scholar?cites=5828249872526292977,,https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-4-11,0,0,0

In this paper. using molecular dynamics simulations. we propose that there exists. in addition to the above-mentioned lid. a novel second lid in this lipase. We further show that the second lid. covering residues 210–222. acts as a triggering lid for the movement of the first. We also investigate the role of hydrophobicity in the movement of the lids and show that two residues. Phe214 and Ala217. play important roles in lid movement.

1143808,Internal rotation in auramine O,1994,Pennathur Gautam and Anthony Harriman,90,"Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions",5,697-701,Royal Society of Chemistry,The fluorescence quantum yield and excited single state lifetime measured for Auramine O in different alcohols increase with increasing microviscosity of the solvent. The results can be explained quantitatively in terms of current theoretical models in which internal rotation of the N.N-dimethyaniline groups is an activationless process controlled entirely by viscous flow. Auramine O binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) in neutral aqueous solution. Binding to DNA is accompanied by modest increases in fluorescence yield and lifetime of the dye whereas binding to HLADH facilitates a dramatic increase in fluorescence. There appear to be two binding sites for Auramine O on the protein. and in one particular site the conformation of the dye is essentially frozen in a form unfavourable for rotational diffusion.,True,UZrbz6IAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,44,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1994/ft/ft9949000697,7359927704750689745,/scholar?cites=7359927704750689745,,,0,0,0

An important role is played by pH in the stereospecific hydrolysis of these esters. The flap region of CRL plays a significant role in the access of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme. At pH 5.6. 48% of the methyl ester and 5% of the butyl ester of ibuprofen were hydrolysed in 5.5 h. whereas at pH 7.2. 9% of methyl ester and 45% of the butyl ester of ibuprofen was hydrolysed in a identical reaction time using CRL. This lead us to assume that CRL prefers the methyl ester of ibuprofen as a substrate at an acidic pH and the butyl ester of ibuprofen at a neutral pH. Therefore. in order to understand the role of pH in the substrate selection by CRL for the esters of ibuprofen we used the crystallographic coordinates of the open form of the CRL (1CRL) for molecular dynamics …,True,UZrbz6IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,42,https://academic.oup.com/peds/article-abstract/16/12/1017/1513668,13703144156532061802,/scholar?cites=13703144156532061802,,https://academic.oup.com/peds/article/16/12/1017/1513668,0,0,0

J. in polymethylene biradicals with chain lengths ranging from 8 to 16 carbon atoms. have been measured as a function of temperature in hydrocarbon solvents by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy. Fitting the EPR spectra gives accurate J values (±10%). and the chainlength dependence at a particular temperature can be modeled successfully only by using a linear combination of through-bond and through-solventcoupling mechanisms. Temperature-dependent coefficients for each mechanism are extracted from fits of the distance dependence. Through-bond contributions are found to dominate for the Ce biradicals. while the through-solvent mechanism is the major contributor to J in the C! 6 chains.

The SWNT films. with controlled thicknesses of tens to hundreds of nanometers. are prepared from commonly commercialized SWNTs via a wet process. The SWNTs could be easily transferred onto any substrates after self‐releasing from filter membranes without further treatment. The obtained films exhibit excellent performances with sheet resistance of 223 Ω sq−1 and a transparency of 90% at 550 nm was obtained. Most important is that the as‐prepared free‐standing SWNT ultrathin films showed extremely high tensile strength up to 850 MPa for only about a 20‐nm thick film. which has great significance for practical applications. for example. as flexible electrode materials. The SWNT film is used to construct a capacitive touch‐screen prototype. which …,True,g4lRzKIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,45,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.201101298,15962116680228310969,/scholar?cites=15962116680228310969,,,0,0,0

A free-standing SWCNT film with thickness of ∼36 nm was firstly prepared via vacuum filtration. The film was then immersed into the pre-synthesized oleic acid-capped CdSe QDs (average diameter of 3.5 nm) solution. where CdSe QDs anchored spontaneously onto the surface of SWCNT film to produce SWCNT–CdSe QDs hybrid film. By using pure SWCNT films in different thicknesses as bottom and top electrodes. a flexible all-carbon electrode optoelectronic conversion device with sandwich structure of SWCNT film (thickness of ∼200 nm)/SWCNT–CdSe QDs hybrid film (thickness of ∼36 nm)/SWCNT film (thickness of ∼36 nm) was constructed to generate optoelectronic conversion …,True,g4lRzKIAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,14,https://pubs.rsc.org/lv/content/articlehtml/2012/nr/c2nr30920c,11173914289724570781,/scholar?cites=11173914289724570781,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhun_Shi/publication/225307189_Free-standing_single-walled_carbon_nanotube-CdSe_quantum_dots_hybrid_ultrathin_films_for_flexible_optoelectronic_conversion_devices/links/54bf91f40cf28ce68e6b63c9.pdf,0,0,0

The microspheres consist of PEDOT chains as three-dimensional solid networks and a large volume of EDOT as liquid medium span them. Due to synergistic effect of micelles and RTILs. the polymerization rate of PEDOT in the system is slowed down greatly. Gel-like PEDOT microspheres spontaneously grew from several tens of nanometers to centimeter scale and the whole process lasted for several days. Thus. the growth of the microspheres is tracked in situ.

The difference in corrosion rate of aluminium inH 2 SO 4 and HCl solutions without inhibitor was attributed to difference in activation energies of the metal acid solution reaction.

The higher efficiencies of the α-pyridoin have been explained in terms of high solubility of the compound facilitated by hydrogen bonding with solvent molecules. α-Pyridoin is also considered to form a more stable bond with mild steel.,True,FPAWn2EAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254058497803082,4110449708628965955,/scholar?cites=4110449708628965955,,,0,0,0

Thermodynamic and adsorption studies reveal that the adsorption of erythromycin on zinc surface is exothermic. spontaneous and is characterised with increasing degree of orderliness. The adsorption characteristics of the inhibitor are best described by the Langmuir adsorption model.

As expected. ferromagnetic order strengthens at expense of antiferromagnetic one as crystallite size is reduced to 15 nm. However. contrary to previously reported works. an enhancement of saturation magnetization is observed as crystallite size increases from 15 to 22 nm. This unexpected behavior is accompanied by an unusual cell volume variation that seems to induce ferromagnetic-like behavior at expense of antiferromagnetic one. Besides. field cooled hysteresis loops show exchange bias field and coercivity enhancement for increasing cooling fields. which suggest a kind of core-shell structure with AFM-FM coupling for crystallite sizes as small as 15 nm.

Whereas MBT adsorbs with its molecular plane flat on Ag. its plane is perpendicular on Au. This difference in adsorbate geometry is manifested as differences in the intensities of certain vibrational peaks in the Raman spectra.Ab initiomolecular orbital (MO) calculations suggest that MBT adsorbs on Au in the thione form and on Ag in the thiol form. The monolayers are stable up to a temperature of 473 K. much higher than most of the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) studied so far. The adsorption geometry does not undergo any significant change when the monolayers are heated. although minor changes are observed in the SER spectra of the Ag monolayer.

At a higher pH of the solution CGNC encapsulates the drug molecules in its 3D-network and releases the drug at a relatively lower pH due to its reversible gel–sol transition properties. A sulphorhodamine B cytotoxicity assay showed that the chitosan–gold nanocomposite–fluorouracil conjugate (CGNC–FU) has higher cytotoxicity than 5-FU to the cervical cancer cells. SiHa. Drug release from CGNC has been controlled by applying a weak. external DC electric field. The drug delivery system is illustrated to be effective for the loading and delivery of 5-FU. The encapsulation efficiency of CGNC was found to be 36% and about 63% of the drug was released by applying the electric field …,True,lKbgQa8AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,33,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/ra/c4ra07551j,9112603410061033418,/scholar?cites=9112603410061033418,,,0,0,0

The method offers a number of benefits including greater sensitivity than liquid extraction methods because the entire extractable mass is transferred to the analytical system. compared with only a few percent from a conventional liquid extraction/injection. The project's goals were to determine if SFE-GC/MS analyses of the surface-extractable components of an individual's hair yield consistent chemical profiles and to investigate if the profiles are sufficiently different to distinguish them from those of other individuals. In addition. the mtDNA sequences from ten of the same individuals used in the SFE-GC/MS study from four family units were determined. and. while the families were distinguishable. the maternal relations yielded identical sequences. In tandem. SFE-GC/MS and mtDNA techniques may provide valuable complementary data from forensic hair samples.,True,cfEUb9UAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,18,https://europepmc.org/article/med/12762525,16169736482252837175,/scholar?cites=16169736482252837175,,,0,0,0

Law enforcement personnel are particularly interested in identifying alleged perpetrators and distinguishing them from victims and have used both established (eg fingerprints) and creative (eg pet hair) comparisons for associating crime scene evidence with samples of known origin. Employers are continually evaluating the best way to ensure that only authorised personnel gain access to sensitive company locations. In addition to crime and work-place security challenges. identification is also needed for a uniquely personal and private concern–establishing blood relationships between adults and children. Over the last several years. there have been numerous examples of identification by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing techniques that have justified reuniting a child with his/her family as well as the release of an incarcerated yet innocent individual. One of the external characteristics that can make humans at least somewhat unique (depending upon the colour and style) is our hair. essentially a non-living tissue that we are continually growing and losing. Hair is one of the most common forms of forensic trace evidence. which explains why crime scene investigators are extremely interested in developing methods using hair for identifying and distinguishing people. Microscopic inspection of hair can suggest its origin (body location. ethnicity) and is typically the first step in forensic hair analysis.

Of the three starches. we found that only high-amylose extrudate showed lower digestion rate/extent than starches cooked in excess water. The ordered structure of high-amylose starches in cooked and extruded forms was similar. as judged by NMR. XRD and DSC techniques. but enzyme resistance was much greater for extruded forms. Size exclusion chromatography suggested that longer chains were involved in enzyme resistance.

The physicochemical and supra-molecular structure of eight rice varieties with amylose content from 9% to 19% were studied to elucidate the factors responsible for variation in enzymatic digestibility of raw and cooked rice. Parboiled rice had a digestion rate coefficient almost 4.5 times higher than the least digestible Low GI rice. The rate coefficient was found to be independent of helical structure and long range molecular order. possibly attributed to the effect of rice flour architecture.

These systems are known as granule ⿿ghosts⿿ due to the release (and removal) of polymer from their structure during cooking. Maize starch ghosts are less swollen than potato starch ghosts. resulting in a higher packing concentration and greater mechanical stability. In a soft-tribological contact. maize ghost suspensions reduce friction compared to the solvent (water). generate bell-shaped tribological profiles characteristic of particle entrainment and show a marked concentration dependence. whereas potato ghost suspensions exhibit lubrication behaviour similar to water. Microscopy analysis of the samples following tribological testing suggests that this is due to the rapid break-up of potato ghosts under the shear and rolling conditions within the tribological …,True,W0MDPpUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,31,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144861716310086,15080719110649343802,/scholar?cites=15080719110649343802,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83971517.pdf,0,0,0

CNTs were obtained by thermal decomposition of camphor at 850 °C in a CVD growth system. by means of a growth process catalyzed by iron clusters originating from the addition of ferrocene in the precursors mixture. The purification procedures involved HNO3. H2SO4. HSO3Cl and NaOH for different process temperatures.As-grown CNTs showed a consistent presence of metal catalyst (about 6 wt%). evidenced by TGA. The purification treatments led to a certain amount of opening of the CNT tips. with a consequent loss of metal catalyst encapsulated in tips.

The morphology and degree of dispersion of the fillers in the polymer matrix at different length scales was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both individual and agglomerated MWCNTs were evident but a good dispersion was observed for some of them. TGA measurements were performed on nanocomposites in order to understand if CNTs affect the stabilization mechanism during thermal and oxidative degradation.

The hydration kinetics of light‐burned MgO exhibit a hydration rate peak similar to that of portland cement hydration. whereas the hydration kinetics of hard‐burned MgO are comparatively slower at the same temperature. and exhibit a continuously declining hydration rate after the first several minutes of reaction. The hydration kinetics of both light‐burned and hard‐burned MgO can be fit using a boundary nucleation and growth model that has previously been applied to the hydration of portland cement and tricalcium silicate.

Nevertheless. significant progresses in developing carbon nanotube-composites technology are limited by the lack of a simple. economical and high conversion/deposition rate production method for carbon nanotubes. Because of the several advantages of the CVD techniques [5. 6]. much efforts have been devoted to the optimization of this method. though a real breakthrough in this field has yet to be achieved. Here we report the growth and the properties of self standing large area millimeters-thick sheets of as-deposited multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Such sheets were grown by catalytical chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at a growth rate up to 0.5 μm sÀ1 over an area limited only by the deposition system size (up to 100 cm2 at present). With this method curved surfaces can be straightforwardly coated. The sheets showed good thermal stability and interesting mechanical properties such as elasticity and resistance under compression and were totally hydrophobic. These results show that the route towards the use of carbon nanotubes as a structural material is now open.,True,qk4qUBwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,44,https://www.academia.edu/download/46142751/13.pdf,496154952931510420,/scholar?cites=496154952931510420,,,0,0,0

The compressive behavior of the pristine and composite mats was consistent with mechanical predictions accounting for an elastic regime followed by elastic instability and compaction.

Hardness and elastic modulus were obtained from nanoindentation. whereas the coefficient of friction of the composites was obtained using a nanoscratch method. The results show a clear impact of the percentage of CNTs filling on the monitored properties. Considerable improvement in the scratch resistance is obtained by the addition of CNTs and a maximum increase in nanomechanical properties is found at intermediate levels of CNTs filling. Creep studies revealed that a higher loading rate results in a greater primary creep deformation and leads to an increase of the total creep deformation. whereas the addition of MWCNTs affects the elastic recovery of the PVB matrix.

This method is illustrated by a careful analysis of the measured spectra of two Gd3+ (S = 7/2) complexes. It is shown that the electronic relaxation mechanisms at the origin of the EPR line shape arise from the combined effects of the modulation of the static crystal field by the random Brownian rotation of the complex and of the transient zero-field splitting. A detailed study of the static crystal field mechanism shows that. contrarily to the usual global models involving only second-order terms. the fourth and sixth order terms can play a non-negligible role.

The Fourier analysis of the (200) PbS X-ray diffraction profile has shown a decrease of the crystallites mean size and an increase of the sensitized PbS lattice distortion because of chemisorption of oxygen at the crystallites surfaces.

XRD and AFM,2012,D Chicea and E Indrea and CM Cretu,14,Journal of optoelectronics and advanced materials,5,460,,Choi. in 1995 [1] mentioned the nanofluid as a suspension containing a small amount of nanoparticles. The heat transfer properties of a fluid were significantly enhanced by the addition of nanoparticles [2]. The nanoparticles can exhibit novel electronic. magnetic. chemical and optical properties [3–5]. As the nanoparticles are considerably smaller that the living cell or parts of the cells. nanoparticle structured materials are used to investigate. to modify living cells or to deliver certain substances or drugs to them without perturbing much the cells. Many applications of nanostructured materials in biology and medicine were developed in the last years and are presented in review papers.[6] being just one of them. The physical properties of the nanoparticles and of the nanofluids strongly depend of the size and size distribution. therefore controlling the synthesis and characterizing the samples after synthesis are crucial. The Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is currently used in characterizing nanoparticles and nanometer to micrometer sized clusters. TEM offers the best resolution. but the samples require specific preparation. which makes it expensive and time consuming. A convenient approach for nanoparticle sizing relays on optical methods involving a coherent light scattering experiment. The target is the suspension. the far field is recorded and a speckle image is otained. The speckled image appears as a result of the interference of the wavelets scattered by the scattering centers (SC hereafter). The image is not static but changes in time as a consequence of the scattering centers complex movement of sedimentation and Brownian motion …,True,gFwAOPAAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,34,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil_Indrea/publication/230838263_Assesing_Fe_3_O_4_nanoparticle_size_by_DLS_XRD_and_AFM/links/09e415051e11380810000000.pdf,14810414387833513345,/scholar?cites=14810414387833513345,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emil_Indrea/publication/230838263_Assesing_Fe_3_O_4_nanoparticle_size_by_DLS_XRD_and_AFM/links/09e415051e11380810000000.pdf,0,0,0

1144062,The mechanism of hydrogen sorption by thin palladium layers I. Desorption,1976,Romulus Vasile Bucur and V Mecea and E Indrea,49,Journal of the Less Common Metals,,147-158,Elsevier,The effects of the thickness of thin electrodeposited palladium layers on the kinetics of hydrogen desorption processes are reported. Measurements have been performed with a piezoelectric quartz crystal microbalance under dynamic conditions. at a constant temperature of 61.1±0.05° C. and three different hydrogen-equilibrium pressures (α-phase region). From the kinetic analysis of desorption data. the desorption rate constants for the first-order step (k 1 d) and for the second order step (k II d N eq i) have been calculated. The effect of the thickness of palladium layers is rather small in the first-order step. and very great in the second-order step. This behaviour is consistent with a mechanism which takes into account the adsorption of H atoms on two different surface states:(a) a weak adsorption (“pre-dissolved”) state. and (b) a strong adsorption state.

The hydrophobicity was introduced on a silicon wafer by SAMs of 10-undecenyltrichlorosilane. and after the initial drop in oxidation. followed by the dilution-by-dropping method. radial-wettability gradient surfaces having hydrophilic centers and hydrophobic exteriors were generated. This direct drop reaction on the SAMs did not require an elastomeric stamp to be fabricated. which allowed for facile tuning of the gradients in terms of sizes and shapes. The fabricated wettability gradient surfaces possessed a water-collecting capability toward the hydrophilic center. which was inactive on previous linear wettability gradient surfaces.,True,xmoEKMEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,31,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la102379s,11615348915073561903,/scholar?cites=11615348915073561903,,,0,0,0

After the deposition of the polydopamine coating. the specific capacitance increases by ∼40% as compared to that of an unmodified IPCN electrode. This increase in the capacitance can be explained based on the pseudocapacitance induced by the catechol groups of polydopamine. Furthermore. the electrodes coated with both polydopamine and layers of Fe3+ and tannic acid exhibit an additional increase in the capacitance to ∼244 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. which is ∼83% higher than that of the unmodified IPCN electrode.

Our experimental results show that one can tune the length of the SERS ruler between 8 and ∼18 nm by choosing the size of the oval-shaped gold nanoparticles. A possible mechanism for our observed distance-dependent SERS phenomenon is discussed using the Gersten and Nitzan model.

The developed assay is based on the distance dependent properties of gold nanoparticles which cause aggregation of antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticles in the presence of cholera toxin resulting discernible color change. This aggregation induced color change caused a red shift in the plasmon band of nanoparticles which was measured by UV–Vis spectroscopy. In addition. we employed DLS assay to monitor the extent of aggregation in the presence of different concentration of cholera toxin. Our assay can visually detect as low as 10 nM of cholera toxin which is lower than the previously reported colorimetric methods.

Ballester and A Costa,61,J. Org. Chem,,9394-9401,,A new series of tripodal receptors based on squaramido rings as unprecedented binding units has been devised. Among the different structural possibilities that this functionality offers. the ability of establishing multiple O to C−H interactions has been explored. On this basis. new receptors capable of recognizing choline. acetylcholine. and related ammonium salts have been synthesized. Association constants in the range 103−104 M-1 have been measured by a 1H-NMR titration method using a 1:1 model. The formation of intracavity complexes is supported by the observation of characteristic changes in the NMR spectra of the complexes. of intermolecular cross peaks in 2D ROESY experiments. and by detection of signals corresponding to the molecular weight of the complexes by positive FAB mass spectrometry. ,True,QICWNiEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,92,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo9614147,1796987896026164412,/scholar?cites=1796987896026164412,,,0,0,0

In this paper we describe the cocrystal landscape of agomelatine. a particularly promiscuous drug able to cocrystallize with up to nine different coformers.

In silico methods for cocrystal prediction are mostly based on structural and energetic considerations. We have developed a computational method that ranks the probability of cocrystal formation of APIs with large databases of crystal coformers (CCFs). This approach is based on using molecular electrostatic potential surfaces to assess molecular complementarity between two cocrystal components. The screening tool was applied to two low solubility drugs. namely griseofulvin and spironolactone.

Typically. these structures are prepared by deposition techniques. but alternatively they could be made by growing the nanoparticles in situ directly from the (porous) backbone support.

La0.4Sr0.4TiO3-based ceramics intended for use as anode materials in solid oxide fuel cells were investigated. The material was found to preserve its cubic structure throughout testing across a range of conditions. although slight signs of phase segregation were also identified under extreme conditions. The thermal expansion coefficient measured on differently processed samples predicts a good thermomechanical compatibility with yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Conductivity measurements indicated that the material exhibits a fast surface reduction. unlike the bulk reduction. which progresses very slowly. An increase of the prereduction temperature was found to significantly increase the extent of the reduction and. therefore. the conductivity.

The exsolution process was found to initially induce the formation of a 20–30 nm deep pit on the oxide surface followed by the emergence of a Ni particle at the bottom of the pit. Continued emergence of the particle results in it nearly filling the pit. producing a unique structure in which the Ni particle is socketed into the oxide surface. We also show that this morphological evolution can be explained using a simple energy-based model that accounts for the interplay between the surface free energy and the strain energy induced by the included metal nucleate.

To justify and further assess this premise. the oxygen deficiency (δ) and conductivity (σ) of reduced La0.4Sr0.4GaxTi1−xO3−x/2−δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.15) samples were studied as a function of Ga doping (x). Both δ and σ were found to increase significantly with Ga doping.

The corresponding conductivity also increased with doping showing a maximum of ∼50 S cm−1 (measured at 880 °C in 5%H2/Ar on ∼62% dense pellet) for x = 0.05.

One process that has recently received increased attention is chemical looping CH4 partial oxidation. which. however. poses stringent requirements on material design. including fast oxygen exchange and high storage capacity. high reactivity toward CH4 activation. and resistance to carbon deposition. often only met by composite materials. Here we design a catalytically active material for this process. on the basis of exsolution from a porous titanate.

While highly active. such catalysts are expensive and prone to deactivation by sintering and thus alternative methods for their production are being sought to ensure more efficient use of noble metals. Exsolution has been shown to be an approach to produce confined nanoparticles. which in turn are more stable against agglomeration. and. at the same time strained. displaying enhanced activity. While exsolution has been extensively investigated for relatively high metal loadings. it has yet to be explored for dilute loadings which is expected to be more challenging but more suitable for application of noble metals.

1144161,Materials and microstructures for high temperature electrochemical devices through control of perovskite defect chemistry,2013,Dragos Neagu,,,,,,The development of technologies that enable efficient and reliable energy inter-conversion and storage is of key importance for tempering the intermittent availability of renewable energy sources. and thus for developing an energy economy based on sustainable. clean energy production. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) may be used to store excess electrical energy as hydrogen. while solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) could convert back hydrogen into electricity. thus balancing energy availability and demand. However. the current state-of-the-art hydrogen electrode used in both SOECs and SOFCs. the Ni-yttria-stabilised zirconia cermet (Ni-YSZ). is unreliable in conjunction with intermittent energy sources. in particular due to its innate redox instability. This thesis explores the fundamental properties of various inherently redox stable A-site deficient titanate perovskite systems (A1-αBO3.

In particular. this work demonstrates that the versatility of perovskites with respect to the introduction of lattice defects such as vacancies and cation substitutions enables considerable improvements in the extent of reduction. electronic conductivity and overall electrochemical activity. Most importantly. the defect chemistry context set by the presence of A-site vacancies was found to trigger the exsolution of electrocatalytically active nanoparticles from the parent perovskite. upon reduction.

The role of every reactant in the nucleation and growth of the nanoparticles has been delineated: OA is the reductant and thus controls the nucleation rate. meanwhile TOP provides a tunable surface stabilization through coordination on the Ni(0) surface. This result leads us to a design synthesis providing tailored monodispersed nanoparticles in a wide range (2−30 nm). which allows self-consistent studies of size-induced changes in catalytic and magnetic properties. Additionally. the growth mechanism is demonstrated to include an aggregation step which thus correlates with the polycrystalline feature of the nanoparticles obtained through this process.

The majority of CO molecules adsorb molecularly on the surface of the nanoparticles. but some undergo dissociative adsorption. leading to oxide species on the surface of the nanoparticles. We found that the tendency of CO to undergo dissociation depends critically on the size of the Co nanoparticles. Indeed. CO molecules dissociate much more efficiently on the larger nanoparticles (15 nm) than on the smaller particles (4 nm).

An original mechanism of “nanoscale-induced phase segregation” was uncovered in the present study: the appearance of two crystallized phases inside each single nanoparticle (here.

This behavior was obtained by reacting at low temperature (<220 °C) substoichiometric amounts of white phosphorus (P4) on well-defined monodisperse Ni nanoparticles in solution. Phosphorus insertion inside the Ni fcc nanoparticles triggers the crystallization of a Ni2P core surrounded by a Ni shell. The crystallization process was monitored by HRTEM. EFTEM.

Pd5P2 and Pd3P stoichiometries form the amorphous phases. but only PdP2 and Pd5P2 could be further crystallized from them. Although it exists as a bulk crystalline material. Pd3P could only be crystallized by starting from the more Pd-rich Pd6P composition.

One of the main reasons for this large interest is that these peptide nanotubes are believed to be very stable both thermally and chemically. Previously. the chemical and thermal stability of self-organizing structures has been investigated after the evaporation of the solvent. However. it was recently discovered that the stability of the structures differed significantly when the tubes were in solution. It has been shown that. in solution. the peptide nanotubes can easily be dissolved in several solvents including water.

The use of cell cultures and integrated electrodes is seen as a promising alternative that could potentially solve this problem. In this work. we present a l-glutamate sensor based on a bienzyme redox hydrogel. capable of detecting the release of this excitatory neurotransmitter from adherently growing cells upon stimulation. The low working potential required for the operation of the sensor decreases the possibility of interference by easily oxidizable compounds always present in complex biological samples. A low detection limit of 0.5 μM l-glutamate. a response time of about 35 s. and a linear range of up to 60 μM are the main characteristics of the sensor. The system has been successfully employed to monitor the release of l-glutamate from HN10 and C6 cells upon stimulation with K+-ions.

1144296,Micro and nano techniques for the handling of biological samples,2011,Jaime Castillo-León and Winnie Edith Svendsen and Maria Dimaki,,,,,CRC Press,Several micro-and nanomanipulation techniques have emerged in recent decades thanks to advances in micro-and nanofabrication. For instance. the atomic force microscope (AFM) uses a nano-sized tip to image. push. pull. cut. and indent biological material in air. liquid. or vacuum. Using micro-and nanofabrication techniques. scientists can make manipulation tools. such as microgrippers and nanotweezers. on the same length scale as the biological samples. Micro and Nano Techniques for the Handling of Biological Samples reviews the different techniques available to manipulate and integrate biological materials in a controlled manner. either by sliding them along a surface (2-D manipulation). or by gripping and moving them to a new position (3-D manipulation). The advantages and drawbacks are mentioned together with examples that reflect the state-of-the-art in manipulation techniques for biological samples. Thanks to the advances in micro-and nanomanipulation techniques. the integration of biomaterials with physical transducers has been possible. giving rise to new and highly sensitive biosensing devices. Although great progress has been made. challenges are still present. To understand the complex interactions between and inside biological samples. scientists will always be working on improving technologies to manipulate. transport. sort. and integrate samples in different environments.

1144298,Matrix‐free methods for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry,2007,Dominic S Peterson,26,,1,19-34,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is a soft ionization mass spectrometric method that has become a preeminent technique in the analysis of a wide variety of compounds including polymers and proteins. The main drawback of MALDI is that it is difficult to analyze low molecular weight compounds (<1.000 m/z) because the matrix that allows MALDI to work interferes in this mass range. In recent years there has been considerable interest in developing laser desorption/ionization (LDI) techniques for the analysis of small molecules. This review examines the approaches to matrix‐free LDI mass spectrometry including desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS). sol‐gels. and carbon‐based microstructures.

The first step affords a thin grafted layer of polymer with a multiplicity of pendent double bonds that are then used in the second step for covalent attachment of the monolith to the wall. As clearly seen on scanning electron micrographs. this procedure prevents the formation of voids at the monolith‐channel interface a problem that has always plagued approaches involving bulk polymerization in nontreated channels due to the shrinkage of the monolith during the polymerization process and its lack of compatibility with the material of the device.

Selectivity studied by linear solvation energy relationships,2001,Dominic S Peterson and Christopher P Palmer,22,Electrophoresis,16,3562-3566,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,Anionic. water‐soluble siloxane polymers modified with different lengths of alkyl chains have very different selectivity than sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles when used as pseudostationary phases in electrokinetic chromatography. The siloxanes in this study are random copolymers with side chains bearing sulfonate groups and alkyl groups (C8. C12. or C18). with the proportion of alkyl groups between 10 and 25% of the total. The differences in selectivity have been studied by linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs). The siloxanes in general have been found to be more cohesive. less polar. more able to interact with solutes through n‐ and π‐electrons. and more able to accept hydrogen bonds than SDS micelles. while the ability to act as hydrogen bond donors is not significantly different than SDS micelles.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Recent research has implicated the C‐terminus of G‐protein coupled receptors in key events such as receptor activation and subsequent intracellular sorting. yet obtaining structural information of the entire C‐tail has proven a formidable task. Here. a peptide corresponding to the full‐length C‐tail of the human CB1 receptor (residues 400–472) was expressed in E.coli and purified in a soluble form. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed that the peptide adopts an α‐helical conformation in negatively charged and zwitterionic detergents (48–51% and 36–38%. respectively). whereas it exhibited the CD signature of unordered structure at low concentration in aqueous solution.

The label is a 3′-terminal pentanucleotide fragment of N-acetylleucyl-tRNA in which mercury atoms have been added at the C-5 position of the three cytosine residues. This mercurated fragment can bind to rat liver peptidyl transferase and function as a donor of N-acetylleucine to puromycin. Concommitant with this binding. the mercury atoms present in the fragment can form a covalent linkage with a small number of ribosomal proteins. The major proteins labeled by this reagent are L5 and L36A. Four protein spots are found labeled to a lesser extent: L10. L7/7a. L3/4 and L25/31.

1144571,Small skeletal kinetic mechanism for kerosene combustion,2016,N Zettervall and C Fureby and EJK Nilsson,30,Energy & Fuels,11,9801-9813,American Chemical Society,The development and validation of a new skeletal mechanism for kerosene combustion. suitable for reacting direct-. large-eddy. and Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes Simulations. are presented. The mechanism consists of 65 irreversible reactions between 22 species and is built on a global fuel breakdown approach to produce a subset of C2 intermediates. A more detailed set of reactions for H/O/C1 chemistry largely determines the combustion characteristics. The mechanism is validated for combustion characteristics related to ignition. flame propagation. and flame extinction over a wide range of pressure. temperature. and equivalence ratios. Agreement with experiments and a more complex reference mechanism are excellent for laminar burning velocities and extinction strain rate. while ignition delays are overpredicted at stoichiometric and rich conditions.

Non-stretched flames were stabilized on a perforated plate burner at 1 atm. and laminar burning velocities were determined using the heat flux method. at conditions where the net heat loss from the flame to the burner is zero. The overall accuracy of the burning velocities was estimated to be better than ±1.0 cm s−1. Very good reproducibility of the results and excellent agreement with modeling using a recently updated chemical kinetic model brings confidence in the validity of the reported results. Previous determinations of laminar burning velocities for acetone have provided inconsistent results.

In this work. two colorimetric and fluorescent sensors 1 and 2 were presented for detecting Cys with different reactive rates in an intramolecular cyclization reaction between acrylate and thiols. Probe 2 is the isomer of the probe 1. which has greater steric hindrance than probe 1. The performed reaction kinetics experiments showed that the reaction rates of 1 with thiols were far more rapid than those of 2 with thiols. From the observed crystal structures of these two compounds. we speculate that the larger steric hindrance around the acrylate group in probe 2 outweighs the electronic effect. thus slowing down the reaction between the acrylate and thiols.

Unipolar n-channel OTFTs with electron-only transport behavior is achieved for all the polymer semiconductors chosen with 2–10 wt % PEI. The electron-rich nitrogen atoms in PEI are thought to fill the electron traps. raise the Fermi level and function as trapping sites for holes. leading to promotion of electron transport and suppression of hole transport. This work demonstrates a convenient general approach to transforming ambipolar and p-type polymer semiconductors into unipolar n-type polymer semiconductors that are useful for printed logic circuits and many other …,True,Xo6WOswAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,34,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.5b05097,3318168664613230654,/scholar?cites=3318168664613230654,,,0,0,0

1144644,Organic photovoltaics with thick active layers (∼ 800 nm) using a high mobility polymer donor,2013,Leanne Murphy and Wei Hong and Hany Aziz and Yuning Li,114,Solar energy materials and solar cells,,71-81,North-Holland,Rather consistent power conversion efficiencies have been achieved in organic solar cells throughout a wide range of active layer thicknesses (∼100 nm to ∼800 nm) by using a p-type polymer semiconductor with high hole transport mobility (∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1) as the donor. and PC61BM as the acceptor. A comparison between standard and inverted device configurations demonstrates that the inverted configuration is more suitable for achieving thicker active layers when a high hole mobility donor is used. We attribute this to the longer hole collection path in the inverted structure. which can benefit from using a high hole mobility material. Our results will be very useful for the development of new semiconductor materials and the design of device structures for more feasible manufacturing of large area OPV devices via high speed roll-to-roll printing processes.,True,Xo6WOswAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,34,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024813001128,18319388862397774912,/scholar?cites=18319388862397774912,,,0,0,0

A Case for Anatase LixTiO2,2007,Marnix Wagemaker and Wouter JH Borghols and Fokko M Mulder,129,Journal of the American Chemical Society,14,4323-4327,American Chemical Society,Insertion reactions are of key importance for Li ion and hydrogen storage materials and energy storage devices. The particle size dependence of insertion reactions has been investigated for lithiated anatase TiO2. revealing progressively increasing Li capacity and Li-ion solubility for decreasing particle sizes. strongly deviating from the expected Li-rich and Li-poor phase separation as occurs in the bulk material. The phase diagram alters significantly. changing the materials properties already at sizes as large as 40 nm. A rationale is found in the surface strain that occurs between the different intercalated phases. which becomes energetically too costly in small particles. In particular the observed particle size-induced solid solution behavior is expected to have fundamental and practical implications for two-phase lithium or hydrogen insertion reactions. ,True,5vPloHMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,731,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja067733p,4463086095194411969,/scholar?cites=4463086095194411969,,,0,0,0

The near-surface environment of the nanosized particles allows higher Li ion occupancies. leading to a larger storage capacity. However. too high surface lithium storage leads to irreversible capacity loss. most likely due to surface reconstruction or mechanical failure. A mechanism where the large near-surface capacity ultimately leads to surface reconstruction rationalizes the existence of an optimal particle size. Recent literature attributes the curved voltage profiles. leading to a reduced length of the voltage plateau. of nanosized electrode particles to strain and interface energy from the coexisting end members. However. the unique zero-strain property of the Li4+xTi5O12 spinel implies a different origin of the curved voltage profiles observed for its nanosized crystallites.

In situ measurements reveal an extraordinary high capacity of 810 mAh/g on the first discharge. Upon cycling at a charge/discharge rate of 33.5 mA/g. this capacity gradually decreases to 200 mAh/g after 50 cycles. The origin of this fading was investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance.

Here. we reveal that the thermodynamics of first-order phase transitions in nanoinsertion materials is distinctly different from bulk materials as demonstrated by the decreasing miscibility gap that appears to be strongly dependent on the overall composition in LiFePO4. In contrast to our common thermodynamic knowledge. that dictates solubility limits to be independent of the overall composition. combined neutron and X-ray diffraction reveals strongly varying solubility limits below particle sizes of 35 nm. A rationale is found based on modeling of the diffuse interface.

In the solid solution regime in microsized rutile. which extends up to x ≈ 0.07 Li/Ti. the Li ions mainly reside at the tetrahedral position at low temperatures and at the octahedral position at higher temperatures. A rationale of this effect was found in the influence of lattice dynamics. illustrated by molecular dynamics simulations of the Li-ion diffusion in the rutile structure. Maximum (chemically) lithiated microrutile (∼0.43 Li/Ti at room temperature) reveals the formation of a layered morphology. having a monoclinic symmetry (P2/m. space group 10) similar to the previously suggested layered hexagonal structure.

Both X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and ab initio calculations have been applied to probe the electronic structure of the newly formed LiTiO2 phase. These results indicate that a large majority of the Li-2s electrons reside at the Ti-3d(t2g)/4s hybridized site. About 10% of these electrons are transferred to non-localized states which makes this compound a good electronic conductor. Ionic conductivity is probed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation experiments indicating relatively small hopping rates between the Li-ion sites in LiTiO2.

Nanostructuring appears to be a promising strategy. in which the higher power density in nanosized materials is related to the dramatically shortened Li‐ion diffusion paths. However. nanosizing materials also changes intrinsic material properties. which influence both ionic and electronic conductivity. In this work neutron diffraction is used to show that in addition to these two aspects. nanostructuring changes the phase behavior and morphology. Lithiated 40‐nm TiO2 anatase crystallites become single phase. either having the Li‐poor original anatase phase. or the Li‐rich Li‐titanate phase. in contrast to microsized crystallites where these two phases coexist in equilibrium within one crystal particle.

High target lithium vacancy concentrations promote the increase in anti-site disorder of Li+ and Fe2+. as this process is driven by vacancy stabilization. Combined neutron and X-ray diffraction on partial delithiated substoichiometric olivines reveals segregated defect-free (where Li is extracted) and defect-ridden (where Li remains) regions.

1144694,Lithium insertion in nanostructured titanates,2010,Wouter Joannes Henrik Borghols,,,,,,Upon nano-sizing of insertion compounds several significant changes in Li-insertion behavior have been observed for sizes below approximately 50 nm. Although the origins of the phenomena are interrelated. the changes can be divided in three main observations. (1) The formation of new phases. leading to enhanced reactivity and extended capacities. which is most likely due to the lesser role of kinetic restrictions. and easier accommodation of strain in nanoscale compounds. (2) Thermodynamic changes due to the relatively increased impact of both surface and interface energy. and (3). the excess Li-storage on the surface of the particles in the form of Li2O. These three phenomena have a positive effect on the performance of the electrode material in a Li-ion battery application. The higher Li-capacities provide the electrode material with a higher energy density. Furthermore. the enhanced extend of the solid solution regime observed at lower Li-capacities. due to changes in the particle’s thermodynamics. supports better ionic mobility in the absence of a rate-limiting phase boundary. However. the relatively increase op the surface also enhances the negative effects. such as the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Also. a Li-rich surface layer inherently shows poor Li-ion mobility. and effectively acts as a block for further intercalation of the bulk of the particle. The detailed insight in the nano-size related surface storage mechanisms discussed in this thesis forms an important basis for understanding the properties of nano-sized insertion materials. This knowledge supports future design of nano-sized electrode materials for Li-ion …,True,5vPloHMAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,1,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:36edf5fe-f81e-4670-b30f-5d5b208db1fa,8018434128330101219,/scholar?cites=8018434128330101219,,,0,0,0

The power density. ie the rate with which Li-ion batteries can be (dis-) charged. is limited by Li-ion diffusion through the solid electrode matrix. Nano-structuring the electrode material appears to be a successful strategy to reach higher rate capabilities simply because the diffusion path through the electrode is drastically shortened. In addition to this trivial aspect. nano-structuring also has dramatic effects on the intrinsic properties of the material. also influencing charge transport. both ionic and electronic [1]. In order to understand these properties. fundamental research on the electronic structure of the nano-sized materials is required.In our research. the focus lies on TiO2 crystallites. a well-suited thermodynamically stable starting material from which a more general model of nano-sized behaviour is to be extracted. This transition metal-oxide has eight different crystalline identities. two of which can host significant amounts of lithium: anatase (spacegroup 141. I41/amd) and rutile (spacegroup 136. P42/mnm). Structural investigation on nano-scale TiO2 anatase revealed enhanced lithium capacity and an increased solid solution domain compared to bulk anatase [2]. consistent with our previous quasi-insitu XAS results on thin layers [3]. Both effects have recently also been observed in nano-sized TiO2 rutile [4]. suggesting these effects to be a manifestation of a more general size-dependent phenomenon. This research aims at understanding the electronic properties of these and other TiO2 morphologies. and to …,True,5vPloHMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2007_report/part1/contrib/41/21286.pdf,,,,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2007_report/part1/contrib/41/21286.pdf,0,0,0

1144702,Size dependent Li-intercalation in TiO2,,D Lützenkirchen-Hecht and WJH Borghols and M Wagemaker,,,,,,Sustainable energy storage in the form of Li-ion batteries requires new and advanced materials in particular with a higher power density. where specifically nano-structuring appears to be a promising strategy. In general. the slow diffusion of Li-ions in the micro-sized crystallites of conventional battery materials is a main limiting factor. Accordingly. the higher power density in nano-structured materials is related to the dramatically shortened Li-ion diffusion path lengths through the inside of nano-sized crystalline electrode materials. However. nano-sizing materials also changes the intrinsic material properties. which influence both ionic and electronic conductivities [1. 2]. On one hand the increased surface-bulk ratio leads to higher defect concentrations. and in addition the charges that are restricted to the surfaces of the particles will become relatively more important when the particle size becomes smaller than the extent of the space charge layer. Recently. we found that in addition to these two aspects. nano-structuring also changes the phase behaviour and morphology of Li-intercalated particles as follows [3]: Lithiated particles with sizes less than 120 nm become single phase. either having the Li-poor original anatase crystallographic phase. or the Li0. 55TiO2 Li-titanate phase. in contrast to micron sized particles where the two phases coexist in equilibrium within each single particle [4. 5]. In addition. the nanoparticles reveal LixTiO2 compositions with stoichiometries that are not stable in bulk crystallites in either phase. For particle sizes of 40 nm. a third phase becomes apparent with the same symmetry compared to the original anatase phase …,True,5vPloHMAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2006_report/part1/contrib/41/17466.pdf,,,,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2006_report/part1/contrib/41/17466.pdf,0,0,0

1144703,Investigation of doped olivines for cathode materials in rechargeable lithium ion batteries,,U Haake and M Wagemaker and W Borghols and D Lützenkirchen-Hecht and R Frahm,,,,,,LiFePO4 (Fig. 1) and related olivine materials have recently attracted attention due to their possible use as cathodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Padhi et al [1] introduced LiFePO4 as a good alternative to the transition metal oxides that are currently used in commercial batteries. Current cathode materials such as LiCoO2. LiNiO2 or LiMnO2 suffer from deterioration upon use due to several charging and discharging cycles or an operation at moderately increased temperatures. Furthermore. there are environmental concerns with their disposal [2]. In contrast. the structural similarity between the charged and the discharged states of LiFePO4 leads to excellent cycleability. Also LiFePO4 is more stable. has a very good thermal stability. and has a similar theoretical capacity of 170 mAh g-1 [3]. Additionally. its voltage characteristics as well as possible cost and environmental issues are advantageous. The interest in the material raised even more when it was claimed that the poor electronic conductivity could be raised by 8 orders of magnitude as a result of supervalentcation doping [4]. Although the position of the dopants is up to date unknown. the supervalent dopant was suggested to reside mainly on the M1 (Li) site. In this way the dopant is thought to create a lithium and/or iron deficient solid solution leading to a minority Fe3+ hole carriers being responsible for the enhanced conductivity in the bulk lattice. What followed is a continuing discussion concerning the origin of the enhanced conductivity in the doped materials. ate for large batteries that are required for electric equipment and hybrid electric vehicles.The samples for the present …,True,5vPloHMAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2007_report/part1/contrib/41/21322.pdf,,,,http://hasyweb.desy.de/science/annual_reports/2007_report/part1/contrib/41/21322.pdf,0,0,0

1144704,Dynamic imine chemistry,2012,Matthew E Belowich and J Fraser Stoddart,41,,6,2003-2024,Royal Society of Chemistry,Formation of an imine—from an amine and an aldehyde—is a reversible reaction which operates under thermodynamic control such that the formation of kinetically competitive intermediates are. in the fullness of time. replaced by the thermodynamically most stable product(s). For this fundamental reason. the imine bond has emerged as an extraordinarily diverse and useful one in the hands of synthetic chemists. Imine bond formation is one of a handful of reactions which define a discipline known as dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC). which is now employed widely in the construction of exotic molecules and extended structures on account of the inherent ‘proof-reading’ and ‘error-checking’ associated with these reversible reactions. While both supramolecular chemistry and DCC operate under the regime of reversibility.

The application of Pd‐PEPPSI‐IPr in sp3–sp3. sp3–sp2 (and vice versa). and sp2–sp2 Negishi cross‐couplings is reviewed. This allowed the systematic development of Pd‐PEPPSI‐IPent. a more sterically demanding. second‐generation catalyst that outperforms the IPr analogue in a variety of sp2–sp2 Negishi cross‐couplings.

Although simpler models may capture overall rates. the reaction schemes proposed here are required to explain the increasing regioselectivity to the primary product with conversion and the dependence of the overall regioselectivity on residual water concentration and additives as a function of reaction conditions. The model indicates that the different reaction conditions (nucleophile. water concentration. temperature. and conversion) lead to different amounts of flux through alcohol-mediated pathways. different speciation of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane adducts. and …,True,acedXUAAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,4,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.9b02607,6777041174561856540,/scholar?cites=6777041174561856540,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2019/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper20125/NAM26_Abstract_CkB-Final-PDF.pdf,0,0,0

The aromatic 1.2-diol functional group in catechol derivatives is believed to be responsible for enhancing the adhesion of a variety of polymers to a range of substrates. Here. we describe a postpolymerization modification approach to the design of emulsion polymers with catechol-functionalized side chains. A series of analogous small-molecule reactions. together with latex characterization by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography (LC) methods. provides evidence for polymer functionalization. Films prepared from catechol-containing latexes displayed remarkable adhesion to challenging. commercially-available thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) (as determined by a standard ASTM cross-hatch method).

This technology is practiced commercially using strong Brønsted acids or bases that produce cyclosiloxane byproducts that can compromise performance properties and are also under increased regulatory scrutiny. We have found that Lewis acids are active silanol polycondensation catalysts that limit the formation of cyclosiloxane byproducts. Ligand donicity was found to have a dramatic effect on the activity of metal salts. as polycondensation catalysts with more weakly coordinating ligands—i.e.. trifluoromethanesulfonate—displaying higher activity.

Among these. Anisakis simplex can cause seafood infestation. and allergic symptoms (urticaria–angioedema. anaphylaxis. and asthma) can follow the eating or handling of affected fish. Although seafood is the principal source of human infections by this parasite. we have found allergic symptoms in 8 patients previously diagnosed as having A simplex sensitization after they ate chicken meat. Chicken feed usually has a high proportion of fishmeal. which might possibly be contaminated by this nematode. Objective: The aim of our study was to determine whether parasite proteins present in chicken meat could be responsible for the symptoms reported by these subjects. Methods: We carried out in vivo tests (prick. bronchial challenge. and double-blind placebo-controlled challenge with meat chicken) in these 8 patients. We performed immunoblotting using the sera from the 8 patients and controls in order to detect A simplex sensitization. We also investigated the presence of A simplex proteins in sera from chickens fed with fishmeal and in other sera from chickens fed only with cereals. We excluded sensitization to other chicken nematodes by serologic methods.Results: All 8 patients presented positive prick and challenges to A simplex.

Hay fever is more predominant in urban than in rural areas. despite the increasingly smaller areas of surrounding grassland. The effect of vehicle exhaust pollutants. mainly diesel particles. and other industrial sources of atmospheric pollution leading to plant damage has been implicated in this phenomenonThis study compared the in vivo and in vitro allergenicity of pooled samples of Lolium perenne grass pollen harvested from 10 different urban areas with that of samples of the same pollen from 10 neighboring rural areasLolium perenne pollen from different parts of a city and from a nearby rural area was harvested in 1999 and 2000 during the peak pollination period.

The objective of this study was to determine populationspecific reference ranges for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). free thyroxine (fT4). free triiodothyronine (fT3) and total triiodothyronine (TT3) on the Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer. For this study. we used human serum samples collected from a population in Castilla y Leo n. Spain. Serum samples were collected from 304 individuals (male. ns151; female. ns153; age 12–94 years) representing outpatients (ns100). hospitalized patients (ns104) and apparently healthy subjects (ns100). Individuals taking any medications. with a history of thyroid disorder. or severe non-thyroidal illness were excluded from the study. For healthy subjects. the following reference intervals were determined: TSH. 0.51–5.95 mIU/l; fT4. 0.84–1.42 ng/dl (10.77–18.21 pmol/l); fT3. 1.48–3.37 pg/ml (2.27–5.18 pmol/l); and TT3. 0.65–1.46 ng/ml (1.00–2.24 nmol/l).

Ltd,Background The prevalence of asthma has increased from the 1950s to the 1990s. The relationship between diet and asthma is an area of controversy that has never been fully evaluated. Attempts at dietary prevention of asthma have produced conflicting results. We have recently identified allergens from cereals that show cross‐reactivity with proteins in grass pollen. An early intake of cereals in the diet during early life might cause IgE sensitization to cereals. It is not known whether such sensitization predisposes the development of allergy to pollen.Methods To test this hypothesis. a cross‐sectional study and an observational case‐control analysis of reviewed data were carried out on 16381 patients who had been admitted to our Allergy Unit between 1989 and 1999. All the patients underwent allergy tests to identify asthma risk‐factors.

Spain. whose origin is either the application of calcium caseinate. or egg yolk and animal glue; and (iii) the patinas with only oxalates found in some of Verona's monuments (St Zeno) and Spanish sites as in the Monastery of Guadalupe and Cuenca cathedral. formed …,True,fXo-PAUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1065/espr2005.05.257,929428048421256289,/scholar?cites=929428048421256289,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50243284/The_Orange-Brown_Patina_of_Salisbury_Cat20161110-3079-ic9qhl.pdf,0,0,0

Detection of specific IgE to poppy seed might be a marker for sensitisation to opiates in allergic people and heroin-abusers. This study assessed the clinical value of morphine. pholcodine and poppy seed skin-prick and IgE determination in people suffering hypersensitivity reactions during anaesthesia or analgesia and drug-abusers with allergic symptoms.We selected heroin abusers and patients who suffered severe reactions during anaesthesia and analgesia from a database of 23.873 patients. The diagnostic yield (sensitivity. specificity and predictive value) of prick and IgE tests in determining opiate allergy was analysed.Overall. 149 patients and 200 controls. mean age 32.9 ± 14.7 years. were included.
