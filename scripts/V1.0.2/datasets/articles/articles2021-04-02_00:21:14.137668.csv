1288094,Aluminum agglomeration reduction in a composite propellant using tailored Al/PTFE particles,2014,Travis R Sippel and Steven F Son and Lori J Groven,161,Combustion and Flame,1,311-321,Elsevier,In solid propellants. aluminum is widely used to improve performance. yet theoretical specific impulse is still not achieved largely because of two-phase flow losses. Losses could be reduced if aluminum particles quickly ignited. more gaseous products were produced and if upon combustion. aluminum particle breakup occurred. To explore this. tailored. fuel-rich. mechanically activated composite particles (aluminum/polytetrafluoroethylene. Al/PTFE 90/10 and 70/30 wt.%) are considered as replacements for reference aluminum powders (spherical. flake. or nanoscale) in a composite solid propellant. The effects on burning rate. pressure dependence. and aluminum ignition. combustion. and agglomeration are quantified.

We explore this by using aluminum particles modified with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) inclusion to drive intraparticle outgassing. which could break apart composite particles. yielding smaller and faster burning fragments during composite solid propellant combustion. We find that use of these particles in a propellant results in more prompt particle ignition. and surface residence time is decreased. For composite propellant burning at 6.9 MPa. mean coarse agglomerate diameter is decreased from 75.8 μm (spherical aluminum) to 29.0 μm (Al/LDPE 90/10 wt.% particles).

Recently. engineered composite particles of aluminum (Al) with inclusions of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or low-density polyethylene (LDPE) have been shown to improve ignition and yield smaller agglomerates in solid propellants. Reductions in agglomeration were attributed to internal pressurization and fragmentation (microexplosions) of the composite particles at the propellant surface.

Past efforts in developing environmentally cleaner solid propellants by scavenging the chlorine ion have focused on replacing a portion of the chorine-containing oxidant (i.e.. ammonium perchlorate) with an alkali metal nitrate. The alkali metal (e.g.. Li or Na) in the nitrate reacts with the chlorine ion to form an alkali metal chloride (i.e.. a salt instead of HCl). While this technique can potentially reduce HCl formation. it also results in reduced ideal specific impulse (ISP). Here. we show using thermochemical calculations that using aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) alloy can reduce HCl formation by more than 95% (with lithium contents ≥15 mass%) and increase the ideal ISP by ∼7 s compared to neat aluminum (using 80/20 mass% Al-Li alloy).

However. most conventional hypergolic propellants are toxic or environmentally hazardous. This work serves as initial motivation for the development of less toxic. hypergolic metal hydride-based propellants for application to liquid and hybrid propulsion systems. In this work. results on the measurement of the hypergolic ignition delay of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the form of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) hybrid fuels and RP-1 slurry fuels with hydrogen peroxide are presented. Ignition delay for LiAlH4 and NaBH4 slurries and neat metal hydride powders with 90% hydrogen peroxide are all less than 20 ms. and 10 ms. respectively. The observable preignition process of LiAlH4 slurries is different from that of NaBH4 slurries. At the time scales investigated. the LiAlH4 slurry preignition process produces gas-phase products. while NaBH4 slurry preignition occurs almost completely in the condensed phase. Droplet tests on DCPD-metal hydride fuel pellets indicate ignition processes similar to those of the slurries and that hypergolic ignition of a fuel grain cannot be relied upon as the sole source of ignition.

Recently. the application of high-power microwave field to aluminized solid propellants has been shown to increase the burning rate by up to 60%.

Without a proper information flow. it is impossible to quantify circular initiatives. both in comparison with the actual linear situation or with circular alternative opportunities.

1288129,The innovative concept of cold district heating networks: a literature review,2018,Marco Pellegrini and Augusto Bianchini,11,,1,236,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The development of sustainable and innovative solutions for the production and supply of energy at district level is nowadays one of the main technical challenges. In the past. district heating and cooling networks aimed to achieve greater energy efficiency through the centralization of the energy production process but with relevant losses related to heat transport. Moving towards a higher share of renewables and lower demand of primary energy requires redesign of the energy district networks. The novel concept of cold district heating networks aims to combine the advantages of a centralized energy distribution system with low heat losses in energy supply. This combined effect is achieved through the centralized supply of water at relatively low temperatures (in the range 10–25 C). which is then heated up by decentralized heat pumps. Moreover. cold district heating networks are also very suitable for cooling delivery. since cold water supplying can be directly used for cooling purposes (ie. free cooling) or to feed decentralized chillers with very high energy efficiency ratio. This paper provides a preliminary literature review of existing cold district heating networks and then qualitatively analyses benefits and drawbacks in comparison with the alternatives currently used to produce heat and cold at district level. including the evaluation of major barriers to its further development.

1288136,A new productive model of circular economy enhanced by digital transformation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution-An integrated framework and real case studies,2018,A Bianchini and M Pellegrini and J Rossi and C Saccani,,"Proceedings of the 23rd Summer School Francesco Turco, Palermo, Italy",,12-14,,The socio-economic trends in the last decades (population growth. rapid industrialization and urbanization) have accelerated the transition from the old linear material flow to the more sustainable circular economy (CE). CE is recognized as a clear value creation opportunity. which can bring the lasting benefits of a more innovative. resilient and productive economy. Nevertheless. there is a huge gap between the big concept of CE and the practical actions. In particular. the research and the implementation of circular models to date have mainly focused on the product end-of-life. in order to reduce. reuse and recycle waste. but the lack of feedback information and performance indexes does not allow the measurement of how a product. a process or a company is really transiting from linear to circular models. This critical issue limits the further development of other circular activities. The impending digital transformation within the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’can support CE to provide these missing aspects. Starting from the consolidated CE model. the paper describes how the application of intelligent assets. Internet-of-Things and big data. could be the basis to create a more promising circular model. where CE principles are extended to the entire product life-cycle. from product design to product utilization. considering also production assets and business strategies. Some case studies. described in literature. are presented to demonstrate how smart assets can interact with circular economy to create a new and more productive model of CE. characterized by a complete and effective circular platform for materials. products. assets and processes …,True,70fzCnkAAAAJ:DUooU5lO8OsC,13,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco-Pellegrini-11/publication/330260267_A_new_productive_model_of_circular_economy_enhanced_by_digital_transformation_in_the_Fourth_Industrial_Revolution-An_integrated_framework_and_real_case_studies/links/5c36264192851c22a3677136/A-new-productive-model-of-circular-economy-enhanced-by-digital-transformation-in-the-Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-An-integrated-framework-and-real-case-studies.pdf,10971407421652280984,/scholar?cites=10971407421652280984,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco-Pellegrini-11/publication/330260267_A_new_productive_model_of_circular_economy_enhanced_by_digital_transformation_in_the_Fourth_Industrial_Revolution-An_integrated_framework_and_real_case_studies/links/5c36264192851c22a3677136/A-new-productive-model-of-circular-economy-enhanced-by-digital-transformation-in-the-Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-An-integrated-framework-and-real-case-studies.pdf,0,0,0

Separation technologies for fine PM are already well-known and adopted on an industrial scale. as a consequence of strict limits set by national and international regulations. On domestic boilers. the same technologies utilized on an industrial scale are not feasible due to high investment costs. Moreover. the emission limits for small size biomass boilers are higher than for industrial boilers. so high efficiency separation technologies are not needed. and are sometimes not present at all.

In particular. the body of water around ports is an area where intense currents and sediment transport rates are usually present and can be affected by low water velocities that take place close to the entrance and inside the port basin. Consequently. sediment can be entrained and accumulated in such areas. creating problems to navigation. Ports and moorings are filled with fine sediments due to deposition resulting from solid transport. In particular. silt particles settle because of the weak vertical and lateral shearing of the velocity field. The result is that harbours frequently require ordinary maintenance dredging.The dredging process involves the removal of sediment in its natural deposited condition by using either mechanical or hydraulic equipment.

The core of this systemic vision is the exemption of responsibility attribution for companies that adopt and implement a health and safety management system in an effective way (Italian Legislative decree 81. 9 April 2008. Art. 30). An index that can evaluate the effective implementation of OHSMS adoption has already been introduced in recent studies. This paper shows how this index can be applied into a Company and which information can be collected. useful to determine the effective implementation of the management system. with relation to its specific sector. in order to allow exemption from responsibility. in case of unpredictable accident. and to accord further reduction of assurance premium. Only the exemption of responsibility for companies with an effective implementation of OHSMS. together with an adequate incentive policy. can significantly improve occupational safety.Now the first characteristic is a function of the company size. In particular. with the actual incentive policy (ie assurance premium reduction) the payback time of the prevention investments is uncompetitive if compared to other investments. especially for small and medium enterprises. Moreover. the current management of the responsibility attribution of an accident (ie of the effective implementation of an OHSMS). which is handled in an on-off way. make even more unreliable the prevention investments. again especially for the small and medium enterprises. which have a slight probability of encountering accidents because of the small …,True,70fzCnkAAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC,10,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco_Pellegrini6/publication/283513498_Effective_implementation_measurability_in_a_health_and_safety_management_system/links/563cbb0f08ae45b5d28975f9/Effective-implementation-measurability-in-a-health-and-safety-management-system.pdf,1098437249358123829,/scholar?cites=1098437249358123829,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco_Pellegrini6/publication/283513498_Effective_implementation_measurability_in_a_health_and_safety_management_system/links/563cbb0f08ae45b5d28975f9/Effective-implementation-measurability-in-a-health-and-safety-management-system.pdf,0,0,0

Due to the low conversion efficiency (up to 5%) of commercial thermoelectric modules. the aim of the integration shall not be the electricity production for external power supply. but the energy self-consumption of biomass boiler electric auxiliaries. The paper describes and analyses four different options for the integration of thermoelectric modules within a biomass boiler: in the combustion chamber. in the convective tubes. in the chimney and with a condensing fluid circuit to be realized outside the biomass boiler. Five quantitative and qualitative key performance indicators have been defined to assess how the integration strategy can influence the electric yield of thermoelectric modules. the ease of maintenance. the operation continuity. the need of auxiliaries systems to be added as well as the impact on biomass boiler redesign or retrofit.

The simulations also reveal very different current distribution patterns for low and high load conditions. with current density maxima under the land area at low loading. and under the channel at higher loading.,True,HO1U3lQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ned_Djilali/publication/242076842_A_Three-Dimensional_Model_of_PEM_Fuel_Cells_with_Serpentine_Flow_Channels/links/56c4ffd908ae736e704710af/A-Three-Dimensional-Model-of-PEM-Fuel-Cells-with-Serpentine-Flow-Channels.pdf,11952854151947583063,/scholar?cites=11952854151947583063,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ned_Djilali/publication/242076842_A_Three-Dimensional_Model_of_PEM_Fuel_Cells_with_Serpentine_Flow_Channels/links/56c4ffd908ae736e704710af/A-Three-Dimensional-Model-of-PEM-Fuel-Cells-with-Serpentine-Flow-Channels.pdf,0,0,0

CO2-saturated solutions,2020,Phong Nguyen and George D Guthrie Jr and J William Carey,100,International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control,,103112,Elsevier,We present constant-flow experiments of high-pressure CO2-saturated fluid through fracture channels in Portland cement with three different fracture geometries and with three different flow rates. The experiments were conducted in etched cement wafers within a microfluidics device. The evolution of pH was observed optically using phenolphthalein dye and changes in channel volume due to dissolution and/or precipitation were characterized with profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. Abundant precipitation for all three geometries was observed in the low flow-rate experiments. while only dissolution was observed in the high-flow rate experiments. The results bracket self-sealing versus self-opening behavior. The observed functional relationship among flow rate. fracture geometry and aperture in relation to self-sealing is consistent with a diverse set of experiments in the literature conducted under widely …,True,HO1U3lQAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750583620301705,14635634994243902199,/scholar?cites=14635634994243902199,,,,0,0,0

Because channels have micro-scale textures and macro-scale geometries. this transport can differ from the case of ideally smooth channels. Surfaces of real channels have irregular boundary conditions to which streamlines adapt and with which particle interact. In low-Reynolds number flows. particles may experience inertial forces that result in trans-streamline movement and the reorganization of particle distributions. Such transport is intrinsically 3D and an accurate measurement must capture movement in all directions. To measure the effects of non-ideal surface textures on particle transport through complex networks. we developed an extended field-of-view 3D macroscope for high-resolution tracking across large volumes () and investigated a model multichannel …,True,HO1U3lQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70728-1,,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70728-1,0,0,0

Using a specially designed astigmatic macroscope for tracking in micron-to millimeter-scale networks. we measure in 3D the transport of particles through a microfluidic device with multiple channel branches (a surrogate system for fractured networks). The size of the particles establishes an initial distribution before entering that is then affected by the branching throughout the entire network. Larger particles form an annulus due to inertial focusing. This distribution. once established. does not permit particles to be transported into some segments of the channel network. However. smaller particles have a uniform distribution in the microfluidic device and pass into all of the branches. organizing …,True,HO1U3lQAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.H41E..08R/abstract,,,,,,0,0,0

These fluid pathways have long been identified as potential leakage pathways in sequestration operations. with some operators seeking to change the reactivity of their well cement to minimize dissolution in the event of acidified brine leakage. However. mineral precipitation of dissolved species has been proposed as a terminating step further into the flow system allowing for the self-sealing of the wellbore flowpath.

Albuquerque. NM (United States),This study is concerned with the extreme response of a two-body wave point absorber (Reference Model 3 or RM3)[1]. This device. which serves as a wave energy converter (WEC). is a simple two-body point absorber consisting of a float and a reaction plate. Power generation results from heave motion induced by waves. We use the open-source simulation tool (Wave Energy Converter Simulator or WEC-Sim) to carry out simulations of the device. We are interested in site-specific design loads associated with a 50-year return period. Accordingly. we use the Inverse FORM approach in this study [2. 3]. The deployment site of interest for this device is near National Data Buoy Center Site 46022. We are most interested in discussing how the availability of metocean data from such sites may be used to define “environmental contours” that help to derive design loads. We show how. given the same metocean data. we can either estimate joint distributions or marginal distributions of the underlying variables together with different correlation measures. These two different approaches. both consistent with the data. lead to somewhat different environmental contours used for design.,True,HO1U3lQAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,0,http://marineenergytechnologysymposium.org/download/2017/0010_FI.pdf,,,,,http://marineenergytechnologysymposium.org/download/2017/0010_FI.pdf,0,0,0

Parametric studies. based on local stability analysis of a family of time-average velocity profiles modeling those observed in recirculating flows. show that the frequency of the absolute mode is determined primarily by the shear layer thickness. and the growth rate of the absolute mode is controlled by the amount of backflow. Given the known streamwise variation of the local velocity profile in the actual flow. this implies that the oscillations are likely to be generated at the middle of the recirculation zone. where the backflow is sufficiently strong. and shear layer thickness is comparable to the step height. The corresponding frequency is determined to be St=O(0.1). because the shear layer thickness is bounded by the step height.

Because of the low flame temperature and the lack of hot regions for flame stabilization. lean blowout (LBO) has become a major technical challenge for dry-low-emission gas turbines. especially when they are operating at low-power conditions [1]. LBO is a significant safety hazard for aeroengines and necessitates an expensive and time-consuming shutdown and restarting procedure for stationary engines.

In this paper. we discuss another mechanism in which the resonator may not be the acoustic field: instead. it is an absolutely unstable shear layer mode acting as the source of sustained oscillations; which morph as large-scale eddies at a frequency different from acoustic modes. These perturb the flame motion and provide energy to the acoustic field. acting here as an amplifier to support pressure oscillations.

Dynamic-mode decomposition (DMD)–a frequency-resolved data-reduction technique–is used to identify and characterize recurrent flow structures. Illustrative results are presented in a swirling flow field for two cases–the nominal flow dynamics and where self-excited combustion driven oscillations provide strong axisymmetric narrowband forcing of the flow. The robust constituent of the nominal reacting swirl flow corresponds to a helical shear-layer disturbance at a Strouhal number (St) of∼ 0.30. St= fD/U0. where f. D and U0 denote the precessing vortex core (PVC) frequency (∼ 800 Hz). the swirler exit diameter (19 mm) and the bulk velocity at the swirler exit (50 ms− 1) respectively. Planar projections of the PVC reveal a pair of oscillating skew-symmetric regions of velocity. vorticity and OH-PLIF intensity that rotate in the same direction as the mean tangential flow. During combustion instabilities. the large-amplitude acoustics-induced axisymmetric forcing of the flow results in a fundamentally different flow response dominated by a nearly axisymmetric disturbance and almost complete suppression of the large-scale helical shear-layer disturbances dominating the nominal flow. In addition. reverse axial flows around the centreline are significantly reduced.

HCO is a good indicator of the instantaneous heat release rate. even in the presence of large strain rates [1].

While some of these frequencies are related to the acoustic field. others appear to be related to shear flow instability phenomena. It is shown in this paper that shear flows can support self-sustained instabilities if they possess absolutely unstable modes. The associated frequencies are predicted using mean velocity profiles that resemble those observed in separating flows and for profiles obtained from numerical simulations. and are shown to match those derived from experimental and numerical investigations.

Their biochemical stability and high concentration of solids and nutrients are the major technical challenges towards effective treatments in the existing wastewater treatment systems. A subsurface vertical-flow engineered wetland (VFEW) is. therefore. introduced as a feasible decentralized septage treatment option for small or medium communities due to its abilities in achieving excellent treatment and energy efficiency and reasonable cost through a simple operation. In general. the VFEW removes suspended solids. organic matter and nitrogenous components constituted in raw septage efficiently and sustainably. This paper presents a critical review on the state-of-the art of septage treatment using vertical-flow engineered wetland with regards to their characteristics and operation. The system-factor such as substrate profile and operational factors such as solid loading rate (SLR) and frequency of loading have been generally agreed as major factors governing the effectiveness of VFEWs. The selection of substrates is crucial to ensure a long-term usability of the VFEW with regards to the clogging phenomenon. The SLR. which ranged from 30 to 250 kg TS m-2 y-1. is of great importance to the treatment capability.

Despite the hydrophobic nature of PAN. the product can be dissolved in water at a high concentration (≥100 g/L). The product exhibits complete absence of alkenes or aromatic structures. and photoluminescence originates from newly formed N- and O-containing groups. The presence of both n to π* and π to π* transitions is confirmed by time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations. The efficient transformation of PAN benefits from the enhanced hydrolysis of nitrile groups.

First. the introduction of a dynamic electricity pricing system. with peak and off-peak prices. will be a reality for 80% of electricity consumers by 2020. The proposed pricing schedule intends to discourage energy consumption during peak periods (i.e.. when electricity demand on the national grid is high) and to incentivize energy consumption during off-peak periods. If farmers. for example. carry out their evening milking during the peak period. energy costs may increase. which would affect farm profitability. Second. electricity consumption is identified in contributing to about 25% of energy use along the life cycle of pasture-based milk. The objectives of this study. therefore. were to document electricity use per kilogram of milk sold and to identify strategies that reduce its overall use while maximizing its use in off-peak periods …,True,ywUhKK8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,72,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030213005353,574440768653631688,/scholar?cites=574440768653631688,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030213005353,0,0,0

1288286,Dairy farm energy consumption,2010,John Upton and Michael Murphy and Padraig French and Pat Dillon,,Dairying: Entering a decade of opportuniy. Teagasc National Dairy Conference,,87-97,,• Energy audits have shown that electricity usage contributes on average. 0.60 cent/litre to milk production costs. In terms of electricity consumption per dairy cow milked. the figures vary from 4 kWh/cow/week to 7.3 kWh/cow/week. This is equivalent to€ 0.60/cow/week to€ 1.10/cow/week.• Key opportunities for reducing energy consumption include; o Eliminate energy wastage; fix all hot water leaks. insulate all hot water piping and refrigerant gas piping and use lights only when necessary. A leak as small as one litre per hour can waste 8500 litres of hot water and 3800 kWh per year. o Optimise plate cooling by increasing water flow to achieve the correct water to milk flow ratios. Increasing the milk to water flow ratios from 1: 1 to 1: 3 can reduce power consumed by the bulk tank by over 40%. o Switch all water heating to night rate only; consider using an oil fired boiler. o Consider using a variable speed drive controller on vacuum pumps. This can save over 60% on vacuum pump running costs. o Use energy efficient lighting.• There is scope for Irish dairying to increase energy efficiency thereby helping to reduce costs while at the same time reduce greenhouse gas emissions.,True,ywUhKK8AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,16,https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/rural-economy/farm-management/DairyFarmEnergyCoonsumption.pdf,15772944712130122365,/scholar?cites=15772944712130122365,,,https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/rural-economy/farm-management/DairyFarmEnergyCoonsumption.pdf,0,0,0

The research was carried out experimentally by means of a real-scale PASLINK test cell facility. located in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain. The results of an experiment performed in March 2010 are presented and evaluated. The behavior of the façade was compared with different traditional constructive systems. using the results of computational simulations performed with the Design Builder software. The experimental results showed that the melting–solidification processes that take place in the PCM led to an increase in the heat absorption during the phase-change temperature intervals. which reduced overheating of the façade. The air circulating through the ventilated chamber was overheated up to 12 °C during the daytime.

The present work optimizes these parameters for market ready phase change materials (PCM) that are suitable in the aforementioned temperature range.

To broaden the limits of applicability for this approach. this study develops natural convection Nusselt correlations for high temperature shell-and-tube LHTES systems. which are under development for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants.

In the case of solid–liquid PCM. a large amount of thermal energy can be stored and released in a small temperature range around the solid–liquid phase transition. Therefore. to test the long-term stability of solid–liquid PCM. they are subjected to melting and solidification processes taking into account the conditions of the intended application. In this work. 18 experimental devices to investigate the long-term stability of PCM are presented.

Ltd.,One of the key factors that currently limits the commercial deployment of thermal energy storage (TES) systems is their complex design procedure. especially in the case of latent heat TES systems. Design procedures should address both the specificities of the TES system under consideration and those of the application to be integrated within. This article presents a fast and easy to apply methodology for the selection of the design of TES systems suitable for both direct and indirect contact sensible and latent TES. The methodology is divided into four steps covering: (a) description of the thermal process or application. (b) definition of the specifications to be met by the TES system. (c) characterization of the specific TES system under consideration and (d) the determination of the TES design.

Economics and energy related disciplines have thus far developed tools to measure such a phenomenon. This paper attempts to explain this seeming paradox using a thermodynamic-evolutionary theoretical framework in addition to the traditional economic approach. We here propose that evolutionary systems. such as biological or even economic systems. may rearrange themselves in a more complex fashion under the pressure of an increasing flux of energy. driven by the higher conversion rate of greater efficiency. Higher complexity. due to a greater energy density rate. counteracts the positive effects of energy efficiency.

While special types of symmetries (eg. automorphisms) are studied in detail within discrete mathematics for particular classes of deterministic graphs. the analysis of more general symmetries in real complex networks is far less developed. We argue that real networks. as any entity characterized by imperfections or errors. necessarily require a stochastic notion of invariance. We therefore propose a definition of stochastic symmetry based on graph ensembles and use it to review the main results of network theory from an unusual perspective. The results discussed here and in a companion paper show that stochastic symmetry highlights the most informative topological properties of real networks. even in noisy situations unaccessible to exact techniques.

After a brief review of the related economic literature. a thermodynamic perspective tackles this topic by demonstrating that the dispute over the size of the rebound effect relies on a misconception of the thermodynamic nature of energy efficiency. The dichotomy. in fact. concerns the relationship between efficiency and power output rather than the scale of the economic side effects generated by energy efficiency mutations. Early intuitions of the dichotomy efficiency/power belong to the pioneering works of Stanley Jevons. in the field of economics. and Alfred Lotka in that of biology.

Quantitatively. distances enter into the so-called gravity models that successfully predict the weight of non-zero trade flows. However. it has been recently shown that gravity models fail to reproduce the binary topology of the World Trade Web.

Then. the information encoded in the geographical distances is used to explain the binary structure of the World Trade Web. by testing it on the degree-degree correlations and the reciprocity structure.

Here we argue that if links are directed. then dependencies are twofold. Besides the ordinary tendency of links of different layers to align as the result of “multiplexity.” there is also a tendency to antialign as a result of what we call “multireciprocity.” ie. the fact that links in one layer can be reciprocated by opposite links in a different layer. Multireciprocity generalizes the scalar definition of single-layer reciprocity to that of a square matrix involving all pairs of layers. We introduce multiplexity and multireciprocity matrices for both binary and weighted multiplexes and validate their statistical significance against maximum-entropy null models that filter out the effects of node heterogeneity.

A major structural change occurred in the beginning of the century as GVCs steadily turned into global networks. amid an unprecedented growth of value-added flows and the rise of China as a major player. First-order network metrics highlight the vital but also distinct roles of Germany. the US. China and Japan in the international organisation of production.

This is why energy efficiency is prompted by many as an absolute remedy for the evils of energy use. such as the environmental pressure or the security of supply. Nevertheless. historically energy consumptions at the world level have always been growing in spite of—or perhaps because of—an increasing level of energy efficiency. Some scholars have called this paradox the rebound effect. The rebound effect (REE) is an unintended consequence of the introduction of more energy-efficient technology. It occurs when the reduction in energy consumption is less than that expected from the magnitude of the increase in energy efficiency.

Since the seminal work of Stanley Jevons (“The Coal Question”). the “problem” of the rebound effect has repeatedly appeared in energy policy debates. challenging the consensus that improved energy efficiency will reduce energy use and carbon emissions and mitigate resource depletion. Most authors view energy efficiency as essential for reconciling economic growth with environmental sustainability. and consider rebound effects to be modest in size and easily addressed. However. there has always been a vocal minority who argue that rebound effects frequently exceed 100% and can potentially eliminate all of the energy savings from improved energy efficiency (“Jevons’ Paradox”). This contentious and polarized debate has largely been confined to the academic world. with only occasional infringements into the public sphere. Until recently. the empirical research on rebound effects was also relatively modest. with< 10 articles per year mentioning the topic between 1998 and 2008. However. academic interest in the topic has exploded since 2008. with more than 50 articles being published each year between 2015 and 2019.

1288366,Efficiency and the rebound effect in the hegemonic discourse on energy,2018,Franco Ruzzenenti and Aleksandra Wagner,13,Nature and Culture,3,356-377,Berghahn Journals,The aim of the article is to discuss the unintended consequences of energy efficiency. in the context of defuturization. by addressing the phenomenon of the rebound effect. The energy discourse is presented as ideological discourse protecting the status quo. even if it contemplates alternatives solutions. The interpretation of energy efficiency in the light of the Luhmannian concept of temporal structures in the modern society is proposed. and two types of expert narratives on the rebound effect are outlined: the mechanistic rebound effect and the systemic Jevons paradox. Finally. we explain why none of them are noticeably reflected in public discourse on energy policy and are limited to the scientific milieu.,True,5-SzOq4AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,6,https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/nature-and-culture/13/3/nc130303.xml?pdfVersion=true,12231326288344177383,/scholar?cites=12231326288344177383,,,,0,0,0
1288367,Energy growth. complexity and efficiency,2010,Franco Ruzzenenti and Riccardo Basosi,,Energy efficiency,,27,BoD–Books on Demand,Over the last two centuries. the human capacity to harness energy or transform heat into work. has dramatically improved. Since the first steam engine appeared in Great Britain. the first order thermodynamic efficiency (the rate of useful work over the heat released by the energy source) has soared from a mere 1% to the 40% of present engines. up to the 70% of the most recent power plants. Despite this efficiency revolution. energy consumption per capita has always increased (Banks. 2007).The economy and society have undeniably faced an expanding frontier. and both household and global energy intensities have commonly been linked to economic growth and social progress. The rising issue of energy conservation has prompted us to consider energy efficiency as more than merely a characteristic of economic growth. but also as a cause (Ayres and Warr. 2004). We thus wonder if it is possible to increase efficiency. reduce global energy consumption. and foster economic development within an energy decreasing pattern. by separating efficiency and energy growth. In other words. by reducing efficiency positive feed-backs on the system’s energy level (Alcott. 2008). In 1865. the economist Stanley Jevons was the first to point out the existence of a circular causal process linking energy efficiency. energy use. and the economic system. Jevons was convinced that efficiency was a driving force of energy growth and highlighted the risk associated with an energy conservation policy thoroughly committed to efficiency1. Recently the Jevon’s paradox has been approached in the field of Economics and termed “rebound effect”.

We present a new measure of cross-layer correlations between flows in different layers based on reciprocity.

We find that short-term financial flows are more correlated with environmental flows than long-term investments. Moreover. the correlations between reverse financial and environmental flows (i.e. the flows of different layers going in opposite directions) are generally stronger than correlations between synergic flows (flows going in the same direction). This suggests a trade-off between financial and environmental layers. where. more financialised countries display higher correlations between outgoing financial flows and incoming environmental flows than from lower financialised countries.

A salient feature of this commodity bubble was the dramatic increasing in the correlation of indexed commodities with oil price following the financialisation of the oil market.

To better understand the root causes of this financial instability. we quantify the relative importance of various drivers behind subprime borrowers' decision to default. In our econometric model. we allow borrowers to default either because doing so increases their lifetime wealth or because of short-term budget constraints. treating the decision as the outcome of a bivariate probit model with partial observability. We estimate our model using detailed loan-level data from LoanPerformance and the Case-Shiller home price index. According to our results. one main driver of default is the nationwide decrease in home prices. The decline in home prices caused many borrowers' outstanding mortgage liability to exceed their home value. and for these borrowers default can increase their wealth. Another important driver is deteriorating loan quality: The increase of borrowers with poor credit and high payment to income ratios elevates default rates in the subprime market. We discuss policy implications of our results. Our findings point to flaws in the securitization process that led to the current wave of defaults. Also. we use our model to evaluate alternative policies aimed at reducing the rate of default.,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,248,https://www.nber.org/papers/w14625,8105610810534460330,/scholar?cites=8105610810534460330,,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14625/w14625.pdf,0,0,0

Key issues of policy concern include quantifying the role of various factors. such as home price declines and loosened underwriting standards. in the recent increase in subprime defaults and predicting the effects of various policy instruments designed to mitigate default. To address these questions. we estimate a dynamic structural model of subprime borrowers’ default behavior. We prove that borrowers’ time preference is identified in our model and propose an easily implementable semiparametric plug-in estimator. Our results show that principal writedowns have a significant effect on borrowers’ default behavior and welfare: a uniform 10% reduction in outstanding mortgage balance for the pool of borrowers in our sample would reduce the overall default probability by 22%. and borrowers’ average willingness to pay for the principal writedown would be $16.643,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,23,https://www.nber.org/papers/w18850,9347891759089869415,/scholar?cites=9347891759089869415,,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18850/w18850.pdf,0,0,0

Stanford University,Under mixed bundling a firm that sells K products can set different prices for all (2K− 1) bundled combinations of its products. For two products there are three possible prices: two component prices and a price for the bundle of both products. For five products there are 31 possible prices. and for 10 products there are 1.023 possible prices. Perhaps unsurprisingly. observed pricing strategies of multiproduct firms tend to be much simpler than what is theoretically possible. In this study we examine the profitability of incomplex alternatives to mixed bundling. which have the benefit of being much simpler to implement in practice. We show that incomplex alternatives often yield profits within a few percentage points of mixed bundling.

1288389,An Empirical Model of Subprime Mortgage Default from 2000 to 2007,2008,Minjung Park and Patrick Bajari and Chenghuan Sean Chu,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,We quantify the relative importance of various drivers behind subprime borrowers’ decision to default. In our econometric model. we allow borrowers to default either because doing so increases their lifetime wealth or because of short-term credit constraints. taking into account that either factor by itself is suffi cient to induce default. Our model also incorporates various proxies for borrowers’ beliefs about future housing prices without imposing beliefs that are necessarily rational. According to our results. the two key drivers behind the recent increase in defaults are the nationwide decrease in home prices and the increase in the number of borrowers with poor credit and high payment-to-income ratios. We use our model to evaluate alternative policies aimed at reducing the rate of default.,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13250562627916218729&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13250562627916218729,/scholar?cites=13250562627916218729,,,,0,0,0
1288390,Adverse or maybe not-so-adverse selection in the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Security Market,2011,Chenghuan Sean Chu,3,"Federal Trade Commission Microeconomics Conference. Washington, DC, November",,,,The commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) market is. in theory. subject to adverse selection at the margin between loans that are securitized in-house by the originator and loans sold to competing CMBS underwriters. However. heterogeneous monitoring costs and other causal mechanisms affecting ex post loan performance can also explain why mortgages securitized in-house tend to perform better (as measured by default-adjusted returns) after controlling for observable loan characteristics. Moreover. portfolio diversification incentives may actually lead to selection for in-house loans that have worse ex ante characteristics. I quantify the relative importance of selection versus causal effects. I first estimate the marginal and joint distribution of loan returns. I then use these estimates as inputs to a model of CMBS pool formation in which competing firms buy and sell loans from each other to form bundles of loans to be securitized. The estimation exploits moment inequalities implied by optimality conditions. and considers alternative specifications of the information structure of the game. The results indicate that ex post causal mechanisms more than account for the better performance of in-house loans. The causal effect outweighs non-random selection. which actually has the net effect of selecting for in-house loans with worse ex ante characteristics. The importance of ex post mechanisms suggests that regulatory reform for securitization markets should aim to mitigate moral hazard rather than adverse selection.,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,1,https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/fourth-annual-microeconomics-conference/chu.pdf,2313896367050032677,/scholar?cites=2313896367050032677,,,https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/fourth-annual-microeconomics-conference/chu.pdf,0,0,0

1288393,Empirical Analysis of Credit Ratings Inflation as a Game of Incomplete Information,2013,Chenghuan Sean Chu,,,,,,I study rating agency behavior in the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). CMBS issuers hire rating agencies in a manner akin to an auction. where an agency’s “bid” comprises a stated standard for a security to get a AAA rating. Equilibrium ratings give a biased representation of agencies’ true beliefs due to a selection effect (only the most favorable ratings are published) and because the agencies trade off between incentives to rate truthfully and incentives to bid strategically in order to increase the probability of being hired to rate the deal. I identify the agencies’ true beliefs by modeling bidding behavior and exploiting a novel source of bidder-specific data. I find that the true beliefs are an important predictor of the ex post realized performance of the securities. even after controlling for the equilibrium ratings. I also investigate the extent of ratings distortion under various counterfactual regimes motivated by proposed policy reforms.,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/Federal%20Trade%20Commission%20Microeconomics%20Conference/chu.pdf,,,,,https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/Federal%20Trade%20Commission%20Microeconomics%20Conference/chu.pdf,0,0,0

An Empirical Model of Subprime Mortgage Default from 2000 to 2007,2008,Patrick Bajari and NBER Sean Chu and Minjung Park,,,,,,To understand the relative importance of various incentives for subprime borrowers to default on their mortgages. we build an econometric model that nests various potential drivers of borrower behavior. We allow borrowers to default on their mortgages either because doing so increases their lifetime utility or because of the borrowersoinability to pay. treating the decision as the outcome of a bivariate probit specification with partial observability. We estimate our model using detailed loan% level data from LoanPerformance and the Case% Shiller home price index. and find that liquidity constraints are as empirically important an explanation as declining house prices for the increase in subprime defaults over recent years. Expectations about future home price movements and changes in the interest rate environment also contributed to the recent rise in defaults. but their actual effects are not large.,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1078.6636&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1078.6636&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Existing models have dealt with various combinations of assumptions about market struc-ture and demand. such as whether firms are monopolistic or competitive. whether consumers are horizontally or vertically differentiated (or both). whether resale is possible. or whether firms engage in exclusive dealing with upstream suppliers. However. beyond the well-understood one-dimensional monopoly screening problem. the empirical study of endogenous quality is still in its infancy.,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12910266235692865615&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0
1288397,A Dynamic Model of Subprime Mortgage Default: Estimation and Policy Implications1,,Sean Chu and Denis Nekipelov and Minjung Park,,,,,,The increase in defaults in the subprime mortgage market is widely held to be one of the causes behind the recent financial turmoil. Key issues of policy concern include quantifying the role of various factors. such as home price declines and loosened underwriting standards. in the recent increase in subprime defaults and predicting the effects of various policy instruments designed to mitigate default. To address these questions. we estimate a dynamic structural model of subprime borrowersqdefault behavior. We prove that borrowersqtime preference is identified in our model and propose an easily implementable semiparametric plug'in estimator. Our results show that principal writedowns have a significant effect on borrowersqdefault behavior and welfare: a uniform 10% reduction in outstanding mortgage balance for the pool of borrowers in our sample would reduce the overall default probability by 22%. and borrowersqaverage willingness to pay for the principal writedown would be $16.643.,True,mZPpNgwAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C,0,https://eml.berkeley.edu/~nekipelov/pdf_papers/paper17.pdf,,,,,https://eml.berkeley.edu/~nekipelov/pdf_papers/paper17.pdf,0,0,0

The paper reports about the changes in crystalline phases of three different compounds namely: aluminium oxide (Al2O3). aluminium nitride (AlN) and iron oxide (FexOy) synthesized at 760 Torr and 500 Torr of operating pressures.

1288428,Photoelectrets and their applications,1971,PKC Pillai and Malti Goel,6,,1,9-27,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,The study of the photoelectret state has recently attracted great attention on account of its various practical applications and also because of its importance as a powerful tool in the understanding of photoconducting solids. It has become a subject of great interest because of the fundamental insight it gives into the electronic and ionic processes resulting from its studies. The utility of photoelectrets arises from the fact that they exhibit persistent polarization by means of simple conversion of radiation into electronic charge in the presence of an applied field.This review article provides a brief discussion on the various experimental techniques in the production and measurement of photoelectrets. It also gives a detailed treatment of current theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of photoelectret formation and their characteristics together with some of their salient pratical applications.

The work of rupture was calculated from the area under the stress extension curves. The contribution made by some of the energy absorbing mechanisms like plastic deformation of the matrix. debonding. and fibre pull-out to the total work have been considered in some detail. In the extrusion direction. and at angles up to 30° to this direction. the interfacial shear stress and load transfer are high. Consequently. the plastic deformation of the matrix througout the specimen volume. and particularly around fibre ends. makes a dominant contribution to the work of rupture. with a small but significant contribution from debonding and also from fibre pullout at the fracture …,True,0O0NLG4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,39,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/026635389090009T,15782256266027090093,/scholar?cites=15782256266027090093,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Malti_Goel/publication/223005173_Energy_absorbing_mechanisms_in_short-glass-fibre-reinforced_polypropylene/links/5b49df330f7e9b4637d67faf/Energy-absorbing-mechanisms-in-short-glass-fibre-reinforced-polypropylene.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,The thermally stimulated current (TSC) technique has been used to study solvent‐cast blends of a cellulose derivative with a vinyl polymer. TSC peaks are observed at 56. 80. and 120°C. Their origin is investigated because the TSC spectra of the blends differ from the spectra of the individual components. Data on blends with components in the weight ratios 25:75. 50:50. and 75:25 indicate that the 50:50 blend shows the greatest polarization. The enhancement of depolarization currents observed on blending is explained on the basis of a Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization due to increased heterogeneity in the structure. Effects of forming conditions (time. temperature. field) on polarization have been investigated. Activation energies and relaxation times are calculated; there is good agreement between the values obtained from the initial‐rise and the full‐curve methods.,True,0O0NLG4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,39,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pol.1981.180190917,3817822948014843708,/scholar?cites=3817822948014843708,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49296341/pol.1981.18019091720161002-27162-f872hs.pdf,0,0,0

1288449,Carbon capture and storage: science and technology focus for mitigation of climate change,2010,Malti Goel,19,Int Assoc Energy Econ,,37-40,,Global warming is attributed to increasing greenhouse gas emissions and mounting concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Since the middle of the 19th century. increasing worldwide anthropogenic activity is said to have given rise to a steady increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is corroborated by direct measurement of CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa Laboratory in Hawaii (USA). The CO2. present in the atmosphere as a trace gas. has an average atmospheric concentration of 280 ppmv. In 1958 the observed concentration was 315 ppmv. which suggested an increase of about 0.5 ppmv per year in the initial half of the 20th century. In 2005 the measured concentration of CO2 was 374 ppmv. suggesting an increase of about 1 ppmv per year in the latter part of the 20th century. The rising concentration of CO2 is ascribed mainly to the use of fossil fuels—coal. oil and gas—for energy production and consumption. According to the International Energy Outlook 2007. world energy consumption is expected to grow from 442 quadrillion Btu (~ 750 billion boe) in 2004 to 702 quadrillion Btu (~ 1200 bboe) in 2030.

Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) offers an alternative negative emissions technology (NET) option. Here we conduct the first inter-model comparison on the role of DACCS in 1.5 and 2 C scenarios. under a variety of techno-economic assumptions. Deploying DACCS significantly reduces mitigation costs. and it complements rather than substitutes other NETs. The key factor limiting DACCS deployment is the rate at which it can be scaled up. Our scenarios’ average DACCS scale-up rates of 1.5 GtCO 2/yr would require considerable sorbent production and up to 300 EJ/yr of energy input by 2100. The risk of assuming that DACCS can be deployed at scale. and finding it to be subsequently unavailable. leads to a global temperature overshoot of up to 0.8 C.

However. concerns of significant trade-offs between climate change mitigation and other sustainable development goals include increased deforestation. and losses of biodiversity and water quality. Moreover. higher emissions of non-CO2 gases. especially methane and nitrous oxide. may reduce the emissions mitigation potential of bioenergy production. since emission of these gases is mostly associated with agriculture and land use. Bioenergy production provides the link between land use and agriculture on the one hand and energy systems on the other. To date. few studies have assessed in an integrated manner the interlinkages in Brazil between these sectors. as well as the impacts on mitigation potential of bioenergy from nonCO2 gas emissions resulting from its production. This thesis presents a modelling framework to explore these interlinkages by hard-linking agriculture. land use and energy systems in a single modelling platform. It then explores scenarios for Brazil’s contribution towards global climate change mitigation efforts. highlighting the cross-sectoral impacts of meeting Paris Agreement goals. In addition. it assesses the role of non-CO2 gases in Brazil’s emissions profiles. including a novel analysis of how the choice of Tier 1 versus Tier 2 agricultural N2O emission factors impacts modelled energy system solutions.,True,7bgJ8tEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,9,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13132228283622805983&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13132228283622805983,/scholar?cites=13132228283622805983,,,http://antigo.ppe.ufrj.br/ppe/production/tesis/aKoberle.pdf,0,0,0

The control is designed by extending the logic of SMA and integrating it with the LMI technique to develop a single-gain feedback controller that is capable of damping oscillations in large systems. It is an integrated form of control because it combines different controllers together so as to prevent any negative interaction between the individual controls. The proposed technique is initially applied to an equivalent model of the WECC system developed in MATLAB and then transferred to a larger and more detailed version created in PSLF. The controllers initially used for the design are the two HVDC lines and an SVC. Three ESDs are added to the model for the improvement of the control.

The problem is challenging because of the large number of contingencies that are to be simulated. In this paper a fast method for power system contingency screening and ranking for small signal stability assessment is presented which essentially reduces the number of contingencies for detailed evaluation. The proposed method avoids repeated computation of eigenvalues for all possible post-contingency scenarios.

A critical challenge that utilities face with adoption of ADMS is the quality of models and data that the ADMS uses for making control decisions.

1288490,Maximizing the Benefits of Volt/VAR Optimization in the Presence of Community Energy Storage,2018,Shailendra Singh and Santosh Veda and SP Singh and Murali Baggu,,,,1-6,IEEE,This paper reports on the need for coordinating smart grid volt/volt-ampere reactive (VAR) control (VVC) and community energy storage (CES) to maximize the benefits of both approaches. It addresses a key application of volt/VAR optimization (VVO): the conservation of voltage reduction (CVR). The lack of coordination among network controls. such as VVO. and asset controls at the community battery storage system can lead to detrimental effects on grid operation. A smart grid-enabled VVC uses the VVO to perform the CVR operation. VVO can perform numerous tasks for advanced distribution management systems with coordination of the system operator. To achieve the optimal VVC solution. we use a particle swarm optimization driven VVO method. The test system has been simulated for two scenarios-during light loading and high loading condition-with and without the CES system.

1288495,WAMS-based intelligent load shedding scheme for preventing cascading blackouts,2013,Santosh Sambamoorthy Veda,,,,,,Severe disturbances in a large electrical interconnection cause a large mismatch in generation and load in the network. leading to frequency instability. If the mismatch is not rectified quickly. the system may disintegrate into multiple islands. Though the Automatic Generation Controls (AGC) perform well in correcting frequency deviation over a period of minutes. they are ineffective during a rolling blackout. While traditional Under Frequency Load Shedding Schemes (UFLS) perform quick control actions to arrest frequency decline in an islanded network. they are not designed to prevent unplanned islanding. The proposed Intelligent Load Shedding algorithm combines the effectiveness of AGC Scheme by observing tie line flows and the speed of operation of the UFLS Scheme by shedding loads intelligently. to preserve system integrity in the event of an evolving cascading failure. The proposed scheme detects and estimates the size of an event by monitoring the tie lines of a control area using Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) and initiates load shedding by removing loads whose locations are optimally determined by a sensitivity analysis. The amount and location of the load shedding depends on the location and size of the initiating event. making the proposed algorithm adaptive and selective. Case Studies have been presented to show that control actions of the proposed scheme can directly mitigate a cascading blackout.,True,-jkM-D8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/19251,13114613563684761201,/scholar?cites=13114613563684761201,,,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/19251/Veda_SS_D_2013.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The use of smart sensors and controls for remote monitoring are integral to the Smart Grid’s operation. One of the most effective ways to assess the insulation condition of high voltage equipment. particularly high voltage cables. is partial discharge (PD) monitoring. In recent years. digital signal processing techniques have been developed to process the PD signal and to date. the wavelet based decomposition technique has proven to be a promising tool for extracting PD signals from noise. This paper outlines the online PD measurement method that is used to collect real data from an electricity distribution substation in Australia. Various techniques for extracting the PD signal from noise are compared and reviewed.

The strategy predicts the customer's load demand and the photovoltaics (PV) power generation for a day-ahead EM. It utilizes the PV power generations and the bidirectional energy transactions from electric vehicles and battery storage to provide a combined response for load support. The system also predicts any uncertainties in customers demand and power generations and implements day-ahead precautionary measures to tackle that uncertainty. Two different prediction strategies are used. autoregressive moving average and artificial neural networks. and their performances for a day-ahead EM are investigated.

The variable dc voltage of the PV array is fed as input to the ICBC and the output voltage of the ICBC is maintained constant with the firing angle of the LCI being fixed at an appropriate value greater than 90°. The interesting feature of this scheme is that. it is not mandatory that the constant dc-link voltage should be more than the peak value of the grid voltage. As the array voltage is now boosted and fixed at the dc link. any variation in the PV output power is reflected in the variation of the dc-link current and hence only one parameter (the dc-link current) sensing is required for the MPPT.

Wind farms are concentrated in the rural areas where the existing transmission grids are very weak. In addition. the wind farms were developed during a comparatively short period of time in a few areas. and the reinforcement of the transmission systems in these areas has lagged behind the fast development of wind energy [1]. In case of fixed-speed wind turbines equipped with induction generators. reactive power support is needed at WECS terminals for voltage regulation and improvement of low voltage ridethrough capabilities.

Facing the application of set-point temperatures. the adaptive comfort model proposes the linking of the comfort temperature to the outdoor temperature which would potentially reduce the use of the HVAC system.

In the current study an adaptive comfort algorithm for hybrid buildings is experimentally validated based on a 17-month field study in office buildings in Spain. The implementation of the algorithm in the HVAC control system. both during the cooling and the heating period. allowed for the evaluation of the energy consumption. obtaining savings of 27.5% and 11.4% respectively.

In particular. historic buildings are an important cultural heritage that. in most cases. may be rehabilitated and reused for new purposes. However. achieving higher efficiencies in those buildings presents many difficulties. since there is a need to preserve aesthetic values and minimize impact on the buildings’ initial construction. In this work. a roadmap that allows rehabilitating a building from the eighteenth century is developed. turning it into a landmark building. to be used as a museum in the near future. The procedure is based on 3D models using REVIT software and detailed energy simulations supported by a cost-optimal methodology. The results reveal how conventional methodologies shown in the literature may improve the energy performance of the buildings during the heating regime. but performance may deteriorate during the cooling season. For that reason. the present study includes the design of a night ventilation system which allows not only solving this problem but also to reducing the cooling demands by more than 43% with little additional costs. In conclusion. historic buildings (which traditionally have a high thermal mass) have increased thermal storage potential by using the structures of the buildings themselves as well as passive cooling techniques.

A digital representation to support the development. calibration. and training of a physical-based reduced-order model for industrial furnaces is sought by integrating experimental data obtained in energy audits performed at several industrial units with detailed numerical results from computational fluid dynamics simulations of the furnaces. Composite models with two blocks. a physics-based reduced-order block. and a machine learning model block. are proposed in order to simultaneously achieve performance and flexibility in its adaptation to different furnaces. while keeping the computational load in acceptable levels. In this paper. preliminary results of the application of the method to a billet heating furnace are presented. namely the results of the computational fluid dynamics simulations of the furnace and their comparison with the measurements performed in an energy audit.

Two different scenarios were considered: (i) the residues are converted locally at the mills or (ii) transported to a centralized power plant. To evaluate the existing electricity potential. sawmills were contacted and the amount and type of generated residues assessed. The LHV (lower heating value) of wood of native species processed at the mills was experimentally determined. Data from real biomass power plants was fitted to calculate efficiencies versus power. With LHV data and conversion efficiency. the potential of installing micro to large-scale biomass-fired power plants was estimated.

Large quantities of energy can be stored to meet immediate changes in demand. allowing effective operation of base− load units at high and essentially constant levels of power. Life cycle costs. simplicity of operation. flexibility. complexity and the state of the technology are among the factors that determine the selection of systems for storage applications. The all− vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is particularly suited to medium and large scale applications. including load levelling and peak shaving. un− interruptible power supply and emergency backup [1].The approaching commercialisation of the VRFB sets a series of new challenges to developers of this newer technology. particularly with respect to thermal effects. minimisation of gas evolution. improved electrolyte stability. resistance to carbon oxidation and membrane fouling. Extensive laboratory testing of different materials. components and additives over a broad range of conditions is time− consuming and comes at a high financial cost.

This work aims at proposing an approach to stadiums energy enhancement that includes strategies largely recognized as effective and applicable to several building typologies (residential. commercial. academic. etc.). The selected case study is the Dacia Arena in northern Italy that has been recently refurbished and renovated. The proposed workflow has as a goal minimizing the increment of the operational emissions. caused by new heated areas in the stadium. Firstly. the energy consumption was estimated in dynamic state for Scenario 0 (current state) and Scenario 1 (refurbished state) to quantify the new plant’s energy demand. Secondly. two hypothetical system layouts were proposed and evaluated. In the first. the power for lighting. cooling and heating is supplied by a system that couples photovoltaic panels with heat pump. In the second. the same photovoltaic plant is integrated with a biomass plant and an absorption chiller. The comparison highlights the suitability of those interventions and the environmental advantages deriving from their exploitation.

The solvent used is an excellent substitute for traditional organic solvents as it is not toxic. it is renewable. and it can be recycled after the extraction process. Prior the GVL-organosolv extraction process. a steam explosion pretreatment was performed in order to break up the tight lignocellulosic structure and partially depolymerise hemicellulose into soluble sugars. making lignin easier to be solubilised. Three common extraction techniques were compared: soxhlet. closed vessel microwave-assisted. and open vessel on a hotplate stirrer. The two-step approach resulted in a cellulose-rich solid. water-soluble hemicellulose sugars and lignin-rich GVL liquor which was further purified for lignin isolation. The two best resulting pulps presented a high cellulose content (75.47% and 78.68%) starting from 38.13% and a content of lignin down to 11.96% and 13.09% starting from 23.02%.

The biorefinery is the case study of the BIT3G project. a national funded research project. and it uses the lignocellulosic biomass that is available in the territory as input materials for biochemical purposes. such as cardoon and carthamus. The whole plant is composed of several sections: the cardoon and carthamus seed milling. the oil refinement facilities. and the production section of some high quality biochemicals. ie. bio-oils and fatty acids. The main goal of the research is to demonstrate energy autonomy of the latter section of the biorefinery. while only recovering energy from the residues resulting from the collection of the biomass. To this aim. this work presents the quantification of the energy requirements to be supplied to the considered biorefinery section. the mass flow. and the energy and chemical characterization of the biomass.

On the other hand. it leads to the progression of significant problems such as low renewable energy density (i). social acceptability (ii). and non-programmability of renewable energy sources (iii). The rural architecture. which is largely present in the countryside of central Italy. is generally equipped with several annexes such as dovecotes (i). grain stores (ii). and tobacco drying kilns (iii). Nowadays. those towers appear in decay because of the decline of agricultural activities. although they are classed as Environmental and Historical Heritage sites. The present work aims to propose a methodology for improving the energy grid in the countryside. while reusing abandoned buildings by modifying their function and maintaining their aspect as much as possible. The proposed workflow was applied to a rural silo. which has fallen into disuse. in Sant’Apollinare (Marsciano. Perugia) by converting it into a mini-biogas plant. The function of the annex which was chosen as the case study changes from agricultural use to energy production: it becomes an on-site renewable energy-based electric grid that can produce clean energy from agricultural and forestry residues. The project turns out to be sustainable not only in terms of energy and the environment. but also from an economic point of view as a result of the recent regulations and incentives for renewable energy production.

A decline of 3.7% in the global energy demand at about 150 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in the first quarter (Q1). of 2020 was recorded. as compared to the same first quarter (Q1). of 2019. due to the cutback on global economic activities. Our results showed that: 1) electricity production for the same period in the years 2018. 2019. and 2020. shrunk at an offset of about 9.20%. which resulted in the modest reduction of about (-1.79%). in the atmospheric CO . to that of 2017-2018 CO  level; 2) a non-seasonal abrupt; but brief. atmospheric CO  decrease by about 0.85% in mid-February 2020. could be due to the Phase 1 movement restrictions in China. The results showed that. the reduction in electricity production is significant to the short-term variability of atmospheric CO . It also highlights the significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO . which suggests that. without the national restriction of activities. CO  concentration are set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%. but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown. and sustained the reduction for two consecutive months. The results underscore the atmospheric CO  reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved. if electricity production from combustible sources were slashed. which could be useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production from combustible sources. and the impact of these reduction to the …,True,BCzNn5gAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04407,7982181712211302138,/scholar?cites=7982181712211302138,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04407,0,0,0

1288641,Analysis of turbocharger non-adiabatic performance,2006,S Shaaban and JR Seume,,8th International Conference on Turbochargers and Turbocharging,,119-130,,Turbocharging is nowadays the most commonly used method of engine supercharging. One of the important factors affecting the turbocharger performance is the heat transfer inside the turbocharger and from the turbocharger to the ambient. Heat transfer takes place due to the high temperature gradient between the turbine and the other components of the turbocharger as well as between the turbine and the ambient. This heat transfer causes underestimation of the measured compressor efficiency and overestimation of the turbine efficiency. This results in an inaccurate estimation of the compressor power and the turbine power.The complex turbocharger geometry introduces many geometrical and operating parameters that affect the turbocharger non-adiabatic performance. The purpose of the present paper is to analyse the turbocharger non-adiabatic performance and define the parameters affecting this performance. It also helps to understand and estimate the effect of each parameter on the turbocharger non-adiabatic performance.,True,gHoD7rEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,72,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=oaVmDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA119&dq=info:avr_cvzpxwoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=2w1mspU2jf&sig=ka6ZANkek74LCVpoJJ3YBvtlfNs,776846731215108714,/scholar?cites=776846731215108714,,,,0,0,0

However. they suffer low aerodynamic efficiency and consequently low power produced. It is proposed to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of Wells turbines by optimizing the blade pitch angle. A fully automated optimization algorithm is implemented in the present work. Two different airfoil geometries are numerically investigated; the standard NACA 0021 and an airfoil with optimized profile “AOP”. Optimization results show that self pitch control of Wells turbines can substantially improve the turbine efficiency while slightly delaying the turbine starting point.

1288644,Impact of turbocharger non-adiabatic operation on engine volumetric efficiency and turbo lag,2012,S Shaaban and J Seume,2012,International Journal of Rotating Machinery,,,Hindawi,Turbocharger performance significantly affects the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid at engine boundaries and hence engine performance. Heat transfer takes place under all circumstances during turbocharger operation. This heat transfer affects the power produced by the turbine. the power consumed by the compressor. and the engine volumetric efficiency. Therefore. non-adiabatic turbocharger performance can restrict the engine charging process and hence engine performance. The present research work investigates the effect of turbocharger non-adiabatic performance on the engine charging process and turbo lag. Two passenger car turbochargers are experimentally and theoretically investigated. The effect of turbine casing insulation is also explored. The present investigation shows that thermal energy is transferred to the compressor under all circumstances. At high rotational speeds. thermal energy is first transferred to the compressor and latter from the compressor to the ambient. Therefore. the compressor appears to be “adiabatic” at high rotational speeds despite the complex heat transfer processes inside the compressor. A tangible effect of turbocharger non-adiabatic performance on the charging process is identified at turbocharger part load operation. The turbine power is the most affected operating parameter. followed by the engine volumetric efficiency. Insulating the turbine is recommended for reducing the turbine size and the turbo lag.,True,gHoD7rEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,45,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijrm/2012/625453/abs/,2659028039725193424,/scholar?cites=2659028039725193424,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijrm/2012/625453/abs/,0,0,0

Therefore its management plays an important role. During the process of methane production in MSW plants. LFG is collected. treated and then used for power production purposes. Although there have been many technologies existed. incineration and landfilling methods are mostly preferred all over the world today due to their high energy production potentials. The increasing amount of solid waste arising from municipalities and other sources and its consequent disposal have been the major environmental and economic problems in Turkey. Furthermore. providing more effective and eco-friendly solutions has been a key point for Turkey while being a candidate country for European Union (EU) accession.

This study was planned to clarify the applicability of the well-known Ergun correlation proposed for beds composed with spherical particles on beds with non-spherical particles. The experimental packed beds were constructed by using two different irregular-shaped and one spherical-shaped packing materials for understanding the effects of particle shape or sphericity. particle size. bed porosity. and bed length to diameter ratio on the pressure drop.

This paper presents a method of harmonic mitigation that can be applied to a laboratory prototype Virtual Air Gap Variable Reactor (VAG-VR) which further improves on the low harmonics already achieved. The method utilizes control current modulation such that the DC auxiliary current is modulated with a 2nd harmonic component. It is seen that the 3rd harmonic can be reduced in the range of 60% - 96% as compared to using the DC auxiliary current without modulation. The 5th and 7th harmonics also show a modest reduction.

In the case of electrode reactions occurring exclusively on the surface of such metal inclusions and the film thickness significantly exceeding clusters’ radii. it is shown that the concentration of species participating in such processes (tested particles. further on) satisfies a diffusion equation complicated with an accompanying electrochemical reaction. By assuming reversibility of the electron transfer processes between polymer fragments. one can arrive at solutions of the derived equation and calculate the corresponding currents resulting from tested particles’ reactions.

Although changes occur in climate due to natural phenomena (such as volcanoes. tectonic plates. variation in sun’s energy. etc.). there are many domestic and commercial activities of human beings which are quite responsible for the increase in rate of climate change problems. The effect of climate change. which is referred to as global warming. can be observed as increase of earth’s temperature year by year. Apart from increase in earth’s temperature. natural disasters and extreme weather events are also being seen in many parts of the world. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by human activities are quite responsible for global warming. The average surface temperature of earth increased from 0.6 C to 0.9 C per decade during 1906–2005. As a matter of fact. an increasd of 1 C temperature in earth is quite significant because rise in 1 C temperature has ample heat to warm the glaciers. oceans. lands. and atmosphere (www. earthobservatory. nasa. gov).

When a 3-form flux is turned on in a Taub–NUT space. an M5-brane gets an effective potential that pins it to the center of the space. A similar effect occurs for M2-branes and D-branes with appropriate fluxes. In carefully chosen limits of the external parameters. this leads to new theories that are decoupled from gravity and appear to break Lorentz invariance. For example. we predict the existence of a new 5+ 1D theory that breaks Lorentz invariance at high-energy and has a low-energy description of N tensor multiplets with N=(1. 0) supersymmetry. We also predict a new type of theory that. similarly to the little-string theory decouples from gravity by a dynamical (rather than kinematical) argument.,True,BMNFCO8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,44,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0550321300003540,16800182839488463269,/scholar?cites=16800182839488463269,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0002175,0,0,0

We find several mean-field states. of which the state of lowest energy upon Gutzwiller projection is a parity and time-reversal breaking chiral phase with a unit monopole flux exiting each tetrahedron. This “monopole flux” state has a Fermi surface consisting of four lines intersecting at a point. At mean field the low-energy excitations about the Fermi surface are gapless spinons. An analysis using the projective symmetry group of this state suggests that the state is stable to small fluctuations which neither induce a gap nor alter the unusual Fermi surface.,True,BMNFCO8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,35,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.144432,545153318471674201,/scholar?cites=545153318471674201,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.0528,0,0,0
1289062,The hiding behind the poor debate: a synthetic overview,2011,Shoibal Chakravarty and MV Ramana,,,,218-229,,In October 2007. the Indian branch of the international environmental organization. Greenpeace. came out with a report entitled Hiding Behind the Poor (Ananthapadmanabhan et al.. 2007) Based on a survey of 819 individuals divided into seven income classes. the report tried to assess CO2 emission levels amongst different income classes in India. The report was produced just prior to the Bali Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). which was expected to be crucial in setting the stage for an agreement to follow the Kyoto Protocol.Though not without its problems (that we discuss below) the Greenpeace report was an important intervention in the Indian climate debate. representing one of the few attempts at examining how emissions are distributed among different income classes. The oldest of such studies that we have been able to identify is from 1997 by Jyoti Parikh and her collaborators (Parikh et al.. 1997; Murthy et al.. 1997). Parikh and her collaborators have produced a more recent attempt in 2009 at quantifying the “differential emission effects of consumption pattern of different income classes in India”(Parikh et al. 2009). An indirect handle on the same question is provided by S. Pachauri. who has produced a series of papers and a book that examine the energy consumption patterns of various income classes in India (Pachauri 2004; Pachauri and Spreng. 2002; Pachauri. 2007; Pachauri and Jiang. 2008).

1289063,Safe vs. fair: a formidable trade-off in tackling climate change,2012,Massimo Tavoni and Shoibal Chakravarty and Robert Socolow,4,Sustainability,2,210-226,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,Global warming requires a response characterized by forward-looking management of atmospheric carbon and respect for ethical principles. Both safety and fairness must be pursued. and there are severe trade-offs as these are intertwined by the limited headroom for additional atmospheric CO 2 emissions. This paper provides a simple numerical mapping at the aggregated level of developed vs. developing countries in which safety and fairness are formulated in terms of cumulative emissions and cumulative per capita emissions respectively. It becomes evident that safety and fairness cannot be achieved simultaneously for strict definitions of both. The paper further posits potential global trading in future cumulative emissions budgets in a world where financial transactions compensate for physical emissions: the safe vs. fair tradeoff is less severe but remains formidable. Finally. we explore very large deployment of engineered carbon sinks and show that roughly 1.000 Gt CO 2 of cumulative negative emissions over the century are required to have a significant effect. a remarkable scale of deployment. We also identify the unexplored issue of how such sinks might be treated in sub-global carbon accounting.

1289065,Unethical authorship is research misconduct,2018,TS Rethinaraj and Shoibal Chakravarty,24,viewed on,,,,Authorship confers several benefits such as professional advancement. social status. and personal gratification. In academia and research organizations. authorship is testimony of scholarship and expertise besides serving as a yardstick for individual promotion and tenure decisions. As a result. a few unscrupulous researchers indulge in various research misconduct and unethical authorship practices to amplify their publication count. The scope of research misconduct. at least in India. has been traditionally confined to fabrication. falsification. and plagiarism—the three issues that attract universal censure. But this overlooks other questionable practices. especially unethical authorship. that is equally detrimental to the integrity of the scholarly enterprise.Authorship conventions vary across disciplines and organizations. but most publishers and professional societies provide explicit guidelines for assigning authorship. An author. accordingly. should provide substantial intellectual contributions in research planning. investigation. data acquisition. analysis. and writing. It was a series of misconduct scandals that surfaced in the United States during 1980s that motivated the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (known as the “Vancouver Group”) to develop explicit criteria to prevent unethical authorship practices.

1289080,Learning Rates. Green Energy Deployment. and Feasible Climate Agreements,2012,Shoibal Chakravarty and E Somanathan,,,,,,International climate negotiations. However. individual countries have implemented various policies related to emission reduction including promotion of renewable energy. This paper uses observed deployment and costs of solar photovoltaics (PV) to infer policy-makers’ preferences for green energy in four regions. the EU. China. the USA. and the Rest of the World (ROW). The historical learning rate of 22%. slowing to 11% after three doublings of output. is used to model the effect of deployment on cost reduction. These preferences then imply that PV deployment will be scaled up sufficiently to drive the cost of green energy down to parity with new fossil energy within three decades (in our reference scenario with constant fossil-fuel prices and myopic behavior). It is shown that a stable (in a welldefined sense) international agreement on deployment of solar PV is feasible and would result in significantly faster deployment and cost reduction. In the reference scenario under cooperation. PV accounts for 25% of world electricity output after 32 years. With a modest increase in fossil-fuel prices. this fraction can be considerably higher. A similar conclusion follows even if an agreement is not reached as long as limited forward-looking behavior is triggered by the negotiation process.,True,BMNFCO8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://sc-lab.org/pdf/2012-learning-rate-green-energy-deployment-and-feasible-climate-agreements.pdf,,,,,https://sc-lab.org/pdf/2012-learning-rate-green-energy-deployment-and-feasible-climate-agreements.pdf,0,0,0

1289083,Sharing global CO2 emission reductions among one billion high emitters,2009,HC de Coninck and Shoibal Chakravarty and Ananth Chikkatur and Steve Pacala and Robert Socolow and Massim Tavoni,,,,,ECN,We present a framework for allocating a global carbon reduction target among nations. in which the concept of common but differentiated responsibilities߿ݠrefers to the emissions of individuals instead of nations. We use the income distribution of a country to estimate how its fossil fuel CO2 emissions are distributed among its citizens. from which we build up a global CO2 distribution. We then propose a simple rule to derive a universal cap on global individual emissions and find corresponding limits on national aggregate emissions from this cap. All of the world's high CO2-emitting individuals are treated the same. regardless of where they live. Any future global emission goal (target and time frame) can be converted into national reduction targets. which are determined by Business as Usual߿ݠprojections of national carbon emissions and in-country income distributions. For example. reducing projected global emissions in 2030 by 13 GtCO2 would require the engagement of 1.13 billion high emitters. roughly equally distributed in 4 regions: the U.S.. the OECD minus the U.S.. China. and the non-OECD minus China. We also modify our methodology to place a floor on emissions of the world's lowest CO2 emitters and demonstrate that climate mitigation and alleviation of extreme poverty are largely decoupled.,True,BMNFCO8AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,0,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:d4b268aa-c390-4a40-9e8e-1ed9996a6c33,,,,,,0,0,0

The sliced kale leaves were dried in wire trays in 10. 20. 40 and 50 mm thick layers. The drying rate increased with drying air temperature but decreased with layer thickness. The effective diffusivity for 10 mm thick layers was found to increase with the drying air temperature and ranged between 14.9 and 55.9 × 10−10 m2/s. The effect of temperature on diffusivity could be expressed by an Arrhenius type relationship with a high R2 of 0.9989. The activation energy of kale was found to be 36.115 kJ/mol.

The oil yield from the various operations was measured and expressed as a percentage of the original mass of crushed seeds. It was found that the oil yields increased linearly with increase in pressure as the compression pressure was increased from 40 to 80 kgf/m and that oil yield also increased linearly with increase in the duration of pressing within the range 2 of 6 to 12 minutes. Oil yield also increased with the bulk temperature of the preheated oilseeds but reached a peak yield at about 75 C and then decreased with further increase in temperature of oilseeds. o It was also found beneficial to dry the seeds to a moisture content slightly below the ambient moisture content of 9.3% (d.b.) although reducing moisture to a value lower that 5% (d.b.) resulted in a reduction in oil yield.

In particular. the experiments were carried out in convective dryer at three air temperature levels of 50. 60 and 70 C and three air velocity levels of 0.5. 1.0 and 2.0 m/s. Experiments in the infrared dryer were done at three air velocity of 0.5. 0.7 and 1.0 m/s.

Household growers of white peach landrace in KwaZulu-Natal at Impendle Local Municipality suffer major losses due to lack of maturity indices that would allow them to predict and plan for harvesting dates. As a result. the fruit is harvested later than its physiologically correct date and processing becomes difficult when the fruit is overripe or spoilt. Extension services do not have enough information on such fruit quality parameters to assist the farmers. With the aim of developing and promoting the value chain in household farming. this study identified physical and chemical parameters linked to peach landrace maturity in relation to extension. Maturity and ripening related parameters were determined. Fruit reached maturity 129 days after full bloom (DAFB) and this coincided with mass. volume and moisture content at respective stages of 80.00 g. 55.20 cm 3. and 83%.

The results indicated an average dry matter yield of 22600 kg ha-1. The average harvesting rate and fuel consumption were 1.57 h ha-1 and 6.23 ℓ ha-1. respectively. The baling rate was 0.80 h ha-1 while diesel consumption during baling was 2.69 ℓ ha-1. Manual harvesting using scythes varied extensively depending on time of day and the quality of the handmade bales though acceptable could at times fall below standards. The open barn storage method and open barn plus tarpaulin cover storage method could be used to store bales for a period of up to 5 months with minimum changes in neural detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) of biomass. The average fuel energy required to both harvest and bale. the biomass constituted less than 1% of the energy that could be recovered from the biomass if used as a fuel.,True,vK1-DM0AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Tsopito/publication/266869921_Alternative_methods_of_harvesting_and_storage_of_grass_biomass_in_a_semi-arid_region/links/5448d80c0cf2f14fb8144b6b/Alternative-methods-of-harvesting-and-storage-of-grass-biomass-in-a-semi-arid-region.pdf,15558889914648830185,/scholar?cites=15558889914648830185,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Tsopito/publication/266869921_Alternative_methods_of_harvesting_and_storage_of_grass_biomass_in_a_semi-arid_region/links/5448d80c0cf2f14fb8144b6b/Alternative-methods-of-harvesting-and-storage-of-grass-biomass-in-a-semi-arid-region.pdf,0,0,0
1289102,Analysis of fish fillet drying rates under three solar energy drying systems,2009,Gikuru Mwithiga and Samuel Gathuki Mwangi,62,,,518-524,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,A small Box type solar dryer with controllable air inlet was designed and tested. The dryer had a mild steel absorber plate and a polyvinyl chloride (pvc) transparent cover and could be adjusted to allow variation in airflow rate through the drying chamber. A convectional green house covered with transparent pvc and into which a drying tray stand at a height of 90 cm above the ground was placed made up the second drying method. The rate of air flow through the green house could be controlled by adjusting the opening at either end of the tunnel. The third method of drying which also served as the control is sun drying in which case the drying trays was placed 90 cm above the ground but left unenclosed to allow free flow of ambient air.

The effect of varying the quantity of water in the pan was studied by varying the depth (1.0. 1.5. 2.0. 2.5 and 3.0 mm) while effect of surface color of radiating surface was determined by placing two different coloured pans adjacent to each other. The effectiveness of this method in capturing “cold load” and the possible use of this cold energy for daytime preservation of fresh produce is analyzed and discussed. It was found that the water in the pan could be cooled to a temperature that was 9 o C below the lowest ambient dry bulb temperature.

This kind of model is particularly useful when modeling 1D heat exchangers or piping. eg. in thermodynamic cycles involving a phase change. Issues. such as chattering or stiff systems. can lead to low simulation speed. instabilities and simulation failures. In the particular case of two-phase flow models. they are usually linked to a discontinuity in the density derivative between the liquid and two-phase zones. In this work. several methods to tackle numerical problems are developed. described. implemented and compared. In addition. methods available in the literature are also implemented and compared to the proposed approaches. Results suggest that the robustness of the models can be significantly increased with these different methods. at the price of a small increase of the error in the mass and energy balances.

As a consequence. the accuracy and simulation speed of the higher level system model mainly depend on the heat exchanger model formulation. In particular. the modeling of thermo-flow systems characterized by evaporation or condensation requires heat exchanger models capable of handling phase transitions. To this aim. the finite volume (FV) and the moving boundary (MB) approaches are the most widely used. The two models are developed and included in the open-source ThermoCycle Modelica library. In this contribution. a comparison between the two approaches is presented. An integrity and accuracy test is designed to evaluate the performance of the FV and MB models during transient conditions. In order to analyze how the two modeling approaches perform when integrated at a system level. two organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system models are built using the FV and the MB evaporator model. and their responses are compared against experimental data collected on an 11 kW el ORC power unit. Additionally. the effect of the void fraction value in the MB evaporator model and of the number of control volumes (CVs) in the FV one is investigated. The results allow drawing general guidelines for the development of heat exchanger dynamic models involving two-phase flows.

Several studies have underlined the potential of small-capacity Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plants for Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) applications. For such systems. accurate models based on actual experimental data represent an important tool. in particular when control issues are considered. This paper presents an experimental campaign on a 10-kWe WHR ORC unit carried out both in steady-state and in transient conditions. The unit presents a regenerative architecture. uses Solkatherm (SES36) as working fluid and a single screw expander as expansion machine. The dynamic response of the unit is analyzed by applying a step function to the pump rotational speed while keeping the expander rotational speed constant. During the experiments. the control of the external heating circuit ensures a steady heat source temperature at the inlet of the evaporator. It has been ensured that the power plant was operating in steady-state condition before any change is imposed to the system. The test rig exhibits a good first law efficiency (about 11% efficiency for a heat source of 125* C) and allows measuring a wide range of operating conditions. Maximum isentropic efficiency of the screw expander is about 60%. Following the experimental campaign. steady state performance curves of the screw expander are developed and calibrated with the experimental data.

As the ORC system is a strongly coupled nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) process. conventional control strategies (e.g. PID) may not achieve satisfactory results. In this contribution our focus is on the accurate regulation of the superheating. in order to increase the efficiency of the cycle and to avoid the formation of liquid droplets that could damage the expander.

Simulation results of a validated dynamic model of the ORC power unit are used to derive a correlation for the evaporating temperature. which maximizes the power generation for a range of operating conditions. This idea is further extended using a perturbation-based extremum seeking (ES) algorithm to identify online the optimal evaporating temperature. Regarding safety conditions. we propose the use of the extended prediction self-adaptive control (EPSAC) approach to constrained model predictive control (MPC). Since it uses input/output models for prediction. it avoids the need for state estimators. making it a suitable tool for industrial applications. The performance of the proposed control strategy is compared to PID-like schemes.

Coupling small-scale ORCs powered by scroll expander-generators with solar thermal collectors and storage can provide combined heat and power to underserved rural communities. Simulation of such systems is instrumental in optimizing their control strategy. However. most models developed so far operate at steady-state or focus either on ORC or on storage dynamics. In this work. a model for the dynamics of the solar ORC system is developed to evaluate the impact of variable heat sources and sinks. thermal storage. and the variable loads associated with distributed generation.

Williams has written the definitive history of energy development and use in that state. illuminating the forces that formed its culture and economy through the interplay of technology. population growth. human values. and the environment. From the fuelwood that warmed its early settlers to the nuclear power plants that run the air-conditioners of contemporary citizens. California has shaped itself by tapping available energy resources. in the process coming to learn the capacity and constraints of technology as it affects the environment. Always a land apart. California has also become an early model for the United States and other countries in both its voracious consumption of energy and its enlightened concern for the natural world. With its rich diversity of resources and its comfortable climate. California has attracted a steady stream of immigrants. As the population increased. so did its appetite for energy. A variety of resources--coal and oil. wind and solar heat. the fall of waters swollen by snowmelt--was harnessed to satisfy the growing needs of farmers and manufacturers and the ordinary citizens of small towns and sprawling cities.

The bacterial and eukaryal community structures during two aerobic granular sludge experiments were tracked using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The first granule cultivation experiment. using an organic loading rate of 1.6 kg/m3d COD. resulted in biomass that was dominated by filamentous bacteria and Zoogloea ramigera colonies. A second experiment with a higher organic loading rate of 6 kg/m3d COD developed a granule-like morphology but was ultimately dominated by filamentous fungi.

The probability distribution of the uncertain demand at each customer is not fully specified. The only available information is that these demands are independent and symmetric random variables that can take some value from their support interval. The supplier is responsible for the inventory management of its customers. has sufficient inventory to replenish the customers. and distributes the product using a capacitated vehicle.

Each retailer faces external dynamic demand and is controlled by a deterministic order-up-to level policy requiring that the supplier raise the retailer's inventory level to a predetermined maximum in each replenishment. The problem is deciding on when and in what sequence to visit the retailers such that systemwide inventory holding and routing costs are minimized.

1289192,Efficient formulations and a branch-and-cut algorithm for a production-routing problem,2010,Mirko Ruokokoski and OGUZ Solyali and Jean-François Cordeau and Raf Jans and Haldun Süral,,,,,GERAD,The production-routing problem can be seen as a combination of two well known combinatorial optimization problems: the lotsizing and the vehicle routing problems. The variant considered in this paper consists in designing a production schedule for an uncapacitated plant. replenishment schedules for multiple customers. and a set of routes for a single uncapacitated vehicle starting and ending at the plant. The aim of the problem is to fulfill the demand of the customers over a finite horizon such that the total cost of distribution. setups. and inventories is minimized. This paper introduces a basic mixed integer linear programming formulation and several strong reformulations of the problem. Two families of valid inequalities. 2-matching and generalized comb inequalities. are introduced to strengthen these formulations. and they are used within a branch-and-cut algorithm. Computational results on a large set of randomly generated instances are presented. Instances with up to 40 customers and 15 time periods or with 80 customers and 8 periods have been solved to optimality within a two-hour limit. The tests clearly indicate the effectiveness of the new formulations and of the valid inequalities. In addition. an uncoordinated approach is considered to demonstrate the benefits of the simultaneous optimization of production and distribution planning. The total cost increases on average by 47% when employing such an uncoordinated approach. Finally. a heuristic algorithm. based on defining an a priori tour for the vehicle routing part. is investigated. The heuristic algorithm shows an excellent performance.

The warehouse has the knowledge of external (deterministic) demands at the retailers and manages their inventories while ensuring no stock-out. We consider two problems with direct shipping policy and two problems with routing policy. For the direct shipping policy. the problem is to determine the optimal replenishments for the warehouse and retailers such that the system-wide costs are minimized. In one problem. the warehouse decides about how much and when to ship to the retailers while in the other problem. inventory level of the retailer has to be raised up to a predetermined level whenever replenished. We propose strong mixed integer programming formulations for these problems. Computational experiments show that our formulations are better than their competitors and are very successful in solving the problems to optimality. For the routing policy. the problem is to decide on when and in what sequence to visit the retailers and how much to ship to a retailer so as to minimize system-wide costs.

In the fluxoid quantization condition the flux integer n. which is set to zero in the usual single-loop flux qubit analysis. plays an important role in the GFQ potential.

1289241,Evolutionary Design of an LNG Process using the ExPAnD Method and a new Graphical Representation of Exergy,2012,Danahe Marmolejo-Correa and Truls Gundersen,,"AIChE Spring Meet., Houston, TX, USA",,,,This paper presents the design of a novel natural gas liquefaction process with removal of heavy hydrocarbons (C 3+). This process is designed using the Extended Pinch Analysis and Design (ExPAnD) method and a new representation of exergy and exergy exchange. The ExPAnD method combines the classical Pinch Analysis with Exergy Analysis and is applicable for the development of processes where both temperature and pressure are important design variables such as in below ambient processes. The design of processes operating below ambient temperature presents several challenges. First. the design must be customized to match the climate conditions (ie ambient temperature and relative humidity) of the location where the plant will be installed. Second. the plant size and location (ie offshore or onshore) constrain the number of units and equipment size. possibly reducing the process efficiency (ie offshore natural gas liquefaction plants have lower energy efficiency. fewer unit operations and smaller equipment size than onshore plants). Third. the number of degrees of freedom in the design may vary because of the manipulation of temperature and pressure. Forth. processes below ambient temperature have large energy consumption in the refrigeration cycles (low temperature level results in high energy consumption). For low temperature heat exchanger networks. the temperature difference between process streams should be small and the refrigeration loads minimized. In consequence even from the conceptual design phase. processes operating below ambient temperature should be as energy efficient design as possible.One …,True,DFflEKgAAAAJ:mvPsJ3kp5DgC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8301733006845496304&hl=en&oi=scholarr,8301733006845496304,/scholar?cites=8301733006845496304,,,,0,0,0

This growing trend is a result of a series of recent disruptions. among others also affecting electricity systems. Therefore. it is of crucial importance for policymakers to determine whether their country has a resilient electricity supply. Starting from a set of 12 indicators. this paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to comprehensively evaluate the electricity supply resilience of 140 countries worldwide. Two DEA models are applied:(1) the original ratio-based Charnes. Cooper. and Rhodes (CCR) model and (2) a novel hybrid framework for robust efficiency analysis incorporating linear programming and Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the CCR model deems 31 countries as efficient and hence lacks the capability to differentiate them. Furthermore. the CCR model considers only the best weight vectors for each country. which are not necessarily representative of the overall performance of the countries. The robustness analysis explores these limitations and identifies South Korea. Singapore and Canada as the most resilient countries.

Decision support should rather focus on finding the best compromise solution (s). accounting for necessary trade-offs between the factors used for the evaluations. which impedes an alternative to outperform all the others on all these factors. In this context. indices are useful measures that aggregate the factors. also called indicators. in a consistent and synthetic fashion. However. different index construction methodologies introduce in the assessment process variable implicit trade-offs between indicators. This work explores this gap by looking at the implications of two common normalization methods (the min-max and standardized) combined with the weighted arithmetic average. Results show that normalization methods can affect rankings. Hence. an approach to unveil and manage the implicit trade-offs between indicators is proposed. This allows to calculate new weighting profiles that make the implicit trade-offs equal. therefore keeping the rankings identical. The proposed approach is applied to assess the electricity supply resilience of 35 countries from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity.

1289253,Quantifying electricity supply resilience of countries with multi-criteria decision analysis,2019,Patrick Emmanuel Gasser,,,,,,Electricity systems are regularly subject to major disruptions triggered by natural hazards. technical failures. human and organizational factors. Electricity system disruptions affect economic activities. operation of infrastructure and the society as a whole. Securing a reliable electricity supply supports the reduction of such harmful effects. Consequently. this calls for resilience assessment. whose goals are not only to minimize the frequency and severity of disruptive events. but also to recover quickly and adapt to new operating conditions. Hence. a comprehensive framework is needed to quantify and measure the resilience of electricity supply systems.This thesis tackles this challenge by employing Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to assess the electricity supply resilience of 140 countries covering more than 96% of the world’s population and 99.6% of the world’s electricity consumption. Based on a set of indicators that comprehensively represents the resilience of electricity supply. indices are constructed to rank the countries. Indicator-based approaches are particularly suitable to assess the present multidimensional problem. In fact. the resulting indices are considered practical for policymakers because they are easily understandable and provide effective communication tools.,True,oLIMKOEAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,1,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/371373/1/190912_Monograph_No_CV.pdf,14206903054442299846,/scholar?cites=14206903054442299846,,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/371373/1/190912_Monograph_No_CV.pdf,0,0,0

More than 80% of incoming energy from the sun is reflected or absorbed by the solar module. The fraction of energy absorbed increases with solar cell temperature and the cells' efficiency drops as a consequence. The efficiency of a PV module is improved by combining a PV module and a thermal collector in one unit. resulting in a hybrid photovoltaic and thermal collector (PV/T). The purpose of this paper is to present the behavior a ther-mosyphon hybrid PV/T when exposed to variations of environmental parameters and to demonstrate the advantage of cooling photovoltaic modules with water using a rectangular channel profile for the thermal collector. A single glazed flat-box absorber PV/T module was designed. its behavior for different environmental parameters tested. the numerical model developed. and the simulation for particular days for Durban weather run. The simulation result showed that the overall efficiency of the PV/T module was 38.7% against 14.6% for a standard PV module while the water temperature in the storage tank reached 37.1 °C.

The results showed that the E15 fuel ratio induced an increase in combustion duration with minimum premixing combustion duration. hence exhibited low emissions. high indicated power. and efficiency with low fuel consumption (at 12 to 18° CA aTDC). These results are due to the low content of carbon in bioethanol. which eliminates the occurrence of soot formation and requires less air to burn fuel blends with low luminosity and radiation. In E10 and E15 fuel. when the engine operated at 2700 rpm. the engine emissions were relatively low with a slight increase in performance. except for E5.

Harvesting energy by vibration with piezoelectric materials can be used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy that can be stored and used to power other devices. This conversion of vibrations (mechanical energy) to electrical energy using piezoelectric materials is an exciting and rapidly developing area of research with a widening range of applications constantly materialising. In this context. the goal of this paper is to develop a comprehensive prototype generator that can harvest vibration energy and convert it to electrical energy by providing the output power for optimisation and its performance. Two setups of prototype are used: a cantilever beam with tip mass at the end. and a cantilever beam without tip mass at the end. Data from the experiment is compared and analysed using MatLab. The results show that the power output of the prototype with the tip mass is greater than the power output without the tip mass.

Raman spectroscopy and SEM/FIB examinations. At constant salt level. corrosion rate increased and stabilized when temperature was below 60 °C.

1289333,Sulfur Immobilization By “Chemical Anchor” to Suppress the Dissolving of Polysulfides in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries,2017,Zhipeng Zeng and Jianhua Yan and Xingbo Liu,,,,,Meeting Abstract,  Embedding sulfur species in carbonaceous materials or conductive polymer network has been widely regarded as the major approach to alleviate the lithium polysulfide dissolution in lithium-sulfur batteries’ cathodes. However. these conductive materials (as coating layer or host material) can only physically restrain polysulfides. since they usually provide open nanopores which could still be accessed by electrolyte. Therefore. the physical barrier can only slow down the escape of polysulfide but not eliminate the issue. Utilizing “chemical anchor” to develop sulfur host materials with strong chemical binding for polysulfide. rather than solely relying on the high surface area or pore structure for the physical confinement. is extensively explored recently. This review details the recent advances in developing active materials with strong chemical interactions between sulfur and host materials. covering sulfurized …,True,UJ6NGhcAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2017-01/5/504/meta,,,,,,0,0,0

The Li{sub 4}Ti{sub 5}O{sub 12} particle is composed of submicro-scaled grains with size of 100–200 nm. The synthesized Li{sub 4}Ti{sub 5}O{sub 12} shows high reversible capacity (ca. 165 mAh g{sup −1} at 0.5 C). excellent rate-capability (ca. 115 and 100 mAh g{sup −1} at 10 and 20 C. respectively) and high temperature cycling stability (50 °C). Under expanded cut-off voltage range of 0.01–2.5 V. it delivers a high specific capacity of ca. 230 and 170 mAh g{sup −1} at 0.5 and 10 C. respectively. while maintaining an excellent cycling stability. The synthesized Li{sub 4}Ti{sub 5}O{sub 12} shows fast de-lithiation but slow lithiation kinetic processes. When discharged at constant 1 C while charged at 10. 20 and 30 C. respectively. the specific capacity of 162. 160 and 158 mAh g{sup −1} can be achieved. The excellent electrochemical performance of the combustion synthesized Li{sub 4}Ti{sub 5}O{sub 12} is ascribed to the porous particle structure and small grain size feature. which ensure the good contact with electrolyte and reduce the lithium ion/electron diffusion distance. and therefore enhance the electrode reaction process.,True,UJ6NGhcAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22234343,,,,,,0,0,0

1289411,Ochratoxin A removal during the main steps of wine making,2005,Luís Abrunhosa and Anabela Fernandes and Armando Venâncio,,,,,,A few years ago. the presence of ochratoxin A (OTA) was reported for the first time in wine. Grape juice is usually more contaminated than wines. and red grape products are more contaminated than white ones. This knowledge has led researchers to conclude that grape processing could contribute to a reduction in the content of this mycotoxin in grape products. such as the case of wines. This study presents the effect of the more common vinification steps on the fate of the mycotoxin during wine making. Grapes with a content of OTA ranging from 0.43 to 7.48 μg/Kg were used for vinification. These grapes were obtained by inoculating recently harvested grapes with an ochratoxin A producing Aspergillus. It was found that after alcoholic fermentation just about 31.8% of the OTA initially present in grapes remained in the wine. After racking. this amount decreased to 10.9 %. and. after malolactic fermentation. to 8.1%. Also. it was found that OTA was present in higher amounts in spent fractions from wine making. such as the lees obtained after fermentation or the sediment obtained after racking. After malolactic fermentation. the most common eonological fining agents were able to decrease even more the content of OTA in the final wine. Vinification assays with eonological enzymes commonly used in wine making industry were also done. Based on this data. we concluded that this reduction is associated with the mycotoxin removal by adsorption into solid wastes or fining agents. and not due to any degradation of ochratoxin A into other compounds.,True,Ly3saDcAAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC,8,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/3438,6027537107942377322,/scholar?cites=6027537107942377322,,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/3438/1/O3-04[1].pdf,0,0,0

Although the rapid growth of energy demand reflects an increased quality of life for Chinese residents. it may also conflict with China’s targets of increased energy efficiency and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This means that the need of effective strategies and technical solutions for reducing climate impact from residential energy consumption will increase with the current economic development.

These properties can be improved by adding bioethanol. witch on one side allows the content’s increasing of the bio-fuel in mixture. and on the other side brings the reminded properties in the prescribed limits of the commercial diesel. First of all. the bioethanol is destined as an alternative for the spark ignition engines. but has applications for compression ignition engines. too.The undertaken researches about partial replacement of the diesel fuel destined to diesel engines with mixtures biodiesel-diesel fuel-bioethanol (BDE). have as main purpose the identification and the testing of new alternative fuels for compression ignition engines. with similar properties of the commercial diesel fuel. having a high content of bio-fuel. In this case. it was started from the fact that by using BDE mixtures. some properties of the biodiesel and of the ethanol are mutually compensated. resulting mixtures with properties very similar with the ones of the diesel fuel. In the research. were used binary mixtures (BD. DE) and triple mixtures (BDE) between biodiesel (B) obtained from rapeseed oil. commercial diesel fuel (D) and bioethanol (E). in different proportions of these ones (the bio-fuel content varied from 5% v/v to 30% v/v. in scales of 5% v/v. also for ethanol. and for biodiesel). having the purpose of evaluating the mixtures’(BDE) main properties and of comparing these ones with the diesel fuel.,True,qCmQ54UAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,20,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZM2gDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA215&dq=info:NM-rR8x38XkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=YeHVGiJ_YQ&sig=0NKu0_Qk-XLT0ZnNy68aJJwzmro,8786936067236024116,/scholar?cites=8786936067236024116,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Margarita_Stoytcheva/publication/275885826_Biodiesel-Quality_Emissions_and_By-Products/links/554881f20cf2e2031b387bed/Biodiesel-Quality-Emissions-and-By-Products.pdf#page=228,0,0,0

The sideslip angle always increases with increasing the lateral force at the wheel. A lateral force generates a slip angle. and a sliding angle generates a lateral force. The steering angle generates a sliding angle on the contact patch between the tire and the tread and at the same time creates a lateral force. The sideslip angle is positive if the tire is rotating around the vertical axis to be aligned with the velocity vector (the direction of the vehicle speed).

Developing robust and high precision density and viscosity models for stabilized diesel fuel–ethanol blends helps the production of fuel to adhere to the quality requirements regarding density and viscosity and the modeling and simulation of injection and combustion processes. For modeling the density and the viscosity of diesel fuel–ethanol blends. five mixtures were prepared with ethanol content up to 15%(v/v) and were stabilized by adding tetrahydrofuran as a surfactant at room temperature. The temperature-dependent density and viscosity of the blends were measured at four different temperatures (0. 15. 40 and 50 C) using an SVM 3000 type apparatus.

Generally. loss of catalytic activity is attributed to nanoparticle sintering or processes by which larger particles grow at the expense of smaller ones. Here. by independently controlling particle size and particle loading using colloidal nanocrystals. we reveal the opposite process as an alternative deactivation mechanism: nanoparticles rapidly lose activity for methane oxidation by high-temperature decomposition into inactive single atoms. This deactivation route is remarkably fast. leading to severe loss of activity in as little as 10 min. Importantly. this deactivation pathway is strongly dependent on particle density and the concentration of support defect sites.

Introduction 1.1 General Oil & Gas (O&G) plants are often located in remote areas. in many cases lacking grid power connection and/or characterized by high availability of renewable resources. The progressive electrification of these areas-often too remote for grid extension-has mainly been achieved through the installation of decentralized generation units with Diesel Generator (DG). Systems running 100% on diesel fuel have the advantages of using a proven and reliable technology. ensuring a theoretically dispatchable and on-demand production of electric energy 1). However. in a rural context. the ability to run a genset does not always match the availability of fuel to run the generator. The isolated and sometimes inaccessible conditions in rural areas makes the delivery of fuel very difficult. especially when necessary for a system powering more than 10 households for several hours a day. Local environmental impacts have also to be taken into consideration. For O&G business itself. the main drawbacks of DG technology concerns: i. operation & maintenance: a. possible difficulty to transport and distribute fuel in isolated and inaccessible areas; b. very high maintenance cost; c. volatile prices of fossil fuel ii. environment a. use of a non-renewable source b. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Regardless the relatively low energy intensity of O&G business. the exploitation of renewable resources is one of the most attractive alternative to continued overdependence on conventional energy sources.

Its prevalence is highest in Africa. This study was limited to four selected sentinel sites for University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) School of Public Health (SPH). The study assessed the prevalence of hypertension among adults resident in rural communities in the Hohoe Municipality of Ghana. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional survey involving adults 18 years and above in four rural communities was used. Data was collected using face-to-face interviews with WHO STEPwise questionnaire. Standardized methods were used for blood pressure and anthropometric measurements. Results: A total of 289 adults were surveyed and 146 (50.5%) including those on treatment were hypertensive. At the time of the survey. 108 (37.4%) of the respondents were hypertensive. There were 87 (30.1%) known hypertensive of which 49 (56.3%) could not control their HPT (uncontrolled HPT). Of the 202 respondents who had never been diagnosed with hypertension. 59 (29.2%) had raised blood pressure (unknown HPT). Age and family history of HPT were found to be associated with HPT. Overall. WHR and WHR for women were found to be positively correlated with HPT (p= 0.006 & p= 0.036) respectively. Conclusion: Half of the adult’s population in the selected rural communities had HPT. One out of three (29.2%) adults’ population had hypertension and were not aware. There is very high (56.3%) uncontrolled HPT in these communities.

Экономика,2,,Федеральное государственное бюджетное образовательное учреждение высшего образования «Санкт-Петербургский государственный университет»,Sanctions introduced in 2006 are said to have had a crucial effect on the Iranian economy in the last decades and have affected the economic relations between Iran and the rest of the World. It has been asserted repeatedly that sanctions against Iran have been hindering its foreign trade and its access to the global market and that sanctions have caused Iran to become less globalized and more isolated. As Iran’s economy is highly sensitive to oil prices due to its high reliance on oil revenues it might affect Iran’s trade with other nations. Our study explores how much various sanctions (financial and non-financial) and oil price have affected the foreign trade of Iran with Russia during 1994-2013. The research provides a detailed study of the impact of financial and non-financial sanctions on Iran-Russia foreign trade and relation of oil price and Iran-Russia foreign trade.

The analysis is conducted using a panel-gravity trade model to analyze bilateral trade pattern between Iran and 50 countries from the EU and Asia during the period 2006–2013. To this end. the authors use an extended gravity model by adding new variables. including the index of Chinn–Ito (KAOPEN) as an indicator of financial openness. and the composite trade intensity (CTI) as an indicator of trade openness. Our findings reveal that the gravity equation fits the data reasonably well. The empirical evidence indicates a significant negative effect of sanctions on Iran–EU bilateral trade (by an average of 46.9%). while it has a positive impact on trade between Iran and the Asian countries (by an average of 85.2%). Overall. these findings confirm that the imposition of various sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program has pushed the country’s foreign trade to reorient away from Europe towards Asia.

Evidence of long-run panel co-integration for N-11 countries,2015,Mohammad Nasre Esfahani and Ehsan Rasoulinezhad,6,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,3,463-470,,This article tries to explore the long-run nexus between oil consumption. gross domestic product (GDP) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the next eleven (N-11) countries over the period 1980-2013. by using the panel c-ointegration. the panel dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) and the panel fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) approaches. The empirical findings indicate that there is a bidirectional long-run linkage between oil consumption-GDP per capita and oil consumption-CO2 emissions. Moreover the inverted U-shaped linkage between the square of GDP per capita and CO2 emissions. supports the existence of environmental kuznets curve hypothesis. With estimations through the panel DOLS and FMOLS. the long-run elasticity of oil consumption per capita to CO2 emissions per capita is calculated about 0.96% and positive which is in contrast to the coefficient sign of its elasticity to GDP per capita (− 0.48%). Moreover. the elasticity of GDP per capita and CO2 emissions per capita to oil consumption per capita are− 0.32% and 0.94%. respectively. These findings prove the negative contribution of non-renewable energy (oil) consumption per capita to GDP per capita in the N-11 group. Furthermore. due to the bidirectional long-run relationships between oil consumption and CO2 emissions. these 11 countries should find the efficient energy policies which are in line with CO2 mitigation and reaching a higher GDP per capita growth.,True,7O59cWkAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC,24,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2813312,3027966395008402601,/scholar?cites=3027966395008402601,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/72692/1/MPRA_paper_72692.pdf,0,0,0

The progress of energy transition by considering geopolitical risk has not been considered seriously yet. This paper contributes to the literature by modeling and analyzing energy transition patterns in Russia with emphasis on geopolitical risks factor as a giant fossil fuels producer using the ARDL bounds testing method over the period of 1993–2018. The main results proved long-run negative impact of economic growth. population growth and inflation rate on energy transition of Russia. while CO 2 emissions. geopolitical risk. exchange rate and financial openness have positive impacts on energy transition movement in the country. Furthermore. we found out that in the short-run. the relationship between energy transition improvement and economic growth. CO 2 emissions. population growth and inflation rate is negative. while geopolitical risk. exchange rate and financial openness are the only variables which accelerate energy transition in the country. As major concluding remarks. Russia’s policy makers should draw attention to the long-run energy plans in the country. Furthermore. lowering dependency of Federals’ budget to the oil and gas revenues would be a useful policy to reduce negative impact of economic growth on energy transition movement in the country. Another recommendation is to determine rapid decarbonizing policies in the country.

In the present work. a broad range of possible n-type materials is surveyed. including ZnO. ZnS. Zn(O.S). (Mg.Zn)O. TiO2. CdS. and Ga2O3. Band offsets are determined through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and optical bandgap measurements. A majority of these materials is identified as having a negative conduction-band offset with respect to Cu2O; the detrimental impact of this on open-circuit voltage (VOC) is evaluated through 1-D device simulation. These results suggest that doping density of the n-type material is important as well. and that a poorly optimized heterojunction can easily mask changes in bulk minority carrier lifetime …,True,dQdwab0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,76,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4905180,14462665341448284471,/scholar?cites=14462665341448284471,,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/97244/Buonassisi_Band%20offsets.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

In the present study. the system performance of the designed TCFPEG system is predicted using a validated numerical model. A parametric analysis is undertaken based on the influence of the engine load. valve timing. the number of linear generators adopted. and different fuels on the system performance. It is found that when linear electric generators are connected with the free-piston gas turbine. the bottom dead centre. the peak piston velocity. and engine operation frequency are all reduced. Very minimal difference on the in-cylinder pressure and the compressor pressure is observed. while the peak pressure in the bounce chamber is reduced. When coupled with a linear electric generator. the system efficiency can be improved to nearly 50% by optimising engine load and the number of the linear generators adopted in the TCFPEG system. The system is able to be operated with different fuels as the piston is not limited by a mechanical system; the output power and system efficiency are highest when hydrogen is used as the fuel.

1289646,Is decoupling a red herring? The role of structural effects and energy policies in Europe,2019,Vincent Moreau and Catarina Amarante De Oliveira Neves and François Vuille,128,Energy Policy,,243-252,Elsevier,Decoupling energy consumption and carbon emissions from economic growth is at the core of the climate change debate: successful decoupling is evidence that efficiency measures can be economically sustainable. In this article. the authors analyze the underlying nature of this decoupling in the European Union from 1990 to 2014. The objective is to quantify the role of structural changes and the effectiveness of energy efficiency measures in lowering energy consumption. We decompose final energy consumption per sector. including households and transportation into three key drivers: economic growth. economic structure and energy intensity. Our results show that a significant part of the reduction in energy consumption can be attributed to structural changes. such as deindustrialization. while an equally significant part can be attributed to energy efficiency.

1289647,Enough Metals? Resource Constraints to Supply a Fully Renewable Energy System,2019,Vincent Moreau and Piero Carlo Dos Reis and François Vuille,8,Resources,1,29,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The transition from a fossil fuel base to a renewable energy system relies on materials and. in particular. metals to manufacture and maintain energy conversion technologies. Supply constraints shift from fossil fuels to mineral resources. We assess the availability of metal reserves and resources to build an energy system based exclusively on renewable energy technologies. A mass balance of 29 metals embodied in renewable energy technologies is compiled in order to satisfy global energy demand. based on five authoritative energy scenarios for 2050. We expand upon these scenarios by modeling the storage capacity needed to support high shares of intermittent renewables (wind and solar). The metal requirements are then compared with the current demand and proven reserves and ultimate mineable resources. This allows us to distinguish between constraints related to renewable energy sources from those linked to technology mixes. The results show that proven reserves and. in specific cases. resources of several metals are insufficient to build a renewable energy system at the predicted level of global energy demand by 2050. The comparison between reserves and resources shows that scarcity relates sometimes more to techno economic supply than to raw material availability. Our results also highlight the importance of substitution among technologies and metals as well as the limited impact of recycling on the depletion of scarce metals.

Advances in life cycle inventory have focused on the propagation and management of uncertainty. but this article addresses the question of how to account for unavailable data and corresponding uncertainty. Large and complicated systems often lack complete data due to confidential practices or the efforts required in the data collection process. Electricity production with multiple processes generating a single product is a classic example. Instead of the conventional process‐based models to estimate missing data. the approach developed in this article divides systems based on functionally equivalent objects. Each one of these objects is then described in terms of characteristic variables. such as power capacity.

Early applications of the concept attempted to quantify the amount of water and food the human body processes to live and sustain itself. Similarly. ecologists have long studied the metabolism of critical substances and nutrients in ecological succession towards climax.

Under 2014 trade volumes. technologies and energy mixes. a hard Brexit—reverting to a trade pattern between the UK and the EU prior to the European Internal Market (EIM)—would imply a rise of about 0.215 Gt of CO 2 eq in the UK's emissions embodied in imports.

Most of this carbon has been converted into atmospheric and oceanic CO2 through combustion. In order to close the carbon cycle and move from linear to circular carbon flows. the use of biogenic sources is promising. especially for material and chemical production. This work quantifies the potential of carbon from a biogenic origin. which can displace fossil equivalents. Conversion processes are associated with the concept of biorefinery. including biological. chemical and physical treatment to produce comparable outputs to the current processes based on coal. oil and gas.

However. the deployment of public charging infrastructure is lagging behind that of EVs. which represents a potential barrier to their wide-scale adoption. The objective of this paper is to develop a comprehensive overview of potential EV charging solutions to be deployed in urban areas. Using a micro-Delphi approach. experts from transport. energy and urban planning were consulted and identified 15 realistic options for charging electric vehicles in urban environments by 2035. The solutions range from purely technical to more service oriented. Most of these solutions already exist today. although some remain at a very early stage of deployment. The five most likely options were on-street public charging points. charging at work. fast-charging stations. using building domestic plugs and semi-fast charging in public areas. When combined with the typical mobility and residential profiles. our results show that EV drivers will most likely rely on a mix of solutions. when they have no home chargers. As such. no breakthrough or major shift is expected in charging infrastructures. rather a scale-up of existing solutions. Our analysis concludes that urban charging options will be numerous and no single solution is expected to dominate as users with different EV user profiles will charge at different times and locations.,True,MuJYJu8AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,0,https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/ejtir/article/view/5315,,,,,https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/ejtir/article/download/5315/4796,0,0,0

This allows for interesting comparisons among several countries and in many cases highlights the positive effect of incentive policies in stimulating the diffusion of such a technology. In this sense. the Generalized Bass Model proves to be essential for modelling and forecasting. On this basis. we observe important differences in the investments made by countries in the PV sector and we are able to identify whether and when these investments obtained the expected results. In particular. from our analysis it turns out that in some cases incentive measures have been certainly effective in facilitating adoption. while in some others these have not been able to produce real feed-back.

However. the recognized importance of communication channels between agents has recently suggested the use of agent-based models. like Cellular Automata. We argue that an adoption or purchase process is nested in a communication network that evolves dynamically and indirectly generates a latent non-constant market potential affecting the adoption phase.Using Cellular Automata we propose a two-stage model of an innovation diffusion process.

The corresponding mean field approximation of its aggregate version is a Riccati equation with a closed form solution. This allows the detection of a change-point time separating an incubation period from a subsequent take-off due to a collective threshold (critical mass).

1289669,Market potential dynamics in innovation diffusion: Modelling the synergy between two driving forces,2011,Renato Guseo and Mariangela Guidolin,78,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,1,13-24,North-Holland,The presence of a slowdown in new product life cycles has recently received notable attention from many innovation diffusion scholars. who have tried to explain and model it on a dual-market hypothesis (early market-main market). In this paper we propose an alternative explanation for the slowdown pattern. a dual-effect hypothesis. based on a recent co-evolutionary model. where diffusion results from the synergy between two driving forces: communication and adoption. An analysis of the synergistic interaction between communication and adoption. based on the likelihood ratio order or on a weak stochastic order. can inform us of which of the two had a driving role in early diffusion. We test the model on the sales data of two pharmaceutical drugs presenting a slowdown in their life cycle and observe that this is identified almost perfectly by the model in both cases.

In this paper. we propose a modelling approach to latent heterogeneity. based on a few fundamental types. which avoids cumbersome integrations with not easy to motivate a priori distributions. This approach gives rise to a discrete non-parametric Bayesian mixture model with a possibly multimodal distributional behaviour. The result is inspired by two alternative theories: the first is based on the Rosenblueth two-point distributions (TPD). and the second is related to Cellular Automata models. From a statistical point of view. the proposed reduction allows for the recognition of discrete heterogeneous sub-populations by assessing their significance within a realistic diffusion process.

Today many new products exhibit very strong seasonal behaviour. which may deserve specific modelling. both for producing better forecasts in the short term and for better explaining special market dynamics and related managerial decisions. By considering seasonality as a deterministic component to be estimated jointly with the trend through Nonlinear Least Squares methods. we have developed two extensions of the Guseo–Guidolin model that are able to simultaneously describe trend and seasonality.

Weekly time series. referring separately to quantities of regular and promotional sales. are available. Their joint inspection highlighted the presence of compensatory dynamics suggesting the study with the LVch to estimate whether competition between regular and promotional sales exists and how it affects product life-cycle. The study of sales under promotion with respect to regular ones represents a new way of dealing with promotional activities effects. whereas the innovation diffusion literature on new product growth has typically considered the effect of pricing and advertising through the generalized Bass model (Bass et al.. 1994). In that model. the total amount of sales. regular plus promotional sales. is analyzed with a univariate approach. while price and advertising expenditures are used as exogenous inputs. without a feedback control. Conversely. exploiting the availability of two distinct time series and studying their interaction. our results show that competition has a symmetric character. Regular sales may access the residual market of those under promotion indicating the beneficial effect of promotional efforts. but the reverse effect is also present.

1289690,An analysis of possible energy impacts of automated vehicles,2014,Austin Brown and Jeffrey Gonder and Brittany Repac,,,,137-153,Springer. Cham,Automated vehicles (AVs) are increasingly recognized as having the potential to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and petroleum consumption through mechanisms such as improved efficiency. better routing. and lower traffic congestion. and by enabling advanced technologies. However. AVs also have the potential to increase fuel consumption through effects such as longer distances traveled. increased use of transportation by underserved groups. and increased travel speeds. Here we collect available estimates for many potential effects and use a modified Kaya Identity approach to estimate the overall range of possible effects. Depending on the specific effects that come to pass. widespread AV deployment can lead to dramatic fuel savings. but has the potential for unintended consequences.,True,3jzqjVEAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,198,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-05990-7_13,13488667172455097022,/scholar?cites=13488667172455097022,,,,0,0,0

While the primary stated motivation for vehicle automation is to improve safety and convenience of road mobility. this transformation also provides a valuable opportunity to improve vehicle energy efficiency and reduce emissions in the transportation sector. Progress in vehicle efficiency and functionality. however. does not necessarily translate to net positive environmental outcomes. Here. we examine the interactions between CAV technology and the environment at four levels of increasing complexity: vehicle. transportation system. urban system. and society.

Golden. CO (United States),This report describes a geospatial analysis method to estimate the economic potential of several renewable resources available for electricity generation in the United States. Economic potential. one measure of renewable generation potential. may be defined in several ways. For example. one definition might be expected revenues (based on local market prices) minus generation costs. considered over the expected lifetime of the generation asset. Another definition might be generation costs relative to a benchmark (eg. a natural gas combined cycle plant) using assumptions of fuel prices. capital cost. and plant efficiency. Economic potential in this report is defined as the subset of the available resource technical potential where the cost required to generate the electricity (which determines the minimum revenue requirements for development of the resource) is below the revenue available in terms of displaced energy and displaced capacity. The assessment is conducted at a high geospatial resolution (more than 150.000 technology-specific sites in the continental United States) to capture the significant variation in local resource. costs. and revenue potential. This metric can be a useful screening factor for understanding the economic viability of renewable generation technologies at a specific location.

The purpose of this brief is to inform this regulatory and legislative decision-making. We solicited policy and planning questions and data needs for shared mobility from within the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies research network. We defined shared mobility as including shared mobility devices. such as e-bikes and e-scooters. and transportation network companies (TNCs). We evaluated whether data shared in accordance with each of six mobility data specifications could be used to support analyses that would answer these questions. We then defined three approaches to data sharing and analysis to address these and other questions. presenting the advantages and disadvantages of each. This brief does not address the full breadth of the questions raised in the CPUC rulemaking nor does it introduce the complexities of this topic.

Golden. CO (United States),This poster presents initial estimates of the net energy impacts of automated vehicles (AVs). Automated vehicle technologies are increasingly recognized as having potential to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and petroleum consumption through mechanisms such as improved efficiency. better routing. lower traffic congestion. and by enabling advanced technologies. However. some effects of AVs could conceivably increase fuel consumption through possible effects such as longer distances traveled. increased use of transportation by underserved groups. and increased travel speeds. The net effect on petroleum use and climate change is still uncertain. To make an aggregate system estimate. we first collect best estimates for the energy impacts of approximately ten effects of AVs. We then use a modified Kaya Identity approach to estimate the range of aggregate effects and avoid double counting. We find that depending on numerous factors. there is a wide range of potential energy impacts.

The effect of steam in the calciner on sorbent performance has received little attention in the literature. Here. experiments were conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) to determine the effect of steam injection during calcination on sorbent reactivity during carbonation.

Thus. in addition to O2 and CO2. the flue gases will include both steam and SO2. and similarly. carbonation of real flue gases will occur in the presence of steam. However. to date. most research has been done without either of these two gaseous components present. Here. batch combustion experiments were performed in a pilot-scale fluidized-bed reactor to study the effects of steam and SO2 addition on CO2 capture by limestone-based sorbents calcined under oxygen-enriched air and oxy-fuel conditions. The initial fast kinetically controlled CO2 capture stage was dramatically reduced when the sorbent was calcined at realistic temperatures in the presence of SO2.

The water–gas shift reaction was assumed to be responsible for the increase in activation energy from 29.7 to 60.3 kJ/mol for limestone based on the formation of intermediate complexes.

Techniques using the hydration of the spent CaO sorbent have been identified as a promising route for the reactivation of CaO sorbents but have so far not been tested at pilot scale using realistic calcination and carbonation conditions. In this work. the performance of sorbents reactivated by two different reactivation techniques (hydration–dehydration and superheating) was assessed in an oxy-fired. pilot-scale dual fluid bed unit. Compared to a spent sorbent. reactivated materials exhibited a ≈60% increase in CO2 carrying capacity over 3 h of circulation as well as an increase in the sorbent attrition rate of 25% (superheating) and 50% (hydration–dehydration).

Two groups of pellets with size 250–600 μm were prepared from Canadian and Spanish limestones using 10% calcium aluminate cement as a binder. The results showed that all groups of pellets experienced a significant extent of attrition as ~ 50% of the sorbent fed to the system was collected as fragments with particle size smaller than 250 μm. The attrition of pellets was found to be comparable to that of limestone tested under similar conditions. The results also indicated the same tendency of attrition for all groups of pellets. with attrition extent being relatively insensitive to limestone type used for pelletization or injection method of sorbent to the system.

Of the many developing post-combustion CO2 capture technologies. calcium looping appears promising due to its high thermal efficiency. technical feasibility at commercial-scale. and low sorbent cost.  Calcium looping has now been performed at the larger-scale. but there is still a significant quantity of information about sorbent performance. the fate of trace pollutant emissions (specifically SO2 and HCl). dual fluidized bed operating configurations. and impact of realistic operating conditions that still needs to be determined.

1289767,A review of convective and artificial vortices for power generation,2015,AT Mustafa and HH Al-Kayiem and SIU Gilani,10,,5,650-665,WIT Press,Thermal energy transfer in the atmosphere occurs from a high temperature zone to a low one by means of convective vortices where mechanical energy is produced. There are two ways of driving vertical flow in the core of a vortex:(1) by the direct action of buoyancy acting on hot air and (2) by producing a vertical pressure gradient along the axis of a vortex because of core development involving the lateral spread of the vortex with height. In particular. it indicates that the intensity of convective vortices depends on the depth of the convective layer via thermodynamic efficiency. the enthalpy perturbation across them. and the existence of sources of vorticity. The atmospheric vortex engine (AVE) is a device for producing an artificial vortex. The operation of AVE is based on the fact that the atmosphere is heated from the bottom and cooled at the top. By artificial vortex generation. it is aimed to eliminate the physical solar updraft tower and reduce the capital cost of solar chimney power plants. This paper reviews natural convective vortices and vortex creation via physical principles of vortex generation. Vortex analysis and modelling are presented.

The data required to train and test this method are attained from a thermodynamic model of the engine under steady-state conditions. To evaluate the tolerance of the method against measurement uncertainties.

Such characteristics are particularly important in energy systems and their potential response to climate change. where it is important to distinguish operational/fuel substitution from investment because the latter necessarily embodies both inertia and innovation. in systems as well as technologies. We argue that integrated assessments of climate abatement need to focus on investment. including the associated characteristics of both learning and inertia. and derive in detail the mathematical basis for incorporating these factors through marginal investment cost curves. From this we also introduce the concept of  pliability  as an expression of the ratio between costs which are significant but transitional (including learning investments. infrastructure and overcoming inertia). as compared to the enduring costs implied by purely exogenous technology assumptions. We then incorporate these features in a global model of optimal climate mitigation and show that they can generate a very different profile and pattern of results from traditional  integrated assessment  models. pinpointing the key sensitivities.

These analyses however rely critically on the assumption of an economic equilibrium. which dismisses established notions on behavioural heterogeneity. path dependence and technology transitions. Here we show that on the contrary. the decarbonisation of the electricity sector globally can lead to improvements in economic performance. By modelling the process of innovation-diffusion and non-equilibrium dynamics. we establish how climate policy instruments for emissions reductions alter economic activity through energy prices. government spending. enhanced investment and tax revenues. While higher electricity prices reduce income and output. this is over-compensated by enhanced employment generated by investments in new technology.

The drought has spread all over the Middle East. Saudi Arabia a decade ago made it illegal to use water for irrigation; you can use water from local aquifers for human use only. This has encouraged the Saudis. the Qataris. the Omanis to invest in lands in other parts of the world. primarily in Africa. Even weaker people in those lands have been expropriated from their traditional lands.Now we have seen the emergence of ISIS. We are all concentrating on the fact that they are all religious fanatics.“If only they were like the less fanatic Moslems from other parts of the world. we would all be OK.” But we forgot that the fight is only partially one of religion. Religion has become the language used to make the fight seem moral.

1289791,Cost-benefit Analysis of Climate Action in Adaptive Economic Systems: A Technology Production and Supply Chain Perspective,2015,Pablo Salas and Jean-Francois Mercure and Rutger-Jan Lange and Michael Grubb,,,,,International Association for Energy Economics,1. MethodFollowing the seminal work by Grubb et al.. 2014; Ha-Duong et al..(1997). here we present a microeconomic theoretical representation of both learning-by-doing. early scrapping as well as adaptive costs in a simple CBA framework consistent with Nordhaus.(2010). Technologies used to generate societal services (electricity. transport. etc). as well as producing industries. have a natural rate of turnover (J.-F Mercure. 2013). The costs of emissions abatement do not only stem from technology costs. but also from those of possible stranded assets and scaling up production capacity. Starting from a static MACC framework for technology costs. we explore technology dynamics based on a microeconomic technology diffusion-based approach. We first introduce learning in the MACC. We then add the costs of stranded assets as well as the adaptive component which have functional dependencies on abatement that include its rate of change. As in the work of Grubb. this results in different dynamics to the classical CBA model in which the functional dependence refers solely to abatement technology costs.,True,PmYeSoMAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/proceedingsabstractdoc.aspx?id=12963,11381309103618688114,/scholar?cites=11381309103618688114,,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/proceedingsabstractdoc.aspx?id=12963,0,0,0
1289792,An assessment of energy resources for global decarbonisation,2013,Jean-Francois Mercure and Pablo Salas,,,002,,University of Cambridge. Department of Land Economy. Cambridge Centre for Climate Change Mitigation Research,This paper presents an assessment of global economic energy potentials for all major natural energy resources. This work is based on both an extensive literature review and calculations based onto natural resource assessment data. In the first part. economic potentials are presented in the form of cost-supply curves. in terms of energy flows for renewable energy sources. or fixed amounts for fossil and nuclear resources. using consistent energy units that allow direct comparisons to be made. These calculations take into account. and provide a theoretical framework for considering uncertainty in resource assessments. providing a novel contribution aimed at enabling the introduction of uncertainty into resource limitations used in energy modelling. The theoretical details and parameters provided in tables enable this extensive natural resource database to be adapted to any modelling framework for energy systems. The second part of this paper uses these cost-supply curves in order to build a tool for analysing global scenarios of energy use. in the context of exploring the feasibility global decarbonisation using renewable energy sources. For such a purpose. a theoretical framework is given for evaluating either flows of stock energy resources for given price path assumptions for the related energy carriers. or the prices of energy carriers given energy demand assumptions. Results of both approaches are used in order to produce a complete comparison of global energy resources. The particular case of the feasibility of global decarbonisation by the end of the century is explored.

Decarbonization of the electricity grid would allow for low-carbon heating. cooling and transport. Investments in renewable energy must be made over a long time horizon to maximise return of investment of these long life power generators. Over these long time horizons. there exist multiple uncertainties. for example in future electricity demand and costs to consumers and investors.To mitigate for imperfect information of the future. we use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize for a low-cost. low-carbon electricity supply using a modified version of the FTT: Power model. In this work. we model the UK and Ireland electricity markets. The DDPG algorithm is able to learn the optimum electricity mix through experience and achieves this between the years of 2017 and 2050. We find that a change from fossil fuels and nuclear power to renewables. based upon wind. solar and wave would provide a cheap and low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels.,True,PmYeSoMAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02342,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02342,0,0,0

This is particularly true in Brazil. where insufficiently understood interactions within the Nexus are contributing to large-scale deforestation and land-use change. water and energy scarcity. and increased vulnerability to climate change. The reason is a combination of global environmental change and global economic change. putting unprecedented pressures on the Brazilian environment and ecosystems. In this paper. we identify and discuss the main Nexus challenges faced by Brazil across sectors (eg energy. agriculture. water) and scales (eg federal. state. municipal). We use four case studies to explore all nodes of the Nexus. For each. we analyse data from economic and biophysical modelling sources in combination with an overview of the legislative and policy landscape. in order to identify governance shortcomings in the context of growing challenges. We analyse the complex interdependence of developments at the global and local (Brazilian) levels. highlighting the impact of global environmental and economic change on Brazil and. conversely. that of developments in Brazil for other countries and the world. We conclude that there is a need to adjust the scientific approach to these challenges as an enabling condition for stronger science-policy bridges for sustainability policy-making.,True,PmYeSoMAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,0,https://iheid.tind.io/record/298237,,,,,,0,0,0

Following the Paris Agreement. a similar consensus exists in the policy community over the urgency of policy solutions to the climate problem. The context for climate policy is thus moving from agenda setting. which has now been mostly established. to impact assessment. in which we identify policy pathways to implement the Paris Agreement. Most integrated assessment models currently used to address the economic and technical feasibility of avoiding climate change are based on engineering perspectives with a normative systems optimisation philosophy. suitable for agenda setting. but unsuitable to assess the socio-economic impacts of realistic baskets of climate policies. Here. we introduce a fully descriptive. simulation-based integrated assessment model designed specifically to assess policies. formed by the combination of (1) a highly disaggregated macroeconometric simulation of the global economy based on time series regressions (E3ME).(2) a family of bottom-up evolutionary simulations of technology diffusion based on cross-sectional discrete choice models (FTT). and (3) a carbon cycle and atmosphere circulation model of intermediate complexity (GENIE). We use this combined model to create a detailed global and sectoral policy map and scenario that sets the economy on a pathway that achieves the goals of the Paris Agreement with> 66% probability of not exceeding 2 C of global warming.

Cambridge: Polity,,213-218,,Investors constitute a relatively new but potentially important voice in global environmental governance. Investors have long voiced their concerns over corporate governance through shareholder resolutions. With increasing ownership shares held by institutional investors. activism targeting multiple companies at the same time has also arisen as a tool to address governance issues. For example. the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) annually announces the so-called ‘focus list’. a list of poorly performing firms in terms of financial performance. aiming to improve their corporate governance and stock performance through active engagement with management. More recently. a large number of well-known institutional investors have taken coordinated action to combat climate change through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The CDP is noteworthy in that it is the first attempt by institutional investors to collectively address a global environmental problem that is less directly related to financial performance than to corporate governance issues. If successful. the CDP provides a valuable example of how investors. non-traditional actors. can promote global environmental governance.Global environmental issues such as climate change present an ideal setting to explore the increasing role of non-traditional actors in governing the global common good.

Given the benefits that accrue to those firms with superior environmental performance. firms have an incentive to shape their disclosures. including managing the amount of information that they disclose. In this paper. we document that firms who are investing less in efforts to improve environmental performance make disclosures that are of lower quality. in the sense that they are less complete. We test whether this disclosure strategy benefits firms. in terms of securing higher ratings from the information intermediaries to whom they are disclosing information. Consistent with our predictions. we find that less complete disclosures are associated with noisier ratings and lower ratings than subsequent improvements in environmental outcomes suggest that they deserve.,True,kw344RYAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,1,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/ambpp.2017.17401abstract,613973453830500855,/scholar?cites=613973453830500855,,,,0,0,0

Incumbents may respond to this change by pursuing either cost-leadership or differentiation. e.g. investment in green technology. Using data on US investor-owned electric utility companies from 1992 to 2008. this paper finds that. on average. wholesale electricity deregulation is associated with lower probability of entry into the renewable generation business by incumbents whereas retail electricity deregulation is not significantly related either to entry or to increases in renewables over time. It appears that wholesale deregulation provides greater cost-reducing incentives than retail deregulation.

Although the literature recognizes stakeholder   dynamism may exist. most prior work treats relevant stakeholders   or their requests as given. We contend that the concept of   dynamism offers a general and flexible framework that provides   new dimension to the firm-stakeholder relationship via social   media. accounting for both firms’ action to address stakeholders’   interests and stakeholders’ reactions. Stakeholder dynamism   manifests in three ways: (1) movement to a higher stakeholder   class with newly gained power. (2) liveliness—social media users   want to stay connected even without specific requests. and (3)   reactions.

If symbolic management is costless. however. then presumably all firms should pursue it. yet in practice they do not. In this paper. we examine the costs as well as the benefits of symbolic management. We emphasize selective (but truthful) disclosure as a tool for adjusting the extent of coupling between symbolic and substantive action. We identify both internal and external costs of selective disclosure. Internal costs arise because firms must undertake at least some level of substantive action in order to have something to truthfully disclose; external costs arise because some stakeholder groups may be sensitive to incomplete corporate disclosure. and impose costs on firms …,True,kw344RYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/AMBPP.2012.14579abstract,,,,,,0,0,0

Retail Electricity Restructuring and Renewable Generation,2008,Eun-Hee Kim,,,,,,The central idea behind economic deregulation is that increased competition provides firms with incentives for greater efficiency. This paper explores how the incentives for greater efficiency might bring about unintended consequences–negative environmental externalities–which could ultimately complicate the strategic choices of firms. It examines this question in the context of renewable electricity generation by electric utility companies in the United States. In particular. I study how retail electricity restructuring. which allows retail customers to choose their own electricity suppliers. influences firms’ investment decisions on renewables. I find that retail electricity restructuring is associated with a reduced propensity for utilities with no renewable supplies to make an initial investment in renewables. Furthermore. once a utility makes its first investment in renewables. it tends to increase the share of renewables in its …,True,kw344RYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13886664380854431845&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0
1289822,PRELIMINARY AND INCOMPLETE: PLEASE DO NOT CITE OR CIRCULATE,2005,Eun-Hee Kim and Thomas P Lyon,,,,,,This paper tries to answer the question.‘Why do firms participate in the Department of Energy (DOE)’s voluntary reporting of greenhouse gases program?’Over the last decade voluntary programs have risen as popular tools to address environmental issues. This is especially true of issues related to climate change and pollution prevention (Lyon and Maxwell. 2004). The increase in voluntary programs has prompted a large body of academic literature in these areas (Lyon and Maxwell. 2002). This literature ranges from theoretical evaluations of their welfare implications to empirical examinations of firms’ participation in the programs. Despite the vast coverage. however. most of the rigorous firm-level participation decision studies are limited to pollution prevention-related issues. Climate change-related issues have not been explored as rigorously. This is probably due to the difficulty in obtaining the relevant data for firm-level analysis. The analysis of climate change-related voluntary programs often requires examining the electric utility sector because it is the largest industrial emitter of greenhouse gases. Collecting financial and operational data for electric operating companies. especially those of investor-owned. has become very difficult since the mid-1990s when the Energy Information Administration (EIA). the statistical agency of DOE. stopped organizing in a convenient format the raw data that electric operating companies report to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

As environmental performance has become increasingly important to customers and investors. intermediaries have developed to fill the void left by the lack of standardized or required reporting and help alleviate the information asymmetry between firms and stakeholders. The ability of these intermediaries to provide accurate and useful information depends on the strategic disclosure of information and reporting by firms.

1289831,The impact of international migration on international trade: an empirical study of Australian migrant intake from Asian countries,2008,Sidney Mankit Lung,,,,,,In the context of established international economic theory. it is well known that international trade of commodities is effectively trading factors of production such as labour and capital. It follows that if factors of production can be moved internationally. then the need for commodity trade is eased. and trade of commodities and movements of factors of production can be substituted for each other. From this. the conclusion can be reached that factor movement is a substitute for commodity trade. Allowing people to migrate from one country to another country involves migration of labour – the movement of a factor of production. The conclusion that factor flows are a substitute for commodity-trade can be re-stated as international immigration is a substitute for international trade. However. this conclusion does not explain the real world in which both international trade and international immigration have increased over time. Thus. established theory of immigration and trade may not be a reliable policy guide for formulating immigration and/or trade policy. It is the purpose of this thesis to formulate an alternative theory. which more effectively explains the relationship between immigration and trade. For the purpose of distinguishing the impact of immigrants on trade from the impact of other factors on trade. this thesis employs a two-step approach. The first step lays down the theoretical foundations by arguing that immigrants contribute to the economy of the immigrant receiving country in two areas: Firstly. immigrants supply labour to the immigrant receiving country and increase demand for goods and services. hence increase the size of the economy in the …,True,xC2f3_UAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,16,http://eprints.vu.edu.au/1460,2537646228795382687,/scholar?cites=2537646228795382687,,,http://eprints.vu.edu.au/1460/1/lung.pdf,0,0,0

It is part of an organisational analysis of the sector. and brings together the organisational and economic context for training with a particular focus on SMEs and their capability needs and apprenticeships.The sector has been through a period of contraction. which has left the industry with an ageing workforce and skills gaps. The sector is also transforming in response to increased investment. and social. economic and environmental changes. which includes Industry 4.0. The challenge now facing the sector is how to build a differently skilled workforce and strengthen areas of the supply chain to meet the increasing demand for all types of rolling stock assets. and the delivery of a service that is networked. reliable. and suitable for every type of passenger. Effective training is central to this challenge.,True,xC2f3_UAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,http://vuir.vu.edu.au/40737/1/dot-training-report.pdf,,,,,http://vuir.vu.edu.au/40737/1/dot-training-report.pdf,0,0,0

The complete suite of reports is as follows,The economics of the rolling stock sector are largely dictated by its history. which has resulted in its current status as public–private partnership (PPP) arrangements between government and industry for the design. manufacture. maintenance and operation of rolling stock. That rolling stock is obtained by government procurement so we investigate aspects of international trade policy and procurement agreements relevant to determine what role government procurement can play in supporting local industry. especially through workforce development and training.

For the first time. energy use and GDP data are both disaggregated into their main components. Panel cointegration techniques addressing heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence are employed to infer the directions and the signs of long-run cross causalities between GDP and energy components. Results are threefold: first. there is a feedback relationship between total energy use and GDP at the aggregated level. mainly through the public expenditure channel. Second. the feedback relationship is validated between real GDP and transportation energy. residence energy and consumption energy. respectively. mainly through the exports and imports channels. Third.the conservation relationship is found between industrial energy and real GDP for which main transmission mechanisms are consumption. exports and imports.,True,xC2f3_UAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/id/eprint/93271,,,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/93271/1/MPRA_paper_93271.pdf,0,0,0

A fundamental concept is described which identifies n-dodecane and iso-octane as being appropriate surrogate fuel components for the non-aromatic synthetic fuels. The performance of the formulated 51.9/48.1 mole % n-dodecane/iso-octane mixture as a surrogate for the target real fuel is evaluated by the measurement of a series of combustion phenomena exhibited by both fuels including:(1)The oxidative reactivity of stoichiometric mixtures of each fuel in O2/N2 at 12.5 atm and 500–1050 K. for a residence time of 1.8 s at a fixed carbon content of 0.3% using a variable pressure flow reactor.(2)The autoignition behavior of stoichiometric …The oxidative reactivity of stoichiometric mixtures of each fuel in O2/N2 at 12.5 atm and 500–1050 K. for a residence time of 1.8 s at a fixed carbon content of 0.3% using a variable pressure flow reactor.The autoignition behavior of stoichiometric …,True,5IzbHtIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,138,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218012001496,3398040798973953143,/scholar?cites=3398040798973953143,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46160357/0c96051ca0f7f20879000000.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. the flame spreads in a narrow gap. as occurs in fires behind walls or inside electronic equipment. This geometry leads to interesting flame behaviors not typically seen in open flame spread. and also reproduces some of the conditions experienced by microgravity flames.Two sets of experiments are described. one involving flame spread in a Narrow Channel Apparatus (NCA) in normal gravity. and the others taking place in actual microgravity. Three primary variables are considered: flow velocity. oxygen concentration. and gap size (or effect of heat loss). When the oxidizer flow is reduced at either gravity level. the initially uniform flame front becomes corrugated and breaks into separate flamelets. This breakup behavior allows the flame to keep propagating below standard extinction limits by increasing the …,True,5IzbHtIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,94,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218009000157,1306356117705179477,/scholar?cites=1306356117705179477,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46371831/Flame_spread_over_thin_fuels_in_actual_a20160609-7664-xrmlti.pdf,0,0,0

The overall oxidative reactivity of n-decane is observed in detail to show low temperature. negative temperature coefficient (NTC) and hot ignition regimes. Detailed temporal speciation studies are performed at reactor initial temperatures of 533 K and 740 K at 12.5 atm pressure and 830 K at 8 atm pressure. Significant amounts of large olefins are produced at 830 K. at conditions of transition from NTC to hot ignition behavior.

Here. we demonstrate a similar result can be obtained by formulating surrogate hydrocarbon fluid mixtures from distillation cuts of molecular class hydrocarbons or even real gas turbine fuels (for which the specific molecular species classes are no more than qualitatively known).

Princeton Variable Pressure Flow Reactor results show that t-butanol does not exhibit low temperature chemistry. and thus has no negative temperature coefficient behavior under the studied conditions. The onset of gas phase chemistry at high pressure occurs at ∼780 K. Over the temperature range of 780–950 K. t-butanol primarily reacts through hydrogen abstraction − alkyl or alkoxy radical beta-scission pathways to form methyl and propen-2-ol. which likely tautomerizes in the sampling system to form acetone. A species sampling study of a t-butanol counterflow diffusion flame reveals that the high temperature consumption routes of t-butanol lead to the stable intermediates isobutene. acetone. and methane. with isobutene existing in the highest concentrations.

1289860,A detailed computational analysis of cavitating and non-cavitating high pressure diesel injectors,2016,Saeed Jahangirian and Aleksandra Egelja and Huiying Li,,,2016-01-0873,,SAE Technical Paper,Demands for higher power engines have led to higher pressures in fuel injectors. Internal nozzle flow plays a critical role in the near nozzle flow and subsequent spray pattern. The internal flow becomes more difficult to model when the injector pressure and internal shape make it more prone to cavitation. Two Bosch injectors. proposed for experimental and computational studies under the Engine Combustion Network (namely “Spray C” and “Spray D”) are modeled in the computational fluid dynamics code ANSYS Fluent.

These advantages are especially important for commercial and strategic air transportation. which are principally powered by gas turbine engines. Certainly through 2035 (and very likely for the remainder of this century) liquid fuel combustion will continue to be the major mode of energy use in transportation systems [2].Fuel specification standards for each end use and certification testing methodologies have been pursued to assure a specific engine technology will operate properly with a fit-for-use fuel. These standards and certification methodologies have been developed primarily on the basis of fuels produced when conventional crude oil was the principal raw energy resource. Recently. much effort has been given to extending the specification standards to encompass blending of alternative fuels derived through synthesis gas processing of natural gas. biomass. and coal using Fischer-Tropsch methods and hydrogenation of fats and bio-oils with petroleum derived fuels.

FT fuels typically contain a high concentration of lightly methylated iso-alkanes. whereas petroleum derived jet and diesel fuels contain large fractions of n-alkanes. cycloalkanes. and aromatics plus some lightly methylated iso-alkanes. A recent experimental and kinetic modeling study of large 2-methylalkanes validated a chemical kinetic model for 2-methylheptane against experimental data obtained in a premixed flame. non-premixed flame. shock tube. and perfectly stirred reactor. In order to further validate models for lightly branched alkanes. this study presents new data for 2-methylheptane oxidation in flow reactor. reflected shock. and rapid compression machine experiments. The flow reactor experiment provides temporal fuel speciation measurements at 840 K and 8 atm. which are important validation targets not available previously for lightly branched alkanes.

The effect of sulfate on concrete is via chemical reactions between hydrated Portland cement and sulfate ions. This effect increases/decreases according to the permeability rate of concrete and the type of cement used in concrete. Puzolanic additives such as fly ash and blast furnace slag are used together with sulfate resistant cement to increase sulfate resistance of concrete. In this study. a special type concrete was produced with Boron Modified Active Belite (BAB) Cement for the investigation of Boron effect on the sulfate attack. For comparison Portland Cement (CEM I 42.5 R) was also utilized. In all mortar mixtures cement: sand ratio and water-cement ratio were kept constant at 1: 2.75 and 0.485 by weight.

Ventilation strategies in dwellings still allow the use of trickle ventilators in window frames for background ventilation. The extent to which this results in “healthy” Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) in recently constructed dwellings was a concern of regulators in Scotland. This paper describes research to explore this. First a review of literature was conducted. then data on occupant interactions with ventilation provisions (windows. doors. trickle vents) gathered through an interview-based survey of 200 recently constructed dwellings. and measurements made on a sample of 40 of these. The main measured parameter discussed here is CO 2 concentration. It was concluded after the literature review that 1000 ppm absolute was a reasonable threshold to use for “adequate” ventilation. The occupant survey found that there was very little occupant interaction with the trickle ventilators eg. in bedrooms 63% were always closed. 28% always open. and in only 9% of cases occupants intervened to make occasional adjustments. In the measured dwellings average bedroom CO 2 levels of 1520 ppm during occupied (night time) hours were observed. Where windows were open the average bedroom CO 2 levels were 972 ppm. With windows closed. the combination of “trickle ventilators open plus doors open” gave an average of 1021 ppm.“Trickle ventilators open” gave an average of 1571 ppm.

1289941,Scottish passive house: insights into environmental conditions in monitored passive houses,2016,Janice Foster and Tim Sharpe and Anna Poston and Chris Morgan and Filbert Musau,8,Sustainability,5,412,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Climate change and sustainability legislation in recent years has led to significant changes in construction approaches in the UK housing sector. This has resulted in the adoption of new building typologies. including the German Passivhaus (Passive House) standard. This standard aims to improve occupant comfort and energy efficiency. potentially changing the ways in which homes operate and how occupants interact with them. With increasing construction of low energy dwellings. there is an emerging gap in knowledge in relation to occupant health and wellbeing. thermal comfort. and indoor air quality (IAQ). Using data collected from a two year Building Performance Evaluation (BPE) study funded by Innovate UK. the environmental data (temperature. relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentrations) from five Certified Passive House homes in Scotland was compared. The results demonstrate problems with overheating with peak temperatures exceeding 30 C. Imbalanced mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) systems were identified in 80% of the dwellings and inadequate IAQ was found due to poor ventilation. Only one of the Passive Houses studied exhibited thermal conditions and IAQ which were. on the whole within Passive House parameters.

EPFL,There is growing awareness in the UK that overheating is a significant problem and one that is likely to intensify with climate change. increasing urbanisation. an ageing population and the move towards ‘low energy’buildings. Recent research suggested that while overheating may be an issue in the South of England. particularly in urban areas. it was not likely to be an issue for Scotland and the North of the UK in the medium term. This notion is reflected in the lack of awareness of the issue in Scotland. Monitoring of 26 new-build low energy and Passivhaus homes across Scotland over a two year period indicates overheating is prevalent in living areas and in particular in bedrooms where it is acknowledged that respite from high temperatures is important.

While previous reviews of IAQ on Passivhaus-certified buildings foccused on offices. this study examines residential buildings. A summary of data collection methods and pollutant concentrations is presented. followed by a critical discussion of the impact of Passivhaus design strategies on IAQ. This review indicates that IAQ in Passivhaus-certified dwellings is generally better than in conventional homes. but both occupant behaviour and pollution from outdoor sources play a significant role in indoor concentrations. Moreover. there are differences in data collection and reporting methods. Many of the available studies depend on short-term IAQ monitoring of less than two weeks. making it difficult to determine the longer impact of housing design on IAQ and occupants’ well-being. There is also a lack of studies from non-European countries. Future research should focus on investigating associations between IAQ and Passivhaus design strategies in hot and humid climates. where evidence is particularly lacking. Further effort is also required to investigate potential links between occupant’s perception of IAQ and physical exposure to indoor pollution.

This results in uninformed decision-making which impacts on actual building performance. in particular Whole Life Costs (WLC). It is proposed that Building Information Modelling (BIM) has the potential to facilitate a more comprehensive and accurate design approach from the initial stages if the model can utilize reliable and robust cost and performance data from buildings in use.

The houses are intended for mainstream and social tenure within Glasgow and contain a range of energy reducing features including one house with a thermally heavy clay block wall and one house using a conventional timber frame and both houses have sunspaces. Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR). solar thermal system and low energy lighting. The dwellings have been subject to an innovative monitoring strategy by MEARU. whereby test occupants (students recruited from the School of Architecture) have been asked to inhabit the buildings for six two-week periods using occupancy ‘scripts’ that determine their internal behaviour. The scenarios thus simulate varying patterns of occupancy in both houses simultaneously and the performance of the houses can then been compared. Indications are that although the clay block house had a poorer thermal performance. it did have other qualitative advantages. and consumption differences could be eliminated by exploiting the thermal mass. The performance of the active systems. including the MVHR system. was found to be problematic. and specific scenarios were undertaken to explore the implications of this.

1289958,Communal residential laundry washing and drying: can it provide demand-side electrical load flexibility?,2011,Simon Paul Borg and Nicolas Kelly and Anastasios Markopoulos and Paul Strachan and Colin Porteous and Tim Sharpe,,2nd International conference in microgeneration and related technologies,,,,Changes in lifestyle have led to increased use and ownership rates of domestic appliances resulting in increasing electrical consumption in the residential sector. An important element of this consumption is due to domestic washing and drying of laundry. Given current and predicted ownership rates. the market for drying facilities is still not fully saturated and electrical demand for these functions will therefore increase. This paper looks at energy loads for laundering in high density housing such as blocks of flats and explores the benefits of communal facilities. Benefits of such facilities include reduced high humidity levels and the mitigation of decreased indoor air quality associated with indoor drying of laundry in individual dwellings. However from the perspective of integrating microgeneration into buildings. communal facilities may facilitate increased flexibility in the electrical demand profile. hence better complementing low carbon and localised energy supplies. In order to investigate the possible effects on the electric demand load profile. this paper presents the scenario of a hypothetical housing block and analyses the effect of moving from washing and drying in individual households to communal facilities. The study includes the effects of appliance energy-efficiency improvements and increased ownership rates. Results obtained show that communal laundering is successful in terms of time-shifting and hence lowering of peak electrical demand but is ineffective in reducing consumption.,True,mTdbSJEAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,5,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/id/eprint/36940,3992658283232313990,/scholar?cites=3992658283232313990,,,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/36940/1/Kelly_NJ_Strachan_Pure_Communal_residential_laundry_washing_and_drying_can_it_provide_demand_side_electrical_load_flexibility_Apr_2011.pdf,0,0,0

Visual and Physical Integration in Building Mounted Wind Turbines–An Alternative Approach,2010,Tim Sharpe,,Paths to Sustainable Energy,,279-300,BoD–Books on Demand,There context for addressing energy use in the built environment includes: the climate change agenda; concerns about peak oil supply; increasing fuel costs; costs of de-carbonising grid supply; and security of supply for certain regions. All of these highlight the value and need for renewable energy supplies. The context for the increased development of renewable energy is clear. The balance of evidence coming from the scientific community concerning the threats and impacts of anthropogenic climate change is now widely accepted (IPCC 2007). This had led to an economic analysis of the actions needed to address these problems (Stern 2007). which identify the benefits of early action. In addition to the climate change agenda. other drivers in the form of concerns about peak oil supply in turn leading to scarcity and increasing fuel costs. the costs of decarbonising grid supply. and security of supply for certain regions all highlight the value and need for renewable energy supplies. To address these problems. a range of policies and technologies are being developed to reduce consumption and to provide a greater generating capacity of low carbon and renewable energy. This requires action at a range of scales and across industries. from national generators to individual consumers. The built environment has particular responsibilities with respect to its demand for energy and resources.

Among many protonic ceramics. yttrium-doped barium zirconate has attracted attention due to its excellent chemical stability. which is the main issue in protonic-ceramic fuel cells. However. poor sinterability of yttrium-doped barium zirconate discourages its fabrication as a thin-film electrolyte and integration on porous anode supports. both of which are essential to achieve high performance.

This residual stress on the electrolyte limits reliable cell operation in practice. and it often results in the failure of the cells. To alleviate the residual thermal stress of the cell. especially on the surface of the electrolyte. we propose to use an additional stress relieving porous layer between the electrolyte and the cathode.

However. only limited research efforts have been made within the area of fire-induced spalling of rock.The objective of this study was to improve the understanding of the behaviour of three Fennoscandian rocks subjected to fire. This was investigated by testing a group of oven-dried and water-stored granite. gabbro and schist blocks. The blocks with the size 600 mm× 500 mm× 300 mm were tested on a small furnace in which the time-temperature curve approximately follows the hydrocarbon fire curve during the first several minutes and then slightly decreases. The temperature distributions inside the tested blocks were also measured during heating.,True,bIqmbI4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,9,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1008265/FULLTEXT01.pdf,1753362152867314315,/scholar?cites=1753362152867314315,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1008265/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0
1290000,Evaluation of vacuum insulation panels used in hybrid insulation district heating pipes,2014,Axel Berge and Bijan Adl-Zarrabi,,"Proceedings of the 14th international symposium on district heating and cooling, Stockholm, Sweden",,7-9,,It is of interest to lower the energy losses from district heating pipes both for economic and environmental reasons. This paper evaluates a hybrid insulation solution where Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIP) are put around the supply pipe in a district heating pipe and the rest of the casing pipe is filled with polyurethane foam (PUR).The apparatus for the “guarded hot pipe” method was used to estimate the thermal properties of single pipes. which have been used as input in finite element models for simulation of twin pipes in field. The simulations indicate a total reduction in the energy loss between 18% and 32% compared to pipes of the same size with pure PUR insulation. Furthermore. the losses from the supply pipe decrease by up to 56%. To achieve the low energy losses. the vacuum in the panels has to be preserved over the life span of the VIP. In field measurements. a hybrid pipe prototype was connected to the district heating grid in Varberg (southwest Sweden). After almost two years. the pipe is still working without any detectable deterioration of the insulation performance. The panels have also been tested at high temperatures in laboratory with promising results.,True,bIqmbI4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bijan_Adl-Zarrabi/publication/267509246_Evaluation_of_vacuum_insulation_panels_used_in_hybrid_insulation_district_heating_pipes/links/5bf2d278299bf1124fde50aa/Evaluation-of-vacuum-insulation-panels-used-in-hybrid-insulation-district-heating-pipes.pdf,15386306561753775028,/scholar?cites=15386306561753775028,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bijan_Adl-Zarrabi/publication/267509246_Evaluation_of_vacuum_insulation_panels_used_in_hybrid_insulation_district_heating_pipes/links/5bf2d278299bf1124fde50aa/Evaluation-of-vacuum-insulation-panels-used-in-hybrid-insulation-district-heating-pipes.pdf,0,0,0

To utilise this type of energy. novel technologies are developed across the globe. Among these. the pavement solar collector (PSC) technology has a considerable potential. A PSC consist of pipes. that are embedded into the upper pavement layers through which fluid is circulated. Solar radiation heats the pavement surface. and the absorbed heat is transferred to the circulating fluid. One applications is to use the heat for recharging shallow geothermal boreholes with solar energy during summer. thereby reducing the electricity consumption of ground source heat pumps during winter. In Scandinavia. however. the knowledge on the PSC application is limited. The Swedish transport administration has therefore established a field station to gain more insight on the PSC in Scandinavia.

Current winter road maintenance methods use 600.000 tons of salt annually. in the Nordic countries. The salt ends up in the environment along the roads and results in environmental challenges. Alternative winter maintenance methods that use heat instead of salt are in use today. However. those systems are designed to use high temperature of about 20–35 °C. This paper presents a numerical model for designing low temperature (4–8 °C) hydronic heated pavements (HHP). The model is validated against an experimental setup and different control strategies are evaluated.

However. there is a need of fast and accurate determination of the thermal properties of the product. The properties can be measured using a direct measurement method such as the Transient Plane Source (TPS) method. To investigate whether the method could be suitable to measure VIP. the recorded temperature increase and the supplied heat flow by the TPS sensor was used in a numerical analysis. An analytical solution was developed to study the heat propagation in the foil material. In order to simplify the TPS measurements. the VIP was replaced with polystyrene with and without aluminium foil. As expected. there was little consistency between the measurement results of VIP with the TPS method and values for VIP found in the literature.

Washington. DC,The 21st century will witness the collision of two powerful forces-burgeoning population growth. together with a changing climate. With population growth. water scarcity will proliferate to new areas across the globe. And with climate change. rainfall will become more fickle. with longer and deeper periods of droughts and deluges. This report presents new evidence to advance understanding on how rainfall shocks coupled with water scarcity. impacts farms. firms. and families. On farms. the largest consumers of water in the world. impacts are channeled from declining yields to changing landscapes. In cities. water extremes especially when combined with unreliable infrastructure can stall firm production. sales. and revenue. At the center of this are families. who feel the impacts of this uncertainty on their incomes. jobs. and long-term health and welfare. Although a rainfall shock may be fleeting. its consequences can become permanent and shape the destiny of those who experience it. Pursuing business as usual will lead many countries down a'parched path'where droughts shape destinies. Avoiding this misery in slow motion will call for fundamental changes to water policy around the globe. Building resilience to rainfall variability will require using different policy instruments to address the multifaceted nature of water. A key message of this report is that water has multiple economic attributes. each of which entail distinct policy responses.

The Morishima elasticities. which reflect the technological substitution potential. indicate that a 1% increase in the price of energy causes the capital/energy input ratio to increase by 1.5%.

In particular. our study uses two methods to reveal the reasons behind sectoral water use in all EU countries. The first method is based on an accounting indicator that calculates the water intensity of an economy as the sum of sectoral water intensities. The second method is a subsystem input-output model that divides total water use into different income channels within the production system. The application uses data for the years 2005 and 2009 on water consumption in the production system of the 27 countries of the EU. From our analysis it emerges that EU countries are characterized by very different …,True,CmVXirwAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,18,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11269-014-0566-6,3894064093543533091,/scholar?cites=3894064093543533091,,,https://www.recercat.cat/bitstream/handle/2072/225298/201403.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Using half hourly electricity demand data. the system marginal price (also called the wholesale price) and the retail price of electricity. we analyse how the gross margin varies across customers with different characteristics. The wholesale price varies throughout the day. thus. the time at which electricity is used affects the gross margin.

The microdata are drawn from the 9-year-old cohort of the Growing Up in Ireland Study. We estimate regression models to identify the factors associated with internet use in the classroom and students’ scores on standardised reading and mathematics tests. and we check whether internet use is endogenous in the test score models. We find that provision of broadband service under the government scheme is associated with more than a doubling of teachers’ use of the internet in class after about a two year lag. Better computing facilities in schools are also associated with higher internet use. but advertised download speed is not statistically significant.

1290026,The ESRI energy model,2012,Valeria Di Cosmo and Marie Hyland,,,424,,Working Paper. The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). Dublin,In Ireland. the energy sector has undergone significant change in the last forty years. In this period. there has been a significant increase in the demand for energy. This increase has been driven by economic and demographic factors. Although the current deep recession has quelled the upward trend in the demand for energy. a future economic recovery will bring these issues back into focus. This paper documents a model of the Irish energy sector which relates energy demand to real economic variables. As part of the HERMES macro-economic model this model of the energy sector has. for a number of years. been used to forecast energy demand. However. the energy model itself can be considered in isolation from the HERMES macro-economic model and this paper gives details of its specification.Because of the capital intensity and long life of the capital assets in the investment sector. a good understanding of how future energy demand will behave is of considerable importance. However. as with all other forecasts. energy demand forecasts are subject to considerable margins of error and wise policy and investment decisions will take this into account. The impact of inaccurate energy demand forecasting was evident in Ireland throughout the 1980s. As discussed in FitzGerald et al.. 2002. decisions made in the 1970s led to excess spare capacity in the electricity sector throughout the 1980s. This placed an addition price burden on Irish consumers and had a negative impact on Ireland’s competitiveness.,True,CmVXirwAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,8,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/100213/1/715485911.pdf,10746880356714459009,/scholar?cites=10746880356714459009,,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/100213/1/715485911.pdf,0,0,0

Department of Economics,This paper analyses the system of energy performance certificates in place in Ireland. We find that having a system with discrete energy-efficiency thresholds causes “bunching” among properties just on the more favorable side of the label cut-off points. This indicates that. in the region around the label thresholds. assessors tend to be extra lenient when evaluating the energy performance of dwellings. We examine possible reasons for this finding. including the market returns to energy efficiency using home sales data from the Irish property price register. and conclude that most likely assessors are trying to ingratiate homeowners to get repeat business.

Our econometric framework structurally estimates the frictionless level of fuel-using capital stocks and employs non-parametric analysis to reveal information on the form of adjustment costs facing firms. To illustrate this approach we use a large panel of Irish manufacturing firms over the period 2004-2009. The econometric estimates show a large variation in the optimal response of capital to changing fuel prices across different fuel-using technologies and imply substantial costs to capital adjustment.

1290043,Total-Factor Energy Efficiency and Its Extensions: Introduction. Computation. and Application,2016,Jin-Li Hu and Tzu-Pu Chang,,,,,Springer,This chapter demonstrates how to use different types of DEA models to compute the total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores. including CCR. Russell. QFI. SBM. DF. and DDF models. The TFEE is a disaggregate input efficiency index. Moreover. the TFEE framework which uses cross-section data can be extended to the total-factor energy productivity (TFEP) growth index by following Malmquist. Leunberger. and Malmquist-Leunberger models which use panel data. Finally. the regional data of Chinese regions during 2010–2011 with inputs and desirable as well as undesirable outputs are used for illustrating the computation of TFEE and TFEP scores.,True,v6CqY2YAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,12,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-7684-0_3,16562003070946394110,/scholar?cites=16562003070946394110,,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/37788/1/93.Joe%20Zhu.pdf#page=58,0,0,0
1290044,Incorporating a leading indicator into the trading rule through the Markov-switching vector autoregression model,2009,Tzu-Pu Chang and Jin-Li Hu,16,Applied Economics Letters,12,1255-1259,Taylor & Francis,This article examines the profitability of trading rules based on the smoothed probability of Markov-switching models and executes two models in Taiwan's case. The results present that both proposed models can earn excess returns over the buy-and-hold strategy and support that both can be used to trade. However. the univariate Markov-switching model. which only uses daily returns series does not successfully capture the trend in the stock market. especially during a bull market. This implies that high-frequency returns series contain lots of noises. In order to overcome this problem. the Markov-switching vector autoregression model that combines a leading indicator and returns is performed in this study. The results indicate a better trading pattern. We conclude that the leading indicator chosen from open interest in the future market increases useful information and reduces noises to improve model estimation …,True,v6CqY2YAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,11,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504850701367254,9542107701350521908,/scholar?cites=9542107701350521908,,,https://ir.nctu.edu.tw/bitstream/11536/14210/1/000268279700015.pdf,0,0,0

This paper applies stochastic frontier approach extend from Zhou et al.(2012) to estimate the input factors efficiency of the 90 life insurance companies from 2006 to 2011. We treat the number of employees. shareholder's equity. and the liability as the input factors. while the operating revenue as the output factor. Our major empirical findings are as follows: The average labor efficiency score of Taiwan areas is higher than the mainland of China. Companies in mainland China get a better average liability efficiency score than those in Taiwan. The average shareholder's equity efficiency scores in the two areas are quite close. while companies in Taiwan do a little bit better.,True,v6CqY2YAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,5,https://search.proquest.com/openview/bc9ac3de30679dd07d748e3567b146a9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1016357,14525422607997108852,/scholar?cites=14525422607997108852,,,,0,0,0

China is now facing a dual challenge of improving both energy and emission efficiencies. To trace the trends of energy and pollution efficiencies. this chapter proposes two indices: ecological total-factor energy efficiency (ETFEE). and ecological total-factor pollution efficiency (ETFPE) based on the Russell-based directional distance function. Using regional data from 2001 to 2011. the result shows that the ETFPE is always lower than the ETFEE for any area in China in the same year. indicating that the country is facing a more serious situation with respect to pollution control compared to energy saving.,True,v6CqY2YAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-0928-0_5,5220288074618883458,/scholar?cites=5220288074618883458,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46485686/10.1007_978-981-10-0928-0.pdf#page=67,0,0,0

There are three input variables. one output variable. and six exogenous determinants of twenty-three municipalities in Taiwan from 1998 to 2004. The average recycling performance has improved progressively. Taichung City is the best performer and Chiayi City is the worst. Municipalities with a higher proportion of highly-educated population. higher household income. and more promoting activities have better recycling performances. Proportions of high-educated people. household income. and promoting activities have decreasing marginal effects while population density has increasing marginal effects on recycling efficiency.

1290194,Mobile commerce integrated with RFID technology in a container depot,2007,Eric WT Ngai and TC Edwin Cheng and S Au and Kee-hung Lai,43,Decision Support Systems,1,62-76,North-Holland,In this paper. we present the findings of a case study on the development of a radio frequency identification (RFID) prototype system that is integrated with mobile commerce (m-commerce) in a container depot. A system architecture capable of integrating mobile commerce and RFID applications is proposed. The system architecture is examined and explained in the context of the case study. The aims of the system are to (i) keep track of the locations of stackers and containers. (ii) provide greater visibility of the operations data. and (iii) improve the control processes.

One of the most important decisions in fleet management is the optimization of vehicle scheduling during an accident. such as a vehicle breakdown and mechanical failure during delivery. The schedule planner has to assign another vehicle to take over the task; thus. accident handling needs the reassignment or re-scheduling of vehicles. The large number of available vehicles for reassignment and numerous trips in a day make rescheduling complicated and difficult to resolve. In this paper. we propose a CFMS integrated with global positioning system (GPS) for real-time vehicle positioning and eSeal enabled by the RFID technology. to help human planners with rescheduling.

The standard procedure for extinction pulse (E-pulse) construction is based on an expansion on subsectional polynomials. In this paper it is proposed a new formalism for E-pulse construction using beta-splines. This formalism allows the E-pulse polynomial basis expansion to be treated in a unified theoretical framework and leads to a simplification of the original problem due to the linear nature of all the involved parameters. This new formulation has been also used to impose new conditions over the spectral contents of the E-pulses. These E-pulses constructed using the new conditions annihilate better the natural modes in the late-time radar target response. and provide a better discrimination rates than the classical scheme,True,txXpTiwAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,20,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1629288/,9815284836500590118,/scholar?cites=9815284836500590118,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Diego_Ruiz3/publication/3018591_Extinction_Pulses_Synthesis_for_Radar_Target_Discrimination_Usingbeta-Splines_NewE-Pulse_Conditions/links/54ad58460cf24aca1c6f1957/Extinction-Pulses-Synthesis-for-Radar-Target-Discrimination-Usingbeta-Splines-NewE-Pulse-Conditions.pdf,0,0,0

Specifically. the residential buildings are responsible for more than 40% of the total energy consumption of the European Union. Therefore. this residential sector is an important target for optimizing the use of energy. This paper examines the energy saving measures for multi-family residential building thermal systems in the city of Granada.

Although extensive efforts have been focused on developing novel cathode materials. it has been a grand challenge to find candidates that can outperform state-of-the-art cathode materials such as layered. olivine. and spinel lithium transition-metal oxides. This issue arises because there are only a limited number of intercalation hosts with appropriate redox potential and lithium solubility. Here. we present a new iron-based intercalation host for lithium ion by exploring the “host formation reaction” from the nanocomposite of lithium and transition-metal compound hosts (i.e..

This new FeOF host structure differs from the well-known rutile FeOF structure and displays distinct electrochemical properties as an electrode for Na-ion batteries.

This voltage decay is widely accepted to mainly originate from progressive structural rearrangements involving irreversible transition metal migration. As prevention of this spontaneous cation migration has proven difficult. a paradigm shift toward management of its reversibility is needed. Herein. we demonstrate that the reversibility of the cation migration of lithium-rich nickel manganese oxides can be remarkably improved by altering the oxygen stacking sequences in the layered structure and thereby dramatically reducing the voltage decay. The preeminent intra-cycle reversibility of the cation migration is experimentally visualized and first-principles calculations reveal that an O2-type structure restricts the movements of transition metals within the Li layer. which effectively streamlines the returning migration path of transition metals. Furthermore. we propose that the enhanced reversibility mitigates the asymmetry of the anionic redox in conventional lithium-rich electrodes. promoting the high-potential anionic reduction. thereby reducing the subsequent voltage hysteresis. Our findings demonstrate that regulating the reversibility of the cation migration is a practical strategy to reduce voltage decay and hysteresis in lithium-rich layered materials.,True,jMXcILkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://escholarship.org/content/qt4gh260pt/qt4gh260pt_noSplash_99c862fb621534024d27e920ca678d3a.pdf,,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt4gh260pt/qt4gh260pt_noSplash_99c862fb621534024d27e920ca678d3a.pdf,0,0,0

Currently. there are no equivalent correlations that predict u s in nonsuspension dense-phase flows. In dense-phase conveying there are two basic modes of flow: plug/slug flow. which is predominantly based on granular products. and fluidized dense-phase flow. which is more suited to fine powders exhibiting good air retention capabilities. In plug/slug type flow. the stresses between the moving plug of material and the pipe wall dominate the solid-phase frictional losses.

Experimental and theoretical investigations conducted for this work suggest that the flow mechanism involved in this type of conveying is highly transient or pulsatile rather than in steady state.

This study specifically investigated the effect of particle shape in discrete element modelling of a vibratory sieving process. with the focus on comparing results from spherical and non-spherical modelling methods. The particle size distribution of an iron ore material was initially obtained experimentally through vibratory sieving tests. An identical process was replicated in DEM with both spheres and non-spherical particles. and resulting particle size distributions were subsequently compared against the experimental results. A rounded polyhedron shape was utilised to calibrate and generate non-spherical particles based on a 2D particle shape characterisation process.

Challenges of using an IMU within pneumatic conveying were discussed. in particular the importance of sensor fusion. Different sensor fusion algorithms were considered and Madgwick's filter was selected as most appropriate. Two IMUs were simultaneously inserted into the pipeline allowing the particle velocity to be measured as the sensors mimicked the motion of the slug particles. Furthermore. barometers on the IMUs allowed for in-situ pressure to be measured as the particles travelled through the slug.

Particle degradation was induced experimentally by recursively conveying the fillite material within a pneumatic pipeline. The associated particle size reduction was monitored. Three electrostatic sensors were embedded along the pipeline to monitor the flow. The results indicated a decreasing trend in the electrostatic sensor outputs with decreasing particle size. which suggested the attenuation of the flow velocity fluctuation.

MD in July 2012. The purpose of the NZERTF is two-fold. First. it is meant to demonstrate techniques that could be used to achieve net-zero operation in a home that is typical of that which would be built in Maryland. The second. and perhaps more important. purpose of the facility is to serve as a testbed to examine the effect of different equipment. construction methods. and operational approaches towards achieving net-zero operation while maintaining a superior indoor environment. This effort is expected to extend many years.

1290283,An improved method of modeling infiltration in commercial building energy models,2014,Lisa C Ng and Steven J Emmerich and Andrew K Persily,1829,,,,US Department of Commerce. National Institute of Standards and Technology,As building envelope performance and HVAC equipment efficiencies are increasingly improved to reduce building energy use. a greater percentage of the total energy loss of a building can occur through envelope leakage. Although the energy impacts of unintended infiltration on a building’s energy use can be significant. current energy simulation software and design methods are generally not able to accurately account for envelope infiltration and the impacts of improved airtightness. New strategies to incorporate airflow calculations into building energy calculations are proposed. which are more accurate than current approaches in energy simulation software and easier to apply than multizone airflow modeling. The new strategies are based on relationships between infiltration rates calculated using multizone airflow models. building characteristics. including envelope airtightness. weather conditions. and HVAC system operation.,True,_IpcrnIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,18,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lisa_Ng4/publication/276500594_An_improved_method_of_modeling_infiltration_in_commercial_building_energy_models/links/5559ef5c08ae980ca6117204/An-improved-method-of-modeling-infiltration-in-commercial-building-energy-models.pdf,7217450789241793357,/scholar?cites=7217450789241793357,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lisa_Ng4/publication/276500594_An_improved_method_of_modeling_infiltration_in_commercial_building_energy_models/links/5559ef5c08ae980ca6117204/An-improved-method-of-modeling-infiltration-in-commercial-building-energy-models.pdf,0,0,0
1290284,Simulated versus Measured Energy Performance of the NIST Net Zero Energy Residential Test Facility Design,2015,Joshua Kneifel and William V Payne and Tania Ullah and Lisa Ng,,,,,US Department of Commerce. National Institute of Standards and Technology,The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) received funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to construct a Net Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF). The initial goal of the NZERTF is to demonstrate that a net-zero energy residential design can “look and feel” like a typical home in the Gaithersburg area. The demonstration phase of the project was from July 2013 through June 2014. during which it successfully demonstrated that the house performed at “net zero.” or produced as much electricity as it consumed over the entire year.The purpose of this report is twofold. The first is to compare the pre-demonstration phase whole building energy simulation to the measured performance of the NZERTF during the demonstration phase. which will identify where the measured performance deviates from the simulated performance of the house in its design state. These variations may be due to incorrect simulation assumptions (eg. incorrect efficiency parameters) or faulty demonstration phase operation control of the NZERTF itself (eg. equipment failures). The components of the NZERTF for which the simulation and measured performance vary the most can be used as a “lessons learned” guide for other researchers to consider in other low-energy house simulation efforts. The second purpose is to adjust the predemonstration phase simulation specifications to better represent the actual performance of the NZERTF during the demonstration phase. The adjustments will lead to the development of a validated simulation model that can be used for analysis of “what-if” scenarios. such as alternative …,True,_IpcrnIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,16,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_Kneifel/publication/274564898_Simulated_versus_Measured_Energy_Performance_of_the_NIST_Net_Zero_Energy_Residential_Test_Facility_Design/links/5526761c0cf2ee9bad77e911/Simulated-versus-Measured-Energy-Performance-of-the-NIST-Net-Zero-Energy-Residential-Test-Facility-Design.pdf,5770018750468440018,/scholar?cites=5770018750468440018,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_Kneifel/publication/274564898_Simulated_versus_Measured_Energy_Performance_of_the_NIST_Net_Zero_Energy_Residential_Test_Facility_Design/links/5526761c0cf2ee9bad77e911/Simulated-versus-Measured-Energy-Performance-of-the-NIST-Net-Zero-Energy-Residential-Test-Facility-Design.pdf,0,0,0

However. questions exist regarding how and whether these tools consider airflow and indoor contaminant concentrations. which is of increasing importance given current efforts to reduce building energy consumption. The airflow and indoor air quality (IAQ) analyses capabilities of several energy simulation programs are investigated and summarized. This study discusses the key question of whether an energy simulation program simulates airflow rates or considers them to be inputs. The manner in which contaminants are simulated (if at all) is also investigated. Both the physical theory behind the simulations and any rule-of-thumb alternatives are summarized and evaluated.

Easy-to-access data are needed to convince building owners and contractors that enhancing the airtightness of new and existing buildings is the next logical step to achieve a high-performance building envelope. To this end. Oak Ridge National Laboratory. the National Institute of Standards and Technology. the Air Barrier Association of America. and the US-China Clean Energy Research Center for Building Energy Efficiency partnered to develop an online calculator that estimates the potential energy and cost savings in major US.

This tool will have a user-friendly graphical interface that accesses a database of CONTAM and EnergyPlus prerun simulation results and will be available to the public at no cost. Baseline leakage rates are either user specified or selected by the user from a list of supplied leakage rates. Users will then enter the expected airtightness after the installation of an air barrier system. Energy costs are estimated based on the building location and other user inputs.

Gaithersburg, MD: National Institute of Standards and Technology",,,,CONTAM is a multizone indoor air quality and ventilation analysis program developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)(Dols and Polidoro 2015). CONTAM generates a wide range of different simulation outputs in the form of binary and text-based files. CONTAM provides the ability to view a limited set of these results via the CONTAM graphical user interface. but many users require access to a much broader range of results. The CONTAM Results Export Tool (subsequently referred to as “Export Tool”) was created to provide access to all of the results that can be generated by a CONTAM simulation. It does so by reading the binary result files and converting them to tab-delimited text files that can be read using a spreadsheet program. The results that can be exported include contaminant concentrations; zone temperatures; weather conditions; airflows through individual paths. ducts and duct leakages; temporal and spatial averages of zone concentrations; and exposure results. The Export Tool also includes the ability to export infiltration rates for use in simulations performed with the EnergyPlus whole-building energy simulation program. This document describes five features of the Export Tool:(1) general conversion of binary results to text.(2) computing temporal and spatial averages of zone contaminant concentrations.(3) exporting occupant exposure results.(4) exporting whole-building air change rates from a CONTAM simulation for use in EnergyPlus. and (5) exporting zone-specific air change rates from a CONTAM simulation for use in EnergyPlus.

There have been significant developments in automotive and business fields. particularly in diesel engines. Nowadays. the method. which is widely used in reducing emissions of a Diesel engine. is the dilution factor called EGR through which it is possible to lower NOx levels. With the reduction of NOx also the performance of a diesel engine (eg the stable combustion and engine power) should be evaluated. This paper presents a useful methodology for analysing the change of the dynamic of the entire engine system. which is due to small changes in EGR dilution ratio.

The system is intended for refrigeration at 5 C in hot climates. and is composed of: medium temperature collector. single effect water ammonia absorption chiller. cold storage. The peculiarity of the configuration is the high temperature difference between the chilled refrigerant temperature. about–5 C (in consequence of using an ice storage) and the condenser temperature (ambient temperature. which could exceed 35 C). In these conditions. the absorption chiller must be driven by a medium temperature heat source (ie parabolic trough collector). Moreover. the selected chiller is directly air cooled. and has the main advantage of having no water consumption. low maintenance work and no legionella problems..

Among the several existing double-lift configurations. semi-GAX cycles are known as the most promising in terms of efficiency. These cycles incorporate the GAX effect in a pressure staged cycle. by means of a split on the solution leaving the low pressure absorber. Two configurations of the semi-GAX cycle have been proposed in the past. the semi-GAX 1 and the semi-GAX 2. The former achieves the GAX effect between the intermediate and the high pressure levels. the latter between the low and the intermediate.

It aims to be as similar as possible to the procedure adopted for calculating the winter heating energy demand of the UNI-CEN standards. The latter. a procedure based on a steadystate model. including one or more corrective numerical-experimental correlations. that take into account in a simplified way–and thus approximately–the effects of thermal capacities on the phenomena under examination. The critical evaluation of the first results suggested changing the approach. in the model correlations developing process. from a physical parameters based to a building typology based. Nevertheless. following such approach. a good agreement has been achieved between the results of a detailed hourly simulation and the values predicted by the simplified model. Indeed there is evidence that acceptable results can only be obtained by providing a correlation by building archetype. To avoid such massive work in developing building archetype based correlations. it was developed and validated a more complex simplified dynamical model. using an average monthly day. and based on the approach followed by the prEN 13792 [3] standard for the freefloating summer room temperature profile evaluation. The results show that the use of such model did not increase the quality of the results. due to too strong simplifying assumption even if more physically based. especially if compared to the full hourly dynamical simulation (ie model based on physical equation with few simplifying assumptions).,True,_LsqXG0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,13,https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/503226,17249680672790776742,/scholar?cites=17249680672790776742,,,https://re.public.polimi.it/bitstream/11311/503226/1/Simplified%20models%20for%20building%20_.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we evaluate the applicability of MSIMPSA. a simulated-annealing-based algorithm. to solve the optimal control problem. Two cases are studied:  first. a simple case without energy balances and. second. a more realistic case using energy balances and constraints on heat transfer. In addition. an SQP optimizer was applied to perform a local optimization around the best results obtained by MSIMPSA. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results:  (i) MSIMPSA can be applied in an easy and straightforward manner (black-box approach) to such optimal control problems.

The first transforms the original problem into six mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations. The second approach takes one of the MILP formulations and relies on the specific features of an MILP solver. namely using starting incumbents. polishing. and callbacks. The last involves the direct solution of the original problem by solvers that can accomodate the nonlinear combinatorial problem. Particular emphasis is placed on the definition of the MILP reformulations and their comparison with the other approaches. The results indicate that the data of the problem has a strong influence on the performance of the different approaches. and that there are clear-cut approaches that are better for some instances of the data.

The uncertainty in the current is described in terms of a finite ensemble of flow realizations.  The proposed approach is based on a nonlinear stochastic programming methodology that uses a risk-aware objective function. accounting for the full variability of the flow ensemble. and accommodating solutions that may not necessarily coincide with a deterministic  solution corresponding to a specific member of the ensemble.  We formulate stochastic problems that aim to minimize a risk measure of the travel time or energy consumption. using a flexible methodology that enables the user to seamlessly explore various objectives. ranging from risk-neutral to risk-averse.  The former is defined by the expectation operator whereas the latter is based on the  conditional value at risk.  We illustrate the application of the proposed approach using synthetic 2D settings. including an uncertain steady current field. and a stochastic. transient. double-gyre flow.  The applications are used to assess the results of the proposed framework. demonstrate the value of stochastic solutions over individual scenario solutions. and to guide the selection of suitable risk measures.,True,f3Pa2IsAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,1,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/handle/10754/663066,9873710337625625364,/scholar?cites=9873710337625625364,,,https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/bitstream/handle/10754/663066/Preprint_KAUST_AUV_stochastic_optimization.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1290368,SIMOP: uma estratégia integrada de simulação-optimização de processos químicos,2005,Ricardo Manuel Pinto de Lima,,,,,,In this thesis na equation-oriented global optimization methodology is proposed. This methodology involves an approach using an equation-oriented process simulator to solve models with a high number of equality constraints and stochastic-based algorithms to perform the optimization step. With an equation-oriented process simulator approach. the stochastic algorithms overcome the difficulties that may arise in dealing with equality constraints. avoiding the application of penalty-based approaches. This methodology aims to solve optimization problems arising from steady-state process design.The optimizer will determine the values of the decision variables. with the remaining variables calculated in the simulation step. Therefore. two important issues arise in this approach: the choice of the decision variables that will fix a determinate system and the numerical procedure to solve the system of equations. An algorithm for choosing optimum sets of decision variables is proposed. This algorithm is based on the coupling of a combinatorial optimizer and a tearing/partitioning algorithm. The resulting algorithm pretends to explore the impact that different sets of dicision variables may have on the structure of the systems. and consequently to explore this feature to efficiently solve systems of nonlinear equations. The process of choosing decision variables is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. whereby a cost function related with the decomposition of the system is associated with the choice of sets of decision variables.

A material flow analysis technique was employed to determine the amount of sawmill residue that could possibly be available to the ethanol industry per annum. A combination of two key trends—improved efficiency of lumber recovery and increased uptake of sawmill residues for self-generation and for wood pellet production—have contributed to a declining trend of sawmill residue availability. Approximately 2.3 × 106 bone-dry tonnes per year of sawmill residue was estimated to be potentially available to the cellulosic ethanol industry in Canada. yielding 350 million liters per year of cellulosic ethanol using best practices.

1290383,An assessment of Thailand’s biofuel development,2013,S Kumar and P Abdul Salam and Pujan Shrestha and Emmanuel Kofi Ackom,5,Sustainability,4,1577-1597,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The paper provides an assessment of first generation biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) development in Thailand in terms of feedstock used. production trends. planned targets and policies and discusses the biofuel sustainability issues—environmental. socio-economic and food security aspects. The policies. measures and incentives for the development of biofuel include targets. blending mandates and favorable tax schemes to encourage production and consumption of biofuels. Biofuel development improves energy security. rural income and reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. but issues related to land and water use and food security are important considerations to be addressed for its large scale application. Second generation biofuels derived from agricultural residues perform favorably on environmental and social sustainability issues in comparison to first generation biofuel sources. The authors estimate that sustainably-derived agricultural crop residues alone could amount to 10.4× 10 6 bone dry tonnes per year. This has the technical potential of producing 1.14–3.12 billion liters per year of ethanol to possibly displace between 25%–69% of Thailand’s 2011 gasoline consumption as transportation fuel. Alternatively. the same amount of residue could provide 0.8–2.1 billion liters per year of diesel (biomass to Fischer-Tropsch diesel) to potentially offset 6%–15% of national diesel consumption in the transportation sector.

The term ‘sustainable.’however. can mean different things depending upon one’s perspective. Sustainable alternatives to fossil-based liquid transport fuels are often defined as sustainable if they are sourced from renewable feedstocks. such as biomass. which are harvested in a sustainable fashion. Public and political support for biofuels is in part attributable to the perceived sustainability of these fuels; the industry’s’ License to Operate’and continued level of political support (ie through funding and blending targets) hinges upon demonstrating positive environmental performance; it may no longer be sufficient to simply be better than the fossil alternative. As biofuels gain increasing share of the liquid transportation fuel market. the economic. environmental and social impacts at all points in the value chain are being increasingly scrutinized to verify that all externalities are accounted for in assessing the true sustainability of these products.Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) models are often the basis for assessing sustainability of biofuels. as well as providing baseline data by which biofuels may be compared to fossil alternatives.

The use of nanorefrigerants or refrigerant with nanolubricant mixtures is one of the passive techniques in enhanced heat transfer performance and reducing energy consumption. This paper reviews the augmentation of heat transfer. enhancement of coefficients of performance (COP) and energy efficiency of various nanoparticle dispersions in the refrigerants or lubricants based on refrigerant type. From the results available in the literatures. it shows that nanorefrigerants and refrigerant/nanolubricant mixtures enhances the heat transfer coefficient.

Phosphates are predominately removed during wastewater treatment by chemical precipitation which is usually expensive and has a significant environmental footprint. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of waste recycled bricks as adsorbent for phosphate removal during wastewater treatment. The kinetics. isotherms. and thermodynamics of adsorption were investigated to establish the mechanisms of adsorption. The results showed that adsorption capacities increased with an increase in contact time. adsorbent dosage. and initial phosphate concentration. The kinetic study indicated that adsorption was governed by several mechanisms with various processes dominating different stages of the adsorption. The adsorption process was better represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetics and the Langmuir isotherm adequately described the adsorption of phosphates onto brick particles with a maximum adsorption capacity of 5.35 mg/g. The thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption process was exothermic and proceeded spontaneously. demonstrating that waste bricks can be used as a sustainable alternative for the effective removal of phosphates from wastewater.

The reaction followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics for both the dark Fenton-like and UV photo-Fenton-like processes. The reaction kinetics of the UV photo-assisted process improved with the presence of humic acid (HA) in wastewater. due to the formation of Fe(III)-HA complexes which enhanced Fe(II) production by a ligand-to-metal charge transfer. The UV photo-assisted process reduced the amount of ferric required to completely degrade progesterone by 60 % and lowered the activation energy to 42 kJ/mol compared to 104 kJ/mol for the dark Fenton-like process. Complete degradation of progesterone was achieved through a multi-step process involving several intermediate compounds.,True,bQQvgqUAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13762-016-1103-3,1362088421194938720,/scholar?cites=1362088421194938720,,,,0,0,0

Ifelebuegu and E. E. Lale and F. U. Mbanaso and S. C. Theophilus,6,Processes,9,1-11,MDPI,The oil industry is plagued with regular incidences of spills into the environment. causing environmental damage to flora and fauna. especially in marine environments where spills easily travel long distances from their sources. This study was carried out to investigate a simple two-step process for the conversion of waste cigarette filters into a superhydrophobic and oleophilic sorbent for application in oil/water separation and spill clean-up. Ultrasonically cleaned filters were surface modified by chemical vapour deposition using methyltrichlorosilane. The results show that the functionalised waste filters achieved superhydrophobic properties with a water contact angle of 154±3.5. adsorbing 16 to 26 times their weights in various oils. which is a better oil sorption performance than those of commercially available non-woven polypropylene adsorbents. Also. the sorption capacity did not significantly deteriorate after 20 cycles of reuse. with up to 75% sorption capacity retained. The surface modified filters demonstrated excellent water repellency. oil sorption. and recyclability showing their potential application for full scale oil spill clean-up.

1290444,The Impact of Aluminium Salt Dosing for Chemical Phosphorus Removal on the Settleability of Activated Sludge,2018,P. Ojo and A. O. Ifelebuegu,5,Environments,8,,MDPI,The use of metal salts like aluminium in the precipitation of phosphorus in activated sludge plants has increased considerably in recent years due to the need to achieve tighter discharge consents for phosphorus in treated wastewater effluent. The impact of aluminium salt (Al 3+) dosing on the settleability of activated sludge as a function of zone settling velocity (ZSV) and stirred specific volume index (SSVI) were investigated in batch settleability tests over a three-year period. The results showed that ZSV increased with increasing dose of aluminium salt as SSVI decreased. This trend was observed for dosing concentrations of less than 100 mg/L. At a dose concentration> 100 mg/L. the trend was reversed as ZSV decreased and SSVI increased. At dose concentrations of< 100 mg/L. Al 3+ helped in the bioaggregation of dispersed activated sludge flocs. thereby improving settleability. The surface morphology from the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images indicated that the initial potential of interfloc bridging. open floc formation. and spindly bulking noticed in the undosed activated sludge flocs were remarkably reduced as the flocs became more compacted after Al 3+ treatment. At> 100 mg/L of Al 3+. the sludge settleability started to disintegrate due mainly to surface charge reversal linked to the formation of aluminium hydroxides and the resultant disintegration of the activated sludge floc structure.

1290445,Brexit and Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union: Implications for UK Energy Policy and Security,2017,Augustine O Ifelebuegu and Kenneth E Aidelojie and Elijah Acquah-Andoh,10,Energies,12,2143,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper articulates the potential implications of Brexit on energy policy and security in the United Kingdom (UK). Given the uncertainties associated with the decision to leave the European Union (EU). the need to consider its potential effects on the UK’s energy sector becomes even more pertinent. Through the lens of a few widely reviewed trade regimes in the light of Brexit. it can be observed that while UK energy policies are unlikely to change drastically. Brexit nevertheless threatens the UK’s capacity to safeguard its energy supply. The uncertainties following Brexit could arguably starve the UK’s upstream petroleum. electricity. and renewable energy sectors of their required investments. Both short and long-term impacts could result in UK residents paying more per unit of energy consumed in a “hard Brexit” scenario. where the UK exits the Internal Energy Market (IEM) and must trade with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules. While a hard Brexit could aid the growth of the nascent shale gas industry. a negotiated withdrawal that includes some form of access to the IEM (a “soft Brexit”) would be more beneficial for the future of energy security in the UK.

1290446,Brexit and UK energy security: Perspectives from unconventional gas investment and the effects of shale gas on UK energy prices,2019,Elijah Acquah-Andoh and Augustine O Ifelebuegu and Stephen C Theophilus,12,Energies,4,600,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Many aspects of the present and future effects on the UK economy. industry. and households. of Brexit have been researched. One thing which appears certain about Brexit is the shadow of uncertainty it casts on the future of business in the UK and its telling effects on the UK economy. It is believed that Brexit has negatively affected the level of investments in the UK. including investments in energy and crucially the upstream oil and gas. with the UK North Sea being starved of investments since 2014. leading already to increased energy bills. The UK is a net importer of natural gas—a major source of its energy. with some dependence on supplies from interconnectors from Europe. At the same time. UK energy companies participate in the common energy market which enables them to undertake arbitrage trading under the common market rules. However. both of these benefits could be lost under a Brexit scenario where the UK and EU come to a no-deal or hard border arrangement. Meanwhile. domestic production of energy in the UK has declined for nearly two decades now and import bills for natural gas are growing—they were£ 14.2 billion in 2017;£ 11.7 billion in 2016 and£ 13.4 billion in 2015—with Government projections indicating an upward trajectory for natural gas imports. It is however believed that the UK has great potential to exploit shale gas to her advantage in order to reduce her reliance on foreign energy which is:(1) less predictable in terms of supply and price affordability and (2) dependent on exchange rates—a primary means through which energy prices increased in 2016/17 post-Brexit referendum vote.

The PMPS particles were synthesised by condensing 3. 4-dihydroxycyclobut-3-ene-1. 2-dione (squaric acid) with 1-methylpyrrole in butanol. The results demonstrated that PMPS particles are effective in the removal of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in water with adsorption being more favourable at an acidic pH. and a superior sorption capacity being achieved at pH 4. The results also showed that the removal of EDCs by the PMPS particles was a complex process involving multiple rate-limiting steps and physicochemical interactions between the EDCs and the particles. Gibbs free energy of− 8.32 kJ/mole and− 6.6 kJ/mol. and enthalpies of 68 kJ/mol and 43 kJ/mol. were achieved for the adsorption E2 and EE2 respectively The removal efficiencies of the EDCs by PMPS particles were comparable to those of activated carbon. and hence can be applied as an alternative adsorbent in water treatment applications.

While human error has been analysed in several industries and has been at the centre of many debates and commentaries. a detailed. systematic and comprehensive analysis of human error in the O&G industry has not yet been conducted. Hence. this report aims to use the Technique for Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors (TRACEr) to analyse historical accidents in the O&G industry. The study has reviewed 163 major and/or fatal O&G industry accidents that occurred between 2000 and 2014. The results obtained have shown that the predominant context for errors was internal communication. mostly influenced by factors of perception. Major accident events were crane accidents and falling objects. relating to the most dominant accident type:‘Struck by’. The main actors in these events were drillers and operators. Generally. TRACEr proved very useful in identifying major task errors. However. the taxonomy was less useful in identifying both equipment errors and errors due to failures in safety critical control barriers and recovery measures. Therefore. a modified version of the tool named Technique for the Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors for the Oil and Gas Industry (TRACEr-OGI) was proposed and used. This modified analytical tool was consequently found to be more effective for accident analysis in the O&G industry.

A detail wastewater characterisation study by the past researchers indicates that grey water is polluted. but the quality is not similar to the domestic wastewater and therefore the traditional design criteria cannot be used for greywater reclamation. The study by the past researchers show grey water with detergent inhibit grey water reclamation process such as aerobic biological process and the appearance of reclaimed water with cloudiness. colour and excessive bubble formation reduce willingness especially for in-house uses than outdoor uses. Partially or untreated soapy grey water are useful for outdoor use and has useful nutrients. but some study shows excess detergent and other cleaning materials may cause harmful effects to the growth of plants and degrades soil structure. It may cause risk to the environment and human who makes close contact with grey water or inhale the spray. Currently most of the grey water reclamation systems are based on traditional wastewater and/or water treatment design and some have no proper design at all. In addition. due to the public perception (“yuck effect”). it is not acceptable for using reclaimed grey water for direct potable use. Also. globally there are standards for potable water quality and regulated widely. whereas only a few countries have non-potable water quality or grey water reuse standards and regulated properly.

The number of people injured. however. is seldom evaluated because it implies significant additional effort and often the information required to perform this evaluation is not available. However. the number of injured people can be very important for emergency planning. especially in relatively large accidents.

By doing so. we also succeeded to rationalise the dependence of pore spacing on anodising conditions. Our experimental approach consists of measuring in-situ the internal stress in anodic oxide films grown galvanostatically on aluminium in phosphoric acid. and to correlate these data with the measured pore spacing of the obtained porous films. Our results indicate that the possibility of a strain energy-induced surface instability is unlikely. as for this case the constitutive dependence of pore spacing on internal stress was not verified. Instead. the measured pore spacing. electric field and barrier oxide thickness obtained on our anodic alumina films indicate that electrostatic energy is the main driving force for pore initiation. as well as the factor …,True,B3KNxp8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,73,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388248110002596,8049146448227482200,/scholar?cites=8049146448227482200,,,,0,0,0

The technique relies on the coupling of an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometer to a specially designed electrochemical flow cell. This has allowed to correlate. for the first time. the kinetics of Al dissolution to well-established morphological changes related to porous anodic oxide formation and growth. A deconvolution algorithm was first developed in order to decompose the experimental ICP/OES signal into elementary distributions. each one characteristic for a specific kinetic regime.

One robust method particularly suitable for in situ curvature monitoring is the multiple beam optical sensor. which consists in measuring the change in relative spacings between parallel laser beams reflecting off the curved substrate. Although the technique is already well established for curvature monitoring in low pressure. gaseous environments. its use in liquid media has not yet received similar attention. Moreover. in the majority of the published work so far. spot spacings have been assumed to depend linearly on curvature. In this paper. it is first shown that this assumption may induce significant errors. particularly at large curvature. A more accurate set of equations is proposed.

This has been done by unraveling possible correlations between a key electrochemical characteristic of the instability event and the internal stress evolution. the latter being measured in situ during the very same anodising experiment. As such. we have been able to make more conclusive statements as compared to the merely speculative arguments in the literature whether these instabilities have a mechanical origin or not.

Oxide growth kinetics on Fe(100). (110). and (111) surface orientations has been investigated at various temperatures and/or an external electric field. The oxide growth kinetics decreases in the order of (110). (111). and (100) surfaces at 300 K over 1 ns timescale while higher temperature increases the oxidation rate. The oxidation rate shows a transition after an initial high rate. implying that the oxide formation mechanism evolves. with iron cation re-ordering. In early stages of surface oxide growth. oxygen transport through iron interstitial sites is dominant. yielding non-stoichiometric wüstite characteristics.

In this work. we anodized sputtered zirconium thin films galvanostatically at room temperature in sulphuric acid until breakdown was observed. and simultaneously measured the internal stress evolution in the oxide in situ. using a high-resolution curvature setup. It was found that the higher the magnitude of the observed internal compressive stress in the oxide. the smaller the oxide thickness at which breakdown occurred. The moment of breakdown was identified from a slope change in the cell voltage evolution. indicative for a decrease in anodising efficiency. The latter presumably occurs as a result of oxygen evolution. initiated by the relative increase of the cubic or tetragonal zirconia phase content relative to the monoclinic …,True,B3KNxp8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,24,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013468610004445,449730740731421315,/scholar?cites=449730740731421315,,,,0,0,0

Testing the mechanical properties of Al2O3 films thinner than 200 nm is challenging. and the link between the mechanical behavior and the microstructure of such films is largely unknown.

Furthermore. no definitive agreement could be obtained with theory. In this paper. in situ techniques are combined to elucidate electrostriction in anodic niobium oxide. The dependence of strain. internal stress. and dielectric constant on the electric field is measured by. respectively. spectroscopic ellipsometry. curvature. and impedance measurements. The through-thickness strain is tensile and proportional to the square of the electric field. The in-plane internal stress is compressive and proportional to the square of the electric field at low field values. The internal stress is predicted relatively well by the Maxwell stress because of the weak dependence of the dielectric constant on the volume change of the oxide.

Accurately quantifying the internal stress as a function of the electric field is thus of technological importance. In this work. electrostrictive stresses are monitored during cyclic polarization of silica thin films on silicon and during the growth of anodic silica. These are obtained by combining curvature and ellipsometry measurements in situ. In silica films grown by thermal oxidation of silicon. the electric field can generate either tensile or compressive stresses depending on its magnitude and on the silica polarization history. The electromechanical coupling in thermal silica is assumed to be controlled by a reversible change of the dipole organization. For anodic silica films. the stress generated by the electric field is tensile and varies linearly with the square of the electric field above 0.26 V2 …,True,B3KNxp8AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,8,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10008-013-2036-0.pdf,13950245235890046771,/scholar?cites=13950245235890046771,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Quentin_Van_Overmeere/publication/257468246_In_situ_monitoring_of_electrostriction_in_anodic_and_thermal_silicon_dioxide_thin_films/links/004635267ee508bbf4000000/In-situ-monitoring-of-electrostriction-in-anodic-and-thermal-silicon-dioxide-thin-films.pdf,0,0,0

The flame stability maps for several strain rates are presented and main concerns are focused on the downstream interactions on the lean and rich extinction boundaries. The fuel composition of 50% H2 and 50% CO with effective Lewis numbers larger than unity for both lean and rich extinction boundaries is chosen for grasping the important role of hydrogen with the deficient reactant Lewis numbers much smaller than unity. The results show that the lean extinction boundaries have the slanted shape. thereby leading to strong interactions; meanwhile the rich extinction boundaries at appropriately low strain rates are of square. indicating weak interactions.
