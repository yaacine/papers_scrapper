1204061,Brazos River bar [Texas]; a study in the significance of grain size parameters,1957,Robert Louis Folk and William C Ward,27,Journal of Sedimentary Research,1,3-26,SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology,A bar on the Brazos River near Calvert. Texas. has been analyzed in order to determine the geologic meaning of certain grain size parameters and to study the behavior of the size fractions with transport. The bar consists of a strongly bimodal mixture of pebble gravel and medium to fine sand; there is a lack of material in the range of 0.5 to 2 mm. because the source does not supply particles of this size. The size distributions of the two modes. which were established in the parent deposits. are nearly invariant over the bar because the present environment of deposition only affects the relative proportions of the two modes. not the grain size properties of the modes themselves. Two proportions are most common; the sediment either contains no gravel or else contains about 60% gravel. Three sediment types with characteristic bedding features occur on the bar in constant stratigraphic order. with the coarsest at …,True,KEdFpy8AAAAJ:PYBJJbyH-FwC,9087,https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jsedres/article-lookup/27/1/3,18318634539775337758,/scholar?cites=18318634539775337758,,http://www.aqqua.uqam.ca/articles/Folk_Ward_27(1)-3.pdf,0,0,0
1204062,The generation of granitic magmas by intrusion of basalt into continental crust,1988,HERBERT E HUPPERT and R STEPHEN J SPARKS,29,Journal of Petrology,3,599-624,Oxford University Press,When basalt magmas are emplaced into continental crust. melting and generation of silicic magma can be expected. The fluid dynamical and heat transfer processes at the roof of a basaltic sill in which the wall rock melts are investigated theoretically and also experimentally using waxes and aqueous solutions. At the roof. the low density melt forms a stable melt layer with negligible mixing with the underlying hot liquid. A quantitative theory for the roof melting case has been developed. When applied to basalt sills in hot crust. the theory predicts that basalt sills of thicknesses from 10 to 1500 m require only 1 to 270 y to solidify and would form voluminous overlying layers of convecting silicic magma. For example. for a 500 m sill with a crustal melting temperature of 850 °C. the thickness of the silicic magma layer generated ranges from 300 to 1000 m for country rock temperatures from 500 to 850°C.

1204063,The propagation of two-dimensional and axisymmetric viscous gravity currents over a rigid horizontal surface,1982,Herbert E Huppert,121,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,43-58,Cambridge University Press,The viscous gravity current that results when fluid flows along a rigid horizontal surface below fluid of lesser density is analysed using a lubrication-theory approximation. It is shown that the effect on the gravity current of the motion in the upper fluid can be expressed as a condition of zero shear on the unknown upper surface of the gravity current. With the supposition that the volume of heavy fluid increases with time like F. where a is a constant. a similarity solution to the governing nonlinear partial differential equations is obtained. which describes the shape and rate of propagation of the current. The viscous theory is shown to be valid for t & t. when a-c a. and for t-4 t. when a> a.. where t. is the transition time at which the inertial and viscous forces are equal. with a.= $ for a two-dimensional current and a.= 3 for an axisymmetric current. The solutions confirm the functional forms for the spreading relationships determined for a= 1 in the preceding paper by Didden & Maxworthy (1982). as well as evaluating the multiplicative factors appearing in the relationships. The relationships compare very well with experimental measurements of the axisymmetric spreading of silicone oils into air for a= 0 and 1. There is also very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the measurements of the axisymmetric spreading of salt water into fresh water reported by Didden & Maxworthy and by Britter (1979). The predicted multiplicative constant is within 10 Yo of that measured by Didden & Maxworthy for the spreading of salt water into fresh water in a channel.,True,KEdFpy8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,880,http://www.itg.cam.ac.uk/people/heh/Paper47.pdf,13332467275227791051,/scholar?cites=13332467275227791051,,http://www.itg.cam.ac.uk/people/heh/Paper47.pdf,0,0,0
1204064,The slumping of gravity currents,1980,Herbert E Huppert and John E Simpson,99,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,4,785-799,Cambridge University Press,Experimental results for the release of a fixed volume of one homogeneous fluid into another of slightly different density are presented. From these results and those obtained by previous experiments. it is argued that the resulting gravity current can pass through three states. There is first a slumping phase. during which the current is retarded by the counterflow in the fluidinto which it is issuing. The current remains in this slumping phase until the depth ratio of current to intruded fluid is reduced to less than about 0.075. This may be followed by a (previously investigated) purely inertial phase. wherein the buoyancy force of the intruding fluid is balanced by the inertial force. Motion in the surrounding fluid plays a negligible role in this phase. There then follows a viscous phase. wherein the buoyancy force is balanced by viscous forces. It is argued and confirmed by experiment that the inertial phase is absent if viscous effects become important before the slumping phase has been completed. R’elationships between spreading distance and time for each phase are obtained for all three phases for both two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. Some consequences of the retardation of the gravity current during the slumping phase are discussed.,True,KEdFpy8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,689,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.6670&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16296239255497654276,/scholar?cites=16296239255497654276,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.6670&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This form is observed 1. 2 to be stable to any small disturbances which are initiated on the front due. for example. to irregularities in the horizontal surface or to chance perturbations. Alternatively. if some fluid is released onto a sloping surface—for example. some liquid detergent on a slanted plate—a quite different plan form occurs. One. two or more extended regions of fluid develop downslope. as shown in Fig. 1a. b. A situation intermediate between these two is now discussed. Consider a broad band of viscous fluid. uniform in depth across a slope. released so as to flow down a constant slope.

1204067,The fluid dynamics of a basaltic magma chamber replenished by influx of hot. dense ultrabasic magma,1981,Herbert E Huppert and R Stephen J Sparks,75,Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology,3,279-289,Springer-Verlag,This paper describes a fluid dynamical investigation of the influx of hot. dense ultrabasic magma into a reservoir containing lighter. fractionated basaltic magma. This situation is compared with that which develops when hot salty water is introduced under cold fresh water. Theoretical and empirical models for salt/water systems are adapted to develop a model for magmatic systems. A feature of the model is that the ultrabasic melt does not immediately mix with the basalt. but spreads out over the floor of the chamber. forming an independent layer. A non-turbulent interface forms between this layer and the overlying magma layer across which heat and mass are transferred by the process of molecular diffusion. Both layers convect vigorously as heat is transferred to the upper layer at a rate which greatly exceeds the heat lost to the surrounding country rock.

Calculations are presented for cooling. crystallization and contamination during the turbulent ascent of a komatiite. a picritic basalt and a tholeiitic basalt. Primitive magmas. like komatiite and picritic basalt. are predicted to erupt with moderate to large amounts of olivine phenocrysts except at very high flow rates. Little crystallization takes place in a basalt on ascent. and any phenocrysts are likely to be inherited from the magma chamber. The erosion rate of the conduit walls and amount of contamination are greatest in primitive magmas and least for cool. fractionated magmas. Contamination is also affected by flow rate.

1204069,Particle-driven gravity currents,1993,Roger T Bonnecaze and Herbert E Huppert and John R Lister,250,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,339-369,Cambridge University Press,Gravity currents created by the release of a fixed volume of a suspension into a lighter ambient fluid are studied theoretically and experimentally. The greater density of the current and the buoyancy force driving its motion arise primarily from dense particles suspended in the interstitial fluid of the current. The dynamics of the current are assumed to be dominated by a balance between inertial and buoyancy forces; viscous forces are assumed negligible. The currents considered are two-dimensional and flow over a rigid horizontal surface. The flow is modelled by either the single-or the twolayer shallow-water equations. the two-layer equations being necessary to include the effects of the overlying fluid. which are important when the depth of the current is comparable to the depth of the overlying fluid. Because the local density of the gravity current depends on the concentration of particles. the buoyancy contribution to the momentum balance depends on the variation of the particle concentration. A transport equation for the particle concentration is derived by assuming that the particles are vertically well-mixed by the turbulence in the current. are advected by the mean flow and settle out through the viscous sublayer at the bottom of the current. The boundary condition at the moving front of the current relates the velocity and the pressure head at that point. The resulting equations are solved numerically. which reveals that two types of shock can occur in the current. In the late stages of all particle-driven gravity currents. an internal bore develops that separates a particle-free jet-like flow in the rear from a dense gravity-current flow near the front.

Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences",1514,511-534,The Royal Society,Recent developments in petrology indicate that fluid dynamic effects are of fundamental importance in controlling magma genesis. The forms of convection in magma chambers arise from compositional variations caused by processes such as fractional crystallization. partial melting and contamination. as well as from thermal effects. These processes. together with phase changes such as volatile exsolution. generally cause much larger density changes in magmas than the thermal effects arising from associated temperature changes. Magmas exhibit a wide range of convective phenomena not encountered in one-component fluids that are due to these compositional changes and to the differences between the diffusivities of chemical components and heat. When crystallization occurs in such multi-component systems. fluid immediately adjacent to the growing crystals is generally either depleted or enriched in heavy …,True,KEdFpy8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,366,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.1984.0006,14320169519796576117,/scholar?cites=14320169519796576117,,,0,0,0

The flow of an inviscid. stratified fluid is initiated from relative rest in a uniformly rotating system containing an isolated topographic feature. The evolution of the flow redistributes vorticity and temperature in such a way that relatively cold water with anticyclonic vorticity exists over the topographic feature. while water shed from above the topographic feature sinks. thereby inducing a warm anomaly with cyclonic vorticity. For sufficiently strong oncoming flows. the shed fluid continually drifts downstream in the form of a relatively warm eddy.

1204072,Axisymmetric collapses of granular columns,2004,Gert Lube and Herbert E Huppert and R Stephen J Sparks and Mark A Hallworth,508,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,175,Cambridge University Press,Experimental observations of the collapse of initially vertical columns of small grains are presented. The experiments were performed mainly with dry grains of salt or sand. with some additional experiments using couscous. sugar or rice. Some of the experimental flows were analysed using high-speed video. There are three different flow regimes. dependent on the value of the aspect ratio a= hi/ri. where hi and ri are the initial height and radius of the granular column respectively. The differing forms of flow behaviour are described for each regime. In all cases a central. conically sided region of angle approximately 59◦. corresponding to an aspect ratio of 1.7. remains undisturbed throughout the motion. The main experimental results for the final extent of the deposit and the time for emplacement are systematically collapsed in a quantitative way independent of any friction coefficients. Along with the kinematic data for the rate of spread of the front of the collapsing column. this is interpreted as indicating that frictional effects between individual grains in the bulk of the moving flow only play a role in the last instant of the flow. as it comes to an abrupt halt. For a< 1. 7. the measured final runout radius. r∞. is related to the initial radius by r∞= ri (1+ 1. 24a); while for 1. 7< a the corresponding relationship is r∞= ri (1+ 1. 6a1/2). The time. t∞. taken for the grains to reach r∞ is given by t∞= 3 (hi/g) 1/2= 3 (ri/g) 1/2a1/2. where g is the gravitational acceleration.

Dissolution of CO2 into the brine. resulting in stable stratification. increases storage security. The dissolution rate is determined by convection in the brine driven by the increase of brine density with CO2 saturation.

In a system containing two or more properties that have different molecular diffusivities and opposing effects on the vertical density gradient. a wide range of novel and complex convective phenomena can occur.

A physical basis for the prediction of the extent of runout of such transport events has remained elusive. We consider the simplest case in which a mass M of debris and loose rock. having fallen from a height H. is subjected to a constant. overall resisting shear stress τ during runout. A prediction for such behavior is that the area overrun by an avalanche is proportional to (gMH/τ)2/3. where the coefficient of proportionality is near unity and a function of the geometry of the “footprint” of the avalanche deposit. This scaling results in a good collapse of the data for a wide range of terrestrial and extraterrestrial phenomena and implies a value of τ in the range 10–100 kPa.

1204081,Komatiites I: Eruption and flow,1985,Herbert E Huppert and R Stephen J Sparks,26,Journal of Petrology,3,694-725,Oxford University Press,Because of their high eruption temperatures and ultrabasic composition. komatiite lavas had low viscosities. which typically ranged from 0-1 to 10 Pa s. A major consequence of this low viscosity is that most lavas erupted as turbulent flows. An analysis of their ascent through the lithosphere suggests ascent velocities in the range of 1 to over 10ms−1 and Reynolds numbers much greater than the critical value of 2000. The lavas would have remained turbulent for most or all of their subsequent flow and emplacement. Typical horizontal flow rates are estimated to range from 0·5 to 100 m2 s−1 per unit width of flow. Such turbulent lava flows would have lost their heat by convection to the surroundings. at rates which are orders of magnitude greater than the rates for laminar flows. which cool by conduction. A quantitative analysis of the cooling of komatiites indicates cooling rates from over 1000 °C hr−1 to a few °C hr …,True,KEdFpy8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,252,https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article-abstract/26/3/694/1535788,13146551590241920965,/scholar?cites=13146551590241920965,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1005.2003&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Here supercritical CO2 has been injected at a rate of ∼ 1 MT/yr since 1996 and imaged by time-lapse seismic data in 1999. 2001 and 2002. The CO2 rises as a narrow plume and is partially trapped by a number of thin mudstones before reaching the caprock to the reservoir. The radii of the individual layers of trapped CO2 increase as the square root of time since initiation as predicted by the modelling for constant input flux. However apparent negative initiation times for horizons low in the reservoir suggests that net input fluxes for these layers have decreased with time. most probably as the spreading layers have increased their …,True,KEdFpy8AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,249,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X06008892,15375967416909038832,/scholar?cites=15375967416909038832,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.556.6852&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1204085,Nonlinear double-diffusive convection,1976,Herbert E Huppert and Daniel R Moore,78,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,4,821-854,Cambridge University Press,The two-dimensional motion of a fluid confined between two long horizontal planes. heated and salted from below. is examined. By a combination of perturbation analysis and direct numerical solution of the governing equations. the possible forms of large-amplitude motion are traced out as a function of the four non-dimensional parameters which specify the problem: the thermal Rayleigh number RT. the saline Rayleigh number R.. the Prandtl number u and the ratio of the diffusivities r. A branch of time-dependent asymptotic solutions is found which bifurcates from the linear oscillatory instability point. In general. for fixed u. r and R.. as RT increases three further abrupt transitions in the form of motion are found to take place independent of the initial conditions. At the first transition. a rather simple oscillatory motion changes into a more complicated one with different structure. at the second. the motion becomes aperigdic and. at the third. the only asymptotic solutions are time independent. Disordered motions are thus suppressed by increasing R.. The time-independent solutions exist on a branch which. it is conjectured. bifurcates from the timeindependent linear instability point. They can occur for values of R. less than that at which the third transition point occurs. Hence for some parameter ranges two different solutions exist and a hysteresis effect occurs if solutions obtained by increasing RT and then decreasing RT are followed. The minimum value of RT for which time-independent motion can occur is calculated for fourteen different values of u. r and Rs. This minimum value is generally much less than the critical value of time-independent linear …,True,KEdFpy8AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,229,https://www.wits.ac.za/media/wits-university/conferences/misgsa/documents/huppertandmoore.pdf,7637663689770449865,/scholar?cites=7637663689770449865,,https://www.wits.ac.za/media/wits-university/conferences/misgsa/documents/huppertandmoore.pdf,0,0,0

Turbulent transfer of heat between the mafic magma and the overlying magma leads to crystallization and exsolution of volatiles in the lower layer.

We argue that the potential of data to support sharing of personal experiences is an underexplored space in PI and worthy of further research.,True,4E3C0WsAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,10,http://www.dbpharrison.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CHI2015-PIWorkshopCameraReady.pdf,217458489797952755,/scholar?cites=217458489797952755,,http://www.dbpharrison.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CHI2015-PIWorkshopCameraReady.pdf,0,0,0

Beyond these everyday devices. more specialized tools for continuously archiving personal experience. or ‘life-logging’. are being developed [1] bringing Vannevar Bush’s dream of a Memex device [2] closer to reality. Whilst such records. as Bush envisaged. can support our memory of experiences [e.g. 1. 3]. it is also suggested that they may help us to see our experiences from a different perspective and reflect on them [4. 5].

There are many aspects of these new physical interfaces that. in addition to other benefits over WIMP interfaces. I argue will provide more pleasurable interactive user experiences. Below are just a few.Physical interfaces can offer a direct relationship between information and control. and even allow direct control of virtual objects through physical objects. Laurel discusses how traditionally interaction technology interfaces are considered as intermediaries between the person and what they want to achieve [7]. In contrast. in order to promote engagement in interaction she argues the system should provide the user with interactive first-person-ness. allowing them to act more directly. A physical interface could achieve this. Having good control is rated by people as one of the important aspects of a pleasurable product [3].

However increased use of ICT for work during non-work time has also been linked negatively to wellbeing including lower work and life satisfaction and increased stress. Previous work has suggested that creating boundaries around the use of ICTs at home to separate work from non-work could reduce some of these negative effects. In this paper we find that people use multiple devices (phones. tablets etc.) as a way of creating boundaries. that the extent to which they do this depends on a number of worklife-indicators but that this does not relate directly to wellbeing.

1204111,Exploring SenseCam to inform the design of image capture and replay devices for supporting reflection,2005,Rowanne Fleck,576,Cognitive Science Research Paper-University of Sussex CSRP,,22,UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX,Research Ideas The SenseCam is a small wearable device that combines a digital camera with a number of sensors which are used to trigger pictures at ‘good’times (presently when other people are around or when there are changes in the environment such as in light levels or sound levels). The SenseCam was envisaged as a device that might add to a lifetime store of data. providing a kind of visual diary of your life and act as a memory aid. However the question of what all these images can really be used for and other issues such as privacy remain largely unanswered. I am investigating the possibility that it might support reflection. Definitions of reflection are wide and varied but there are a number of situations in which it is thought beneficial. for example when learning from experience and developing professional practice. Dewey. one of the earliest people to consider the nature of reflection. describes reflective thought as “active. persistent. and careful consideration of any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it and the further conclusions to which it tends”(1933. p118). I am taking reflection to be something very similar to this general definition. to mean taking time to think more deeply about things that have been come across or occurred and considering how they relate to what is already known. The literature advocates numerous techniques for supporting reflection (eg Moon. 1999) and various uses of technology (eg Seale 1998). One way in which technology can support reflection is by recording. This can work in two ways; firstly technology can support the collection and recording of data to draw …,True,4E3C0WsAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/47178987/csrp576.pdf#page=26,1968240888437280187,/scholar?cites=1968240888437280187,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47178987/csrp576.pdf#page=26,0,0,0

We found that these workshops helped them to recontextualise and to better understand their data. identify new strategies for changing their behaviour and motivated people to commit to changes in the future.

This has led to the increased use of questionnaires. in-depth interviews and focus groups in commercial usability and academic research contexts. Questionnaires are usually paper based or delivered online and consist of a set of questions which all participants are asked to complete. Once the questionnaire has been created. it can be delivered to a large number of participants with little effort. However. a large number of participants also means a large amount of data needing to be coded and analysed. Interviews. on the other hand. are usually conducted on a one-to-one basis. They require a large amount of the investigator’s time during the interviews and also for transcribing and coding the data. Focus groups usually consist of one investigator and a number of participants in any one session. Although the views of any one participant cannot be probed to same degree as in an interview. the discussions that are facilitated within the groups often result in useful data in a shorter space of time than that required by one-to-one interviews.   All too often. however. researchers eager to identify usability problems quickly throw together a questionnaire. interview or focus group that. when analysed.  produces very little of interest.

Immersion. the sense of being “in the game.” is one of the key components of the gaming experience but existing literature suggests that social play provides more fun but less immersion. There is however little empirical support for this. This paper therefore addresses the question: how does playing digital games in a social situation alter the sense of immersion felt by the individuals playing? This paper presents three experiments that test the relationship between social setting and immersion. The three experiments aim to manipulate the social setting in which players play. be it against a computer. against a person online or against a co-located person.

This form of bodily expression of affects presents two facets of interest to our community:(a) It is a powerful modality of communication. As evidence. we summarize some of our previous studies showing how systems can be trained to accurately recognize emotions. even across different cultural backgrounds;(b) Body postures have been shown to have a powerful regulatory role on emotions. This opens the door to the development of systems that. by involving the body of its users. can induce specific affective states and therefore improve user engagement. To support our discussion. we briefly review a very preliminary study showing how incorporating full-body movements in the control of a game results in users reporting a higher sense of engagement.

The ensemble mean strength is biased slightly too weak. with the largest biases over the Pacific sector (−1.4 ± 1.2 m/s. −19%). An analysis of atmosphere‐only (AMIP) experiments indicates that 28% of the zonal mean position bias comes from coupling of the ocean/ice models to the atmosphere.

The deep winter convection regions are key to the ventilation of the ocean interior. and changes in their properties have been related to climate change in numerous studies. Their simulation in climate models is consistently too shallow. too light and shifted equatorward compared to observations. The shallow bias is mostly associated with an excess annual‐mean freshwater input at the sea surface that over‐stratifies the surface layer and prevents deep convection from developing in winter.

The corresponding effective diffusivity depends on the geometry of the tracer field. which is determined by the underlying flow. Recent studies have used effective diffusivity. calculated from a suitable tracer. as a qualitative indicator of the transport and mixing properties of a given flow. Here we show that the effective diffusivity may further be used as a quantitative diagnostic of transport and mixing.

The large intermodel range is associated with significant differences in the ACC density structure. The ACC position is accurately represented at most longitudes. with a small (1.27°) standard deviation in mean latitude. The westerly wind jet driving the ACC is biased too strong and too far north on average. Unlike CMIP3 there is no correlation between modeled ACC latitude and the position of the westerly wind jet.

This broad ring of vortex air remains isolated from the core between late winter and midspring. Satellite measurements of stratospheric H2O confirm that the isolation lasts until at least mid‐October. A three‐dimensional chemical transport model simulation of the Antarctic ozone hole quantifies the ozone loss within this ring and demonstrates its isolation.

Comparison of three different diffusivity calculations enables the effects of locally enhanced tracer diffusion to be distinguished from the streamwise average. It also enables the distinction to be made between locally generated complexity in the tracer structure and that advected into a particular domain. The technique is applied to the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The results highlight the important role that the mean flow plays in determining eddy diffusivity.

In both cases the variation of the transport and mixing behavior with a parameter ϵ governing the strength of the time dependence is considered. It is shown that dynamical consistency has the effect of (i) postponing the breaking of a central transport barrier as ϵ increases and (ii) removing the property of the kinematic flow that. for a large range of ϵ. a weakly permeable central barrier persists.

The near-surface Southern Ocean geostrophic flow. obtained from altimetric observations. is chosen for particular examination since it exhibits strong eddy activity. Careful analysis indicates that the effective diffusivity calculation is not strongly sensitive to the resolution of the velocity field or to the tracer initial conditions (after a spinup time of 3 months). and that a numerical diffusivity of 50 m2 s− 1 is appropriate to resolve the Batchelor scale at a computational resolution of.

In both systems. the flow organizes itself into coherent tilted nonzonal jets that are aligned perpendicular to the barotropic potential vorticity (PV) gradient. In the two-layer system. the upper layer. the lower layer. and the barotropic PV gradients all have different orientations and therefore the jets cross the layer-wise PV gradients.

Summary findings of a survey and focus groups conducted in the UK in March 2011,2012,Emily Shuckburgh and Rosie Robison and Nick Pidgeon,,,,,Living With Environmental Change,This report examines public attitudes to climate science and its representation in the news media. It details the results of a survey of the UK population conducted in March 2011. which was complemented by a series of focus groups conducted in London. Sutton Coldfield and Newcastle-upon-Tyne at the same time. and presents the findings in the context of a review of the relevant existing literature.  Recent reports (Muir Russell 2010; Inter Academy Council 2010) have emphasised the need to communicate the scientific evidence concerning climate change in a way the general public can more readily understand and engage with. However. the best way to achieve this is not self-evident.  The purpose of this report is to investigate how effectively the main conclusions of climate science are being communicated to the general public in the UK and how communication of climate science through the news media might better engage the public. It represents a first step towards adopting a more rigorous approach to climate science communication that incorporates testing and evaluation of what works and what does not work in terms of public engagement.  A reasonable and realistic goal of climate science communication might be to provide information that is necessary. if not sufficient in itself. for the public to make informed choices about policies or actions.

Part II: Seasonal and interannual variability,2009,Emily Shuckburgh and Francesco d’Ovidio and Bernard Legras,66,Journal of the atmospheric sciences,12,3695-3706,,The Lyapunov diffusivity is used to investigate local isentropic mixing events in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) region. The diagnostic highlights the seasonal cycle of the longitudinally varying mixing properties. in particular those associated with the monsoon circulations and the westerly ducts in the subtropics.

Should consumers always be encouraged to touch products. and does it always alter product perception?,2011,Nigel Marlow and Cathrine V Jansson‐Boyd,28,Psychology & Marketing,3,256-266,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,It has previously been suggested that consumers' product evaluations are positively affected by tactile interaction. However. it is not known if it is applicable to products that people usually touch for brief periods of time. This study sets out to explore whether it is possible to influence consumers' tactile perception of fast‐moving consumer goods by altering the surface texture. In this study individual tactile sensing and visual appreciation were compared with the combined visual and tactile sensing of surface textures for two types of products (soap and biscuits). Three types of textures on the outside of either a soap or biscuit box and three separate sample swatches of the textures used on the boxes were used in the study.

However. in the past 15 or so years there has been a gradual but steady interest in how the other senses can impact upon aspects such as consumer decision-making. product evaluation. and attention. The tactile sense in particular has been hailed as having the capacity to alter consumer perceptions and at times even directly compete with visual input. This review looks at numerous aspects of how touch is linked to consumption. such as; why it is an important tool. when tactile input is useful. the role of interpersonal touch in consumption and applicability to sales techniques. whether a “tactile language” can be established and how need for touch can be measured.

1204174,The history of consumer psychology,2017,Cathrine V Jansson-Boyd and Nigel Marlow,,,,3-17,,It is astounding how much people consume. For example. in 2014. the American toy market grew to a value of $18.1 billion (Toy Association. 2015). In 2013. the coffee shop industry in the United Kingdom was worth£ 5.8 billion. and over 74 million units of LCD TVs were sold in Asia. Moreover. in 2015. 74 million automobiles were sold worldwide (Statista. 2015). With figures such as the aforementioned. it is hardly surprising that what people consume plays a key part in their lives. Consumerism is hardly a new concept. At first glance. historically it appears that people have been interested in consuming for as long as they have existed. From a survival point of view. this is almost obvious. because early humans would have to have been interested in feeding and clothing themselves. providing shelter etc. in order to survive. These processes would have involved what might be termed “natural consumption”. By natural. we are implying that the consumption came from readily available resources. Food was provided for by hunting and gathering; shelter was fashioned from resources already existing in the ecosystem. for example cave-dwellings or huts built from branches and woven reeds. This “natural consumption” provided the minimum for survival. It was literally living “hand-to-mouth”. The step-change. of course. was the development of farming. Agriculture was also a step-change in the relationship that humans had with nature. It represents intervention and control over nature. This control allowed nomadic people to settle; life became much more predictable. and importantly. the nascent farming communities could for the first time produce more …,True,Aw1XvWIAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,8,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Si8lDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:XQE-64EOdGUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=wJ-0PDDdC3&sig=M4dk-t8rIOVNGrY83rgbDzTMQl0,3253303765525648735,/scholar?cites=3253303765525648735,,,0,0,0

Previous studies on energy use in social housing have generally focussed on the technological aspects (such as the potential savings possible by retrofitting this class of housing across the UK) or have involved one‐off interventions or measures. During a 2‐year period. we worked with previously homeless people to reduce their energy consumption. The 32 participants lived in small blocks of flats (owned by a social housing organisation) that underwent retrofitting with air source heat pumps. We ran a three‐phase tenant engagement programme to compare a range of approaches aimed at energy reduction.

Investigations of why this might be have included segmentation. to identify different groups who undertake more or less action. and analysis of various “barriers” to action. Those on lower incomes who are not home owners have previously been found to be less engaged in seeking out energy efficiency information. Working with low-income tenants living in supported social housing we conducted three group interviews. accompanied by a 7-item scale measuring general attitude towards the environment. The interviews were aimed at opening up discussion about environmental and energy issues. including exploring more deeply what. for these participants. underlies barriers to conservation behaviours. We found participants to be very willing to engage in conversation and knowledgeable about a range of relevant issues. Barriers explored include: lack of confidence in existing levels of knowledge. habit. self-interest and lack of agency. and in all cases several different perspectives were voiced by participants.

The Edinburgh Building. Cambridge CB 2 2 RU United Kingdom,The interaction of a turbulent eddy with a semi-infinite. poroelastic edge is examined with respect to the effects of both elasticity and porosity on the efficiency of aerodynamic noise generation. The scattering problem is solved using the Wiener-Hopf technique to identify the scaling dependence of the resulting aerodynamic noise on plate and flow properties. including the dependence on a characteristic flow velocity U.

Asymptotic analysis of these special cases reveals parametric limits where the far-field acoustic power scales like U6 for a porous edge. and a new finite range of U7 behaviour is found for an elastic edge. to be compared with the well-known U5 dependence for a rigid impermeable edge.

Alongside conventional ducted turbofan designs. new open-rotor contra-rotating power plants are currently under development. which present their own noise challenges. The key sources of tonal and broadband noise. and the way in which noise propagates away from the source. are surveyed in both cases. We also consider in detail two key aspects underpinning the flow physics that continue to receive considerable attention. namely the acoustics of swirling flow and unsteady flow-blade interactions.

1204193,Noise generation by the interaction between ingested turbulence and a rotating fan,1998,Sharanya J Majumdar and Nigel Peake,359,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,181-216,Cambridge University Press,An important criterion in the development of modern aeroengines is the identification of the dominant noise sources under typical aircraft take-off and approach conditions. and also in ground-based tests in which the engine is stationary. In this paper. we develop a theoretical model for unsteady distortion noise. which results from the interaction of ingested atmospheric turbulence with the rotating fan. with a view to providing a better understanding of the important physical mechanisms in this particular aspect of sound generation. The theory. developed in the frequency domain. is applicable for any arbitrary spectral form of atmospheric turbulence upstream of the fan. and as a simple model we take the von Kármán spectra for isotropic turbulence. The key fluid dynamical process in unsteady distortion is the deformation of turbulent eddies into long. narrow filaments as they enter the engine. due to the strong streamtube contraction experienced by the steady. non-uniform mean flow generated by the fan. Simple models of the steady flow fields are provided for both open and ducted rotor geometries. The distorted turbulent field at the fan face can be obtained using rapid distortion theory. and considerable simplification is made here by noting that the number of blades in typical aeroengine fans is large. allowing the application of asymptotic analysis and the derivation of closed-form expressions for those parts of the turbulence spectrum at the fan face which dominate the radiation. The unsteady forces exerted on the rotating fan blades are then calculated via a strip-theory approach. The resulting sound scattered to the far field is then evaluated using …,True,kIxqWCEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,85,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nigel_Peake/publication/238176784_Noise_generation_by_the_interaction_between_ingested_turbulence_and_a_rotating_fan/links/00b4952cc60292e22e000000.pdf,3703565560316021508,/scholar?cites=3703565560316021508,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nigel_Peake/publication/238176784_Noise_generation_by_the_interaction_between_ingested_turbulence_and_a_rotating_fan/links/00b4952cc60292e22e000000.pdf,0,0,0

Previous work by Hanson & Horan (1998) that considers a cascade of flat plates at zero incidence is extended to take into account blade geometry and angle of attack. Our approach is based on the work of Peake & Kerschen (1997). who calculate the forward radiation due to the interaction between a single vortical gust and a cascade of flat plates at non-zero angle of attack. The extensions completed in this present paper are two-fold: first we include the effects of small but non-zero camber and thickness; and second we produce uniformly valid approximations which predict the upstream radiation near modal cut-off.

The duct modes are separated into ordinary duct modes and surface modes confined to a neighbourhood of the boundary. Previous asymptotic results of Rienstra for the surface modes assume that the dimensionless frequency ω is large. and that the azimuthal order m ≪ ω. In this paper. these results are generalized to arbitrary values of m. as applicable to rotor-alone noise in aeroengines where m is a multiple of the number of blades and is typically O (ω). A dimensionless number λ is found to govern the surface modes’ behaviour. and qualitatively different behaviour is seen for λ in four distinct regions. separated by critical values depending only on the steady flow Mach number.

As a first step in the development of a general prediction scheme. we model in this paper just the action of the blade mean loading by treating the blades as flat plates aligned at a non-zero incidence angle. δ. to the oncoming stream. and consider harmonic components of the incident field with reduced frequency k. We then use asymptotic analysis in the realistic limit k 1. δ 1 with kδ= O (1) to make a consistent asymptotic expansion of the compressible Euler equations. The flow is seen to consist of inner regions around each leading edge. in which sound is generated by the local gust–airfoil and gust–flow interactions. and an outer region in which both the incident gust is distorted according to rapid distortion theory and the out-going sound is refracted by the non-uniform mean flow. The complicated multiple interactions between the sound and the cascade are included to the appropriate asymptotic order. and analytical expressions for the forward radiation are derived. It is seen that even a relatively small value of δ can have a significant effect. thanks to both the O (δk1/2) change in the amplitudes and the O (kδ) change in the phases of the various radiation components. corresponding to the additional source mechanisms associated with the flow distortion around each leading edge and the effects of propagation through the non-uniform flow. respectively.

In the present work. surface treatments are designed to replicate the effects of the canopy in a form suitable for application to an airfoil. These treatments are installed directly upstream of the trailing edge to modify the boundary-layer turbulence before acoustic scattering by the edge.

Many cases of vortex instability are not fully explained by strong exponential instability modes. and transient growth could offer an alternative route to breakdown in such cases. Strong transient growth is found. in agreement with previous studies. We first discuss the problem by reference to ducted vortices which model aeroengine flow. The transient growth is inviscid in character. and in this paper we specifically interpret it as an effect of the inviscid continuous spectrum. The relevant inviscid theory explains new scalings which we find for the transient growth. which are generalizations of the quadratic scaling seen previously in two-dimensional flows and non-swirling pipe flows.

1204202,The stability and transition of the boundary layer on a rotating sphere.,2002,Stephen J Garrett and N Peake,,,,,University of Leicester,This paper is concerned with convective and absolute instabilities in the boundary-layer flow over the outer surface of a sphere rotating in an otherwise still fluid. Viscous and streamline-curvature effects are included and the analysis is conducted between latitudes of 10° and 80° from the axis of rotation. Both convective and absolute instabilities are found at each latitude within specific parameter spaces. The results of the convective instability analysis show that a crossflow instability mode is the most dangerous below θ = 66°. Above this latitude a streamline-curvature mode is found to be the most dangerous. which coincides with the appearance of reverse flow in the radial component of the mean flow. At low latitudes the disturbances are considered to be stationary. but at higher latitudes they are taken to rotate at 76% of the sphere surface speed. as observed in experimental studies. Our predictions of the Reynolds number and vortex angle at the onset of convective instability are consistent with existing experimental measurements. Results are also presented that suggest that the occurrence of the slowly rotating vortices is associated with the dominance of the streamline-curvature mode at θ = 66°. The local Reynolds number at the predicted onset of absolute instability matches experimental data well for the onset of turbulence at θ = 30°; beyond this latitude the discrepancy increases but remains relatively small below θ = 70°. It is suggested that this absolute instability may cause the onset of transition below θ = 70°.

In general this phenomenon can be linked to instabilities in aircraft engine inlets.The model incorporates a slowly varying duct intake and accounts for the swirling flow downstream of the fan. The slow axial variation in cross-section gives rise to turning points where upstream-propagating acoustic modes are totally reflected into downstream-propagating modes. The effect of the swirling flow downstream can be to cut off a mode which is cut on upstream of the fan. It is shown that these two aspects of the flow. coupled with the effects of the fan (represented by an actuator disc). can lead to acoustic modes becoming trapped in the intake. thus giving rise to pure acoustic resonance.A whole range of system parameters. such as axial. fan and swirl Mach numbers. which satisfy the …,True,kIxqWCEAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,55,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/trapped-acoustic-modes-in-aeroengine-intakes-with-swirling-flow/A2D769566BF924D7521005338B484D53,18323997552561454199,/scholar?cites=18323997552561454199,,,0,0,0

1204209,Upstream-radiated rotor-stator interaction noise in mean swirling flow,2005,Alison J Cooper and Nigel Peake,523,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,219,Cambridge University Press,A major component of the noise in modern aeroengines is rotor–stator interaction noise generated when the wake from the rotating fan impinges on a stator row downstream. An analytically based model for the prediction of upstream-radiated rotor–stator interaction noise is described. and includes the important effect of mean swirling flow on both the rotor wake evolution and the acoustic response. The analytic nature of the model allows for the inclusion of all wake harmonics and enables the response at all blade passing frequencies to be determined. An asymptotic analysis based on large rotor blade number is used to model the evolution of the rotor wake downstream in a cylindrical duct carrying mean swirling flow. The equations governing the axial evolution of the wake simplify to three coupled first-order differential equations in the interior. while close to the duct walls. a boundary-layer correction is required in order to satisfy the impermeability conditions at the boundaries. At the stator location. the wake is used as input into a local linear cascade model at each radius. The interaction of each wake harmonic gives rise to acoustic waves of multiple azimuthal order which contribute to the pressure field radiated back upstream. This enables the total acoustic response to be determined in terms of cylindrical duct modes in mean swirling flow. The effect of stator blade geometry (thickness. camber. angle of attack) and rotor–stator separation on the total upstream-radiated noise is determined. Blade geometry is shown to have a significant effect on the noise generated. and increasing the rotor–stator gap can lead to large reductions in noise levels …,True,kIxqWCEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,39,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.583.6775&rep=rep1&type=pdf,17738368040669081033,/scholar?cites=17738368040669081033,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.583.6775&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

For smaller adverse pressure gradients. there exists a critical Reynolds number above which the flow is globally linearly unstable. but below which it is globally stable.

For the lowest azimuthalorder modes. three distinct regimes are found in which the modes are localized in different parts of the duct cross-section. This phenomenon is explained by a balance between whispering-gallery effects along the duct and refraction by the steady flow. At the opposite extreme. strongly spinning modes are investigated. and are seen to be due to a different whispering-gallery effect across the duct cross-section.,True,kIxqWCEAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,36,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/531a/7733512ca46ea0dd182950701d3b24aa45f3.pdf,17686751765119593339,/scholar?cites=17686751765119593339,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/531a/7733512ca46ea0dd182950701d3b24aa45f3.pdf,0,0,0
1204212,On the unsteady motion of a long fluid-loaded elastic plate with mean flow,2004,N Peake,507,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,335,Cambridge University Press,In this paper we consider the dynamic behaviour of a fluid-loaded elastic plate of dimensionless length 2L. set in a rigid baffle in the presence of uniform mean flow of dimensionless speed U. and including plate pre-tension (dimensionless tension T) and a spring foundation (dimensionless spring constant λ). Our aim is to extend previous analytical work of Crighton & Oswell (1991). who examined an infinite plate with T= λ= 0. This is achieved by considering a plate which is long on the scale of typical plate bending waves. and then by expressing the unsteady motion as a superposition of infinite-plate waves which are continuously rescattered in near-field regions at the plate leading and trailing edges. We find that the finite plate possesses resonant solutions which are temporally unstable. both for parameter values for which the infinite plate is convectively unstable (T and/or λ sufficiently small) and parameter values for which it is stable (T and/or λ sufficiently large). It is shown that instability is present in the absence of structural damping on the finite plate. in agreement with numerical results of Lucey & Carpenter (1992). Neutral resonant states are also found. for which we derive a generalization of the Landahl (1962) and Benjamin (1963) concept of wave energy. Finally. we replace the linear pre-tension T by the nonlinear tension induced by bending. and analyse the nonlinear evolution of the states of negative wave energy in the presence of weak structural damping. We show that the system possesses points of minimum action at non-zero frequency. which act as attractors. predicting the existence of nonlinear fluttering motion.,True,kIxqWCEAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,36,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nigel_Peake/publication/231948123_On_the_unsteady_motion_of_a_long_fluid-loaded_elastic_plate_with_mean_flow/links/00b4952cc602978db9000000/On-the-unsteady-motion-of-a-long-fluid-loaded-elastic-plate-with-mean-flow.pdf,14095587152994816514,/scholar?cites=14095587152994816514,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nigel_Peake/publication/231948123_On_the_unsteady_motion_of_a_long_fluid-loaded_elastic_plate_with_mean_flow/links/00b4952cc602978db9000000/On-the-unsteady-motion-of-a-long-fluid-loaded-elastic-plate-with-mean-flow.pdf,0,0,0

This collaborative design research project for a low-energy prefab house with an industry partner. a manufacturer of Structural Insulated Panels (SIP). is used as a case study to show that it is possible to achieve high energy performance while addressing specific socio-technical concerns within an Australian volume homebuilding market.

1204231,A resilience assessment framework for critical infrastructure networks' interdependencies,2020,Maryam Imani and Donya Hajializadeh,81,Water Science and Technology,7,1420-1431,IWA Publishing,Critical infrastructures (CIs) provide essential services to the society. As infrastructures are becoming more interdependent. there is an increasing need for better management of their interactions and interdependencies. Interdependencies among CI can cause cascading failures and. hence. amplify negative consequences due to these failures. This can also affect CIs' service restoration rate and consequently reduce their resilience in coping with these hazardous events. The common challenge currently faced by CI asset owners is the lack of robust resilience-informed business planning and management strategies in response to interdependent assets' failures due to low-probability/high-impact hazards. This is of particular importance as CI owners and managers are investing more on improving the resilience of their assets in response to extreme environmental hazards.

1204234,Assessing the Impact of Degree Day Base Temperatures on The Development of an Energy Index to Measure Energy Reduction,2017,Carlos Jimenez-Bescos,,International Conference for Sustainable Design of the Built Environment-SDBE London,,241,,Refurbishment projects must be monitored before and after technology or behavior changes implementations to be able to assess their effectiveness and to drive conclusions on their applicability. An Energy Index approach has been previously developed and at its foundation. is the implication of base temperature selection on Degree Day for assessing energy reduction. The base temperature used to calculate Degree Days in the UK is 15.5 degrees. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of Degree Day base temperatures on the development of an Energy Index by means of correlation between energy consumption and Degree Days. The methodology was based on a low budget energy management strategy. in which the following information was collected: meter readings. internal temperature and outdoor conditions by means of degree-days. The methodology was employed in thirteen flats. with a control group of six flats having electric storage heaters and a further seven flats retrofitted with heat pumps. The flats were retrofitted with heat pumps; meter readings were collected around monthly intervals. while internal temperature was collected at 20 minutes intervals. Energy consumption was correlated to Degree Days based on 15.5 degrees and then compared to the correlation when the base temperature for Degree Days matches the internal flat temperature. The results show that by matching the base temperature to internal flat temperature. the average correlation improves from 0.55 to 0.76 and the average standard deviation improves from 0.36 to 0.19. meaning that the spread of results is reduced and a better evaluation of …,True,9bPiH6gAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,2,http://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/702788/,3268183851104693360,/scholar?cites=3268183851104693360,,https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/702788/6/Jimenez-Bescos_2017_4.pdf,0,0,0

Six listed churches initially used for worship and later converted to community uses were selected and surveyed as case study buildings using purposive sampling technique. A qualitative analytical approach based on ranking the performance of the surveyed building’s energy consumption assessment compared to others within the same geographical region was adopted. Findings show that a greater number of the surveyed buildings are low-performing with their energy use being exacerbated by the combination and interplay of multiple factors such as building use pattern. efficiency of services and lighting etc. Results of the findings imply that potential and identifiable prospects for efficiency improvements and CO2 emissions reduction exists within the operation of the buildings.

The achievement of sustainable outcomes requires a range of professions. organisations. groups and individuals to work towards shared goals. Thus an emphasis on multi-agency and participatory working has become an integral component of the development of sustainable communities. Initial slow progress gave rise to a review of shortfalls in institutional capacity. and deficits in the generic skills required to enable effective multi-agency working were revealed. The policy response to these perceived deficits included initiatives to provide targeted information and training resources – at both a national and regional level – to urban development professionals and communities. This paper discusses research conducted at a regional level to develop a set of on-line resources focussed on the enhancement of generic skills. The research has addressed a wide range of conceptual and practical difficulties: the nature of generic skills; the capacity of online learning to address contextual skills; and the difficulties of integrating on-line learning into everyday working practices.

The challenge is that since most of these buildings were designed and built in a very different age. they are often seen as hugely energy-inefficient. Although. numerous attempts have been made to improve their energy efficiency. however due to the impulse to protect their delicate fabric. few have achieved little or no success. This paper as part of a doctoral research into energy management in reuse of public heritage buildings (PHBs); investigate strategies adopted to improve energy efficiency in adaptive reuse of PHBs where energy use problem could potentially be addressed. An online survey was conducted among heritage building stakeholders who reported their perceptions of energy use reduction for sustainable reuse PHBs. Findings show that most respondents were less inclined in their projects to implement energy efficiency strategies. Across the survey. few respondents who had significant success had better perceptions of the sustainable approach to achieving energy efficiency for heritage buildings. The paper presented the recommendations as perceived by the stakeholders; conclude by highlighting that a well-designed efforts to improve energy efficiency in reuse PHBs would require energy management to be incorporated into the daily operational practices.

The asphalt pavement surfaces tend to absorb a large amount of heat through solar radiation and increase the air temperature. which affects the operation of building heating and cooling systems. causing environmental problems and thermal discomfort. However. this energy can be collected by water circulated through buried copper pipes to cool down temperatures and be stored for other usages. This work aims to develop a method for determining the optimum areas to locate pavement solar collector (PSC) systems and simulate the reduction of ambient air and surface temperature by using a coupled computational modelling approach. Discrete ordinate model and solar-ray tracing were utilised for solar radiation effect modelling in the 3D simulation. Furthermore. the PSC prototype was developed. and lab-scale experiments were carried out for validation. Based on the simulated conditions. in the unshaded area. the asphalt slab’s near-surface temperature was reduced by up to 10℃ and the outlet water temperature increased by about 5℃. At the pedestrian height level. the air temperature was reduced up to 4.6℃. This study further expands the investigation of the variation of outdoor conditions such as air temperature and solar radiation. The results showed that the proposed method could be used to optimise the pavement solar collector’s positioning to reduce urban surface and air temperature.,True,9bPiH6gAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,0,https://futurecitiesandenvironment.com/articles/10.5334/fce.109/,,,,https://futurecitiesandenvironment.com/articles/10.5334/fce.109/,0,0,0

However. one problem during synthesis of CZTS films is the loss of Sn as a result of decomposition and evaporation of SnS. This paper uses kinetic models to show that the mechanism of the decomposition reaction probably occurs in at least two stages; first. a loss of sulfur which causes dissociation of the structure into binary sulfides. and only then the evaporation of SnS. Knowledge of the reaction mechanism helps to identify the driving force for decomposition as arising from the relative instability of Sn(IV) in CZTS against reduction; this theory is backed up by thermodynamic data. The volatility of SnS further exaggerates the decomposition by rendering it irreversible. This insight. alongside experimental data. allows prediction of the annealing conditions required to stabilize CZTS surfaces.

This paper explores some consequences of the chemical instability between CZTS and the standard Mo “back contact” layer used in the solar cell. Chemical passivation of the back contact interface using titanium nitride (TiN) diffusion barriers. combined with variations in the CZTS annealing process. enables us to isolate the effects of back contact chemistry on the electrical properties of the CZTS layer that result from the synthesis. as determined by measurements on completed solar cells. It is found that instability in the back contact is responsible for large current losses in the finished solar cell. which can be distinguished from other losses that arise from instabilities in the surface of the CZTS layer during annealing.

The CZTS grain size is larger for metallic precursors than for sulfur-containing precursors while more uniform films with fewer voids are obtained in the latter case. During sulfurisation of precursors with tin-excess in closed quartz ampoules. tin is lost from the films with greater losses from metallic precursors. We suggest that the reduced grain size and the reduced tin-loss for sulfur-containing precursors can be explained by a larger number of CZTS nuclei being formed early in the sulfurisation process. In sulfur containing precursors with large tin excess. SnS2 is observed together with CZTS. and a tin-rich bottom layer segregates. This indicates that tin-diffusion in CZTS is relatively slow.

1204251,Dynamic behaviour of the reactive sputtering process,2006,Tomas Kubart and Oliver Kappertz and Tomas Nyberg and Sören Berg,515,Thin Solid Films,2,421-424,Elsevier,Modelling of the dynamic behaviour of the reactive sputtering process is a key issue in many respects. Apart from increasing the basic understanding. such a model is also important for an active control of the process so that optimal deposition conditions can be maintained. This work is intended to present a basic model for the dynamic behaviour of the reactive sputtering process. The influence of the processing parameters on the transient behaviour is discussed. We found that the processing curves depend on the rate by which the processing parameters are varied. In particular. when measuring pressure–flow curves for increasing and decreasing reactive gas flow. the rate of change of the reactive gas supply strongly influences the width of the hysteresis region.,True,JwrijxIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609005025800,4944119241127252312,/scholar?cites=4944119241127252312,,,0,0,0

It is found that for both metals. the discharge peak current significantly increases in the oxide mode in contrast to the behavior in reactive direct current magnetron sputtering where the discharge current increases for Al but decreases for Ti when oxygen is introduced. In order to investigate the increase in the discharge current in HiPIMS-mode. the ionic contribution of the discharge in the oxide and metal mode is measured using time-resolved mass spectrometry. The energy distributions and time evolution are investigated during the pulse-on time as well as in the post-discharge.

In this contribution. we have studied the hysteresis behaviour of Ti metal targets sputtered in Ar + O2 mixtures. For fixed pulse on time and a constant average power. there is an optimum frequency minimizing the hysteresis.

Scientific assessments on climate change have mainly involved atmospheric scientists and experts in the area of environment and energy. Key questions in the scientific discourse were: if observed climate change was accidental or systematic. what role could be attributed to the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases? Which models can tell us about future developments? How much reduction in emissions is needed to mitigate the risks of climate change? Climate change scenarios are typically expressed in terms of time scales of 50–100 years. for areas as large as northwest Europe. Such projections about globally very significant changes in the decades to come are difficult to comprehend or translate into real life today in a certain city or rural area.

Different actors ‘see’ disasters as different types of events and as a result they prepare for. manage and record them in very different ways. This paper explores what different perceptions of vulnerability mean in terms of the understanding and practices of two significant sets of actors and stakeholders involved in disaster preparedness and management in the Philippines: the state and NGOs. Approaches to disaster are not just a function of people's perceptions of disaster risk but also of their understanding of the prevailing social order and social relations.

Furthermore. we criticize the tendency to promote women's departure from the mining sector. which has been presented as the best strategy to protect them against the threats of sexual violence. exploitation and oppression.

Diversity of bureaucrats. technocrats and local people,2003,Dorothea Hilhorst,21,International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters,1,37-56,RESEARCH COMMITTEE ON DISASTERS. UNIVERSITY OF,The relations between disaster experts. governments. and local people have often been considered problematic in disaster situations. The idea that disasters caused by natural hazards are the ultimate terrain of experts and managers has been discredited by approaches focusing on the capacities and coping practices of local people. while the role of governments in the interplay between experts and local people is often left unclear. This paper reviews some recent insights into the complexity of these relations by introducing the notion of social domains of disaster responses. Social domains are areas of social life where ideas and practices concerning risk and disaster are exchanged. shared and more or less organized because of a certain proximity. physically or discursively. in the ways references are made to disaster and risk. The study of social domains allows one to focus on the everyday practices and movements of actors negotiating the conditions and effects of vulnerability and disaster. The paper first discusses how experts and local people are represented in different subsequent paradigms of disaster studies; elaborates on the importance of social domains for studying disaster response; after which the three domains of disaster science. governance and local people will be discussed.,True,gq0I100AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,73,https://www.alnap.org/system/files/content/resource/files/main/hihorst.pdf,12272911745346895694,/scholar?cites=12272911745346895694,,https://www.alnap.org/system/files/content/resource/files/main/hihorst.pdf,0,0,0
1204283,Disaster. conflict and society in crises: everyday politics of crisis response,2013,Dorothea Hilhorst,,,,,Routledge,Humanitarian crises-resulting from conflict. natural disaster or political collapse–are usually perceived as a complete break from normality. spurring special emergency policies and interventions. In reality. there are many continuities and discontinuities between crisis and normality. What does this mean for our understanding of politics. aid. and local institutions during crises? This book examines this question from a sociological perspective. This book provides a qualitative inquiry into the social and political dynamics of local institutional response. international policy and aid interventions in crises caused by conflict or natural disaster. Emphasising the importance of everyday practices. this book qualitatively unravels the social and political working of policies. aid programmes and local institutions. The first part of the book deals with the social life of politics in crisis. Some of the questions raised are: What is the meaning of human security in practice? How do governments and other actors use crises to securitize–and hence depoliticize-their strategies? The second part of the book deals with the question how local institutions fare under and transform in response to crises. Conflicts and disasters are breakpoints of social order. with a considerable degree of chaos and disruption. but they are also marked by processes of continuity and re-ordering. or the creation of new institutions and linkages.

El Salvador suffered two severe earthquakes. Approx. 1.160 people were killed and 8.120 injured. 150.000 houses were destroyed. infrastructure (including health services) damaged and the total economic loss is estimated at $1.25 billion. Wisner (2001) states that this number could have been lower if the government would have opted for more serious attention to the inclusion of civil society in management. instead of simply decentralising. This example does not stand alone. Participation of civil society in disaster management has often been disregarded as impractical. inefficient or unnecessary. In this paper we shall argue why participation is important and what will be the conditions under which participatory risk and disaster management could develop.Water-related disasters continuously appear on our television screens and in our newspapers. Reports on floods. hurricanes. tsunamis and tornadoes show us devastation and loss of lives and livelihoods. On the other side of the hydrological spectrum we find the creeping and silent droughts. not as destructive as floods. but killing even more people. All too often disaster management is rather ad-hoc relief after a disaster event. Prevention of loss and mitigation of disaster are challenges that people are facing everywhere.

It is based on fieldwork with one development NGO in the Cordillera of the Philippines: the Cordillera Women NGO. or CWNGO (a pseudonym). Through this study I wanted to find out why certain groups of actors form organizations that they call an NGO. and how they ascribe meanings to the organization in practice. Meaning making is central to everyday practice. since it underlies the numerous small and big. pro-active and responsive decisions and actions that together make up the organization. In addition. the study focuses on matters of everyday politics. On the one hand. this entails the way ideology was important in shaping the organization. On the other. this involves the question how NGOs acquire legitimation as a development organization vis-à-vis relevant other parties. including clients. donors and constituency. This means that I look into processes by which NGO actors convince stakeholders that a situation requires development. that NGO intervention is indispensable and appropriate. and that the NGO has no self-interest in the envisaged programme.The approach I developed for this rests on three pillars. Firstly. I use an actor orientation. Such an orientation starts with the premise that social actors have agency. They reflect upon their experiences and what happens around them and use their knowledge and capabilities to interpret and respond to development. An actor orientation recognizes the large range of constraints that impinge on social actors. but emphasizes that such constraints operate through people.

1204294,Classical humanitarianism and resilience humanitarianism: making sense of two brands of humanitarian action,2018,Dorothea Hilhorst,3,Journal of International Humanitarian Action,1,1-12,SpringerOpen,Humanitarian aid has long been dominated by a classical. Dunantist paradigm that was based on the ethics of the humanitarian principles and centred on international humanitarian United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations. While in previous decades alternative paradigms and humanitarianisms evolved. this classical paradigm remained the central narrative of humanitarianism. In recent years. however. this paradigm has been paralleled by a resilience paradigm that is focused on local people and institutions as the first responders to crises. Whereas classical humanitarianism is rooted in the notion of exceptionalism. resilience humanitarianism starts from the idea of crisis as the new normality. This paper discusses the two paradigms and the incongruent images they evoke about crises. local institutions and the recipients of aid. The article puts forward the case for studying the ways in which these contrasting aid paradigms shape practices. dealing with the importance of discourse. the social life of policy. the multiplicity of interests. the power relations and the crucial importance of understanding the lifeworld and agency of aid workers and crisis-affected communities. The article demonstrates how the stories that humanitarians tell about themselves are based on highly selective views of reality and do not include the role they themselves play in the reordering and representation of realities in humanitarian crises.,True,gq0I100AAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C,40,https://jhumanitarianaction.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41018-018-0043-6,2902817787385299880,/scholar?cites=2902817787385299880,,https://jhumanitarianaction.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41018-018-0043-6,0,0,0

Murrelet marine habitat selection was simultaneously affected by sea surface temperature and nearshore environment characteristics. as well as distance to nest site for breeders. with lesser influence by physical oceanographic features. Marbled murrelets were generally associated with areas characterized by higher relative tidal speeds. greater depths. steeper ocean floor slopes. less freshwater inflow and proximity to sandy beaches. though the strength of these relationships varied. Breeding murrelets were also associated with proximity to nest sites. We observed within-season and between-site variability in murrelet-SST associations. suggesting that murrelets change their foraging tactics as their needs and/or local oceanographic conditions change.

The overall purpose for evaluating MFS II-funded development interventions is to account for results and to contribute to the improvement of future development interventions.This evaluation report evaluates the International Lobbying and Advocacy (ILA) programmes of the eight alliances that implement 16 ILA projects in 15 different regions worldwide. Parallel to this evaluation of ILA programmes. an in-country evaluation on the MDGs. organisational capacity and civil society is being carried out in eight countries.

1204315,Doctors. clerics. healers. and neighbors: religious influences on maternal and child health in Uzbekistan,2008,Jennifer Brooke Barrett,,,,,,A growing body of literature links religion to a variety of beneficial health outcomes. but many aspects of the influence of religion on health attitudes and behaviors remain uninvestigated. Most existing work linking religion to health focuses on the United States and other Western contexts. and examinations of reproductive. maternal. and child health are notably absent from research seeking to clarify the relationships between religion and health. This dissertation explores the influences of religious beliefs and behaviors on reproductive. maternal. and child health in Uzbekistan. a theoretically and practically useful context for this study. In this project. I seek to enhance understandings of connections between religion and health by incorporating insights from demographic literature on religion and reproduction and from the body of work on the religion-health connection. In order to answer questions about overall associations between religion and reproductive. maternal. and child health as well as questions about the specific pathways through which religion comes to affect health. I draw on both quantitative and qualitative analyses. I conduct quantitative analysis using secondary survey data collected in 1996 and 2002 in order to address questions related to patterns in the observable relationships between religious affiliation and aspects of reproductive. maternal. and child health in Uzbekistan. To answer questions about mechanisms of religious influence. I turn to qualitative data (observation. focus groups. and in-depth interviews) collected over an 11 month period in two locations (urban and rural) in Uzbekistan.

Social Sciences Group,The MFS II grant framework has awarded€ 1.9 billion through the MFS II grant framework to 20 Dutch Co-Financing Agencies working towards strengthening civil society in the global South and achieving sustainable reduction in poverty. The overall purpose of the joint MFS II evaluation. of which this baseline report is one part. is to account for results and to contribute to the improvement future development interventions. This segment of the overall evaluation focuses on international lobbying and advocacy programs of 8 MFS II alliances grouped into three thematic clusters: Sustainable Livelihoods and Economic Justice; Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights; and Protection. Human Security. and Conflict Prevention. The ILA evaluation has the aims of: 1) assessing the effectiveness. efficiency. and relevance of ILA programs funded by MFS II; 2) developing and applying innovative methodologies for the evaluation of ILA programs; and 3) providing justified recommendations that enable further development interventions.The originality of the evaluation of MFS II ILA programs lies in the “bridging” approach taken. seeking to merge two positions in evaluations sometimes positioned as irreconcilable. The evaluation aims to reconcile the linear evaluation tradition that compares outcomes at a certain moment in time against a set of objectives. with the evaluation perspective that acknowledges complexity and recognizes the adaptive capacities of programs.

These widespread changes may affect the distribution of their prey. We studied the continental-scale distributions of non-breeding Calidris alpina pacifica and C. a. hudsonia (Pacific and Atlantic dunlins. respectively). as numbers of their major predators—peregrines (Falco peregrinus) and merlins (F. columbarius; together ‘falcons’)—increased after DDT was banned in 1973. For the period 1975–2010 we compiled the number of dunlins and falcons in each of 244 Christmas Bird Count circles. which cover most of the dunlins’ non-breeding ranges. Over the study period. falcons increased by 6.5-(Pacific) and 3.1-(Atlantic) fold. spread to more count circles. and the number of dunlins per falcon fell. The annual total count of the two dunlin sub-species fluctuated strongly and independently. We measured annual aggregation as the expected proportion of a subspecies total found on the same count circle as a randomly selected dunlin. The average aggregation of Pacific dunlins (0.117) was about double that of Atlantic dunlins (0.059). with annual variation largely attributable to changes in a few large count circles. The slope of the aggregative response to year-on-year changes in dunlin numbers was identical on the two coasts.

These                ideals are set against the experience of urban middle-class life. This discourse                describes consumer culture as debased materialism. while at the same time presenting                it as central to middle-class social life. This article explores the nature of the                tension apparent in this contradiction. and finds that employers of this discourse                accept the inescapable nature of status battles around consumption while denying it                legitimacy and real significance for the constitution of their individual selves.

Consequently. we make the case for a refocusing of research on political engagement.

However. our understanding of the motivations for such targeting remains limited. as does our ability to engage with this matter through policy. In this article we explore tactical targeting of schools in Nepal in order to deepen our understanding of this phenomenon. Our key argument is that schools offered important qualities and resources to parties in conflict. We distinguish physical and symbolic qualities and resources that are human and financial in nature. and we explain how and why these played a role in the targeting of schools. We conclude that if we seek to protect schools. children. and school staff from being targeted. it may be well worth temporarily decreasing schools’ societal prominence in comparable cases in which our argumentation may apply …,True,Si3U4-QAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,26,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/667530,14164663769135843305,/scholar?cites=14164663769135843305,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5b89/f2c4ed3fca9829a73326f2080f9bbe2f201e.pdf,0,0,0

Based on a theoretical perspective of aid as a socially negotiated arena. the contextual and interactionist concept of imaging is used. rather than labelling (which is done to people). or perceptions (located in one actor's head). The paper uses a Q-methodology that symmetrically researches different groups of actors by posing the same questions. Our data confirm that the distinctions between the way aid workers and recipients view themselves. each other and the aid provided were more gradual than clear-cut between categories and that the legitimacy of aid workers is not determined by the perceived quality of aid.

Politically disaffected citizens interviewed understand politics in terms of a lifeworld-politics clash. and they espouse a policy-oriented ideal of politics that puts their lifeworld at the centre. Although their approach suggests that they turn away from institutional politics that fails this ideal. their citizenship is political. and they demand acknowledgement and inclusion of their view of reality rather than simply improvement in policy quality. These citizens assume themselves to be standing together with others presumably sharing their common sense understandings of what politics should be and how it fails in reality.

The authors approach this transformation from the perspective of the core values of the partnership concept and the ability of field workers to behave in ways that are consistent with these core values. illustrated by an empirical study of the relationships between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and NGOs in a refugee-assistance programme in northern Uganda.

We question this assumption and argue that ToC’s focus on cause–effect logic and intended outcomes does not do justice to the recursive nature of complex interventions such as advocacy. Supported by our work as evaluators. and specifically our case study of an advocacy program on child rights. we illustrate how advocacy evolves through recursive interactions. with outcomes that are emergent rather than predictable. We propose putting “practices of change” at the center by emphasizing human interactions. using the analytical lenses of strategies as practice and recursiveness.

UN-backed since 1995. has been widely adopted in national policies. gender inequalities are rarely systematically addressed on the ground. To explain this limited effectiveness. this paper takes a discourse analytical perspective on gender policy and budgeting. with a focus on the translation of the international norm into domestic norms and policies. An in-depth. inductive analysis of 107 policy documents in Uganda examines how the gender mainstreaming norm has been translated at three administrative levels: national. district. sub-county. The analysis finds five processes that reduce the norm's transformational potential: neglecting gender discourse. gender inertia. shrinking gender norms. embracing discursive hybridity and minimizing budgets. Overall. gender mainstreaming largely stopped at the discursive level. and often paradoxically depoliticized …,True,Si3U4-QAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277539518304771,15522889585193538940,/scholar?cites=15522889585193538940,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277539518304771,0,0,0
1204335,Wealth and its social worth: Consumers in the land of Gandhi,1998,MGJ van Wessel,,Amsterdams sociologisch tijdschrift,,,,Middle-class status in Baroda. India. involves the consumption of other and much more goods than consumed by earlier generations. However. established morality qualifies the pursuit of status through consumption as illegitimate. In addition. some people fear that consumption of modern goods signals the onset of a shallow and meaningless society. and conflicts with true emotional life and empathy. The pursuit of employment and status through consumption also runs counter to the ideal of simplicity. or abstinence from material pleasures. In local discourse on social and cultural conditions. consciousness of the distance between ideal and real with regard to consumption is ever present and marks local evaluation of. and debate about. modern consumer culture. 13 References.

They undertook actions in order to infuse water management with a pragmatic logic that in their view would be better able to handle complexity. They addressed the requirements of an organizational context dominated by rational comprehensive planning as the model for acceptable action and associated forms of organizing that honor formally regulated responsibilities. Existing organizational practices and the logics grounding these were the counterpoint of their strategy. as well as the source on which they drew. Conventional forms of planning and organization were changed from within. through insider action woven into existing organizational process and form.

However. establishing the effectiveness of advocacy is problematic and dependent on the interpretations of the stakeholders involved. as well as the interactions between them.

Wageningen: Wageningen University,,,,The MFS II grant framework has awarded€ 1.9 billion through the MFS II grant framework to 20 Dutch Co-Financing Agencies working towards strengthening civil society in the global South and achieving sustainable reduction in poverty. The overall purpose of the joint MFS II evaluation. of which this baseline report is one part. is to account for results and to contribute to the improvement future development interventions. This segment of the overall evaluation focuses on international lobbying and advocacy programs of 8 MFS II alliances grouped into three thematic clusters: Sustainable Livelihoods and Economic Justice; Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights; and Protection. Human Security. and Conflict Prevention. The ILA evaluation has the aims of: 1) assessing the effectiveness. efficiency. and relevance of ILA programs funded by MFS II; 2) developing and applying innovative methodologies for the evaluation of ILA programs; and 3) providing justified recommendations that enable further development interventions.The originality of the evaluation of MFS II ILA programs lies in the “bridging” approach taken. seeking to merge two positions in evaluations sometimes positioned as irreconcilable. The evaluation aims to reconcile the linear evaluation tradition that compares outcomes at a certain moment in time against a set of objectives. with the evaluation perspective that acknowledges complexity and recognizes the adaptive capacities of programs.

Using a case study from the Netherlands. we show that Dutch citizens’ difficulties in relating to democratic institutions reflect at least partly a clash between their ideals of national representative democracy and their experience of it in practice. Citizens seek experience of representation in non‐processual indications of representation through which they orient themselves: fixed positions. leadership that suggests action in a direction of choice. and an experienceable orientation towards output.

The interpretive approach toward communication employed in this study presents new insights on how. for citizens. government communicates its responsiveness. and how citizens' interpretations that arise from these communications make sense.

The number of partnerships is increasing. However. facilitation and evaluation of partnerships is hampered by the lack and/or non-use of feasible tools. As a consequence. health promotion through partnerships is not optimally facilitated and evaluated.

Because no one agency can tackle all these determinants. the promotion of healthy ageing requires an intersectoral approach. The aim of this article is to describe a theoretical basis. the development and possible applications of a framework within a municipality in the Netherlands. This framework supports intersectoral collaboration by guiding and stimulating the development. implementation and evaluation of health promotion activities for healthy ageing. It is based on the principles of health promotion and on the theory of salutogenesis and built upon three interrelated central concepts: (1) sense of coherence.

There has been no systematic examination of the extent of community participation in community development projects and little analysis of their effectiveness. This systematic review aims to identify the extent of community participation in community development projects implemented in Australian Indigenous communities. critically appraise the qualitative and quantitative methods used in their evaluation. and summarise their outcomes. Ten electronic peer-reviewed databases and two electronic grey literature databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2015. The level of community participation and the methodological quality of the qualitative and quantitative components of the studies were assessed against standardised criteria. Thirty one evaluation studies of community development projects were identified. Community participation varied between different phases of project development. generally high during project implementation. but low during the evaluation phase. For the majority of studies. methodological quality was low and the methods were poorly described. Although positive qualitative or quantitative outcomes were reported in all studies. only two studies reported statistically significant outcomes.

Toronto. Canada,Background: As interventions are not yet successful in substantially improving physical activity levels of low socioeconomic status groups in the Netherlands. it is a challenge to undertake more effective interventions. Participatory community-based physical activity interventions such as Communities on the Move (CoM) seem promising. Evaluating their effectiveness. however. calls for appropriate evaluation approaches.Objective: This paper provides the conceptual model for the development of a context-sensitive monitoring and evaluation approach in order to (1) measure the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CoM. and (2) develop an evaluation design enabling the identification of underlying mechanisms which explain what works and why in community-based physical activity programs.Methods: A cohort design is proposed. based on multiple cases. measuring impact. processes. and changes at each of the distinguished levels. The methods described in this paper will evaluate both short-and long-term effects. costs. and benefits of CoM.Results: Testing of the proposed model began in October 2012 and is on-going.Conclusions: The design offers a valid research strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of community-based physical activity programs. Internal validity is guaranteed by the use of several verification techniques such as triangulation. The multiple case studies at the program and community levels enhance external validity.,True,PxZbG-IAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,24,https://www.researchprotocols.org/2013/1/e20?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_1,4413661705715950049,/scholar?cites=4413661705715950049,,https://www.researchprotocols.org/2013/1/e20?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_1,0,0,0
1204367,Health-related quality of life. self-efficacy and enjoyment keep the socially vulnerable physically active in community-based physical activity programs: a sequential cohort study,2016,Marion Herens and Evert Jan Bakker and Johan van Ophem and Annemarie Wagemakers and Maria Koelen,11,PloS one,2,e0150025,Public Library of Science,Physical inactivity is most commonly found in socially vulnerable groups. Dutch policies target these groups through community-based health-enhancing physical activity (CBHEPA) programs. As robust evidence on the effectiveness of this approach is limited. this study investigated whether CBHEPA programs contribute to an increase in and the maintenance of physical activity in socially vulnerable groups. In four successive cohorts. starting at a six-month interval. 268 participants from 19 groups were monitored for twelve months in seven CBHEPA programs. Data collection was based on repeated questionnaires. Socio-economic indicators. program participation and coping ability were measured at baseline. Physical activity. health-related quality of life and on-going program participation were measured three times. Self-efficacy and enjoyment were measured at baseline and at twelve months. Statistical analyses were based on a quasi-RCT design (independent t-tests). a comparison of participants and dropouts (Mann-Whitney test). and multilevel modelling to assess change in individual physical activity. including group level characteristics. Participants of CBHEPA programs are socially vulnerable in terms of low education (48.6%). low income (52.4%). non-Dutch origin (64.6%) and health-related quality of life outcomes. Physical activity levels were not below the Dutch average. No increase in physical activity levels over time was observed.

Recently. there is growing interest to understand benefits for citizen scientists themselves. We studied the perceived impacts of participation in a public health citizen science project on citizen scientists in a disadvantaged neighbourhood in the Netherlands. Local citizen scientists. characterised by low income and low educational level–many of whom were of migrant origin–were trained to interview fellow residents about health-enhancing and health-damaging neighbourhood features. Experiences of these citizen scientists were collected through focus groups and interviews and analysed using a theoretical model of potential citizen science benefits. The results show that the citizen scientists perceived participation in the project as a positive experience. They acquired a broader understanding of health and its determinants and knowledge about healthy lifestyles. and took action to change their own health behaviour. They reported improved self confidence and social skills. and expanded their network across cultural boundaries. Health was perceived as a topic that helped people with different backgrounds to relate to one another. The project also induced joint action to improve the neighbourhood’s health. We conclude that citizen science benefits participants with low educational or literacy level. Moreover. it seems to be a promising approach that can help promote health in underprivileged communities by strengthening personal skills and social capital.

It now denotes one or more of several processes and impacts related to gas/oil exploration. extraction. and development; confusion can arise when it is unclear which processes or impacts are included in a particular use of this term. “Fracking” also carries negative and lewd connotations that shape public representations of the processes and impacts associated with it.

The information and ideas we hold about shale gas development can strongly influence our discussion of this issue. the impacts we associate with it. and the types of regulation we view as appropriate. Our knowledge and beliefs are based in part on social representations—common sense understandings of complex. often scientific. phenomena. generated in the public sphere and reliant on the history. culture. and social structure of the context in which they emerge. In this article. we examine social representations of environmental. economic. and social impacts of natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale. as reported by major regional newspapers.

Inc.,The United States and Canada have been at the forefront of shale oil and gas development via hydraulic fracturing. Understanding public perceptions is important given the role that they may play in future policy decisions in both North America and other parts of the world where shale development is at a much earlier stage. We review 58 articles pertaining to perceptions. published between 2009 and 2015. Studies report mixed levels of awareness of shale operations. tending toward higher awareness in areas with existing development. While individuals tend to have negative associations with the term ‘fracking.’ views on shale development are mixed as to whether benefits outweigh risks or vice versa: perceived benefits tend to be economic (e.g.. job creation and boosts to local economies) and risks more commonly environmental and/or social (e.g.. impacts on water and increased traffic).

Although an explicit premise of the One Health Initiative is that healthy wildlife contribute to human health. and vice versa. the initiative also suggests implicitly that wildlife may pose threats to human health through zoonotic disease transmission.

A less common way of conceptualising effects of extractive industries. but more akin to the way in which rural residents discuss and experience the complex set of effects. is changes to way of life. A growing literature explores effects on ‘wellbeing’ and ‘the good life’ as important determinants of responses to development projects. and as necessary considerations for policies regulating such development.

The answer matters crucially for policy and communication – if perceptions of what is true (beliefs) precede feelings (attitudes). additional information could shape views on an energy technology; yet. if attitudes precede beliefs. the usefulness of communication. either for influencing beliefs or simply making the public more informed. is far less clear.

The authors conclude that word choice (or ‘framing’) of this form of unconventional fossil fuel development is ‘much ado about nothing’ and that ‘survey research into fracking need not overly worry about the choice of [word] strategy’ (p. 56). These inferences are problematic. First. despite the authors’ repeated claims that prior research has not explored differences in public attitudes on this issue when ‘fracking’ versus other language is used. prior research has examined this topic – via a very similar methodological approach – and generated opposite findings.

1204399,Community perspectives of natural resource extraction: coal-seam gas mining and social identity in Eastern Australia,2013,David Lloyd and Hanabeth Luke and Bill Boyd,,Coolabah,10,144-164,,Using a recent case study of community reaction to proposed coal-seam gas mining in eastern Australia. we illustrate the role of community views in issues of natural resource use. Drawing on interviews. observations and workshops. the paper explores the anti-coal-seam gas social movement from its stages of infancy through to being a national debate linking community groups across and beyond Australia. Primary community concerns of inadequate community consultation translate into fears regarding potential impacts on farmland and cumulative impacts on aquifers and future water supply. and questions regarding economic. social and environmental benefits. Many of the community activists had not previously been involved in such social action. A recurring message from affected communities is concern around perceived insufficient research and legislation for such rapid industrial expansion. A common citizen demand is the cessation of the industry until there is better understanding of underground water system interconnectivity and the methane extraction and processing life cycle. Improved scientific knowledge of the industry and its potential impacts will. in the popular view. enable better comparison of power generation efficiency with coal and renewable energy sources and better comprehension of the industry as a transition energy industry. It will also enable elected representatives and policy makers to make more informed decisions while developing appropriate legislation to ensure a sustainable future.,True,7Li25sIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,66,https://www.raco.cat/index.php/coolabah/article/view/327736,16022224577538178398,/scholar?cites=16022224577538178398,,https://www.raco.cat/index.php/coolabah/article/download/327736/418258,0,0,0

1204419,Social licence or social science? Perspectives on social impact assessment,2019,R Parsons and R Lawrence and H Luke and J Vozoff,,9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE MINERALS INDUSTRY (SDIMI 2019),,,,Established frameworks for social impact assessment (SIA). both internationally and in Australia. emphasise the fundamental need for rigorous social-science methods. alongside complementary principles such as impartiality. a life-cycle approach. and transparency. For example. the New South Wales (NSW) SIA guideline for resource projects (NSW DPE. 2017) notes that SIA should use “appropriate. accepted social-science methods and robust evidence from authoritative sources.” and that SIA should be “undertaken in a fair. unbiased manner.” The rationale for these principles is that decision-makers. and people potentially affected by major projects. should be able to rely on the findings and conclusions in forming a balanced view of their merits. On this basis. rigorously investigating the community’s views. and level of approval–or ‘social licence’–for a proposal becomes one of the critically important parts in the SIA process.

To assist Lismore City Council (Northern New South Wales) in its deliberations on the topic. a referendum-style poll on the issue of CSG industry development was held in conjunction with the local government elections of September 2012. The poll question.‘Do you support CSG exploration and production in the Lismore City Council area?’. elicited a poll response rate of 97% of eligible voters. of which 87% voted ‘no’. This paper reports the results of an exit poll survey and examines the role of the poll and exit poll survey in providing a process of deliberative democracy in the context of the CSG debate. Key details highlighted by the results were that nonsupporters of CSG exploration were primarily concerned about water quality. while supporters saw the primary benefit being regional employment. Emerging themes of this study are the need for more independent research on potential risks and benefits of CSG developments. increase in institutional transparency. and the development of renewable alternatives. The study concludes that the principles of deliberative democracy involved in the Lismore City Council poll and subsequent exit poll survey have provided an opportunity for a more open discussion and genuine discourse within the,True,7Li25sIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=AU2019D02831,,,,,0,0,0

Heat Transfer,4,567-574,,Usual heat transfer fluids with suspended ultra fine particles of nanometer size are named as nanofluids. which have opened a new dimension in heat transfer processes. The recent investigations confirm the potential of nanofluids in enhancing heat transfer required for present age technology. The present investigation goes detailed into investigating the increase of thermal conductivity with temperature for nano fluids with water as base fluid and particles of Al2O3 or CuO as suspension material. A temperature oscillation technique is utilized for the measurement of thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity is calculated from it.

While one group of investigators has observed very strong evidence of hyperbolic nature of conduction in such materials and experimentally determined the corresponding relaxation times to be of the order of tens of seconds. the other group proclaims that their experiments do not show any such relaxation behaviour and the conventional Fourier law of conduction is good enough to describe conduction in them. This paper is an effort towards resolving this controversy. In the first place the experimental philosophies and techniques of both the groups have been thoroughly examined.
