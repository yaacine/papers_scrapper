1098620,NARSTO critical review of photochemical models and modeling,2000,Armistead Russell and Robin Dennis,34,,12-14,2283-2324,Pergamon,Photochemical air quality models play a central role in both schentific investigation of how pollutants evlove in the atmosphere as well as developing policies to manage air quality. In the past 30 years. these models have evolved from rather crude representations of the physics and chemistry impacting trace species to their current state: comprehensive. but not complete. The evolution has included advancements in not only the level of process descriptions. but also the computational implementation. including numerical methods. As part of the NARSTO Critical Reviews. this article discusses the current strengths and weaknesses of air quality models and the modeling process. Current Eulerian models are found to represent well the primary processes impacting the evolution of trace species in most cases though some exceptions may exist. For example. sub-grid-scale processes. such as concentrated power plant …,True,ISshn7cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,620,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231099004689,3804746162887829493,/scholar?cites=3804746162887829493,,,0,0,0

While ozone modeling and evaluation is fairly developed. particulate matter (PM) modeling is still an evolving science. EPA has issued minimal guidance on PM and visibility model performance evaluation metrics. goals. and criteria. This paper addresses these issues by examining various bias and error metrics and proposes PM model performance goals (the level of accuracy that is considered to be close to the best a model can be expected to achieve) and criteria (the level of accuracy that is considered to be acceptable for modeling applications) that vary as a function of concentration and extinction. In this paper. it has been proposed that a model performance goal has been met when both the mean fractional error (MFE) and the mean fractional bias (MFB) are less than or equal to +50 …,True,ISshn7cAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,602,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231006000690,17130405454318444666,/scholar?cites=17130405454318444666,,,0,0,0

The primary source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for energy. As society’s demand for energy increases and more CO2 is produced. it becomes imperative to decrease the amount emitted to the atmosphere. One promising approach to do this is to capture CO2 at the effluent of the combustion site. namely. power plants. in a process called postcombustion CO2 capture. Technologies to achieve this are heavily researched due in large part to the intuitive nature of removing CO2 from the stack gas and the ease in retrofitting existing CO2 sources with these technologies. As such. several reviews have been written on postcombustion CO2 capture.

The space is built around two coordinates. volatility and the degree of oxidation. both of which can be constrained observationally or specified for known molecules. Earlier work presented the thermodynamics of organics forming the foundation of this 2-D-VBS. allowing us to define the average composition (C.

The MAE measured at 632 nm was 8.45±1.71 and 9.41±1.92 m2 g−1 during winter and summer respectively. The daily variation of MAE was found to coincide with the abundance of organic carbon (OC). especially the OC to EC ratio. perhaps due to the enhancement by coating with organic aerosol (especially secondary organic aerosol. SOA) or the artifacts resulting from the redistribution of liquid-like organic particles during the filter-based absorption measurements. Using a converting approach that accounts for the discrepancy caused by measurements methods of both light absorption and EC concentration. previously published MAE values were converted to the equivalent-MAE. which is the estimated value if using the same measurement methods as used in this study. The equivalent-MAE was found to be much lower in the regions heavily impacted by biomass burning (e.g.. below 2.7 m2 g−1 for two Indian cities). Results from source samples (including diesel exhaust samples and biomass smoke samples) also demonstrated that emissions from biomass burning would decrease the MAE of EC. Moreover. optical properties of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in Beijing were presented. Light absorption by WSOC exhibited strong wavelength (λ) dependence such that absorption varied approximately as λ−7. which was characteristic of the brown carbon spectra.

Starting from Rio 1992 Summit and 1997 Kyoto Negotiations. policy-makers have been trying to find solutions regarding climate change issue. Governments can reduce green house gas emissions by advocacy. by regulation and by the application of economic instruments. It is argued that economic instruments have a number of benefits compared with other measures. Economic theory suggests that. in general. markets provide the best means of allocating an economy’s resources. Therefore. market-based economic instruments will be key policy tools for achieving environmental improvements. They can provide incentives for behaviour that protects or improves the environment. and deter actions that are damaging to the environment. Economic instruments can include taxes. charges. tradable permit schemes. subsidies or market barrier reductions. or deposit/refund schemes.

In the process. sustainable development as an offspring of the post-war era and the succeeding green economy have brought a new dimension to the notion of development. The order of green economy. which could be described as an idea of endowing the basic concepts such as economic growth. industrial production. consumption. prosperity and enrichment with a brand new meaning. holds that a worldwide income growth could be achieved via efficient use of renewable resources. At the same time. this new order suggests that public resources should be used for the welfare of humans and natural environment. This new discourse of green economy also suggests that new areas of employment called green jobs will emerge. As distinct from the long discussed endeavors in protecting nature and fighting against environmental pollution. the discourse of a new order as a counter action against industrialization and development is an extension of the ecological world view. which is itself an anti-thesis of the mechanical world view.

In the arid ecosystem of Central Asia. for instance. the Aral Sea has been subjected to an unprecedented degree of negative anthropogenic impacts. The atmospheric concentration of CO2 emissions is rising as the result of a variety of human activities. of which the burning of fossil fuels is the most important. Since early 1990s. taking action in order to control global warming has been on the world’s agenda. The design of effective and comprehensive policies to control climate change requires an understanding of the rules played by the different factors affecting CO2 production. This study tries to analyze the sources of changes in energy-related CO2 emissions for five Central Asian countries for 1992-2001 periods. For this purpose. we use a decomposition technique. which separates out the effects of changes in population. energy intensity of output. economic growth. primary energy use in final energy consumption and the carbon intensity of fossil fuel combustion. Data shows that CO2 emissions were reduced quite substantially in Tajikistan. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan since 1992. Our results suggest that main decrease in CO2 emissions in these countries is due to a serious economic contraction after the collapse of Soviet Union. Other factors contributing to this result are improvements in energy intensities and decline in energy related activities in general. Even though. other two Central Asian countries. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. also experienced similar economic contraction for the same period. their CO2 emissions have increased.

However. PBA provides an incomplete picture of driving forces behind these emission changes and impact of global trade on emissions. simply by neglecting the environmental impacts of consumption. To remedy this problem. several studies propose to consider national emissions calculated by consumption-based accounting (CBA) systems in greenhouse gas (GHG) assessments for progress and comparisons among the countries. In this article. we question the relevance of PBA’s dominance. To this end. we. firstly. try to assess and compare PBA with CBA adopted in greenhouse gas emissions accounting systems in climate change debates on several issues and to discuss the policy implications of the choice of approach.

Robinson,2020,Sedat Alatas,20,Review of Economic Perspectives,3,403-405,,Liberty has two important components: the state and society. It is. however. neither granted by just the state nor just the society. It rather emerges and flourishes only when both of them coexist and balance each other out. In The Narrow Corridor: States. Societies. and the Fate of Liberty. Acemoglu and Robinson discuss this state-society relationship and its importance to achieving liberty. To this end. they provide a comprehensive framework to address the questions of where liberty comes from. why only some societies are able to achieve liberty. while others are not. and what the possible outcomes of liberty are especially in terms of prosperity. The main argument of the authors is that both state and society should be strong and run together as the evolution of the statesociety relationship over time is directly connected to the emergence of liberty. and an imbalance between them is detrimental to it. A strong state is required to resolve conflicts by enforcing laws. guarantee the rights of its citizens. and provide public services. A strong and vigilant society. in turn. acts collectively. participates in politics. and controls the state to promote liberty. For that purpose. they build a new theory about liberty and support their ideas by providing examples from world history. including China in the 1950s. the Nazi regime in Germany. recent conflicts in the Middle East. statebuilding efforts of Athenians and Americans. and experiences of many Latin American countries.The theory proposed by the authors relies on three different types of states: the Despotic.

We find that international tourist arrivals into Turkey alongside income. squared income and energy consumption. cointegrate with CO2 emissions. Tourist arrivals. growth. and energy consumption exert a positive and significant impact on CO2 emissions in the long-run.

To do this. second generation econometric methods have been employed to panel data including panel unit root tests. panel cointegration tests. and panel long-run models. Panel unit root tests suggest that oil prices plus selected macroeconomic aggregates in OECD countries are non-stationary at levels but become stationary at first differences in the existence of multiple structural breaks. Five structural break points have successfully been investigated in the series of this study during panel unit root and panel cointegration tests. Durbin–H panel co-integration tests confirm that there is a long-term relationship between oil prices and those macroeconomic aggregates.

1098729,Internet shopping behavior of Turkish customers: comparison of two competing models,2012,Aykut Hamit Turan,7,Journal of theoretical and applied electronic commerce research,1,77-93,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this Internet age. information technologies are increasingly penetrating our daily lives. Internet Shopping has become a daily activity for most of us. However. there are very limited studies to investigate cognitive factors influencing individuals’ online shopping behavior in a developing country context. In this study. two widely used socio-psychology based theories. the extended version of Technology Acceptance Model (e-TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). have been tested in Internet shopping context and the results are compared for a Turkish sample. The results have revealed significant theoretical relationships for all of the proposed paths in both theories. yet the Theory of Planned Behavior presented better fit indices and proven to be a more detailed explanatory framework.,True,Eab6J5kAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,41,https://www.mdpi.com/0718-1876/7/1/7,391077905670009365,/scholar?cites=391077905670009365,,https://www.mdpi.com/0718-1876/7/1/7/pdf,0,0,0

Estimates of aggregated impacts necessarily make assumptions on the relative importance of sectors. countries and periods; we propose to make these assumption explicit. We introduce a Gini coefficient for climate change impacts. which shows the distribution of impacts is very skewed in the near future and will deteriorate for more than a century before becoming more egalitarian.

One way of dealing with carbon leakage and competitiveness is the imposition of border adjustment measures for competing imports. for example in the form of the obligation to importers of goods to purchase and surrender emissions allowances to the authorities when importing. In this paper. we explore some implications of border adjustment measures in the EU ETS. for sectors that might be subject to carbon leakage. We examine the implications of two variants of these measures on the competitiveness of these sectors and on the global environment with the help of a multi-sector. multi-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the global economy.

The government accepted the RIVM analysis and consequently ClUTent Dutch environmental policy aims at large reduction of pollutants. Another conclusion of the RIVM study was that such high reduction goals would not be easy to achieve by technological means alone. and that thus structural changes would be required. These changes could eventually lead to sustainable development. which now forms the major focus of Dutch government national environmental policy. This being so. the Dutch government requested that RIVM in subsequent issues of Concern for Tomorrow should investigate the options for sustainable development.,True,F-5hROIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,231,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9H9WAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP6&dq=info:LypNDt9MClAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MINt5LrmMl&sig=WINHhHoLWfh7e0SR6FdphijCDYA,5767506793702697519,/scholar?cites=5767506793702697519,,,0,0,0

We find the cost estimates of the studies to be sensitive to the stringency of the stabilisation target. the assumed emissions baseline. the way in which the time profile of emissions is determined in the model. the choice of control variable (CO2 only versus multigas). the number of regions and energy sources in the model and. to a lesser degree. the scientific “forum” in which the study was developed. We find that marginal abatement costs of the stringent long-term targets that are currently considered by the European Commission are still very uncertain but might exceed the costs that have been suggested by recent policy assessments.,True,F-5hROIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,190,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508007295,8328971111699353823,/scholar?cites=8328971111699353823,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/50102/1/576823651.pdf,0,0,0
1098751,Trade liberalization and carbon leakage,2003,Onno Kuik and Reyer Gerlagh,24,The Energy Journal,3,,International Association for Energy Economics,This paper examines the effect of trade liberalization on carbon leakage. We present quantitative estimates of carbon leakage under the Kyoto Protocol with and without freer trade by means of import tariff reductions agreed to in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. We find that under a plausible range of assumptions. the implementation of these import tariff reductions increases the overall rate of leakage. suggesting that previous studies may structurally have underestimated the rate of carbon leakage under the Kyoto Protocol. But we also find that the costs of abating the trade-induced leakage are modest relative to the welfare gains of freer trade. Analysis of the trade-induced carbon leakage shows large differences between leakage caused by reductions of import tariffs on energy goods and by reductions of import tariffs on non-energy goods. It also shows large differences in emission responses among developing country regions.,True,F-5hROIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,162,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/1414,6640271362494473203,/scholar?cites=6640271362494473203,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=1414,0,0,0

Despite the evident policy demand for this combined transfer and “scaling up” of values. an approach to value transfer that addresses the challenges inherent in assessing ecosystem changes at a national or regional level is not available. This paper proposes a methodology for scaling up ecosystem service values to estimate the welfare effects of ecosystem change at this larger geographical scale. The methodology is illustrated by applying it to value the impact of climate change on European wetlands for the period 2000–2050.

We first develop and analyse two simple competing models for carbon leakage. The first model represents the pollution haven hypothesis. It focuses on the international competition between firms that produce energy-intensive goods. The second model highlights the role of a globally integrated carbon-energy market. We calculate formulas for the leakage rates in both models and. through meta-analysis. show that the second model captures best the major mechanisms reported in the CGE literature on carbon leakage. We extend this model with endogenous energy-saving technology and international technology spillovers. This feature is shown to decrease carbon leakage. We build-in the endogenous energy-saving technology in a large CGE model and verify that the results from the formal model carry over. Carbon leakage becomes negative for moderate levels of international technology spillover.,True,F-5hROIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,140,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=979915,14361783602303656283,/scholar?cites=14361783602303656283,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/9328/files/wp070033.pdf,0,0,0

At national as well as supranational levels. proposals for introduction of emissions trading schemes have been made. This paper assesses alternative emissions trading schemes at domestic level: (1) schemes where the total level of emissions is fixed (absolute cap-and-trade). (2) schemes where the allowable level of emissions per firm is related to some firm-specific indicator (relative cap-and-trade). and (3) mixed schemes which combine elements of the above alternatives. We present a quantitative assessment of these alternatives for climate change policy in the Netherlands.

From a global warming point of view. these secondary effects or 'spillovers' of climate policy may be either negative or positive. Negative spillovers refer particularly to the incidence of carbon leakage. i.e. an increase in CO2 emissions in non-abating countries due to the implementation of climate policy in Annex I countries. Positive spillovers. on the other hand. refer especially to the inducement of carbon-saving technological innovations and the diffusion of these innovations. both at home and abroad.The primary objective of the present report is to provide a summary assessment of the analytical and empirical knowledge on the potential incidence of spillovers due to climate policy in Annex I countries of the Kyoto protocol.

It is well known that a unilateral CO2 abatement policy in one region may cause CO2 emissions to increase in non-abating regions because of the relocation of CO2-intensive firms and because of energy market effects. If. however. the CO2 mitigation policy induces energy-saving technological innovation in the home region and this innovation can freely spill-over to energy users abroad. carbon leakage may be offset by induced efficiency gains in foreign firms. In this paper we develop a simple mathematical model of carbon leakage and technological spillovers and perform numerical simulations with an adjusted CGE model to illustrate the potential importance of international technology spillovers.

It was introduced in 1995 and was primarily aimed at bridging the gap between the costs of landfilling and incineration. As such. the choice for this instrument and the rates that are applied in The Netherlands are mainly based on political and administrative considerations and decisions. The present study aims at investigating the effectiveness of the landfill tax as a waste policy instrument. in terms of market impact. costs and benefits. including external environmental costs and benefits. and to compare it with other (command-and-control type) instruments. The results should contribute to the European debate on landfill taxation. The focus is on household waste and comparable waste from the service sector (offices. shops etc.). as these are the waste streams to which EU policy pays much attention and about which much information is available. The study addresses three central questions: (1) To what extent is the Dutch landfill tax providing the right incentives to the appropriate market parties. and is the waste market functioning sufficiently in order to achieve the policy objectives by means of market incentives?; (2) To what extent does the landfill tax cover the external costs of landfilling?; (3) Is the landfill tax the least expensive option to minimize landfilling. or are there other ('command-and-control type') instruments that are more cost-effective?

1098770,Indicators for social and economic coping capacity—moving toward a working definition of adaptive capacity,2002,Gary Yohe and Richard SJ Tol,12,Global environmental change,1,25-40,Pergamon,This paper offers a practically motivated method for evaluating systems’ abilities to handle external stress. The method is designed to assess the potential contributions of various adaptation options to improving systems’ coping capacities by focusing attention directly on the underlying determinants of adaptive capacity. The method should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate diverse applications whose contexts are location specific and path dependent without imposing the straightjacket constraints of a “one size fits all” cookbook approach. Nonetheless. the method should produce unitless indicators that can be employed to judge the relative vulnerabilities of diverse systems to multiple stresses and to their potential interactions. An artificial application is employed to describe the development of the method and to illustrate how it might be applied. Some empirical evidence is offered to underscore the significance …,True,AjZwhtwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1505,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378001000267,8780976646684378504,/scholar?cites=8780976646684378504,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.175.5861&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In addition. in the case of quasi-irreversible investments with a long lifetime (e.g. infrastructure investments. development of coastal zones). precautionary adjustments may be called for to increase the robustness of structures. or to increase the rate of depreciation to allow for earlier replacement.

Such a level should be achieved with a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”(UNEP/WMO. 1992).The ultimate goal for stabilizing GHG concentrations is to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The question of what is dangerous is one that the authors of this chapter cannot answer. Danger is a function of the degree to which effects are negative and the degree to which those effects are unacceptable. The latter is a value judgment.

Although there is substantial scope for economizing on the consumption of water without affecting its service level. the main response to water scarcity has been to increase the supply. To a large extent. this is done by transporting water from places where it is abundant to places where it is scarce.

Historically. the most common approach to integrated assessment has been the attempt by individual researchers or research teams to integrate the information available from the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished via informed qualitative linkages. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of component models based on mathematical representations of information from the various contributing disciplines. This approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the assumptions input to the various components of the models. but may tend to constrain the type of information that can be used to what is explicitly represented in the model. IAMs can be divided into two broad classes: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. Policy optimization models optimize key policy control variables such as carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes. given formulated policy goals (eg. maximizing welfare or minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concentration target).

This static approach ignores the dynamic effects through which climate change may affect economic growth and hence future welfare. In this paper we take a closer look at these dynamic effects. in particular saving and capital accumulation. With a constant savings rate. a lower output due to climate change will lead to a proportionate reduction in investment which in turn will depress future production (capital accumulation effect) and. in almost all cases. future consumption per capita. If the savings rate is endogenous. forward looking agents would change their savings behavior to accommodate the impact of future climate change.

1098791,Environmental external costs of transport,2013,Peter Bickel and Rainer Friedrich,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Transport is very important for the economy and our welfare. However. transport also causes a lot of problems. including air pollution. Such problems should be taken into account. when making decisions. A prerequisite for doing so is. that the impacts are known. quantitatively measured and allocated to the different activities in transport. Furthermore. they should be transformed into monetary units to be used as a basis for cost-benefit analyses or as an aid for setting taxes and charges. that reflect the external costs. This book describes a methodology for calculating impacts of transport activities and external costs caused by air pollution and presents numerous applications of this methodology for different transport technologies. locations and policy case studies. The approach has been developed and results have been calculated within the research project'ExternE Core/Transport'. financed to a large extent by the European Commission.

About 70% of all water is used for agriculture. and agricultural products are traded internationally. A full understanding of water use is impossible without understanding the international market for food and related products. such as textiles. The water embedded in commodities is called virtual water. Based on a general equilibrium model. we offer a method for investigating the role of water resources and water scarcity in the context of international trade. We run five alternative scenarios. analyzing the effects of water scarcity due to reduced availability of groundwater. This can be a consequence of physical constraints. and of policies curbing water demand. Four scenarios are based on a “market solution”. where water owners can capitalize their water rent or taxes are recycled.

İslam dini Müslümanların alışveriş yapmalarını teşvik etmiş. faizli olarak borç alıp vermeyi ise yasaklamıştır. Bu ve bunun gibi yasaklar fon ihtiyacı duyan ya da elindeki fazla fonu değerlendirmek isteyen Müslümanları İslam diniyle çelişmeyen ticarete dayalı farklı yöntemler bulmaya itmiştir. Bunlardan en eski ve en yaygın olanı murabaha olarak adlandırılan maliyet artı kâr satışı yöntemidir. Bu yönteme göre bir kişi satın aldığı bir miktar malı. satın aldığı bedel üzerine anlaşılan bir tutarda kâr ilave ederek satmaktadır. Bu yöntem normal bir satış yöntemi gibi görünse de kâr ilavesinin taraflar arasında serbestçe kararlaştırılması yönünden farklılık göstermektedir. Günümüzde Türkiye’de İslami bankacılık alanında faaliyet gösteren katılım bankaları fon kullandırma işlemlerinde en çok bu yöntemi kullanmaktadır. Nitekim dünyada İslami bankacılık hizmet ve ürünleri hızla büyürken. Türkiye’nin de faizsiz bankacılık sektöründe gelişmekte olan bir ülke olduğu düşünüldüğünde.

1098852,Türkiye'de Cari İşlemler Açığı Sorunu ve Enerji Politikaları-Teorik ve Güncel Bilgiler,2018,Oktay Kızılkaya and Emrah Sofuoğlu,,,,,Nobel Akademik Yayıncılık Eğitim Danışmanlık Tic. Ltd. Şti.,Cari işlemler dengesi ülkelerin ekonomik performans göstergeleri arasında sayılan bir konu olması nedeniyle iktisat literatüründe çok fazla tartışılmaktadır. Yüksek miktarda ve sürekli artış halinde olan cari açıklar ekonomiler için ciddi sorunlar doğurabilmektedir. Cari açık sorunu 1980’li yıllara kadar genellikle gelişmekte olan ülkelerin gündeminde olan bir konu iken 1980 sonrasında özellikle liberalizasyon hareketleri ile beraber artık dünya ülkelerinin bir sorunu olmaya başlamıştır. Türkiye ekonomisi için cari işlemler dengesi. özellikle son yıllarda cari açık oranın artmasıyla beraber en çok konuşulan ekonomik olaylar arasında yerini almıştır. Son yıllarda Türkiye’de enerji açığı ile cari açık arasındaki ilişki “ekonomik büyüme→ enerji talebi→ enerji açığı→ dış ticaret açığı→ cari açık” biçiminde ortaya çıkmıştır. Cari açığın finansmanı ise daha çok dış tasarruflarla sağlanmakta ve bu durum Türkiye’nin dış yükümlülüklerini artırmaktadır. Bir ülkenin düşük karbonlu bir ekonomiye geçmesi durumunda o ülkede: yenilenebilir enerji kaynaklarının kullanımında ve enerji verimliliğinde artış. teknolojik gelişme anlamında pozitif bir dönüşüm ve ülke vatandaşlarının refahlarında artış gibi gelişmelerin görülmesi muhtemeldir. Unutulmamalıdır ki. düşük karbonlu bir ekonomiye geçiş demek sürdürülebilir bir kalkınmanın anahtarını cebine koymak demektir. Almanya. Güney Kore. Japonya gibi ülkeler de enerjide dışa bağımlı. dolayısıyla enerji ithalatı yüksek ülkelerdir. Ancak bu ülkeler. katma değeri yüksek ürünler üretmeyi başarabilmiştir. Teknolojiye yaptıkları yatırım sayesine yüksek teknolojili ürün ihracatı yapmaktadırlar. Dolayısıyla birim başına ihracat değeri …,True,qDGxnFMAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-9LTDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=info:EUfwvOMFupkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=eVyzoeXIMq&sig=laGTCdSdA78wRThDb7B5RigZcTk,11077172709156734737,/scholar?cites=11077172709156734737,,,0,0,0
1098853,Pollution haven hypothesis and climate change: analysis for newly industrialized countries,2017,Emrah SOFUOĞLU,,Energy and Sustainability: Theoretical and Applied Perspectives,,129,,As a notion of sustainable development has started to be debated in all around the world since 1980's. Briefly. this notion means that usage of today’s resources efficiently without detriment to next generations’ resources. In this sense. countries make environmental adjustments. enhance the investment in renewable energy. trying to increase the energy efficiency and decrease the carbon density. Thus. these countries are trying to supply their energy with clean. green and sustainable resources instead of the fossil fuel-based economy in the context of sustainable development. In spite of the fact that developed countries come a long way with this transition. developing countries have been slow due to the economic issues arising from the high costs.Technological developments have a strong effect of reducing energy consumption which decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emission in the atmosphere per output. In this regard. multinational companies directly penetratein the developing countries’ markets by way of foreign capital investments and these companies also lead to economic. technological and governmental changes in the respective developing countries. However. these changes have been mostly accepted positively. from time to time even if they have been seen negatively before.

Verimlilikteki artışın ise sürekli kılınması. ülkelere daha çok üretim yapabilme. üretim süresini kısalması. daha kaliteli ve daha ucuza mal ve hizmet üretebilme avantajı sağlamaktadır. Bu açıdan. ülke ekonomileri için iş gücü verimliliğinin artırılmasında uygulanacak politikalar önemli hale gelmektedir. İş gücü verimliliğini. ev sahibi ülkeye transfer etmiş oldukları teknoloji unsurlarından dolayı doğrudan yabancı yatırımların etkilediği bilinmektedir. Bu bağlamda çalışmanın amacı. Türkiye ekonomisinde son yıllarda artan doğrudan yabancı yatırımların iş gücü verimliliği üzerindeki etkisini ampirik olarak analiz etmektir. Bu kapsamda 1971-2015 yılları arasında Türkiye’de DYY’nin iş gücü verimliliği üzerindeki etkisi ampirik olarak analiz edilmiştir. Çalışmada birim kök testlerinden sonra. eşbütünleşme ilişkisinin test edilmesinde Johansen (1988; 1991) yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Uzun dönem katsayıları ise Dinamik En Küçük Kareler yöntemi (DOLS) yöntemi ile tahmin edilmiştir. Eşbütünleşme test sonuçları; iş-gücü verimliliği. DYY. dışa açıklık. küreselleşme ve sermaye bikrimi arasında uzun dönemli bir denge ilişkisinin varlığını işaret etmektedir. Uzun dönem katsayı tahmin sonuçları ise. DYY’nin iş gücü verimliliği üzerinde pozitif ve istatistiki olarak anlamlı bir etkiye sahip olduğunu göstermektedir. Nedensellik test sonuçları iş-gücü verimliliği ve DYY arasındaki ilişkinin çift yönlü olduğunu ortaya koymaktadır.

It identifies lessons for policymakers seeking to engage civil society and makes recommendations on how academics can co-operate more effectively with civil society. Insights are drawn from recent studies on stakeholder involvement in the international political process and a series of surveys and semi-structured interviews. The authors identify four challenges. Effort should: be planned more strategically; link sustainable consumption to current priorities; ensure better links between global and local; and NGOs have to better link to other interest groups.,True,alUFr9EAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,25,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJISD.2007.016936,9749806864557615133,/scholar?cites=9749806864557615133,,https://www.hb.fh-muenster.de/opus4/files/10640/Church-Lorek_2007.pdf,0,0,0

The Theory of Planned Behaviour TPB and Social Practice Theory SPT offer different views on consumer behaviour. and on ways to change it. This paper briefly describes the challenges. discusses the applicability of both theories and their meaningfulness for policy recommendations.We suggest an approach combining results of both bodies of theory. complemented by ideas from political economy. to substantiate the Prism of Sustainable Consumption we introduce as a heuristic sufficiency policy tool. It is useful to identify affordability criteria for change in each dimension. as the basis for deriving suggestions for effective policy interventions. We conclude that (i) effective interventions are possible.

1099449,The changing contribution of unpaid work to the total standard of living in sustainable development scenarios,2002,Joachim H Spangenberg,5,International Journal of Sustainable Development,4,461-475,Inderscience Publishers,"In Europe since the 1950s. average working hours have declined steadily and the time available for unpaid work has increased. Nonetheless. its contribution to the total standard of living has not been taken into account so far. although the majority of working hours in Germany and Europe is in unpaid work. The qualitative integration of unpaid work in the new framework concept of ""mixed work"" is introduced as an alternative more appropriate for the emerging new patterns of working life than the traditional concept of lifelong. full-time ""normal work"".

Conservation attitudes and behaviors largely depend on experiences with nature. and this “extinction of experience” (EOE) is a threat to biodiversity conservation. In this paper. we propose that citizen science. an increasingly popular way to integrate public outreach with data collection. can potentially mitigate EOE. Our review of the literature on volunteers’ motivations and/or outcomes indicates that nature‐based citizen science (NBCS) fosters cognitive and emotional aspects of experiences in nature.

Ltd,The literature on the costs of climate change often draws a link between climatic “tipping points” and large economic shocks. frequently called “catastrophes.” The phrase “tipping points” in this context can be misleading. In popular and social scientific discourse. “tipping points” involve abrupt state changes. For some climatic “tipping points.” the commitment to a state change may occur abruptly. but the change itself may be rate‐limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally. the connection between climatic “tipping points” and economic losses is tenuous. although emerging empirical and process‐model‐based tools provide pathways for investigating it.

National level surveys are a useful tool for furthering this understanding but present multiple challenges. two of which are addressed in this paper. The first challenge is that the U.S. public’s limited knowledge of climate change issues requires that information is provided in the survey. and that the content of this information is thought to be critical in eliciting accurate responses. Second. the use of national surveys may mask regional and state differences that result from the distribution of predicted climate change impacts and varying social contexts.

1099511,Challenging climate change: The denial countermovement,2015,Riley E Dunlap and Aaron M McCright,,,,,Oxford University Press,Shortly after James Hansen’s June 1988 Senate testimony placed anthropogenic global warming on the public agenda in the United States. organized efforts to deny the reality and significance of the phenomenon began. reflected by formation the following year of the Global Climate Coalition (an industry-led front group formed to call global warming into question). These efforts to deny global warming—and human-caused climate change more generally1—have continued over the ensuing quarter-century. involving an ever-growing array of actors. and often cresting when domestic or international action (eg. the 1997 Kyoto Protocol) aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions seems imminent. Organized denial reached an unprecedented level in 2009 when the newly elected Obama administration and a Democratic-controlled Congress increased the likelihood of US action to reduce GHG emissions and the December 2009 Copenhagen Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was approaching. The efforts have continued relatively unabated since then. cresting whenever climate change policymaking becomes salient on the US or international agendas.The fruits of this campaign are readily apparent in the US Congress. where Republican majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives are attempting to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from taking steps to control GHG emissions and doing their best to cut funding for federal programs dealing with climate change.

While it originated in the US. climate change denial has spread gradually to a range of nations. creating something of an international movement. Initially funded primarily by the fossil fuels industry (Gelbspan 1997). over time conservative foundations and thinktanks have become major supporters and promoters of climate change denial. Conservative think-tanks in particular have facilitated and promoted the efforts of a small number of ‘contrarian’scientists in an effort to provide the forces of denial with the guise of scientific credibility. magnifying the visibility and impact of the contrarians’ views (McCright and Dunlap 2000. 2003). The activities of the contrarians have supplied vital ammunition for attacking mainstream climate science. symbolised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). and thus the scientific underpinnings of calls for policy-making to deal with climate change (Begley 2007). This chapter begins with a brief examination of the historical roots of climate change denial starting with the technologically optimistic worldview. prevalent in Western societies. that is being challenged by environmentalism (Douglas 2007).

Reflexive modernization theory highlights an emerging tension between those who direct attention to the negative consequences of industrial capitalism such as climate change (e.g.. the scientific community and environmental organizations) and those who defend the economic system against such critiques (e.g.. the conservative movement). Political divisions in the American public increasingly map onto these societal divisions between critics and defenders of the industrial capitalist order—especially for the issue of climate change.

In a connected world. goods and services consumed in one country are often produced in other countries and exchanged via international trade. Thus. local consumption is increasingly met by global supply chains oftentimes involving large geographical distances and leading to global environmental change. In this study. we connect local consumption to global land use through tracking global commodity and value chains via international trade flows. Using a global multiregional input–output model with sectoral detail allows for the accounting of land use attributed to “unusual” sectors – from a land use perspective – including services. machinery and equipment. and construction.

1099533,Assessing regional and global water footprints for the UK,2010,Yang Yu and Klaus Hubacek and Kuishuang Feng and Dabo Guan,69,Ecological Economics,5,1140-1147,Elsevier,The concept of the water footprint has been recently introduced as an important indicator for human-induced water consumption. The water footprint is defined as the total volume of water used during production and consumption of goods and services as well as direct water consumption by humans. Water is not only consumed directly but also indirectly in production processes. Therefore. calculating the water footprint enables us to quantify total water consumed along the whole global supply chain. In this paper. we develop a regional input–output (IO) model extended by water consumption coefficients to quantify the respective domestic water footprint for different consumption categories for the South-East and North-East of England and the UK. i.e. the water consumed directly and indirectly along the regional supply chain.

This decline has been widely attributed to a shift from the use of coal to natural gas in US electricity production. However. the factors driving the decline have not been quantitatively evaluated; the role of natural gas in the decline therefore remains speculative. Here we analyse the factors affecting US emissions from 1997 to 2013. Before 2007. rising emissions were primarily driven by economic growth. After 2007. decreasing emissions were largely a result of economic recession with changes in fuel mix (for example. substitution of natural gas for coal) playing a comparatively minor role. Energy–climate policies may. therefore. be necessary to lock-in the recent emissions reductions and drive further decarbonization of the energy system as the US economy recovers and grows.,True,BPgmG-IAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,233,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8714,3444331978104878246,/scholar?cites=3444331978104878246,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8714,0,0,0

The extent of urban production and urban lifestyles has become one of the main drivers for China's CO2 emissions. To analyze drivers of CO2 emissions we use a consumption-based accounting approach that allocates all emissions along the production chain to the product and place of final consumption. whereas a production-based approach would allocate all emissions to the place of origin. In this study. we focus on the spatial distribution of production activities leading to CO2 emissions across China as a consequence of final consumption in four Chinese mega cities: Beijing.

This study investigates the distributional effects of climate change taxes on households belonging to different income and lifestyle groups; and it compares the effects of a CO2 tax with a multiple GHG tax in the UK in terms of cost efficiency and distributional effects.Results show that a multi GHG tax is more efficient than a CO2 tax due to lower marginal abatement costs. and that both taxes are regressive. with lower income households paying a relatively larger share of their income for the taxes than higher income households. A shift from a CO2 tax to a GHG tax will reduce and shift the tax burden between consumption categories such as from energy-intensive products to food products.

However. they are often unsure of how or where to begin the publishing process. and do not always feel comfortable asking for help from their faculty advisors or fellow students. Scholars. including librarians. have attempted to address these concerns by developing tools and services to meet the needs of future faculty. In recent years. university presses and research libraries have recognized their shared mission in furthering scholarship. with libraries themselves offering publishing education and expertise. PROJECT OVERVIEW During the 2012-2013 academic year. subject librarians and publishing professionals at the University of Michigan Library crafted a program to address students’ questions and concerns about the publishing lifecycle. This ongoing initiative includes a multi-semester workshop series developed in concert with faculty from departments throughout campus. as well as a supplementary online toolkit that takes into account the rapidly evolving nature of scholarly communication. LESSONS LEARNED Major takeaways from this program include: the value of student assessment in shaping publishing workshops; awareness of the discrepancies of registration numbers and actual attendance. highlighting the potential for enhanced promotion techniques; the importance of university press and faculty insight; and the benefits of collaboration among librarians. publishing professionals. and faculty members.

This paper reports on a research project that aimed to do just that: use two discrete active learning techniques to teach information literacy concepts. particularly those situated in the ACRL Frame.“Authority is Constructed and Contextual.” Twenty-two sections of a public speaking course were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. A play technique was used with one sample of students. a website evaluation activity was used with another. and a control group received no library instruction. Both active learning techniques led to gains in information literacy scores that were significantly higher than those of the control group.

Both libraries field a significant number of in-person reference transactions over the course of a year. with the graduate library reporting 18.733 transactions for the 2009 calendar year. and the undergraduate library reporting 8.455 transactions for the same time period. 2 Although these numbers indicate that patrons are in fact approaching a reference desk. what they do not describe is who patrons are choosing to initiate contact with when approaching the desk. and if their choices differ for various patron groups. Library literature has attempted to address the question of why patrons choose to approach. or not approach. the reference desk. Many factors have been identified as possibly playing a role in why people approach the desk. such as nonverbal behaviors or perceived librarian availability. These studies tend to focus on the extent to which librarians facilitate an environment of approachability. Other studies have emphasized reasons why patrons might not approach the reference desk. such as feelings of library anxiety. low self efficacy. or wishing to not interrupt a librarian. However. what has been less emphasized in the library and information literature is how social factors might influence whom a patron will approach at the reference desk. and specifically. if there are associations between a patron’s initiation of approach and the gender of librarians.

Environmentalists and industrialists alike have promoted the benefits of reuse as a means toward improved efficiency and reduced resource pressure. Some have called for a new ‘culture of reuse’(Botsman and Rogers 2010; Stokes et al. 2014). It is in this context that we explore repair. resale. and reuse as practices with deep historical precedent and contemporary continuity. Are there lessons to be learned from places that are already home to circular economies and strong cultures of reuse? And are there dangers inherent in a stronger. more formalized reuse sector? This paper draws on an historical and ethnographic analysis of vibrant reuse practices in the rural northeastern state of Maine. While there is a popular tendency to explain Maine’s persistent reuse practices as a response to economic and geographic marginality. our empirical observations suggest that these explanations do not adequately capture the complexity of reuse markets. discount the power of human agency and sense of place. and preclude important lessons for reuse policy in other contexts.

When food is landfilled instead of eaten. the economic and natural resources used to produce and transport that food are also wasted. At the same time. however. food insecurity remains a pressing issue both in the United States and within the state of Maine. This paper explores efforts to reduce food waste and address food insecurity in Maine’s K–12 school system. with an emphasis on food redistribution. Research indicates that schools produce substantial amounts of food waste. but little is known about strategies that schools employ to address food waste. either through formal policy or grassroots efforts. Based on an analysis of school board waste policies and interviews with school officials in Maine. this study suggests that the adoption of specific types of practices to reduce food waste is influenced by multiple factors.,True,5jfIxU4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,6,https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/mpr/vol26/iss1/7/,6191139665540342608,/scholar?cites=6191139665540342608,,https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1760&context=mpr,0,0,0
1099582,Rummaging through the Attic of New England,2019,Brieanne Berry and Jennifer Bonnet and Cindy Isenhour,2,Worldwide Waste: Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies,1,,,The concept of the circular economy has taken off. gaining momentum along with concerns about resource depletion. waste. and the impending ‘end of cheap nature’(Moore 2014). Environmentalists and industrialists alike have promoted the benefits of reuse as a means toward improved efficiency and reduced resource pressure. Some have called for a new ‘culture of reuse’(Botsman and Rogers 2010; Stokes et al. 2014). It is in this context that we explore repair. resale. and reuse as practices with deep historical precedent and contemporary continuity. Are there lessons to be learned from places that are already home to circular economies and strong cultures of reuse? And are there dangers inherent in a stronger. more formalized reuse sector? This paper draws on an historical and ethnographic analysis of vibrant reuse practices in the rural northeastern state of Maine. While there is a popular tendency to explain Maine’s persistent reuse practices as a response to economic and geographic marginality. our empirical observations suggest that these explanations do not adequately capture the complexity of reuse markets. discount the power of human agency and sense of place. and preclude important lessons for reuse policy in other contexts. Insights from Maine suggest that any effort to promote reuse would benefit from looking beyond purely economic rationales to attend to matters of place. sociality. and market relationality.,True,5jfIxU4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,3,https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/ant_studentpub/3/,9307253856507412214,/scholar?cites=9307253856507412214,,https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=ant_studentpub,0,0,0

Inc.,This article explores the production of wealth through distributive labor in Maine's secondhand economy. While reuse is often associated with economic disadvantage. our research complicates that perspective. The labor required to reclaim. repair. redistribute. and reuse secondhand goods provides much more than a means of living in places left behind by international capitalism. but the value generated by this work is persistently discounted by dominant economic logics. On the basis of semistructured interviews. participant observation. and statewide surveys with reuse market participants in Maine. we find that the relational value of reuse. produced through caring. flexible. distributive labor. is especially significant. We argue that paying attention to the practices. politics. and value of distribution is critical for understanding wealth in communities perceived to have been left behind by global capitalist systems …,True,5jfIxU4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sea2.12176,1082072231583284401,/scholar?cites=1082072231583284401,,https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/sea2.12176,0,0,0

Our essay critically examines the political and economic relationships between urban and rural geographies in the context of secondhand economies.

This article provides a macro survey of how market-based instruments for forest conservation have expanded in Vietnam. particularly in relation to a long dominant state sector. Yet an assessment of Vietnam’s PES pilot projects indicates that they do not follow predicted orthodox “neoliberalization of nature” approaches in their use of market instruments. particularly in regards to privatization. retreat of the state. and capitalization of commodities.

This unrest was long-standing and had been caused by high rates of Vietnamese migration to historically minority areas. loss of traditional lands and rampant deforestation. and generally poor development policies directed at non-Vietnamese ethnic groups. However. in normally staid and security-tight Viet Nam. rural unrest such as this was shocking; Western reporters noted that this was the most serious protest to have taken place in Viet Nam since reunification in 1976 (UPI 2001). The SRV had up to that point often praised itself in official documents for the fact that there had been no prolonged conflict within the country fought on the basis of ethnicity. This is despite the fact that at least 13 percent of the population within the territory of Viet Nam is ethnically non-Vietnamese. As was proudly noted in a Ha Noi newspaper before the 2001 riots.“There has been no ethnic confrontation. no religious war. no ethnic conflict. And no elimination of one culture by another.” The newspaper attributed Viet Nam's success as a nation to the fact that “national history has been a long process of multiculturalism and multi-ethnicity”(Ama Trinh 2000: 3).

The state nationalization of all forest resources during socialist rule from 1954 to the opening of the economy in the 1980s contributed significantly to illegal logging. as any locally-used forest was considered to be national property. During this period. there was a generalized ‘free-for-all’ on the forests. contributing to a massive breakdown of local tenure rules and resource allocation. Despite the dissolution of many of the state-owned logging reserves and distribution of this land to local communities. which began in the late 1980s. deforestation has continued. During the 1990s. an export ban on raw logs from Vietnam was enacted to halt the continued deforestation. with generally ineffective results.

One project to reforest 5 million hectares has received hundreds of millions of US dollars for implementation.

The authors claim that focusing attention on the micro-politics of PES design and implementation fails to expose an underlying neoliberal governmentality. and therefore only reinforces neoliberal capitalism as both the problem and solution of ecological crises. In response. we argue that a focus on the actions of local actors is key to understanding how and why such governmentality fails or succeeds in performing as theorized.

But there is less understanding of how subnational policy and local projects are able to incorporate attention to adaptation; therefore. we use a case study in Vietnam to discuss how REDD+ projects and policies address both concerns of mitigation and adaptation together at subnational levels. Through stakeholder interviews. focus groups. and household surveys in three provinces of Vietnam with REDD+ activities. our research sought to understand if REDD+ policies and projects on the ground acknowledge that climate change is likely to impact forests and forest users; if this knowledge is built into REDD+ policy and activities; how households in forested areas subject to REDD+ policy are vulnerable to climate change; and how REDD+ activities can help or hinder needed adaptations. Our findings indicate that there continues to be a lack of coordination between mitigation and adaptation policies in Vietnam. particularly with regard to REDD+. Policies for forest-based climate mitigation at the national and subnational level. as well as site-based projects. have paid little attention to the adaptation needs of local communities. many of whom are already suffering from noticeable weather changes in their localities. and there is insufficient discussion of how REDD+ activities could facilitate increased resilience.

As a result. this small country has been the site of a concerted effort on the part of conservation organizations and international development agencies to improve environmental protection. In particular. the rise in deforestation beginning with the end of the Franco–Viet Nam war in 1945. through the American war from 1960 to 1975. and continuing after reunification of North and South in 1975. has been characterized as the most pressing environmental issue facing the country. One solution to this problem of deforestation has been to develop state-managed protected areas. These parks are. for the most part. designed with input from Western conservation organizations and development agencies (cf. Wege et al. 1999). Furthermore. on paper. the goals are to protect them according to Western conservation ideals. While older protected areas in Viet Nam were often demarcated on an ad hoc basis. and included a wide range of disturbed and less disturbed habitat without much thought to system-wide representation. new parks have been proposed on the basis of biodiversity protection and in areas ‘pristine’enough that they need enforcement against human encroach-,True,VHMrH60AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,14,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11515878365063388358&hl=en&oi=scholarr,11515878365063388358,/scholar?cites=11515878365063388358,,,0,0,0

By way of examining the different ways in which people become invested in the politics of value at the landfill. whether as part of expressions of gender and class or for personal enjoyment. different comportments toward materiality are revealed to have underlying social and moral implications.

The afterlife of waste materials and processes of waste management reveal the centrality of transient and discarded things for questions of materiality and ontology and marginal and polluting labor and environmental justice movements. as well as for critiques of the exploitation and deferred promises of modernity and imperial formations.

1099643,Toward a new theory of waste: from ‘matter out of place’to signs of life,2014,Joshua Ozias Reno,31,"Theory, Culture & Society",6,3-27,Sage Publications,This paper offers a counterpoint to the prevailing account of waste in the human sciences. This account identifies waste. firstly. as the anomalous product of arbitrary social categorizations. or ‘matter out of place’. and. secondly. as a distinctly human way of leaving behind and interpreting traces. or a mirror of culture. Together. these positions reflect a more or less constructivist and anthropocentric approach. Most commonly. waste is placed within a framework that privileges considerations of meaning over materiality and the threat of death over the perpetuity of life processes. For an alternative I turn to bio-semiotics and cross-species scholarship around the question of the animal. Specifically. the paper asks what theories of waste would look like if instead of taking ‘dirt’ as their starting point. they began with trans-species encounters with animal scat.

1099644,Waste away: working and living with a North American landfill,2016,Joshua Reno,,,,,Univ of California Press,Though we are the most wasteful people in the history of the world. very few of us know what becomes of our waste. In Waste Away. Joshua O. Reno reveals how North Americans have been shaped by their preferred means of disposal: sanitary landfill. Based on the author’s fieldwork as a common laborer at a large. transnational landfill on the outskirts of Detroit. the book argues that waste management helps our possessions and dwellings to last by removing the transient materials they shed and sending them elsewhere. Ethnography conducted with waste workers shows how they conceal and contain other people’s wastes. all while negotiating the filth of their occupation. holding on to middle-class aspirations. and occasionally scavenging worthwhile stuff from the trash. Waste Away also traces the circumstances that led one community to host two landfills and made Michigan a leading importer of foreign waste. Focusing on local activists opposed to the transnational waste trade with Canada. the book’s ethnography analyzes their attempts to politicize the removal of waste out of sight that many take for granted. Documenting these different ways of relating to the management of North American rubbish. Waste Away demonstrates how the landfills we create remake us in turn. often behind our backs and beneath our notice.,True,Gft-bNcAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,71,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ibQwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=info:nP_ajVJ1OxcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jFpGeso6gI&sig=Y0JvSZquXI1O8L2V5kdrcDwR2xE,1674060683925979036,/scholar?cites=1674060683925979036,,,0,0,0

One is the (in)famous Combined Heat and Power incinerator in Sheffield. the other a forgotten biological digester in Devon utilizing anaerobic microbes. Both sites are early exemplars of experimental and biopolitical waste disposal technologies—incineration and anaerobic digestion—now regarded as leading alternatives for reducing the United Kingdom's dependence on landfill and fossil fuel; both sites also inspired public resistance at critical moments in their development.

These practices are the historical precedent and continue to be the stuff of common sense for a significant portion of human society. And yet. reuse. repair and other elements of a ‘circular economy’have recently emerged as a significant focus in environmental and economic policy.

It is primarily based on research conducted in and around a large landfill in the rural periphery of Detroit – which once accepted all of Toronto’s waste – and the different neighborhoods and livelihoods entangled with it.  Examining landfills and the people and places associated with them. it is argued. provides a new way of understanding societies that are dependent upon mass waste disposal.  I demonstrate how the prevailing Northern American waste regime creates strange new possibilities for wasted places and people even as it serves as a source of social and material pollution.  All of the chapters share in common a focus on landfilling as a waste disposal method that pollutes environments. bodies. livelihoods. towns. and states. while at the same time generating new ecological relations. economic opportunities. and political movements.  Some of the people discussed in my dissertation explore new opportunities through employment as a waste worker at the landfill or by scavenging there. while others seek to control or combat the waste site and see it as the product of injustice and neglect.

To the extent that Euro‐American techniques of “unnatural” language instruction developed during the Cold War era have been successful. it is because communicative interactions are broken down into basic components. and would‐be language learners are equipped with materials. devices. and habits that make up for their distinct bio/social deficits.

1099653,Wastes and values,2017,Joshua Reno,,Archaeologies of Waste: Encounters with the unwanted,,17-22,,In this introduction I want to discuss the relationship between waste and value. but in doing so I hope to clarify the distinction between two different senses of waste and three different senses of value. The first kind of waste results from conscious and contested human decisions about what is worthless or abject. In other words. this kind of waste is opposed to value in two senses. value as economic worth and value as a meaningful ideal to live by. The second kind of waste does not depend on whether or not a human regards it as such. and is the result of purposeful expenditures that both humans and non-humans depend on to live. This also introduces a third kind of value. which is the implicit meaning of any living thing’s existence. to survive; even if the ideals a person lives by require self-sacrifice. for example. to the extent that they are alive as such they implicitly avow value in the third sense and will expend waste in the second sense. I will consider the relevance of these sets of distinctions for thinking about the nature of human disposal behavior in general. and in the process hope to outline some of the things that we can learn from in depth case studies like the European archaeological accounts to follow. Let us begin with the two senses of ‘waste’. Waste in the first sense refers to some thing that human beings no longer want. that individuals or groups consciously reject. put in storage. and/or deposit. based on specific sets of aesthetic criteria that are invented and applied by people in a particular time and place. Waste in this sense thus bears a close relationship to two senses of value.

1099666,Shared responsibility for managing electronic waste: A case study of Maine. USA,2009,Travis P Wagner,29,Waste Management,12,3014-3021,Pergamon,Based on high disposal and low recycling rates of electronic waste (e-waste) and continued exportation to developing countries. reliance on municipal responsibility for e-waste management has been unsuccessful in the United States. This case study examines Maine’s program. which was the first US state to mandate producer responsibility for recycling household e-waste. Maine’s program established a shared cost responsibility among producers. municipalities. and consumers. The study found that Maine’s program resulted in a significant reduction in disposal and a corresponding increase in environmentally sound recycling. In the first 3 years of the program. 6.406 million kg of household e-waste was collected and recycled for a population of 1.32 million. The new program. implemented in 2006. increased the number of e-waste items collected and recycled by 108% in the first year. 170% in the second year …,True,aF1DZIIAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,110,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X09002256,14544776158738011621,/scholar?cites=14544776158738011621,,,0,0,0
1099667,Reducing single-use plastic shopping bags in the USA,2017,Travis P Wagner,70,Waste Management,,3-12,Pergamon,In the USA. local governments have the primary responsibility to manage MSW. However. local governments lack the authority to explicitly shift costs or responsibility back onto the producer for specific problem wastes. A particularly problematic waste for local governments is the single-use plastic bag. In 2014. in the USA. 103.465 billion single-use plastic shopping bags were consumed. Because of their extremely low recyclability rate. plastic bags remain a significant source of land-based litter and marine debris and impair stormwater management systems. They also reduce the effectiveness of automated recycling systems. In response. local governments increasingly have adopted a variety of measures specifically intended to reduce the store-level consumption of single-use shopping bags in 5 major categories: bans. imposition of fees and taxes. establishing minimum product design of bags. requiring consumer …,True,aF1DZIIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,93,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X17306335,5327583971829043414,/scholar?cites=5327583971829043414,,,0,0,0
1099668,A new model for solid waste management: an analysis of the Nova Scotia MSW strategy,2008,Travis Wagner and Paul Arnold,16,Journal of cleaner Production,4,410-421,Elsevier,In 1989 Canada established a national goal; divert 50 percent of the nation's municipal solid waste from disposal by 2000. The province of Nova Scotia was the first and only province to achieve this goal. In the early 1990s. Nova Scotia relied on substandard land-based disposal. incineration. and open burning. Pollution prevention was minimal. In 1995. Nova Scotia adopted a comprehensive. province-wide strategy based on pollution prevention to fundamentally change its historical approach and to achieve the diversion goal. The strategy has been effective. has achieved substantial environmental benefits. and program costs are comparable to other North American systems. This paper examines and analyzes the strategy and its current construct to assess whether the Nova Scotia strategy is a model program worthy of consideration at national and other sub-national levels.,True,aF1DZIIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,74,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652606003325,6626777447120202555,/scholar?cites=6626777447120202555,,,0,0,0
1099669,Landfill mining: Case study of a successful metals recovery project,2015,Travis P Wagner and Tom Raymond,45,Waste Management,,448-457,Pergamon,Worldwide. the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) is increasing and landfills continue to be the dominant method for managing solid waste. Because of inadequate diversion of reusable and recoverable materials. MSW landfills continue to receive significant quantities of recyclable materials. especially metals. The economic value of landfilled metals is significant. fostering interest worldwide in recovering the landfilled metals through mining. However. economically viable landfill mining for metals has been elusive due to multiple barriers including technological challenges and high costs of processing waste. The objective of this article is to present a case study of an economically successful landfill mining operation specifically to recover metals.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Product Stewardship (PS) frameworks are being adopted as a preferred policy approach to promote cost-effective diversion and recovery of post-consumer solid waste. Because the application of EPR/PS generally requires the creation of a separate and often parallel collection and/or management system. key to increasing the amount of waste recovered is to maximize the convenience of the collection system to maximize consumer participation. Convenient collection is often mandated in EPR/PS laws. however it is not defined. Convenience is a subjective construct rendering it extremely difficult to define. However. based on a dissection of post-consumer collection efforts under a generic EPR/PS system. this paper identifies and examines five categories of convenience – knowledge requirements. proximity to a collection site. opportunity to drop-off …,True,aF1DZIIAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X12002851,12603755166393701523,/scholar?cites=12603755166393701523,,,0,0,0

This study examines the influence of specific collection facility attributes (recycling fees charged. number of days open. and driving distance) on the household collection rate of e-waste in the US state of Maine. Data were collected for household computer monitor and television collection for 92 municipal waste transfer facilities representing 30% of the state's population for one year. Results suggest that recycling fees are negatively correlated with the number of televisions and computer monitors collected; furthermore. the more frequently facilities were open. the more televisions and computer monitors were collected per capita. The distance from the facility had no correlation. which prompted an analysis of whether the existence of a curbside collection system in the municipality was …,True,aF1DZIIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,55,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344911001029,302502389700603987,/scholar?cites=302502389700603987,,,0,0,0

The approach used in this study is to apply the thesis of Altheide (2003) that mass media uses the discourse of fear to report on acts of terrorism. Through a content analysis of six national newspapers. this study sought to answer two questions: Do national newspapers frame ecotage acts primarily as terrorism? If ecotage is framed as terrorism. is the discourse of fear used in stories that discuss ecotage? Using 20 search terms commonly used to describe ecotage acts. 155 news stories were found from 1984 to 2006. Based on an analysis of these stories. there was a marked shift in framing ecotage as terrorism starting in 2001. but before 9/11.

The traditional approach. expanding and improving disposal options. was rejected at the provincial and local levels. Instead. both levels simultaneously developed and implemented policies that focused on maximizing the recovery of solid waste. In both cases. crucial to policy adoption was the reframing of solid waste from a useless by-product to a valuable economic resource. This reframing was the result of the intervention of powerful policy actors. environmental justice concerns. media attention. and the sustained presence of the issue on the agenda.

CFLs provide many benefits. but they contain a very small amount of mercury. Given the billions of CFLs in use worldwide. they represent a significant source of mercury unless CFLs are recycled and the mercury recovered in an environmentally sound manner. In the state of Maine (northeast United States). despite mandated recycling of CFLs and availability of free CFL recycling. the household CFL recycling rate is very low. A study was undertaken to identify the primary factors responsible for low recycling. The first step was to survey householders who use CFLs.

The public and media perceive hazardous waste to be a major environmental and public health risk. Yet. although the problem of hazardous waste and its resultant contamination has long been known. no one took it seriously until about 1978. An interesting question is. Why did the public and media ignore hazardous waste for so long. particularly during a period of unprecedented public and media interest in the environment. especially pollution. in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s? Before 1970. waste disposal received little national media and public attention.

The lack of a methodology presents considerable challenges to novice policy students because of their lack of knowledge and experience in defining complex problems and thus their undeveloped skill in craft. Root Cause Analysis (RCA). a structured methodology designed to analyze the causes and effects of problems. can be a powerful pedagogical method to increase student comprehension and success in defining policy problems. Although RCA was developed primarily as an ex post methodology in the engineering. computing. and health care fields to understand how major adverse events or system failures occurred. a modified RCA is well suited for identifying and analyzing complex and dynamic policy problems …,True,aF1DZIIAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,7,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15236803.2014.12001797,16185914946367275658,/scholar?cites=16185914946367275658,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34195786/JPAE_20_03_final.pdf#page=159,0,0,0

A number of these influence their attractiveness on economic grounds. including both the size and timing of the premium and potential payouts. and the degree of risk aversion of the potential customers. Other factors make programs attractive for reasons that are not economic. but no less valid. These have to do with the trust that people have in the insurance product and the organizations involved in selling and managing it. Indeed. data from India. Africa. and South America show that these factors may be more important than the economic ones in influencing demand.

Left Coast Press, Walnut Creek",,70-86,,Global climate change has become an increasingly visible topic in public culture over the past few decades. and will likely dominate environmental. political. and social agendas for some time to come. Only in the last few years has a critical mass of anthropologists begun to focus on the social practices and cultural implications surrounding the production of climate change models and scenarios. the communication and interpretation of climate information. climate change causes and solutions. and the implications of its impacts for people worldwide.The topic of climate has a long history in the social sciences. As far back as Hippocrates. scholars theorized about how climate shapes society. assessing how climate differences. extremes. and seasonal patterns affected human activity (Harris 1968. 41–42). Focus on these topics often led to ethically dubious and racist theories like climatic (or geographic) determinism. in which climate led to certain cultural or social behaviors. A focus on climate constraints and human responses. or “adaptation.” is central to today’s multidisciplinary academic discourse. and three major simplifications of the past are being acknowledged: climate is only one of several drivers affecting human behavior. climate on most timescales is not static. and we are capable of influencing and changing global climate.

Ethiopia. in 2010. in which participants in the games allocated money across risk management options. One of the options was index insurance that was the same as commercial products sold locally. Participants exhibited clear preferences for insurance contracts with higher frequency payouts and for insurance over other risk management options. including high interest savings. The preference for higher frequency payouts is mirrored in commercial sales of the product. with commercial purchasers paying substantially higher premiums than the minimal. low frequency option available.

Mexico. fisheries management is heavily influenced by models of individual economic rationality held by biologists and others involved in management. in which fishermen ‘choose’ to overfish because they are motivated by selfish individual rationality. Yet there is much that is neglected by these models. including the pressures of economic markets. family and community expectations. and cultural and personal value systems. Actual decisions about fishing and resource management rarely match the expectations of classical or neoliberal economic models of individual behaviour.

The study uses a case study of a location in the Wellington city centre. Te Aro. New Zealand. The flow behaviour. mean and gust wind speedups. and the probability of exceedance of high wind speeds at locations around the target building were evaluated through wind-tunnel experiments. numerical simulations and analysis of long-term Wellington Meteorological wind records. For the wind-tunnel experiments. the erosion technique and Irwin probes were employed to visualise and measure the flow pattern and wind speed. respectively. The numerical simulation was conducted using the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) method and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model. The study also investigates the feasibility of the use of a relatively low-cost numerical approach to study wind flow in urban areas. particularly for the purpose of commercial projects. The advantages and disadvantages of the employed methods are discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that numerical simulations provide more detailed information about the wind flow in the whole computational domain compared with wind-tunnel measurements. which can only be conducted at limited points.

To reach an acceptable level of yield production. cultivation of two crops of rice is necessary. For the temporal distribution of precipitation in the region for cultivation of the second crop of rice during the dry season existence of some water resource for irrigation is vital. Small earth dams constructed by the Filipino government have the ability to reserve the additional rainfall during the rainy season and offer it for cultivation purposes when rain is scarce. This study was conducted in the watershed of an earth dam in Villa Boado. Talugtug. Nueva Ecija province. to figure out the diversity of soils and their effectiveness on soil involvement in the hydrological cycle of the watershed. Results showed that two groups of soils with high and low swelling ability exist in the area. While soils with high swelling ability hold much more water content. they limit soil involvement ability in the hydrological cycle due to their low permeability and insignificant changes on moisture content during the time from the rainy to the dry season.

Results indicate an increase in engine speed leads to increased spray impinging (wall film formation). turbulence intensity and average wall temperature in cylinder. The enhanced air/fuel mixing and intensified evaporation of wall film decreases soot emission by reducing the extent of the fuel rich regions specially in impinging zones.

In this paper. shape optimization of two-dimensional cavitators in supercavitating flows is studied. A two dimensional supercavitation potential flow passes a symmetric two dimensional cavitator. which is placed perpendicular to the flow in a channel of infinite length and immediately a cavity is formed behind the cavitator. This is because of the generation of a gas or vapor cavity between the body and the surrounding liquid due to the change in a high speed flow direction passing the cavitator. Drag force acting on this supercavitating body dictates the thrust requirements for the propulsion system. to maintain a required cavity at the operating speed. Therefore. any reduction in the drag force. by modifying the shape of the cavitator. will lead to decrease this force.

Based on the results. more than 25% drag reduction happens at a friction Reynolds number of Reτ = 500 for slip length of 1×10−5 m.

Optimal input design is the process of generating informative inputs that can be used to generate the good quality dynamic model of AUVs. In a problem with optimal input design. the desired input signal depends on the unknown system which is intended to be identified. In this paper. the input design approach which is robust to uncertainties in model parameters is used. The Bayesian robust design strategy is applied to design input signals for dynamic modeling of AUVs. The employed approach can design multiple inputs and apply constraints on an AUV system’s inputs and outputs.

Using a suitable method to estimate these coefficients serves as a time efficient approach to raise the achievable precision in the design and control of AUVs. This paper estimates hydrodynamic derivatives of an AUV using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for the wings and body. CFD modeling was performed to simulate captive model tests including straight line and planar motion mechanism (PMM). In such runs. the process was implemented separately for the wing and body. Experimental tests for the same AUV in the water tunnel were carried out for CFD validation. Comparing the numerical results to the experimental data. it was shown that the modeling method is able to estimate these coefficients at reasonable accuracy.

Various types of cavitators. such as disk. cone. and parabolic. were designed and manufactured. Also. the shape of the cavities formed behind these bodies were considered and compared. Dimensionless parameters such as dimensionless length and the diameter of the cavity as well as the dimensionless required air flow on the cavitators were obtained. The results showed that parabolic cavitators have an optimum design in comparison with the disk and cone cavitators due to their insignificant capability to reduce the drag force. yet the cavity’s length has a moderate size. It was also observed that this type of cavitator is capable of forming a cavity with a dimensionless length up to L/d= 33 and a dimensionless width up to D/d= 3.6. Moreover. parabolic cavitators require the highest amount of air injected in comparison with the cone and disk types; therefore. they operate in lower cavitation numbers.

However. due to wideness of the workspace and the flexibility of the cables. they are susceptible of unwanted vibrations which reduce their precision. Therefore. determination of velocity limits in the operation workspace is of high importance. In this study. stability analysis and critical velocities of a four cable plane robot is considered. Governing equations of the system are extracted by use of finite element method and employing variable length element. The characteristic coefficients of the extracted equations are nonlinear and velocity dependent ones. To provide a stability analysis. the equations are linearized assuming that the end-effector experiences quasi-static movements and the system is subjected to low amplitude vibrations. Afterwards. the corresponding eigenvalue problem is analyzed and critical speeds of the robot in whole workspace domain are calculated. Furthermore. vibration frequencies corresponding to the unstable eigenvalues are determined. It is observed that system critical speed reduces as the end-effector moves to the boundaries of the workspace. In contrast to this. the frequency of the corresponding unstable modes increase as the end-effector moves to the borders of the workspace.,True,zegaPwYAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1503614101877825935&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

In this study. a simply-supported rectangular plate stimulated by a harmonic force and attached to a viscous damper in specific locations. is considered. The governing equations of the plate are derived using Lagrange method. Then. these equations are solved employing Helmholtz-Kirchoff integral and Fourier transforms to measure near filed and far-field scattered acoustic pressure. In the sequel. assuming the location of the damper and the applied force to be unknown. the sound recorded by a microphone array is used to identify the force and the damper locations and also to find vibration stream lines. in a reverse manner. Numerical simulations confirm the applicability of the proposed method.

1099995,Boundary condition-enforced immersed boundary method for thermal flow problems with Dirichlet temperature condition and its applications,2012,WW Ren and C Shu and J Wu and WM Yang,57,Computers & Fluids,,40-51,Pergamon,A boundary condition-enforced immersed boundary method is presented in this paper for simulation of free and forced convection problems with Dirichlet-type boundary condition. The heat source/sink is introduced into the energy equation to model the effect of immersed boundary. Different from previous works. in this paper. the heat source/sink is not pre-calculated. but determined implicitly in such a way that temperature at the immersed boundary interpolated from the corrected temperature field accurately satisfies the thermal condition. The main advantage of the proposed method lies in its simple concept. easy implementation and robustness in stability. Another important contribution of the paper is that it presents two efficient ways to calculate the average Nusselt number.

Thus. the effect of the intake swirl on the fuel spray and diesel engine combustion performance was explored. Quantitative analysis of the characteristics of fuel-air mixing and combustion characteristics under different swirl ratio was given. It was found that the spray atomization and fuel-air mixing begins from the front of fuel beam which has deflection due to the presence of the intake swirl.

Simulation results indicate that compared with diesel fuel. kerosene cavitates more due to higher turbulent kinetic energy as a result of lower viscosity. The results from experiment indicate that under lower charge density. the spray penetration for kerosene is obviously shorter than that for diesel. especially for the lower injection pressure. This is because lower fuel viscosity results in a reduction in the size of the spray droplets. leading to lower momentum. However the spray angle of kerosene is larger compared with diesel due to stronger turbulence in the nozzle flow caused by increased cavitation for kerosene. which also accords well with the simulation results.,True,N1AWWcAAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,8,https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2016-01-0839/,9756543391302746041,/scholar?cites=9756543391302746041,,,0,0,0

Cavitation and turbulence inside a diesel injector play a critical role in primary spray breakup and development processes. Thus understanding the phenomenon of cavitation is significant in capturing the injection process with accuracy. In this study. the cavitating flow inside an injector nozzle hole was numerically investigated.

With a piezoelectric injector. the spray characteristics of kerosene and G50 (gasoline/diesel blend fuel). which are kinds of WDF. were investigated and compared to diesel. The characteristics such as spray penetration. spray velocity. spray angle and air entrainment were used to understand the spray behaviour of the test fuels. The results indicate that the piezoelectric injector shows significant improvement over the conventional solenoid injector in injection response and needle opening speed. which enables precise and rapid control of injection. The trade-off effects of charge density and injection pressure on spray penetration and spray velocity are quite clear. while spray angle is almost insensitive to injection pressure.

A new hybrid spray model developed by coupling the standard KHRT model to cavitation sub model was used. The detailed thermo-physical properties of ether fuels have been predicted and validated with experimental results available from literature. The cavitation inception inside the injector nozzle hole has been studied for ether fuels in comparison with diesel fuel. It was found that ether fuels cavitates higher compared to that of conventional diesel fuel because of its low viscosity. The spray tip penetration of diesel fuel was longer than that of ether fuels due to high viscosity and density of diesel fuel.

The breakage of a continuous fin into oblique sections leads to the reinitialization of the thermal boundary layer at the leading edge of each oblique fin. effectively reducing the boundary layer thickness. This regeneration of entrance effects causes the flow to always be in a developing state. thus resulting in better heat transfer. In addition. the presence of smaller oblique channels diverts a small fraction of the flow into adjacent main channels. The secondary flows created improve fluid mixing. which serves to further enhance heat transfer. Both numerical simulations and experimental investigations of copper-based oblique finned microchannel heat sinks demonstrated that a highly augmented and uniform heat transfer performance. relative to the conventional microchannel. is achievable with …,True,SLwSN0AAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C,126,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/heattransfer/article-abstract/134/10/101901/417024,5266089418093455062,/scholar?cites=5266089418093455062,,,0,0,0

The reactivity controlled combustion is accomplished by creating reactivity stratification in the cylinder with the use of two fuels characterized by distinctly different cetane numbers. The low reactivity (i.e.. low cetane number) fuel is firstly premixed with air and then charged into the cylinder through the intake manifold; later. the high reactivity (i.e.. high cetane number) fuel is injected into the charged mixture through a direct injector. Subsequently. the reactivity stratification is formed.

1100170,SKELETAL MECHANISM CONSTRUCTION FOR METHYL OLEATE IN REAL BIODIESEL FUELS,2019,Han Li and Wenming Yang,,,,,,A skeletal mechanism with 133 species and 877 reactions for MOD9D (one of the main unsaturated methyl esters in biodiesel fuels) is constructed by using decoupling methodology. The obtained skeletal mechanism consists of four parts: high temperature decomposition. low temperature oxidation. ester group reactions and detailed chemistry of small species. Extensive validations are firstly performed against available experimental data in shock-tube for autoignition delay. The predicted results by the skeletal mechanism matches well with the experiment results. The comparison has been conducted between the detailed mechanism and a semi-detailed mechanism. Good agreement or even better predictions at some initial conditions has been observed. Further validations are conducted against the experimental data of fuel species’ conversion rate and species concentration in PSR at varying initial temperatures.

The modelling of ash deposit morphomology is also included. Ash deposition in coal and biomass fired boilers will induce many ash-related issues (such as slagging. fouling and corrosion) which will reduce the boiler efficiency and capacity. Some traditional prediction methods have been proposed to evaluate ash deposition. However. these methods are based on chemical compositions of ash deposits and the operating temperatures in boilers. which are unable to fully predict the complex ash deposition process. Great efforts have been made to develop mechanistic models to predict ash deposition processes in nature. The behavior of ash formation and deposition in the boilers plays a key role in the design of boilers and the selection of fuels.

The emphasis of the study was to follow the evolution of the PSDF from the onset of particle inception to particle mass growth. At the onset of soot inception. the PSDF was found to follow a power-law dependence on particle diameter. The PSDF becomes bimodal at larger height above the burner surface. and remains bimodal throughout the flame. Numerical simulation using a kinetic model proposed previously and a stochastic approach to solve aerosol dynamics equations again showed a bimodal PSDF.

The model is second-order in its complexity and is shown to be more accurate to the standard “linear-by-volume” (LbV) model which is often used when no other information is available. Such observations are due to the existence of both synergistic and antagonistic blending of the octane numbers between the three components. In particular. antagonistic blending of toluene and iso-octane leads to a maximum in sensitivity that lies on the toluene/iso-octane line.

This was done using the periodic supercell method as implemented within the CASTEP software package with Al concentrations approaching the very low levels present in industrial samples of rutile TiO 2. Defect states involving substitution of a titanium atom for an aluminium atom were studied along with the more stable configuration of two adjacent aluminium substitutions with an oxygen vacancy in between. In the latter case. aluminium does not introduce band-gap states but leads to an increase in the band gap in both anatase and rutile. This suggests that aluminium doping pushes the absorption edge further into the UV and therefore reduces the photocatalytic activity.

We classify the existing literature broadly into two categories. viz. static and adaptive design of experiments (DoE). We begin with the abundant literature available on static DoE. its chronological evolution. and its pros and cons. Our discussion naturally points to the challenges that are faced by the static techniques. The adaptive DoE techniques employ intelligent and iterative strategies to address these challenges by combining system knowledge with space-filling for sample placement. We critically analyze the adaptive DoE literature based on the key features of placement strategies.

This potential is used to estimate equilibrium constants of dimerisation for five representative PAH molecules based on a statistical mechanics model. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to study the clustering of homomolecular systems at a range of temperatures. The results from both sets of calculations demonstrate that at flame temperatures pyrene (C16H10) dimerisation cannot be a key step in soot particle formation and that much larger molecules (e.g.circumcoronene.

The experimental results including combustion temperature. unburned residues. gas species. and flame spectra were collected. The influences of initial coal concentration on the ignition behaviors of an Indonesian subbituminous in a reducing atmosphere were studied. Our findings show that as initial coal concentration increased. the intensity of visible light and the carbon burnout progressively increased. while the ignition distance and the fuel NOx formation continually decreased. It was observed that the region of continuous flame became successively concentrated. and the flame stability was increasingly enhanced. indicating that the ignition behaviors improved in a gradual way. Furthermore. the mechanism of the combined homo-heterogeneous ignition changed to homogeneous ignition. To be specific. at initial coal concentrations of 0.33 kg/kg and 0.41 kg/kg. the homo-heterogeneous combined ignition mechanism occurred. While at an initial coal concentration of 0.53 kg/kg. the mechanism changed to homogenous ignition. For a tangentially-fired pulverized-coal boiler burning the Indonesian subbituminous. the highest initial coal concentration of the horizontal bias combustion burners can be designed as 0.53 kg/kg. which will be beneficial to the strong ignition and low-NOx emission.,True,s-wdhswAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC,0,https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/177388,,,,,0,0,0

It takes advantages of a cavity to stabilize the flame. When the cavity size of a TVC is well designed. a large rotating vortex can be formed in the cavity. The vortex cannot shed out the cavity and is thus named a “locked” or “stable” vortex. One of the main challenges for TVC design is fuel injection. Typically. fuel can be injected directly into the cavity or from the diffuser upstream. Injecting from the diffuser leads to the fuel being mixed with the air before it enters the combustor. When the fuel is injected directly into the cavity. it is desirable to supply the fuel in such way that the locked vortex in the cavity is reinforced. Furthermore. the fuel-air mixing in the cavity will be promoted. as the bypass air is directly added into the cavity.

Either passive or active control in open- or closed-loop configurations can be implemented to mitigate such instabilities.

NW. WASHINGTON. DC 20036 USA,Experimental measurements have been made of the enthalpies of mixing of isooctane and ethanol blends so as to calculate the enthalpies of vaporization of these mixtures. The enthalpy of vaporization is very important for the performance of spark ignition engines. especially those that use gasoline direct injection (GDI). High enthalpies of vaporization increase the charge cooling effect so that the volumetric efficiency is improved (thereby increasing the specific output) and a higher compression ratio can also be used. because there is a lower temperature at the start of compression. The higher compression ratio increases both the efficiency and the specific output. However. measurements reported here show that the increased enthalpy of vaporization has an adverse effect on the particulate matter (PM) emissions from a GDI engine. This is attributed to the air fuel mixture being less homogeneous.,True,8hIpfLgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,90,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef1015796,6902901408312774130,/scholar?cites=6902901408312774130,,,0,0,0

GDI engines are known to emit a higher number of PN emissions (on an engine-out basis) than Port Fuel Injection (PFI) engines. due to the reduced mixture homogeneity in GDI engines. Euro 6 emission standards have been introduced in Europe (and similarly in China) to limit PN emissions from GDI engines. This article summarises the current state of research in GDI PN emissions (engine-out) including a discussion of PN formation. and the characteristics of PN emissions from GDI engines. The effect of key GDI engine operating parameters is analysed. including air-fuel ratio. ignition and injection timing. injection pressure. and EGR; in addition the effect of fuel composition on particulate emissions is explored. including the effect of oxygenate components such as ethanol.

However. its biological role in conidiation remains largely elusive. We report here that conidia production. morphogenesis. integrity. germination and their viability in Pestalotiopsis microspora require the polyketide-derived melanin. A polyketide synthase gene. pks1. was identified and demonstrated responsible for melanin biosynthesis in this fungus. A targeted deletion mutant strain Δpks1 displayed a defect in pigmentation of conidia and had an albino colonial phenotype. Interestingly. Δpks1 produced approximately 6-fold as many conidia as the wild type did. suggesting a negative modulation of melanin on conidia production in this fungus.

1100461,Experimental investigation of tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO) in diesel engine without any engine modification,2015,V Karthickeyan and P Balamurugan and R Senthil,1,J Biofuels Bioenergy,2,170-183,,In the current energy scenario. attention of world is changing towards producing energy from waste products. In the present study. tyre pyrolysis oil (TPO) is prepared and investigated in diesel engine. Initially. waste tyres were collected from local market. cut down into small pieces and steel wire meshes inside the tyre were removed. Then the pieces were heated at a high temperature. The last derived component after heating is called TPO. The minimal amount of black tyre powder which was also identified inside oil is removed by filtering process. The obtained TPO oil is mixed with traditional diesel fuel in the ratio of 20% TPO and 80% diesel. Then the prepared samples were tested in computerised single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine to analyse the combustion and performance characteristics. Emission measurements were done using AVL make: 444 Di Gas Analyser and 437C Smokemeter. The results show that brake thermal efficiency increased by about 0.6% and brake specific energy consumption decreased by about 0.59 MJ kWh-1 with 20TPO than diesel fuel at full-load condition. The exhaust emission gases like CO. HC. NOx and smoke were decreased about 0.01%. 1 ppm. 119ppm and 11.2 Hartridge smoke unit with 20TPO than neat diesel. respectively.

1100468,A study on magnetic field assisted laser percussion drilling and its effect on surface integrity,2018,S Balamurugan and C Bala Manikandan and P Balamurugan,94,Archives of Materials Science and Engineering,1,,,Purpose: of this paper is to reduce the taper angle and surface roughness of the laser drilled hole on Aluminium alloy with the assistance of magnetic field. At lower laser powers. able to achieve higher material removal rate in drilling with reduced taper angle and roughness. Design/methodology/approach: Aluminium alloy is a highly reflective material. while laser drilling it ejects plumes. which makes the drilling unreliable. The plume generated due to this action causes deteriorating effects over the work piece as such affecting surface textures. Removal of plume is the major consideration in laser machining process. especially in laser assisted drilling. The plume is a form of cluster of ions having charges in it. Due to the magnetic field input. the ions line the path along the lines of force of magnets. Thus. the ion cloud can be cleared at the localized plane. where the subsequent laser drilling going to be happens. leads to reduced plume thereby reduces the taper angle and surface roughness. Findings: The defect of percussion laser drilling that is barrelling effect in the drilled hole was reduced with the assistance of magnetic field setup. For the laser energy of 90 mJ. the magnetic assisted laser drilling shows better improvement in the material removal rate of 64.5%. the profile error (spatter height) was reduced to 45% and the taper angle of the drilled hole also reduced by 16.3%. The results confirmed the fact that. the Lorentz force confined the plume particle to be raised upwards and circulated outwards to the sidewall from the centre of the laser beam. This expansion of laser induced plasma plume. improved the material removal rate of the hole.,True,q_3jARsAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bala_Cheirmakani/publication/329539840_A_study_on_magnetic_field_assisted_laser_percussion_drilling_and_its_effect_on_surface_integrity/links/5c0e93a6299bf139c74fa22b/A-study-on-magnetic-field-assisted-laser-percussion-drilling-and-its-effect-on-surface-integrity.pdf,16456135415672635067,/scholar?cites=16456135415672635067,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bala_Cheirmakani/publication/329539840_A_study_on_magnetic_field_assisted_laser_percussion_drilling_and_its_effect_on_surface_integrity/links/5c0e93a6299bf139c74fa22b/A-study-on-magnetic-field-assisted-laser-percussion-drilling-and-its-effect-on-surface-integrity.pdf,0,0,0

This has resulted in increased usage    of hydrogen as fuel for internal combustion engines. Hydrogen resources are    vast and it is considered as one of the most promising fuel for automotive    sector. As the required hydrogen infrastructure and refueling stations are    not meeting the demand. widespread introduction of hydrogen vehicles is not    possible in the near future. One of the solutions for this hurdle is to blend    hydrogen with methane. Such types of blends take benefit of the unique    combustion properties of hydrogen and at the same time reduce the demand for    pure hydrogen. Enriching natural gas with hydrogen could be a potential    alternative to common hydrocarbon fuels for internal combustion engine    applications.

In the opening chapter of his new book. Sustainable Materials. Allwood cites plastic grocery bags in the UK as a case in point. He notes that plastic accounts for about 1 per cent of the UK’s CO2 emissions. and plastic carrier bags make up 1 per cent of plastic use. Hence. even if all plastic bags were scrapped–and assuming their substitute were carbon neutral. which is unlikely–we would only be addressing 0.01 per cent of the UK’s carbon footprint.By contrast. says Allwood.“our aim is to look for solutions. and our number-one guiding principle is about scale–we want to make sure that we identify options for change that are big enough to make a big difference.” Allwood’s research team starts by quantifying which economic activities generate the most emissions. It turns out that 64 per cent of global CO2 emissions are energy-or processrelated (the rest are from deforestation. agriculture or decay); and 35 per cent of these emissions are from industry. 31 per cent from buildings and 27 per cent from transport.,True,76uDzrcAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,580,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.592.8907&rep=rep1&type=pdf,12882015570204965935,/scholar?cites=12882015570204965935,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.592.8907&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. agriculture is the main driver of losses of biodiversity and a major contributor to climate change and pollution. and so further expansion is undesirable. The usual proposed alternative—intensification with increased resource use—also has negative effects. It is therefore imperative to find ways to achieve global food security without expanding crop or pastureland and without increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

The environmental benefits of using timber are not straightforward; although it is a natural product. a large amount of energy is used to dry and process it.

Strain distributions through the thickness of the sheets are measured for two configurations of ISF: two-point incremental forming (TPIF) and single-point incremental forming (SPIF). and a comparison is made to pressing. The measurements show that the deformation mechanisms of both SPIF and TPIF are stretching and shear in the plane perpendicular to the tool direction. with shear in the plane parallel to the tool direction. Strain components increase on successive laps. and the most significant component of strain is shear parallel to the tool direction.

There are two factors which are important when assessing the potential gains from energy efficiency technologies: the scale of energy flow and the technical potential for improvement. However. most efficiency analyses consider only the potential gains from known efficiency technologies. while ignoring the complex flow of energy through the chains of conversion devices. In response. this paper traces the global flow of energy. from fuels through to the final services. and focuses on the technical conversion devices and passive systems in each energy chain.

Some hydro-forming type processes induce significant normal stress across the workpiece and this has led to a small number of extended formability analyses. However. recent work on the incremental sheet forming process which is known to give higher formability than conventional sheet pressing has shown that the repeated passage of a tool over the sheet leads to significant through-thickness shear strains being induced in the workpiece. Accordingly this paper explores the forming limits of sheet forming processes which induce any possible proportional loading. including all six components of the symmetric stress tensor.

However. many materials cannot be recycled. Most materials that are recycled today are downgraded in the process and. for some materials. recycling is more energy intensive than new production.

Components and materials can under some circumstances be reused. without the energy-intensive step of recycling.

The simplified process is described and shown to give increases in forming limits compared to a conventional process with the same geometry. A model of the process is set up with a commercial finite element package. validated. and used to trace the history of a ‘pin’inserted perpendicularly into the workpiece. The history of the deformation of the ‘pin’demonstrates significant through thickness shear occurring in the direction parallel to tool motion.

Industrial activities create all the physical products (e.g.. cars. agricultural equipment. fertilizers. textiles. etc.) whose use delivers the final services that satisfy current human needs. Compared to the industry chapter in AR4. this chapter analyzes industrial activities over the whole supply chain. from extraction of primary materials (e.g.. ores) or recycling (of waste materials). through product manufacturing. to the demand for the products and their services. It includes a discussion of trends in activity and emissions. options for mitigation (technology. practices. and behavioural aspects). estimates of the mitigation potentials of some of these options and related costs. co-benefits. risks and barriers to their deployment. as well as industry-specific policy instruments. Findings of integrated models (long-term mitigation pathways) are also presented and discussed from the sector perspective. In addition. at the end of the chapter. the hierarchy in waste management and mitigation opportunities are synthesized. covering key waste-related issues that appear across all chapters in the Working Group III contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).,True,76uDzrcAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,165,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11116/,10313784533624309648,/scholar?cites=10313784533624309648,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11116/1/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter10.pdf,0,0,0

Global demand for steel has risen to 1.4 billion tonnes a year and is set to at least double by 2050. while the steel industry generates nearly a 10th of the world’s energy related CO2 emissions. Meeting our 2050 climate change targets would require a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions for every tonne of steel produced and finding credible solutions is proving a challenge. The starting point for understanding the environmental impacts of steel production is to accurately map the global steel supply chain and identify the biggest steel flows where actions can be directed to deliver the largest impact. In this paper we present a map of global steel. which for the first time traces steel flows from steelmaking. through casting. forming. and rolling. to the fabrication of final goods.

This paper presents an investigation into whether incremental sheet forming (ISF) would be mechanically feasible alternative means to form sandwich panels. Process feasibility is assessed through examination of failure modes. thinning and surface quality after application of ISF to various sandwich panel designs. It is shown that ISF can be applied to sandwich panels which have ductile and largely incompressible cores. For a formable sandwich panel. the influence of ISF on the panel and a metal sheet of comparable plastic bending moment were evaluated. Similar trends in tool forces were observed. the sine law had similar accuracy in predicting thinning and the through-thickness deformation was similar for both materials.

In the opening chapter of his new book. Sustainable Materials. Allwood cites plastic grocery bags in the UK as a case in point. He notes that plastic accounts for about 1 per cent of the UK’s CO2 emissions. and plastic carrier bags make up 1 per cent of plastic use. Hence. even if all plastic bags were scrapped–and assuming their substitute were carbon neutral. which is unlikely–we would only be addressing 0.01 per cent of the UK’s carbon footprint.By contrast. says Allwood.“our aim is to look for solutions. and our number-one guiding principle is about scale–we want to make sure that we identify options for change that are big enough to make a big difference.” Allwood’s research team starts by quantifying which economic activities generate the most emissions.

Demand for these materials is anticipated to double at least by 2050. by which time global carbon emissions must be reduced by at least 50%. To evaluate the challenge of meeting this target. the global flows of these materials and their associated emissions are projected to 2050 under five technical scenarios. A reference scenario includes all existing and emerging efficiency measures but cannot provide sufficient reduction. The application of carbon sequestration to primary production proves to be sufficient only for cement.

There are two factors which are important when assessing the potential gains from energy efficiency technologies: the scale of energy flow and the technical potential for improvement. However. most efficiency analyses consider only the potential gains from known efficiency technologies. while ignoring the complex flow of energy through the chains of conversion devices. In response. this paper traces the global flow of energy. from fuels through to the final services. and focuses on the technical conversion devices and passive systems in each energy chain.

One underexploited option to reduce embodied carbon is the reuse of structural steel. However. in the UK. work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi-structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers. five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost. availability/storage. no client demand. traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost. supply chain gaps/integration. risk. jointing technique. composite …,True,3-ct8FoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261730210X,252870832246947304,/scholar?cites=252870832246947304,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/113185/1/Densley%20Tingley%20et%20al%202017.pdf,0,0,0
1100635,Mapping global flows of chemicals: from fossil fuel feedstocks to chemical products,2018,Peter G Levi and Jonathan M Cullen,52,Environmental science & technology,4,1725-1734,American Chemical Society,Chemical products are ubiquitous in modern society. The chemical sector is the largest industrial energy consumer and the third largest industrial emitter of carbon dioxide. The current portfolio of mitigation options for the chemical sector emphasizes upstream “supply side” solutions. whereas downstream mitigation options. such as material efficiency. are given comparatively short shrift. Key reasons for this are the scarcity of data on the sector’s material flows. and the highly intertwined nature of its complex supply chains. We provide the most up to date. comprehensive and transparent data set available publicly. on virgin production routes in the chemical sector: from fossil fuel feedstocks to chemical products.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is increasingly used to identify such priorities but can be misleading. This article draws attention to two effects that can occur when the system boundary for a product LCA is not defined correctly. We illustrate the “washing machine effect” by showing that in separate life cycle studies of clothing. detergents. and washing machines. the use of energy is dominated by operation of the washing machine. All three studies prioritize the use phase for action. but in an aggregated study. double counting of the use‐phase impact occurs. We demonstrate the “inverse washing machine effect” with an example related to energy used in transport.

This is a result of the high energy intensity of the process. significant CO2 release from the raw materials used. and large global consumption. It is also a high growth sector as emerging economies develop their infrastructure. This paper outlines an investigation into day-to-day performance variation that. if scaled to the global level. represents a potential for improvement of up to 100 Mt CO2 equivalent per year. Optimising this operational variation is not included in current roadmaps for reduction of cement industry CO2 emissions. and has the potential to be cost neutral. or even save money for cement producing companies.

Using a novel ranking method inspired from the field of information retrieval (tf-idf). we have analysed interviews of actors across the supply chain to determine the acuteness of the perception of each barrier.

Hence. even if all plastic bags were scrapped–and assuming their substitute were carbon neutral. which is unlikely–we would only be addressing 0.01 per cent of the UK’s carbon footprint.By contrast. says Allwood.“our aim is to look for solutions. and our number-one guiding principle is about scale–we want to make sure that we identify options for change that are big enough to make a big difference.” Allwood’s research team starts by quantifying which economic activities generate the most emissions.

Their aim has been to recycle the material into a usable extruded component without melting. Industry has yet to embrace this processing technique despite over a decade of research. We instead investigate the potential to use extrusion as a pre-melting step to increase metal recovery during chip recycling. We extrude aluminum (AA6060) and zinc (Kirksite A) chips under different extrusion ratios. The oxide content of the extruded aluminum is predicted using evidence from the literature and measured using an Auger Nanoprobe. We compare the subsequent metal recovery rates during vmelting to those obtained during: (1) bulk metal recycling; (2) melting of chips by submersion in molten metal; (3) melting of chips with salt fluxes; and (4) melting of previously compacted chip briquettes.For aluminum chips. it is found that an …,True,4XQeuikAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618322352,1739381488372773774,/scholar?cites=1739381488372773774,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Cooper19/publication/326663529_Metal_recovery_during_melting_of_extruded_machining_chips/links/5f3705c7a6fdcccc43c8a42c/Metal-recovery-during-melting-of-extruded-machining-chips.pdf,0,0,0

We investigate the extent to which the EOL recycling rate is constrained by the ability to collect EOL scrap versus the ability to recycle scrap into new alloys given the compositional mismatch between available scrap and the new alloys demanded by industry. The compositional mismatch means that scrap must be ""sweetened"" during recycling with virgin metals (primary unalloyed aluminum and alloying elements) to satisfy the chemistry constraints of the new alloys. If the mismatch is too great. then recycling becomes unviable.We first review the reasons for the compositional mismatch by examining its three causes: contamination with tramp elements; mixing of different aluminum scrap during recycling; and shifting demand for new alloys.

1100664,Reuse of steel and aluminium without melting,2014,Daniel Cooper,,,,,,Carbon dioxide emissions must be dramatically reduced to avoid the potentially dangerous effects of climate change. The steel and aluminium industries produce large amounts of carbon dioxide. accounting for 6% of anthropogenic emissions. Previous studies have shown that in these industries there is limited scope for further improvements in energy efficiency. Material efficiency strategies can. however. further reduce emissions. This thesis focuses on materially efficient reuse without melting. A scoping study of current reuse found three opportunities. an examination of which forms the basis of this thesis: reusing components at end of product life; extending the lifespan of products; and reusing manufacturing scrap. The opportunity to reuse components has received little attention to date and there is no clearly defined set of strategies or barriers to enable assessment of appropriate component reuse; neither is it possible to predict future levels of reuse. This thesis presents a global assessment of the potential for reusing steel and aluminium components. A combination of top-down and bottom-up analyses is used to allocate the final destinations of current global steel and aluminium production to final products. A substantial catalogue has been compiled for these products characterizing key features of steel and aluminium components including design specifications. requirements in use. and current reuse patterns. To estimate the fraction of end-of-life metal components that could be reused for each product. the catalogue formed the basis of a set of semi-structured interviews with industrial experts.

Cement is primarily used in concrete. the most used material on the planet and a critical part of any analysis of emissions reduction strategy. To estimate the potential for reducing demand. this work analyses material flow in the cement industry. using the UK in 2014 as a case study. Combining published data. analytic assumptions. and interviews we estimated the material flow of cement from the production to a breakdown of its use in applications. Having broken down the demand for cement into 25 applications. multiple material efficiency techniques were considered: substituting cement for calcined clay and limestone. reducing the cement content of concrete. post-tensioning floor slabs. using more precast building elements. reducing construction waste. and reducing the overdesign in construction.

These models assume that energy is an intermediate product of some combination of human labour and capital. These models also assume that the supply of energy is driven by economic demand. We assume the contrary. i.e. that useful energy is a primary input. derived (mostly) from natural capital. This failure to capture the impact of primary resources (as useful energy) on economic growth leads to inappropriate formulation of economic growth theories.

Some models use the material properties of the material in bulk as inputs for modelling the densification of assemblies of powder particles. It is important to understand how these properties differ when the material is in powder form. Existing works tend to analyse bulk material or powder exclusively and rarely compare properties such as hardness between the two. This work compares the microstructures and hardness of metal powder with bulk material with the aim of guiding the assumptions made in the modelling of metal powder densification.

Besides estimating the carbon intensity of electricity production. we propose a new indicator. the carbon intensity of electricity use. which quantifies CO 2/kWh of electricity derived useful exergy. Results show final to useful efficiency dilution until World War I (50% to 30%) due to a decrease in share of the high-efficiency transport sector and from mid-1940s to 1960 and mid-1990s onwards (58% to 47% and 47% to 40%) due to an increase in share of the low efficiency commercial and residential sector.

1100696,The impact of reducing car weight on global emissions: the future fleet in Great Britain,2017,Andre Cabrera Serrenho and Jonathan B Norman and Julian Allwood,,,,,Royal Society Publishing,Current European policies define targets for future direct emissions of new car sales that foster a fast transition to electric drivetrain technologies. However. these targets do not consider the emissions produced in electricity generation and material production. and therefore fail to incentivise car manufacturers to consider the benefits of vehicle weight reduction. In this paper. we examine the potential benefits of limiting the average weight and altering the material composition of new cars in terms of global greenhouse gas emissions produced during the use phase. electricity generation and material production. We anticipate the emissions savings for the future car fleet in Great Britain until 2050 for various alternative futures. using a dynamic material flow analysis of ferrous metals and aluminium. and considering an evolving demand for car use. The results suggest that fostering vehicle weight reduction could produce greater cumulative emissions savings by 2050 than those obtained by incentivising a fast transition to electric drivetrains. unless there is an extreme decarbonization of the electricity grid. Savings promoted by weight reduction are immediate and do not depend on the pace of decarbonization of the electricity grid. Weight reduction may produce the greatest savings when mild steel in the car body is replaced with high-strength steel.

This study compares the two approaches with the objective of understanding their relative merits and the conditions for which each approach is appropriate. The approaches often provide contrasting results. This can be due to differing datasets and assumptions but may also reflect underlying differences in what the results represent. In particular the applicability. implications and the boundaries to which the results relate. If the nature of these differences is not appreciated. they can be problematic for the appropriate use of the results. Several hybrid techniques have been developed in order to address these differences and take advantage of the benefits offered by each approach. These clearly have merit. However. it is proposed that where the nature of the differences is appreciated. the different results can complement each other and provide a more expansive understanding of the impacts being investigated. This can be advantageous when the results are used to inform policy decisions or to report progress towards particular goals. To explore this further. a case study relating to the UK steel sector is presented. illustrating the range of results which may be indicated by each approach.

Those environmental impacts depend on the efficiency with which operations are carried out. In the case that LCA data are available for multiple similar installations. their respective operational performances can be benchmarked and links between operational efficiency and environmental impacts can be established. In this paper. this possibility is illustrated with a case study on LCA of mussel cultivation in rafts. For each site (raft) both its inputs consumption and mussel production are known. A separate LCA of each site has been performed and its corresponding environmental impacts have been estimated.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) can be combined with LC approaches to provide quantitative benchmarks that orientate the performance of energy systems towards environmental sustainability. with different implications depending on the selected LC + DEA method. The present paper examines currently available LC + DEA methods and develops a novel method combining carbon footprinting (CFP) and DEA. Thus. the CFP + DEA method is proposed. a five-step structure including data collection for multiple homogenous entities. calculation of target operating points. evaluation of current and target carbon footprints. and result interpretation. As the current context for energy policy implies an anthropocentric perspective with focus on the global warming impact of energy systems. the CFP + DEA method is foreseen to be the most consistent LC + DEA approach to provide benchmarks for energy policy making.

A technology-rich. optimisation-based model for power generation in Spain is developed and provided with endogenous life-cycle indicators (climate change. resources. and human health) to assess their evolution to 2050. Prospective performance indicators are analysed under two energy scenarios: a business-as-usual one. and an alternative scenario favouring the role of carbon dioxide capture in the electricity production mix by 2050. Life-cycle impacts are found to decrease substantially when existing fossil technologies disappear in the mix (especially coal thermal power plants). In the long term. the relatively high presence of natural gas arises as the main source of impact. When the installation of new fossil options without CO 2 capture is forbidden by 2030. both renewable technologies and—to a lesser extent—fossil technologies with CO 2 capture are found to increase their contribution to electricity production. The endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators into energy models proves to boost the usefulness of both life cycle assessment and energy systems modelling in order to support decision-and policy-making.

1100735,Dynamic ecocentric assessment combining emergy and data envelopment analysis: application to wind farms,2016,Mario Martín-Gamboa and Diego Iribarren,5,Resources,1,8,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Most of current life-cycle approaches show an anthropocentric standpoint for the evaluation of human-dominated activities. However. this perspective is insufficient when it comes to assessing the contribution of natural resources to production processes. In this respect. emergy analysis evaluates human-driven systems from a donor-side perspective. accounting for the environmental effort performed to make the resources available. This article presents a novel methodological framework. which combines emergy analysis and dynamic Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for the ecocentric assessment of multiple resembling entities over an extended period of time. The use of this approach is shown through a case study of wind energy farms. Furthermore. the results obtained are compared with those of previous studies from two different angles. On the one hand. a comparison with results from anthropocentric approaches (combined life cycle assessment and DEA) is drawn. On the other hand. results from similar ecocentric approaches. but without a dynamic model. are also subject to comparison. The combined use of emergy analysis and dynamic DEA is found to be a valid methodological framework for the computation of resource efficiency and the valuation of ecosystem services. It complements traditional anthropocentric assessments while appropriately including relevant time effects.

Within this context. this work applies a set of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools to prioritise the selection of five alternative bioenergy systems for residential heating based on the combination of three commercial technologies (pellet. wood stove and traditional fireplace) and two different feedstocks (eucalypt and maritime pine species). Several combinations of MCDA methods and weighting approaches were compared to assess how much results can differ. Eight indicators were used for a sustainability assessment of the alternatives while four MCDA methods were applied for the prioritisation: Weighted Sum Method (WSM). Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE). and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE). Regarding the sustainability performance indicators. the highest environmental impacts were calculated for the fireplace alternatives. and there was not a best environmental option. Also. no clear trend was found for the economic and social dimensions. The application of MCDA tools shows that wood stove alternatives have the best sustainability performance. in particular wood stove with combustion of maritime pine logs (highest scores in the ranking).

1100744,Enhancing the economic dimension of LCA+ DEA studies for sustainability assessment,2014,Diego Iribarren and Mario Martín-Gamboa,,"Proceedings of the 4th World Sustainability Forum. MDPI, Basel",,,,The combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been recently proposed as a methodological framework for the sustainability assessment and benchmarking of multiple similar entities. While important benefits are associated with this combined methodology (eg. quantification of performance indicators and eco-efficiency verification). some underdeveloped aspects need to be addressed. In this respect. further efforts are required so that the LCA+ DEA methodology succeeds in coping with the different sustainability dimensions in balance. In particular. previous studies pinpoint the need for further exploring the economic dimension of this type of assessment. Within this context. the present work presents different pathways to enhance the economic component of LCA+ DEA studies. On the one hand. straightforward options for widening the economic scope of the LCA+ DEA methodology include the calculation of economic savings and/or lifecycle costing indicators linked to the operational benchmarks calculated by the method. On the other hand. indirect pathways rely on the previous calculation of environmental or emergy benchmarks. Environmental benchmarks can be translated into economic terms through the monetization of externalities. while emergy benchmarks can be translated into market-driven indicators for the valuation of ecosystem services. These pathways (either separately or jointly) help boost the use of the LCA+ DEA methodology for sustainability assessment.,True,X9-l1DkAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,3,https://sciforum.net/manuscripts/2672/manuscript.pdf,4413087203566638979,/scholar?cites=4413087203566638979,,https://sciforum.net/manuscripts/2672/manuscript.pdf,0,0,0
1100745,A life-cycle perspective in energy systems modelling: nuclear extension scenarios for Spain,2017,Diego García-Gusano and Mario Martín-Gamboa and Diego Iribarren and Javier Dufour,,"8th international conference on life cycle management, luxembourg",,,,During the last decade. the European consensus on fighting climate change has stimulated national governments and societies to support the installation of renewable energy technologies. Within this context. the Spanish electricity production from renewable sources has grown significantly. from 17% in 2005 to 37% in 2015. Even though national power generation trends point to large renewable contributions in the long term. there are current concerns about the retirement of fossil and nuclear power technologies in the coming years. In particular. beginning in 2021. and by 2028. Spain will shut down its 6 nuclear power plants (8 reactors. 7.573 MW) unless a nuclear extension is approved by the government in order to extend their licences beyond 40 years. As presumed. this decision is controversial since there are many aspects (energy security. environment. economy. public acceptance. etc.) to take into account. Consequently. this work aims to enrich the discussion about potential nuclear extension in Spain by assessing relevant life-cycle indicators previously integrated into an energy system model of the Spanish power generation sector for the time frame 2010-2050. Therefore. the value added behind the modelling is the endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators and the implementation of three energy scenarios subject to techno-economic optimisation. First. a business-as-usual (BaU) scenario driven by the evolution of key socioeconomic drivers is considered. Additionally. the scenarios “Nuclear+ 10” and “Nuclear+ 20” are implemented. considering an extension of 10 and 20 years in nuclear plants. respectively.

The direct cost of electricity of a fusion power plant and its key dependencies on the physics and technology assumptions. are calculated. as are the materials requirements. The other important aspect of costs. the external costs which can arise from effects such as pollution. accidents and waste are also given. Fusion is found to offer the prospect of a new energy source with acceptable direct costs and very low external costs.

1100781,Life cycle assessment of the Spanish cement industry: implementation of environmental-friendly solutions,2015,Diego García-Gusano and Israel Herrera and Daniel Garraín and Yolanda Lechón and Helena Cabal,17,Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,1,59-73,Springer Berlin Heidelberg, This study tries to find out the hotspots of the Spanish cement sector in 2010 by the life cycle assessment (LCA) and evaluates some improvement scenarios where best available technologies and substitution measures are taken into consideration. The document presents an environmental LCA of the cement production using the 2011 International Reference Life Cycle Data System method recommended by the European Commission. Attending to the clinker production by stage. fossil fuel combustion is the most important source in terms of impacts. Besides. limestone’s calcination is crucial attending to the climate change. Electricity consumption is also relevant both in human toxicity with cancer effects and freshwater eutrophication (FE). Accordingly. solutions deployed lead to reductions in different impact categories. Fossil fuel substitution scenario achieves to reduce 33 and 37 % photochemical ozone …,True,z3xTIc0AAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,43,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10098-014-0757-0,16873787677905709389,/scholar?cites=16873787677905709389,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Diego_Garcia-Gusano/publication/271619470_Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_the_Spanish_Cement_Industry_Implementation_of_Environmental-Friendly_Solutions/links/55b2078208ae9289a084f80f.pdf,0,0,0
