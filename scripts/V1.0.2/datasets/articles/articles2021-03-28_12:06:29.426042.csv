1261111,Constructing ionic highway in alkaline polymer electrolytes,2014,Jing Pan and Chen Chen and Yao Li and Lei Wang and Lisheng Tan and Guangwei Li and Xun Tang and Li Xiao and Juntao Lu and Lin Zhuang,7,Energy & Environmental Science,1,354-360,Royal Society of Chemistry,Alkaline polymer electrolytes (APEs) are an emerging material that enables the use of nonprecious-metal catalysts in electrochemical energy technology. such as fuel cell and water electrolysis. Yet the OH− conduction in APE has been of much lower efficiency than the H+ conduction in its acidic counterpart (typically Nafion). leading to a large dissipative loss in energy conversion applications. Here we report that. by properly constructing ion-aggregating structures in APE. a OH− conducting highway can be built. such that the OH− conduction in APE becomes as efficient as the H+ conduction in Nafion (greater than 0.1 S cm−1 at 80 °C under moderate ion-exchange capacity 1.0 mmol g−1).

1261112,The biology and role of CD44 in cancer progression: therapeutic implications,2018,Chen Chen and Shujie Zhao and Anand Karnad and James W Freeman,11,,1,1-23,BioMed Central,CD44. a non-kinase transmembrane glycoprotein. is overexpressed in several cell types including cancer stem cells and frequently shows alternative spliced variants that are thought to play a role in cancer development and progression. Hyaluronan. the main ligand for CD44. binds to and activates CD44 resulting in activation of cell signaling pathways that induces cell proliferation. increases cell survival. modulates cytoskeletal changes. and enhances cellular motility. The different functional roles of CD44 standard (CD44s) and specific CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms are not fully understood. CD44v contain additional peptide motifs that can interact with and sequester growth factors and cytokines at the cell surface thereby functioning as coreceptors to facilitate cell signaling. Moreover. CD44v were expressed in metastasized tumors. whereas switching between CD44v and CD44s may play a role in regulating …,True,6D1Ys14AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,303,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13045-018-0605-5,5105401323268313437,/scholar?cites=5105401323268313437,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13045-018-0605-5,0,0,0

Hybrid weakness. the poorer development of hybrids compared with their parents. hinders gene exchange between different species at the postzygotic stage. Here we show that two incompatible dominant loci (Hwi1 and Hwi2) involving three genes are likely to determine the high temperature-dependent expression of hybrid weakness in interspecific hybrids of rice. Hwi1 comprises two leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR–RLK) genes. 25L1 and 25L2. which are specific to wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) and induce hybrid weakness.

In such applications. the frequency of the spin waves is important as it affects the overall frequency performance of the resulting devices. In conventional ferromagnetic thin films. the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic resonance and spin waves are limited by the saturation magnetization of the ferromagnetic (FM) material and the external bias field. High-frequency applications would require high external magnetic fields which limit the practicality in a realistic device. One solution is to couple microwave excitations to perpendicular standing spin waves (PSSWs) which can enable higher oscillation frequencies.

Particularly conventional near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) suffers from the trade-off between resolution and efficiency. Planar plasmonic lens schemes can partially solve this issue utilizing plasmonic resonances. but the performance is not robust over a large range of sample materials. In this work we show a novel quasi-3D plasmonic scheme to focus light into the extreme subwavelength region in the near field with an efficiency orders higher than NSOM. The superb performance comes from the strong coupling between the localized mode with an off-plane E-field component and the sample being processed. Our scheme can efficiently focus light to a spot with a diameter down to 1/20 of its wavelength. and the coupling efficiency can be as high as 10%.

1261145,The ranking of negative-cost emissions reduction measures,2012,Simon Taylor,48,Energy Policy,,430-438,Elsevier,A flaw has been identified in the calculation of the cost-effectiveness in marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs). The problem affects “negative-cost” emissions reduction measures—those that produce a return on investment. The resulting ranking sometimes favours measures that produce low emissions savings and is therefore unreliable. The issue is important because incorrect ranking means a potential failure to achieve the best-value outcome. A simple mathematical analysis shows that not only is the standard cost-effectiveness calculation inadequate for ranking negative-cost measures. but there is no possible replacement that satisfies reasonable requirements. Furthermore. the concept of negative cost-effectiveness is found to be unsound and its use should be avoided. Among other things. this means that MACCs are unsuitable for ranking negative-cost measures. As a result.

1261149,Enabling urban-scale energy modelling: a new spatial approach,2014,Simon Taylor and Denis Fan and Mark Rylatt,42,Building Research & Information,1,4-16,Routledge,Urban-scale energy modelling provides an ideal tool for studying non-domestic energy consumption and emissions reduction at the community level. In principle. an approach based on the characteristics of individual commercial premises and buildings is attractive. but it poses a number of challenges. the most immediate of which is deciding precisely what to model. For a range of reasons connected with their self-contained nature. individual non-domestic buildings would ideally be selected.

1261150,Demand reduction in the UK—with a focus on the non-domestic sector,2007,David Toke and Simon Taylor,35,Energy Policy,4,2131-2140,Elsevier,A demand reduction strategy is considered in the context of the UK and in the light of the UK Government's 2006 Energy Review. This paper discusses how a mechanism—a Demand Reduction Obligation (DRO)—can be established to achieve radical energy demand reduction targets in electricity and gas use in the industrial. commercial and public administration sectors. A DRO would require energy suppliers to invest in energy-saving measures so as to reduce energy demand in these sectors. The investment for this activity would be funded by energy suppliers who would increase prices in order to cover the cost of achieving the carbon reductions. Public opinion surveys suggest that a large proportion of the public would prefer to support demand reduction measures compared to other energy options. It may be practical to deliver carbon emission reductions equivalent to around 30% of emissions from the UK …,True,qDo3zWYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421506002825,7314580794239197889,/scholar?cites=7314580794239197889,,,,0,0,0

The native buildings were found to be thermally uncomfortable in the winter due to low operative temperatures arising from their concrete construction and single glazing. When the building envelope was refurbished. the energy performance improved markedly and the buildings became thermally comfortable in the winter.

1261155,Characterising space use and electricity consumption in non-domestic buildings,2010,Rob Liddiard and Simon Taylor and Mark Rylatt,,,,,,Energy used in the operation of the United Kingdom’s non-domestic buildings contributes 18% of national carbon dioxide emissions and reducing these is government policy. The use of electrical equipment in buildings is a major contributor to overall consumption. due to both its intrinsic energy consumption and the effects of incidental internal gains resulting from its operation. Knowledge of how and where consumption and internal gains occur in buildings is important in understanding the consumption characteristics of the building stock. The overall aim of this research was to improve the prediction of energy consumption in the non-domestic stock through the inference of appliance electricity consumption and resultant heat gains. for internal space uses of premises. as identified in UK property taxation data. To achieve this. the objectives were to: 1. Develop a method for inferring space usage in premises. 2. Infer values for the electricity consumption of appliances. and hence internal gains. for space uses within premises. 3. Apply the method to a dataset at the urban scale and use a suitable model to deduce the energy consumption. 4. Compare the results with measured data. Objectives 1 and 2 were achieved through analyses of detailed energy surveys of more than 300 non-domestic premises. By excluding equipment used for heating and cooling. both intrinsic electricity consumption and internal gains from appliances have been characterised for combinations of internal space use and premises activity type.

1261157,Deep carbon emission reductions in existing UK social housing: are they achievable. and how can they be funded?,2009,Andrew Reeves and SC Taylor and PD Fleming,,,,,European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ECEEE),As part of the UK's effort to combat climate change. deep reductions in carbon emissions will be required from existing social housing. The potentially high cost of the required stock refurbishment is a key barrier to the achievement of this goal. No assessments exist to date of the viability of achieving deep emission cuts whilst overcoming this financial barrier. For this study. this viability has been assessed for Peabody. a large housing association operating in London. A model of energy use. carbon emissions and refurbishment costs has been developed for Peabody's existing stock. Various approaches to stock refurbishment up to 2030 were modelled. and outputs were assessed against four socio-economic scenarios. reflecting uncertainty about future fuel prices and efforts to mitigate climate change. Carbon emission reduction was assessed against the target set by the Greater London Authority (GLA) for 2025 for London in the London Climate Change Action Plan. The results indicate that the GLA's target can only be achieved through extensive stock refurbishment and only then against a background of substantial efforts to reduce UK carbon emissions. Despite assumptions of considerable financial support for refurbishment in the scenarios studied. the required measures require a significant increase in net expenditure and are therefore not financially viable for Peabody without extra funding. These findings point towards a future context where carbon emission reduction in housing is increasingly reliant on measures that may not provide net savings over the long term.

1261170,Parameters influencing the productivity of solar stills–A review,2015,P Prakash and V Velmurugan,49,,,585-609,Pergamon,In this paper. a review is made on the various parameters influencing the productivity of the solar stills. The researches on the factors improving productivity such as area of absorption. minimum depth of water. water–glass cover temperature difference. inlet water temperature. heat storage. phase change materials. vacuum technology and other methods such as using reflectors. condensers. multi effect distillation. etc. are discussed here. The review showed that the productivity increases when the area of the absorption is increased. The basin water depth is the main parameter that affects the productivity of the still. The increase of the water–glass cover temperature difference (Tw−Tg) also plays a vital role in increasing the productivity. Preheating the feed water to the still basin shows a considerable improvement in the productivity.

However this can be achieved in stepped solar still in which the area of the basin is minimized by having small trays. Very few works have been carried so far in stepped solar still and constant depth trays are used in the basin plate. In this work. a stepped still with two different depth of trays are used. The basin plate contains twenty five trays with 10 mm depth and twenty five trays with 5 mm depth. To improve the productivity. experiments were carried out by integrating small fins in basin plate and adding sponges in the trays. Theoretical and experimental analyses are made for fin type. sponge type. and combination of fin and sponge type stepped solar still. When the fin and sponge type stepped solar is used. the average daily water production has been found to be 80% higher than ordinary single basin solar still. The theoretical results agree well with the experimental. Also an economic analysis was made.

The first set of observations shows that under certain thunderstorm conditions. wind turbine blades can produce electric discharges at regular intervals of ~3 s in relation to its rotation. over periods of time that range from a few minutes up to hours. This periodic effect has not been observed in static towers indicating that the effect of rotation is playing a critical role. The repeated discharges can occur tens of kilometers away from electrically active thunderstorm areas and may or may not precede a fully developed upward lightning discharge from the turbine. Similar to rockets used for triggering lightning. the fast movement of the blade tip plays an important role on the initiation of the discharge. The movement of the rotor blades allows the tip to “runaway” from the generated corona charge.

A total of 510 sparks were applied for both polarities. The paper shows the effects of the voltage rise time and the peak voltage in the generation of X‐rays. It is found here that shorter rise times and high peak voltages tend to produce more X‐rays emissions with higher energies than longer front waveforms or lower peak voltages. In a similar way. higher voltage variations produce more energetic emissions. This finding suggests that the variation of the electric field before the breakdown can play a fundamental role in the X‐ray production. The results are similar with the observations of X‐rays produced in natural lightning where detections have been associated to leader steps before the return stroke.,True,P_8w-c0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,58,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2010GL044543,1390461454275189082,/scholar?cites=1390461454275189082,,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010GL044543,0,0,0

Both wind turbines and aircraft can initiate lightning. and very favorable conditions for lightning initiation occur in winter thunderstorms. Moreover. winter thunderstorms are characterized by a relatively high production of very energetic lightning. This paper reviews the different types of lightning interactions and summarizes the well-known winter thunderstorm areas. Until now comprehensive maps of global distribution of winter lightning prevalence to be used for risk assessment have been unavailable. In this paper we present the global winter lightning activity for a period of 5 years. Using lightning location data and meteorological re-analysis data. six maps are created: annual winter lightning stroke density. seasonal variation of the winter lightning and the annual number of winter thunderstorm days.

The analysis reported an extremely active storm. evolving through distinct phases. which stood out from a multicell structure to finally become a supercell. The onset of newer regions of convective development interacting with the main cell made the charge structure to be rather complex during some stages of this long-lived hailstorm. Evidence suggests the presence of regions with the charge layer being inverted from that of normal. non-severe convective storms. producing predominantly positive cloud-to-ground lightning.

Up to now. nobody has studied separately the influence of positive and negative electrodes. Thus. the goal of this letter is to demonstrate the influence of the positive and the negative electrode in the production of runaway electrons in laboratory sparks. Results show that. emissions are affected by the distribution of the equipotential lines around the cathode.

On the basis of extensive fieldwork in China between 2010 and 2012. we suggest that the high turnover of leading cadres at the local level may hinder state-led greening growth initiatives. Frequent cadre turnover is intended primarily to keep local Party secretaries and mayors on the move in order to promote the implementation of central directives. While rotation does seem to aid implementation by reducing coordination problems. there are also significant downsides to local leaders changing office every three to four years. Officials with short time horizons are likely to choose the path of least resistance in selecting quick. low-quality approaches to the implementation of environmental policies.

Previous research finds that these SCSs are employed by the Chinese state as “surveillance infrastructure” and for social management. This article focuses on a different angle: the public’s opinion of SCSs. Based on a cross-regional survey. the study finds a surprisingly high degree of approval of SCSs across respondent groups. Interestingly. more socially advantaged citizens (wealthier. better-educated. and urban residents) show the strongest approval of SCSs. along with older people.

Local leaders signal competence when their superiors actively collect evidence to evaluate their performances: these are years leading to the end of a five-year term. To create better economic performances. local leaders lessen the enforcement of environmental regulations to reduce local industries’ production costs and/or to attract firms from other jurisdictions. Such selective enforcement creates an environmental political business cycle in which pollution increases in years leading to the year of leader turnover.

The most common biofuel is bio-ethanol accounting for more than 90% of total biofuel usage. It is increasingly produced from sugar cane making cane a strategic crop for biofuels. Given the growing demand for “green” fuels. bio-ethanol production has been supported by energy policies in the past decade. which have consequently been accused of contributing to the global trend of rising food prices and thus jeopardising food security.

At the national level. a preference for low carbon alternatives. ongoing bureaucratic restructuring. and profitability concerns of the national oil companies (NOCs) help to explain a lack of support for methanol fuel. At the local level. a short-term and localized view of industry development explains why some governments actively promote methanol fuel through local standardization. subsidies. and management of NOC opposition.

Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers,Building energy consumption and loads are strongly influ-enced by solar gain and heat transfer through the centre-glass area of windows. Methods have been devised to calculate the corresponding energy performance indices (e.g.. SHGC and U-factor). Simulation offers the opportunity to examine design options such as low-emissivity or solar-control coatings. glass tints. substitute fill gases and diathermanous glazing layers. Current models use a radiosity-based approach to quantify longwave radiant exchange. A new method is presented for the thermal analysis of multilayer systems. This method. by using a resistor network to quantify both convective and radiant exchange. offers exceptional generality. “Jump” resistors allow for airflow between layers. or diathermanous layers. or any combination of the two. The air and mean radiant temper-atures can differ on both the indoor and outdoor sides. In addi-tion a more general method has been devised for calculating indices of merit without restricting the generality of the simu-lation model – for any set of environmental temperature and insolation conditions.

1261249,Determining Off-Normal Solar Optical Properties of Roller Blinds.,2009,Nathan A Kotey and John L Wright and Michael R Collins,115,ASHRAE Transactions,1,,,Solar gain through fenestration constitutes a significant portion of peak cooling load and annual energy consumption in buildings. As such. any reduction in solar gain translates into savings associated with the cost of purchasing and operating cooling equipment. Shading devices in general. and roller blinds in particular. can be used to reduce solar gain appreciably. The performance of a roller blind is largely determined by its solar optical properties. In this study. an integrating sphere was used to obtain off-normal solar properties of six typical roller blind samples. Measurements were used to develop semi-empirical models for the off-normal beam-beam. beam-diffuse. and diffuse-diffuse solar optical properties. The models provide a means to calculate off-normal properties by adjusting known values of beam-beam transmittance (ie. openness). beam-total transmittance. and beam-total reflectance measured at normal incidence.

Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers,Building envelope performance is strongly influenced by solar gain and heat transfer through windows. The majority of this energy gain or loss passes through the center-glass area of the glazing system. Various methods have been devised to calculate the corresponding center-glass performance indices. Solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) and U-factor are the quantities most frequently sought. Hand calculations have given way to computer-based techniques. Computer simulation offers the opportunity to employ more detailed models plus the ability to model the large number of glazing systems made possible by design options. such as low-emissivity or solar-control coatings. selective glass tints. substitute fill gases. and glazing layers. that partially transmit longwave radiation. A new. more accurate method is presented in this paper for manipulating spectral optical data while calculating the energy related optical properties of glazing layers and glazing systems.

1261256,A two-dimensional numerical model for natural convection in a vertical. rectangular window cavity,1994,John L Wright and Harry F Sullivan,,,,,American Society of Heating. Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers,It is common for sealed glazing units to exhibit condensation problems when operated in cold climates. Condensation often forms along the perimeter of the exposed surface of the indoor glazing because of the thermal short circuit caused by the edge seal. Furthermore. condensation most readily forms along the bottom edge of the indoor glazing because of the combined effects of edge seal conduction and fill gas convection. A simple two-dimensional numerical control volume formulation is presented that can be used to model the natural convection of gas within a vertical. rectangular cavity. Details of a unique perturbation scheme used to generate secondary cells are also presented This model closely reproduces the average Nusselt number results of more complex numerical models.

Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers,The fenestration chapter of the 2005 ASHRAE Hand-book—Fundamentals (ASHRAE 2005) has long included methods for determining the U-factor and solar heat gain coef-ficient (SHGC). or window performance indices. using the radiative and convective heat transfer coefficients around a glazing layer. The present work examines the errors inherent in applying these standard calculation methods to window systems that include a single diathermanous layer (such as a shading layer). and new equations for calculating the perfor-mance indices are derived. Furthermore. the radiative heat transfer coefficients used in these calculations can be difficult to determine in the presence of a diathermanous layer.

Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers,Window solar gain is known to have a strong influence on building energy consumption and peak cooling load. Venetian blinds are routinely used to control solar gain. Software based on one-dimensional models is available to accurately predict the thermal performance of glazing systems. but the develop-ment of models for windows with shading devices is at a very early stage. A guarded heater plate apparatus has been used to measure center-glass heat transfer rates through a double-glazed window with a venetian blind in the glazing cavity. Vari-ables examined include pane spacing. temperature difference. slat angle. and the presence of a low-emissivity coating. Results were compared with earlier measurements.

1261260,Effective U-values and shading coefficients of preheat/supply air glazing systems,1986,John L Wright,,,,,,"Research is documented which makes use of a computer program called VISION. This computer program was developed specifically to provide a detailed analysis of heat transfer occurring in glazing systems. VISION was modified to perform an analysis of the energy flows in supply air windows. A model used to quantify heat transfer in the supply air flow is described. Ventilation air is brought in through supply air windows and the energy recovered by the preheat of the air flow is credited to the thermal performance of the window itself. Thus. the net energy flow between the conditioned space and the window was used to calculate an effective U-value and shading coefficient. The use of these ""effective"" window performance parameters permits the subsequent quantification of energy flows to or from the supply air glazing system without the necessity of modelling the detailed mechanisms of energy transport within the glazing system itself. A variety of glazing system designs are simulated. Indoor glazing temperature is reported for each system.

Sr. Ni. and Eu sorption on Na-illite and the modelling of Cs sorption,1999,C Poinssot and Bart Baeyens and Michael H Bradbury,,,,,,A natural illite (illite du Puy) was purified and converted to the homo-ionic Na-form. The conditioned Na-illite was characterised in terms of its mineralogy. chemical inventory and physico-chemical properties. The structural formula was determined from energy dispersive spectroscopic analyses (SEM/TEM-EDS) and bulk chemistry measurements. A cation exchange capacity of 127 meq kg{sup -1} was determined by the {sup 22}Na isotope dilution method at neutral pH. The Na-CEC was also measured as a function of pH. The stability of Na-illite as a function of pH in the range between 3 and 6 was investigated. At low pH values partial dissolution of the illite occurs releasing the structural elements Al. Si. Mg. and K into solution. The presence of Ca and Sr in solution was interpreted as being due to desorption from cation exchange sites. All of these elements are also present at neutral pH but at considerably lower levels. Such effects cannot be avoided and must be considered in the interpretation of the sorption measurements. The main focus of the experimental work presented here is on the sorption behaviour of Cs. Sr. Ni and Eu on conditioned Na-illite as a function of NaClO{sub 4} background electrolyte concentration (0.1 and 0.01 M). nuclide concentration and pH in the range between 3 and 11. Sorption edge data (R{sub d} versus pH) and sorption isotherms (quantity of nuclide sorbed versus equilibrium nuclide concentration) are presented for these four elements.

USiO4. is the second most abundant U4+ mineral on Earth. and its formation by the alteration of the UO2 in spent nuclear fuel in a geologic repository may control the release of radionuclides to the environment. Despite its abundance in nature. the synthesis and characterization of coffinite have eluded researchers for decades. On the basis of the recent synthesis of USiO4. we can now define the experimental conditions under which coffinite is most efficiently formed. Optimal formation conditions are defined for four parameters: pH. T. heating time. and U/Si molar ratio. The adjustment of pH between 10 and 12 leads probably to the formation of a uranium(IV) hydroxo-silicate complex that acts as a precursor of uranium(IV) silicate colloids and then of coffinite.

These simplified models calculate the effects of alpha particles and recoil atoms on mobility of uranium atoms in UO2. They lead to a diffusion coefficient which is proportional to the volume alpha activity with a proportionality factor of about 10−44 (m5). However. the same models applied for fission lead to a radiation-enhanced diffusion coefficient which is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than values reported in literature for U and Pu. Other models are based on an extrapolation of radiation-enhanced diffusion measured either in reactors or under heavy ion bombardment.

Evidence of the Beneficial Effect of Extensive Recycling,2017,Jérôme Serp and Christophe Poinssot and Stéphane Bourg,10,Energies,9,1445,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this early 21st century. our societies have to face a tremendous and increasing energy need while mitigating the global climate change and preserving the environment. Addressing this challenge requires an energy transition from the current fossil energy-based system to a carbon-free energy production system. based on a relevant energy mix combining renewables and nuclear energy. However. such an energy transition will only occur if it is accepted by the population. Powerful and reliable tools. such as life cycle assessments (LCA). aiming at assessing the respective merits of the different energy mix for most of the environmental impact indicators are therefore mandatory for supporting a risk-informed decision-process at the societal level. Before studying the deployment of a given energy mix. a prerequisite is to perform LCAs on each of the components of the mix. This paper addresses two potential nuclear energy components: a nuclear fuel cycle based on the Generation III European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) and a nuclear fuel cycle based on the Generation IV Sodium Fast Reactors (SFR). The basis of this study relies on the previous work done on the current French nuclear fuel cycle using the bespoke NELCAS tool specifically developed for studying nuclear fuel cycle environmental impacts. Our study highlights that the EPR already brings a limited improvement to the current fuel cycle thanks to a higher efficiency of the energy transformation and a higher burn-up of the nuclear fuel (− 20% on most of the chosen indicators) whereas the introduction of the GEN IV fast reactors will bring a significant breakthrough by suppressing the …,True,-bbdBaEAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,20,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/9/1445,13250008698754053170,/scholar?cites=13250008698754053170,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/9/1445/pdf,0,0,0

1261335,The regulating power market on the Nordic power exchange Nord Pool: an econometric analysis,1999,Klaus Skytte,21,Energy Economics,4,295-308,North-Holland,What differentiates the structure of Nord Pool from other power exchanges around the world is the way the balance from the spot market is maintained until the actual. physical delivery takes place. via the regulating power market in Norway. This paper reveals the pattern of the prices on the regulating power market. by analysing the cost of being unable to fulfil the commitments made on the spot market. Some power producers with unpredictable fluctuations (e.g. wind) will need to buy regulation services. The disclosed pattern implies that these producers must pay a limited premium of readiness in addition to the spot price; this premium is independent of the amount of regulation. The level of the premium of readiness for down-regulation is shown to be strongly influenced by the level of the spot price. On the other hand. it is demonstrated that the premium for up-regulation is less correlated to the spot price …,True,7K5b9bYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,153,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014098839900016X,13757612009707999716,/scholar?cites=13757612009707999716,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40533126/skytte_regulating__power.pdf,0,0,0

The background for this development is improved technology. decreasing costs. and increased concern regarding environmental problems of competing technologies such as fossil fuels. For the future there are large possibilities for increasing the renewable electricity share. However. variable renewable power production has to be balanced. Demand side flexibility offers an interesting approach to the balancing issues. The aim of this paper is to compare flexibility potentials and how they were estimated in seven Northern European countries in order to compare general challenges and results as well as the connection between used method and results.

This paper compares two ways to achieve target compliance—either with import of biomass from countries outside the EU or without. The ADMIRE REBUS model combines cost data for electricity producing renewable energy technologies with data on the renewable energy resources available in EU and assesses the effect of the various national support policies for green electricity in the EU countries. The major finding of the study is that increased imports of low-cost biomass will significantly reduce the cost of target compliance. but would hamper the use of energy crops and further development of wind power within the EU.

This study assesses three tariffs that permit a flexible use of electric boilers in a representative district heating system in Denmark. A mixed integer programming model is developed to evaluate the impact of each tariff on district heating flexibility quantitatively. The tariffs are then discussed in the light of the regulatory requirements that network tariffs must comply with.We show that alternative tariffs enhance the business case for P2H technologies to run flexibly. support the replacement of fossil fuels by green electricity and lower the overall cost of supplying heat.

In the environment associated with the power markets. the regulatory mechanisms interact with each other and thus the attainment of the specified goals. Analytical discussions in the paper show that synergies do exist between the different regulation mechanisms and the targets. However. the challenge of having the different targets lies in the fact that the mechanisms at present cover different geographical areas and sectors. and that the targets are set differently within each Member State.

Sustainable smart energy systems based on renewable energy cannot be implemented without addressing the issue of how to re-design existing electricity and gas markets. Moreover. markets for heating and transport fuels will also be challenged. In recent years. the re-design of the electricity market has attracted a lot of attention and is an area of focus in research. However. the re-design of electricity markets should not be seen isolated from the re-design of other energy markets. By applying a 100% renewable energy system scenario. this paper illustrates and quantifies how future renewable heating. green gas and liquid fuel markets will influence the electricity markets and vice versa.

1261349,Consumer ownership in liberalized electricity markets. The case of Denmark,2002,Ole Jess Olsen and Klaus Skytte,73,Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics,1,69-88,Blackwell Publishers Ltd.,The continuation of consumer ownership has been an important part of the Danish electricity reform from 1999. Consumer ownership refers to either a consumer co‐operative or a municipal utility. Contrary to conventional wisdom. consumer ownership can be supported by solid arguments from modern economic theory of organization. These arguments are presented and confronted with both present and future situation in Denmark. The development of the electricity supply industry after the Second World War has emptied consumer ownership of much of its original content. Nowadays. most consumers consider their electric utility as the (monopoly) supplier of a good they demand and not as something they own. Therefore. obligatory consumer ownership as specified in the new Danish Electricity Act of 1999 cannot be relied on to guarantee security of supply and reasonable prices for small consumers,True,7K5b9bYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,23,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-8292.00186,14527311703417793711,/scholar?cites=14527311703417793711,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Klaus_Skytte/publication/227603594_Consumer_Ownership_in_Liberalized_Electricity_Markets_The_Case_of_Denmark/links/5b9226e492851c78c4f3ec21/Consumer-Ownership-in-Liberalized-Electricity-Markets-The-Case-of-Denmark.pdf,0,0,0

Here we present an experimental analysis of the horizontal wake deviation of a 5 MW offshore wind turbine between 0.6 and 1.4 diameters downstream. The wake field has been scanned with a short-range lidar and the wake path has been reconstructed by means of two-dimensional Gaussian tracking. We analysed the measurements for rotor yaw misalignments arising in normal operation and during partial load. representing high thrust coefficient conditions. We classified distinctive wake paths with reference to yaw misalignment. based on the nacelle wind vane. in steps of 3° in a range of ±10.5°. All paths observed in the nacelle frame of reference showed a consistent convergence towards 0.9 rotor diameters downstream. suggesting a kind of wake deviation shift. This contrasts with published results from wind tunnels which in general report a convergence towards the rotor. The discrepancy is evidenced in particular in a comparison which we performed against published paths obtained by means of tip vortex tracking.,True,7K5b9bYAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC,21,https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/1/41/2016/,16716064982258513823,/scholar?cites=16716064982258513823,,,https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/1/41/2016/wes-1-41-2016.pdf,0,0,0
1261352,Barriers for district heating as a source of flexibility for the electricity system,2017,Klaus Skytte and Ole Jess Olsen and Emilie Rosenlund Soysal and Daniel Møller Sneum,,"Journal of Energy Markets, Forthcoming",,,,The Scandinavian countries Denmark. Norway and Sweden currently deploy large amounts of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources. especially wind power. This calls for additional flexibility in the power market. The right coupling to the underlying national and local district heating (DH) markets can generate large amounts of flexibility. However. regulatory barriers and different energy market designs may hinder the potential benefits from system integration. and lower the potential that can be realized. The Scandinavian countries have a large extension of DH with a good potential for providing flexibility services to the electricity market. We survey and discuss regulatory barriers and drivers for exploiting this potential for flexibility. Combined heat and power (CHP) is widely integrated in the power market. but it is threatened by low electricity prices due to the increasing amounts of wind power. Power-to-heat technologies. electric boilers and heat pumps are blocked by high tariffs and taxes. A calculation of the heat costs of different DH technologies demonstrates that. under the present price and tax conditions in Denmark and Sweden. CHP and power-to-heat are unable to compete with heat-only boilers that use tax-free biomass.,True,7K5b9bYAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC,19,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2981610,395578772311121708,/scholar?cites=395578772311121708,,,,0,0,0

Production and trade must be separated from the distribution network. which is still considered a natural monopoly. The main regulatory task will be to secure access on equal terms for competing suppliers. The Danish producers of combined heat and power can compete on an international market. and the existence of low cost producers in the other Nordic countries should make such a market contestable.

1261357,Use of electric vehicles or hydrogen in the Danish transport sector in 2050?,2017,Klaus Skytte and Amalia Pizarro and Kenneth B Karlsson,6,,1,e233,Wiley Periodicals. Inc.,Denmark has an ambitious long‐term goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector with an overall climate target to be independent of fossil‐fuel consumption by 2050. We compare a likely scenario with two alternative ways to achieve the goal—either with a high percentage of electric vehicles (EV) or with a high percentage of hydrogen use for transportation. The STREAM model—an energy scenario simulating tool—is used to model the different scenarios and their integration with the electricity and heating systems. The major findings are that an increased share of EV can reduce the socioeconomic cost of the energy system in 2050. However. electricity demand for H2 generation via electrolysis is more flexible than EV charging and the production can therefore. to a larger degree be used to out‐balance variable electricity surplus from a high share of wind energy in the power system …,True,7K5b9bYAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C,14,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wene.233,3742376274938063061,/scholar?cites=3742376274938063061,,,,0,0,0

This work proposes different approaches for the minimization of the heat flux on external tower receiver with surround field. The mathematical formulation is implemented in Matlab. while Delsol is used for the heliostat field modeling. Since the number of variables is very high. branching the original optimization problem in a set of sub-problems is a beneficial technique. Four approaches. based on this concept. are here proposed: they differ for the number of field sectors considered in the optimization process and on the heliostat projection modeling.

ORC has been proposed in the last 20 years as a reliable solution for the exploitation of these energy sources since the alternative represented by steam cycles leads to an inefficient conversion of such small available thermal powers. However. the use of organic fluids involves a number of safety and environmental issues. either related to fluid flammability (for hydrocarbons) or to their high Global Warming Potential (for halogenated fluids). and of limitations to the achievable cycle maximum temperature. due to fluids thermal decomposition.

In sCO 2 cycles the compression phase generally starts very close to the fluid critical point in a region characterized by significant real gas effects. so that depressurization. that is the typical operating strategy adopted for closed gas cycles. may not be the optimal one. In fact. a significant variation of fluid thermodynamic properties along the compression will occur with a probable penalization on the overall plant efficiency. A recuperative recompressed cycle with High Temperature Recuperator (HTR) achieving a cycle efficiency of 41.92% is designed and part-load performances of the overall power plant are analyzed also taking into account the boiler behavior. Different operating strategies are investigated considering the combinations of component features such as rotational speed and variable geometry at the inlet of turbomachinery. fan speed on the heat rejection unit. variation of the fluid inventory. The best operating strategy energy-wise is finally proposed. providing a numerical estimation of the off-design overall plant performance. highlighting some design criteria for boiler and turbomachinery.

Needs and Practices,2014,Stefan Bouzarovski and Saska Petrova and Sergio Tirado Herrero,,,2014-25,,SPRU-Science and Technology Policy Research. University of Sussex,This paper charts the emergent body of new approaches towards the research and amelioration of energy deprivation in the home. It starts from the premise that all forms of energy and fuel poverty–in developed and developing countries alike–are underpinned by a common condition: the inability to attain a socially-and materially-necessitated level of domestic energy services. Emphasizing the functionings and capabilities provided by energy use in the residential domain has led us to question binary divisions between the fields of ‘fuel poverty’and ‘energy poverty’within. respectively. the global North and South. In order to move towards an integrated understanding of energy service poverty. we rely on ‘systems of provision’paradigms to highlight the multiple socio-technical pathways that prevent the effective fulfilment of household energy needs. Based on such approaches. the paper identifies the main components and implications of ‘energy vulnerability’frameworks. whereby the driving forces of domestic energy deprivation are seen through a dynamic heuristic predicated upon issues of resilience and risk. Using recent developments in Hungary as an example. we employ energy vulnerability thinking to illustrate the systemic driving forces and implications of domestic energy deprivation.,True,N79lgHgAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,41,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2743143,13723105674350636059,/scholar?cites=13723105674350636059,,,,0,0,0

Most of these plants do not have a thermal storage system for maintaining the power block performance at nominal conditions during long non-insolation periods. Because of that. a proper solar field size. with respect to the electric nominal power. is a fundamental choice.

This new optical-geometric property sets upper bounds for the deviation of the reflected sunbeams. in relation to trajectories of the reference situation. It is observed that the maximum deviation depends on the width of the mirror. which must be limited for maximizing the optical efficiency.

1261442,A comparative analysis of configurations of linear Fresnel collectors for concentrating solar power,2014,María J Montes and Carlo Rubbia and Rubén Abbas and José M Martínez-Val,73,Energy,,192-203,Pergamon,Linear Fresnel collector arrays present some relevant advantages in the domain of concentrating solar power because of their simplicity. robustness and low capital cost. However. they also present important drawbacks and limitations. notably their average concentration ratio. which seems to limit significantly the performance of these systems.First. the paper addresses the problem of characterizing the mirror field configuration assuming hourly data of a typical year. in reference to a configuration similar to that of Fresdemo. For a proper comparative study. it is necessary to define a comparison criterion. In that sense. a new variable is defined. the useful energy efficiency. which only accounts for the radiation that impinges on the receiver with intensities above a reference value.

Integration of solar energy to the steam turbine of a combined cycle gives some advantages: the first one is the fuel saving due to the solar contribution and. additionally. the second one is that this contribution takes place especially in highly insolated periods with high ambient temperatures. when conventional combined cycles decrease their power rate and work with decreased efficiency.Previous works showed the convenience of ISCC using PTC and direct steam generation in locations with severe climatology.

Each one attempts to reduce losses coming from two respective sources. The systems are simulated and compared to a reference STPP.They consists on: (a) a double thermal energy storage (DTS) with different functionalities for each storage and (b) the subdivision of the solar collector field (SSF) into specialised sectors. so that each sector is designed to meet a thermal requirement. usually through an intermediate heat exchanger. This subdivision reduces the losses in the solar field by means of a decrease of the temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF).

Such applications present the requirement of appropriately designing the receiver active absorber surface. as the incident radiation flux can be very high. Besides that. the solar image in the receiver is not uniform. so conventional boilers designs are not well suited for these purposes. That point is particularly critical in solar central receivers systems (CRS). where concentrated solar flux is usually above 500 kW/m2. causing thermal and mechanical stress in the absorber panels.This paper analyzes a new thermofluidynamic design of a solar central receiver. which optimizes the heat transfer in the absorber surface.

The SAXS patterns of uniaxially oriented films are characterized by strong equatorial scattering peaks which are attributed to scattering arising from the oriented ionic domains (ionomer peak ca. q = 2 nm-1).

1261465,Electrical conductivity and relaxation in poly (3-hexylthiophene),2009,Jan Obrzut and Kirt A Page,80,Physical Review B,19,195211,American Physical Society,We studied the complex conductivity of regioregular poly (3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT) in the temperature range between 193–333 K (− 80 C to 60 C) and in the frequency range from the direct current (dc) to 12 GHz. The identified relaxation process was investigated by quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS). The dielectric loss peak extracted from complex conductivity corresponds to local molecular motions having an activation energy of about 9 kJ/mol. which agrees well with the QENS results. The molecular motions of the hexyl side groups in poly (3-hexylthiophene) contribute to this relaxation process in P3HT. which is coupled with a cooperative charge transport along the P3HT chains. In the cutoff frequency range. the real part of complex conductivity (σ′) gradually transitions to a frequency-independent conductivity (σ∝′). which is thermally activated.

Although this basic concept has been known for at least half a century. recent advances have led to the discoveriy of previously uncovered memory properties that challenge the traditional concept of shape memory polymers. In particular. a temperature memory effect refers to the capability of a polymer to memorize temperatures instead of shapes. Thus far. the reported temperature memory effect has been established under iso‐strain stress recovery conditions. in which the maximum recovery stress appears at a temperature roughly identical to the deformation temperature.

For statistical copolymers. the monomer sequence distribution and compositional heterogeneity in and among the copolymer chains have a profound influence on the behavior and physical properties of the material. 1 Measurement of monomer reactivity ratios. the key synthetic parameters for designing tailored copolymers. provides insight necessary to control monomer sequence; however. these parameters are timeconsuming and difficult to measure. 2 The standard method for measuring monomer reactivity ratios requires the synthesis and purification of a series of copolymers with a broad range of molar compositions followed by characterization (typically nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy). Often. the necessity to “artificially” limit conversion and extensive purification protocols result in intrinsic errors and poor reproducibility in the obtained kinetic parameters. Analogous to their bulk counterparts. statistical copolymer brushes result from the copolymerization of two monomers from surface-bound initiators. where the arrangement of monomers within the tethered chains is dictated by monomer reactivities.Because of the lack of segmental rearrangement (as observed in. eg. block copolymers3). these copolymer brush surfaces enable the expression of a statistical distribution of monomer constituents at the interface which reflect the distribution along the length of the tethered chains. 4. 5 Consequently. statistical copolymer brushes provide a platform for covalently “trapping” the copolymer composition …,True,43B7ch4AAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,20,https://www.academia.edu/download/40251864/Measurement_of_Reactivity_Ratios_in_Surf20151121-12165-g9ip58.pdf,11519831147264854529,/scholar?cites=11519831147264854529,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40251864/Measurement_of_Reactivity_Ratios_in_Surf20151121-12165-g9ip58.pdf,0,0,0

T1ρ. and T2 values of Nafion®. Because of a “homogenizing” of the T1's as a result of spin diffusion. it was not possible to resolve from the T1 experiments the relative motions of the side‐ and main‐chain. The initial increase in T1ρ as a function of increasing temperature has been attributed to backbone rotations that increase with increasing temperature. The maxima observed in the T1ρ plots suggest a change in the dominant relaxation mechanism at that temperature. The similarity in relaxation behavior of the side‐ and main‐chains suggests that the motions are dynamically coupled. because of the fact that the side‐chain is directly attached to the main‐chain.

Upon review of the literature. there seem to be two broad contributors that cause such a trend: those that are manifested by the effects of fuel property differences directly on in-cylinder processes and those that are manifested by the effects of fuel property differences on engine systems. thus rendering an indirect effect on in-cylinder processes. In this article. the former manifestations are called fundamental issues while the latter manifestations are called system response issues. Both can have significant impact on the magnitude and direction of nitrogen oxides emission differences between biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuels. This article has the objective to identify the distinction between fundamental and system response issues on nitric oxide emissions of biodiesel combustion in a …,True,MSym5h0AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,16,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468087411399215,15947454670417440571,/scholar?cites=15947454670417440571,,,,0,0,0

One issue that remains an area of investigation is the improvement of engine efficiency (i.e.. specific fuel consumption) for the novel mode of combustion. The objective of this article is to assess the several parameters (i.e.. friction. pumping work. combustion phasing. heat transfer rate. and combustion efficiency) that affect the brake fuel conversion efficiencies of a medium-duty diesel engine as its combustion mode is transitioned from conventional to low temperature. The analysis reveals that. in this study’s development of low temperature combustion. late combustion phasing is the primary factor causing a decrease in brake fuel conversion efficiency.

Two common devices that can be used to achieve high levels of EGR are an intake throttle and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). Because the two techniques affect the engine air system in different ways. local combustion conditions differ between the two in spite of. in some cases. having similar burn patterns in the form of heat release.

The internal combustion engine has multiple pathways for dissipating thermal energy; the engine’s exhaust is one that is conveniently accessible for converting to useful work via waste heat recovery. Coincident with increased waste heat recovery efforts. however. is increased engine efficiency improvement efforts. Anecdotally. an increase in engine efficiency will typically result in a decrease in exhaust exergy. thus decreasing the power capability of a waste heat recovery system. Further. other developments are taking place with internal combustion engines. such as the use of alternative fuels and combustion modes designed to decrease engine emissions. which may affect engine exergy.

1261512,The influence of soot radiation on NO emission in practical biodiesel combustion,2014,H Song and TJ Jacobs,128,Fuel,,281-287,Elsevier,This study is motivated by so-called “Biodiesel NOx Penalty”. which is the often reported increase in nitrogen oxides emissions with biodiesel. relative to petroleum diesel. Biodiesel also reportedly decreases exhaust soot concentrations via a reduction of soot formation during combustion. Soot is a known source of radiation heat transfer during diesel combustion. and can cause a reduction in flame temperature relative to non-sooting conditions. As NO formation is strongly dominated by high combustion temperature. the heat transfer from soot to surroundings can reduce NO formation. The primary objective of this study is to assess if a decrease in soot radiation with biodiesel fuel leads to the increase of NO emission. In the current study. a metallic fuel additive (barium). which is known to effectively reduce soot formation during combustion. is used to control the soot formation of both petroleum diesel and 100% palm …,True,MSym5h0AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236114002683,7186528726783593805,/scholar?cites=7186528726783593805,,,,0,0,0

Diesel engines. partly due to their conventional use of fuel-lean combustion processes. inherently emit relatively lower CO2 emissions than their gasoline engine counterparts. With the use of biodiesel fuel. diesel engines offer the potential to substantially reduce energy consumption [2] and atmospheric carbon emissions [3]. Biodiesel-fuelled engines. however. face interesting challenges. Related to engine performance. the typically lower heating value of biodiesel results in less torque for any given injector pulsewidth. If torque is matched (ie. longer pulsewidth). then this commonly equates to increased brake specific fuel consumption. These comparisons are richly reported in the literature (eg. Refs.[4–9]).

Two basic approaches to CCS are available.1.2 In one approach. CO2 is captured directly from the industrial source. concentrated into a nearly pure form. and then pumped deep underground for long-term storage (see Figure 1). As an alternative to storage in underground geological formations. it has also been suggested that CO2 could be stored in the ocean. This could be done either by dissolving it in the mid-depth ocean (1–3 km) or by forming pools of CO2 on the sea bottom where the ocean is deeper than 3 km and. consequently. CO2 is denser than seawater. The second approach to CCS captures CO2directly from the atmosphere by enhancing natural biological processes that sequester CO2 in plants. soils. and marine sediments.

Despite a decade of increasing political and societal focus on climate change and the milestone Paris Agreement, global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not been curbed, and the emissions gap is larger than ever. The challenges for the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit and for international climate change negotiations in 2019 are clear. Unless mitigation ambition and action increase substantially and immediately in the form of new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by 2020 and are reflected in ambitious long-term GHG development strategies, exceeding the 1.5° C goal can no longer be avoided, and achieving the well-below 2° C temperature goal becomes increasingly challenging.

The report addresses the complex issue of identifying synergies and tradeoffs between national priorities and mitigation policies. an issue that requires the integration of various disciplines so as to provide a comprehensive overview of future development trends. available technologies and economic policies. Further. the report suggests a new conceptual framework for treating the social aspects in assessing mitigation and adaptation costs in climate change studies. The impacts of certain sustainability indicators such as employment land poverty reduction on mitigation costing are also discussed in the report.

The FCCC requires that each signatory prepare and complete inventories of greenhouse gases. and it calls for each party to formulate. implement. publish and regularly update national programs containing measures to mitigate climate change. In addition. it states that the developing countries may propose projects for financing with an estimate of the incremental costs and benefits of reducing emissions. Another article of the Convention notes that developing country parties may seek funds from developed coutries for climate change mitigation activities.

This paper proposes a model of solar-powered charging stations for electric vehicles to mitigate problems encountered in China’s renewable energy utilization processes and to cope with the increasing power demand by electric vehicles for the near future. This study applies the proposed model to Shenzhen City to verify its technical and economic feasibility. Modeling results showed that the total net present value of a photovoltaic power charging station that meets the daily electricity demand of 4500 kWh is $3.579.236 and that the cost of energy of the combined energy system is $0.098/kWh. In addition. the photovoltaic powered electric vehicle model has pollutant reduction potentials of 99.8%. 99.7% and 100% for carbon dioxide. sulfur dioxide. and nitrogen oxides. respectively. compared with a traditional gasoline-fueled car. Sensitivity analysis results indicated that interest rate has a relatively strong influence on COE (Cost of Energy).

China needs to make more effort to develop renewable energy. This paper attempts to use portfolio theory to optimize China's overall energy system with considering the learning curve effect of renewable energy cost and the characteristic of fossil energy cost increasing over time. It also takes into account additional factors such as environmental costs of coal consumption and various growth rates of the cumulative R&D (research and development) capacity for solar power. This research has found that the development of renewable energy in China has tremendous potential but it will not replace fossil energy in the next decades.

Successful sharing must achieve enhanced utilization efficiency of DERs and. in the mean time. ensure voluntary participation of prosumers and a sharing-enabling aggregator. It is also desirable to incentivize the adoption of DERs. To fulfill these goals. we formulate a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) for DER valuation within a sharing community. The aggregator coordinates DER operations in real-time; then it solve this MPEC problem after each billing period. In doing so. the aggregator evaluates two operating costs for each prosumer: the actual cost under coordination and the counter-factual cost if the prosumer independently traded power with the aggregator.

1261568,From two competing oscillators to one coupled-clock pacemaker cell system,2015,Yael Yaniv and Edward G Lakatta and Victor A Maltsev,6,,,28,Frontiers,At the beginning of this century. debates regarding “what are the main control mechanisms that ignite the action potential (AP) in heart pacemaker cells” dominated the electrophysiology field. The original theory which prevailed for over 50 years had advocated that the ensemble of surface membrane ion channels (i.e.. “M clock”) is sufficient to ignite rhythmic APs. However. more recent experimental evidence in a variety of mammals has shown that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) acts as a “Ca2+ clock” rhythmically discharges diastolic local Ca2+ releases (LCRs) beneath the cell surface membrane. LCRs activate an inward current (likely that of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) that prompts the surface membrane “M clock” to ignite an AP. Theoretical and experimental evidence has mounted to indicate that this clock “crosstalk” operates on a beat-to-beat basis and determines both the AP firing rate and rhythm. Our review is focused on the evolution of experimental definition and numerical modeling of the coupled-clock concept. on how mechanisms intrinsic to pacemaker cell determine both the heart rate and rhythm. and on future directions to develop further the coupled-clock pacemaker cell concept.,True,I-utgx0AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,67,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2015.00028/full,1343391126180572395,/scholar?cites=1343391126180572395,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2015.00028/full,0,0,0

Two mechanisms have been suggested to serve as key regulators:(1) ADP and Pi concentrations—ATP utilization/hydrolysis in the cytosol increases ADP and Pi fluxes to mitochondria and hence the amount of available substrates for ATP production increases; and (2) Ca2+ concentration—ATP utilization/hydrolysis is coupled to changes in free cytosolic calcium and mitochondrial calcium. the latter controlling Ca 2+-dependent activation of mitochondrial enzymes taking part in ATP production.

Cardiomyocyte mitochondria are micron-sized. fluid-filled passive spheres distributed throughout the cell in a crystal-like lattice. arranged in pairs sandwiched between the sarcomere contractile machinery. both longitudinally and radially. Their shape represents the extant 3-dimensional (3D) force-balance. We developed a novel method to examine mitochondrial 3D-deformation in response to contraction and relaxation to understand how dynamic forces are balanced inside cardiomyocytes. The variation in transmitted light intensity induced by the periodic lattice of myofilaments alternating with mitochondrial rows can be analyzed by Fourier transformation along a given cardiomyocyte axis to measure mitochondrial deformation along that axis. This technique enables precise detection of changes in dimension of ∼1% in ∼1 µm (long-axis) structures with 8 ms time-resolution. During active contraction (1 Hz stimulation). mitochondria deform along the length- and width-axes of the cell with similar deformation kinetics in both sarcomere and mitochondrial structures. However. significant deformation anisotropy (without hysteresis) was observed between the orthogonal short-axes (i.e.. width and depth) of mitochondria during electrical stimulation.

While IVA inhibits I f. this effect has been reported at essentially unphysiological voltages. ie. those more negative than the spontaneous diastolic depolarization (DD) between action potentials (APs). We tested the relative potency of IVA to block I f over a wide range of membrane potentials. including those that encompass DD governing to the SANC spontaneous firing rate. A clinically relevant IVA concentration of 3 μM to single. isolated rabbit SANC slowed the spontaneous AP firing rate by 15%. During voltage clamp the maximal I f was 18±3 pA/pF (at− 120 mV) and the maximal I f reduction by IVA was 60±8% observed at− 92±4 mV. At the maximal diastolic depolarization (~− 60 mV) I f amplitude was only− 2.9±0.4 pA/pF. and was reduced by only 41±6% by IVA. Thus. I f amplitude and its inhibition by IVA at physiologically relevant membrane potentials are substantially less than that at unphysiological (hyperpolarized) membrane potentials.

The brain modulates SANC automaticity. via the autonomic nervous system. by stimulating membrane receptors that activate (adrenergic) or inactivate (cholinergic) adenylyl cyclase (AC). However. these opposing afferents are not simply additive. We showed that activation of adrenergic signaling increases AC-cAMP/PKA signaling. which mediates the increase in the SANC AP firing rate (i.e.. positive chronotropic modulation). However. there is a limited understanding of the underlying internal pacemaker mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between cholinergic receptors and the decrease in the SANC AP firing rate (i.e.. negative chronotropic modulation). We hypothesize that changes in AC-cAMP/PKA activity are crucial for mediating either decrease or increase in the AP firing rate and that the change in rate is due to both internal and membrane mechanisms. In cultured adult rabbit pacemaker cells infected with an adenovirus expressing the FRET sensor AKAR3.

This high-throughput signaling consumes ATP.  Aims We have previously demonstrated that basal AC-cAMP/PKA signaling directly. and Ca2+ indirectly. regulate mitochondrial ATP production. While. clearly. Ca2+-calmodulin-CaMKII activity regulates ATP consumption. whether it has a role in the control of ATP production is unknown.   Methods and Results We superfused single. isolated rabbit SANC at 37°C with physiological saline containing CaMKII inhibitors. (KN-93 or autocamtide-2 Related Inhibitory Peptide (AIP)). or a calmodulin inhibitor (W-7) and measured cytosolic Ca2+. flavoprotein fluorescence and spontaneous AP firing rate. We measured cAMP. ATP and O2 consumption in cell suspensions. Graded reductions in basal CaMKII activity by KN-93 (0.5–3 µmol/L) or AIP (2–10 µmol/L) markedly slow the kinetics of intracellular Ca2+ cycling. decrease the spontaneous AP firing rate. decrease cAMP. and reduce O2 consumption and flavoprotein fluorescence. In this context of graded reductions in ATP demand. however. ATP also becomes depleted. indicating reduced ATP production.

Its lighting system provides 24 h of artificial sources only. with a higher amount of electric power used during the day. Due to safety reasons. when there is natural lighting outside the tunnel. the lighting levels in the stretches right after the entrance and before the exit must be high. in order to guide the driver’s eye towards the middle of the tunnel where the luminance must guarantee safe driving. avoid any over-dimensioning of the lighting systems. and produce energy savings. Such effects can be reached not only through the technological advances in the field of artificial lighting sources with high luminous efficiency. but also through new materials for road paving characterized by a higher reflection coefficient than other ordinary asphalts. This case study examines different technical scenarios. analyzing and comparing possible energy and economic savings. Traditional solutions are thus compared with scenarios suggesting the solutions previously mentioned. Special asphalts are interesting from an economic point of view. whereas the high costs of LED sources nowadays represent an obstacle for their implementation.

However the indices used for its evaluation were usually developed for indoor environments assuming still air conditions and absence of solar radiation and were only later adapted to outdoor spaces. For this reason. in a previous study the Mediterranean Outdoor Comfort Index (MOCI) was developed. which is an empirical index able to estimate the thermal perception of people living in the Mediterranean area. In this study it was compared numerically (by using the data obtained through a field survey) with other selected thermal indices. This comparison. performed in terms of Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient. association Gamma. percentage of correct predictions and cross-tabulation analysis. led to identify the MOCI as the most suitable index to examine outdoor thermal comfort in the interested area. As a matter of fact it showed a total percentage of correct predictions of 35.5%.

An example is the double skin façade which is directly exposed to solar radiation. This approach may be present in many residential buildings and is commonly called a “solar chimney”. Often this solution collides with architectural requirements. primarily when the building is not in a favorable condition in terms of exposure to the south. The purpose of the present study is to numerically investigate the performance of an alternative type of solar chimney which is integrated into the frame of a residential building and heated from below by a horizontal plate that acts as a thermal storage.

A useful solution is to identify the energy performance of buildings through the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). as it provides information for the comparison of buildings with different architectural typology. shape. design technology and geographic location. However. this tool does not assess the real energy consumption of the building and does not always take into account its impact on the environment. In this work. two different types of analysis were carried out: one based only on the energy efficiency and the other one based on the environmental impact. Those analyses were applied on a standard building. set in three different Italian locations. with the purpose of obtaining cross-related information. After the evaluation of the results. interventions on some parameters (walls insulation. windows frame. filler gas in the insulated glazing) have been identified in order to improve the energy behavior of the building with an acceptable environmental impact. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology that integrates the EPC with green building rating systems. leading to a more conscious choice of retrofit interventions as a compromise between energy performances and environmental impact.

Some past researches demonstrated how some devices. useful to this purpose. follow the principles of solar chimneys and are able to move air masses while exploiting the Archimedes thrust. The natural ventilation must be supplied by a flow moving upward. generated by a heat source performing at temperatures slightly higher than the one present in the environment. To have a minimum energetic effect. the heat can be extracted from solar ponds; solar ponds are able to collect and store solar energy in the geographical regions characterized by sufficient values of solar radiation. Thus it is possible. in summer. to provoke a nocturnal natural ventilation useful for the air change in indoor spaces (in those climatic areas where. during the night. there is a temperature gradient).

This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli. a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300-Part1. which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope. based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the non-alteration of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25%. This work shows how it is possible to improve the energy performance of an existing building achieving a significant energy saving with the respect of the building architecture. shape. function and the surrounding landscape.

They are comprised of arrangements of policygoals and policy means matched through some decision-making process. These policy-making efforts can be more. or less. systematic in attempting to match ends and means in a logical fashion or can result from much less systematicprocesses.“Policy design” implies a knowledge-based process in which the choice of means or mechanisms throughwhich policy goals are given effect follows a logical process of inference from known or learned relationships betweenmeans and outcomes. This includes both design in which means are selected in accordance with experience andknowledge and that in which principles and relationships are incorrectly or only partially articulated or understood. Policydecisions can be careful and deliberate in attempting to best resolve a problem or can be highly contingent anddriven by situational logics. Decisions stemming from bargaining or opportunism can also be distinguished from thosewhich result from careful analysis and assessment.

The concept of ecoagriculture emerged from the recognition that these demands could be met only if addressed in concert based on land use systems that advance multiple goals in the same geographic space.In this context. ecoagriculture is a vision for improving human management of the land and natural resource base so that it simultaneously meets three goals:(a) conserving a full complement of native biodiversity and ecosystem services.(b) providing agricultural products and services on a sustainable basis. and (c) supporting viable livelihoods for local people. The concept frames an approach for managing natural areas and agricultural landscapes in complementary ways. Empirically. ecoagriculture is predicated on a growing body of evidence that tradeoffs among conservation. food production. and livelihoods are not always necessary. Instead. significant synergies are achievable using known and emerging management techniques. Ecoagriculture is already being practiced in hundreds of locations worldwide. with promising results for regions where biodiversity conservation. food production. and poverty alleviation are all high priorities.

Each chapter provides a multi-topic overview of the state of knowledge on how. why. where or when policies are designed and how such designs can be improved. These experts address how a new emphasis on effective policy design has re-emerged​ in public policy studies in recent years​ and​ clarify the role of historical policy decisions. policy capacities and government intentions in promoting a design orientation towards​ policy formulation and policy-making more generally. They examine many previously unexplored aspects of policy designs and designing activities. which focus upon analyzing and improving the sets of policy tools adopted by governments to correct policy problems. Ranging from the fundamentals of policy design and its place in greater policy studies. to new questions regarding policy design content and​ effectiveness. to contemporary design trends such as the use of digital tools and big data. the Routledge Handbook of Policy Design is a comprehensive reference for students and scholars of public policy. public administration and public management. government and business.,True,SoLSaMUAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,31,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=VE8PEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:TAXsUNbaJdQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=mi5-XzrVSx&sig=2ubWuS2YT4-Jykg24X8Vz1x3PRA,15286865124194518348,/scholar?cites=15286865124194518348,,,,0,0,0

1261632,Policy design: From tools to patches,2017,Michael Howlett and Ishani Mukherjee,60,Canadian Public Administration,1,140,Wiley: 12 months,Policy design involves the purposive attempt by governments to link policy instruments or tools to the goals they would like to realize. The study of policy design focuses on these tools. their advantages and disadvantages and better understanding the processes around their selection and deployment in order to improve policy-making efforts and outcomes. The roadmap for the development of this approach to the policy sciences stretches from early works in public policy studies around the identification of policy tools and the classification of instrument types in the 1960s and early 1970s (Design 1.0). to present-day studies that strive to effectively formulate effective and context-appropriate policy alternatives given the specific historical legacies and political realities in which policy selection and implementation takes place (Design 2.0). Canadians have been leaders in both eras. with many well-known works on policy tools as well as more recent works on policy design written by Canadian authors. This contribution sets out five key sets of articles in each era in this field. featuring a major work in the discipline and a matching article from Canada in each time period examined.

1261634,Policy formulation: where knowledge meets power in the policy process,2017,Michael Howlett and Ishani Mukherjee,,,,,Edward Elgar Publishing,Public policies emanate from societies’ efforts to affect changes in their own institutional or public behaviour in order to achieve some end goal key policy actors consider to be important. Such policies are determined by governments but involve other actors and institutions–private. commercial. family and others–in often complex governance and governing arrangements and relationships (Howlett & Ramesh. 2016). Policy formulation is part of the process of developing public policies and involves governments and other policy actors asking and answering questions about how societies can deal with various kinds of problems and conditions affecting citizens and organizations in the pursuit of their goals. These questions vary in range and scope. but addressing them typically involves deliberations among a wide range of actors about what kinds of activities governments can undertake. and what kinds of policy …,True,SoLSaMUAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,17,https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781784719319/9781784719319.00006.xml,3270238826698645058,/scholar?cites=3270238826698645058,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b457/b638f161f7b18c39d9d01ca7c662622fa537.pdf,0,0,0

If so. what does it look like. and why does it take the shape it does? This article argues that in the newly reinvigorated emphasis of policy studies on policy instruments and their design lies the basis of an analysis of a dominant policy style in the Asian region. with significant implications for understanding the roles played by specific kinds of policy capacities. There is a distinctly Asian policy style based on a specific pattern of policy capacities and governance modes. In this style. a failure to garner initial policy legitimacy in the articulation of instrument norms often results in later mismatches between instrument objectives and specific mechanisms for their achievement.

It is often presented as an easy and low-cost intervention to alter individual behavior. However. there is limited insight into the cost effectiveness of these attempts and the impact of inserting behavioral policy instruments into an existing mix of traditional tools in a particular policy sector. Furthermore. there has been little focus on the intersection of large behavioral datasets and how they could complement behavioral insights. We present a conceptual overview of how the intersection of big data and behavioral knowledge would work in the renewable energy sector.

Comparative policy studies have contributed much towards clarifying the nature of the processes of policy analysis and policy formulation which result in the construction of these policy portfolios.

In climate policy specifically. different degrees and types of uncertainties pose a challenge to policymakers. Policy entrepreneurs and the combination of their analytical. operational and political competences are a relevant component in reducing ambiguity in policy design and translating broad policy goals to operational programmes and specific policy instruments. Using the case of the European Emission Trading Scheme. we suggest that the success of policy entrepreneurs in catalysing policy change is determined by their capacity to work against multiple kinds of uncertainty. This ‘uncertainty mitigating’ capacity on the part of policy entrepreneurs rests significantly on balancing managerial expertise and political acumen.

In the contemporary discourse of policy design. effectiveness has taken on a more foundational meaning that goes beyond what is understood as only the attainment of specific policy goals. Rather. it has come to occupy a central position in the study of policy design. signifying the broader logic of deliberate policy action used to articulate policy problems and present alternative ways of addressing them.

The overheating of a surface exposed to sunlight can be reduced by improving solar reflectance. In this sense. several studies have demonstrated the positive effect of cool materials on UHI mitigation.In addition to traditional cool materials. retroreflective (RR) materials have been recently proposed for this application. The present paper aims at the assessment of angular reflectance of RR films for several inclination angles of solar radiation. To reproduce variation of solar radiation’s inclination during the daytime. an ad hoc experimental setup was designed and used. Characterization of RR materials when hit by solar radiation with different inclinations allows to assess their behaviour on daytime if used as novel urban coatings for mitigation of the UHI …,True,ElyeYPsAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C,123,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261915001683,1655538361159975837,/scholar?cites=1655538361159975837,,,,0,0,0

Moreover. to meet the goal to replace 30% of fossil fuel by biofuels by 2030. a huge amount of lignin will soon be produced. The first major step involved to add value to the unconverted lignin is its separation from other biomass constituents to give high purity lignin. In this current work. extraction of lignin from a bio-residue (containing ca. 40% lignin) from second generation bioethanol production is presented. The biomass chosen is Arundo donax L.

Solar energy production generally does not match with energy demand because of its intermittent and non-programmable nature. entailing the adoption of storage technologies. Hydrogen constitutes a chemical storage for renewable electricity if it is produced by water electrolysis and is also the key reactant for CO 2 methanation (Sabatier reaction). The utilization of CO 2 as a feedstock for producing methane contributes to alleviate global climate changes and sequestration related problems. The produced methane is a carbon neutral gas that fits into existing infrastructure and allows issues related to the aforementioned intermittency and non-programmability of solar energy to be overcome. In this paper. an experimental apparatus. composed of an electrolyzer and a tubular fixed bed reactor. is built and used to produce methane via Sabatier reaction. The objective of the experimental campaign is the evaluation of the process performance and a comparison with other CO 2 valorization paths such as methanol production. The investigated pressure range was 2–20 bar. obtaining a methane volume fraction in outlet gaseous mixture of 64.75% at 8 bar and 97.24% at 20 bar. with conversion efficiencies of. respectively. 84.64% and 99.06%.

Typical. cost effective. cool roof solutions are not applicable to these buildings due to important constraints deriving from:(i) the owners of homes with roofs visible from the ground level;(ii) the regulation about the preservation of the historic architecture and the minimization of the visual environment impact. in particular in historic centers. In this perspective. the present paper deals with the development of high reflective coatings with the purpose to elaborate “cool” tiles with the same visual appearance of traditional tiles for application to historic buildings. Integrated experimental analyses of reflectance. emittance. and superficial temperature were carried out. Deep analysis of the reflectance spectra is undertaken to evaluate the effect of different mineral pigments. binders. and an engobe basecoat. Two tile typologies are investigated: substrate-basecoat-topcoat three-layer tile and substrate-topcoat two-layer tile. The main results show that the developed coatings are able to increase the overall solar reflectance by more than 20% with acceptable visual appearance. suitable for application in historic buildings. Additionally. the effect of a substrate engobe layer allows some further contribution to the increase of the overall reflectance characteristics.

The present work aims at studying the application of clathrate hydrates as PCMs in buildings. Clathrate hydrates are crystalline structures in which guest molecules are enclosed in the crystal lattice of water molecules. Clathrate hydrates can form also at ambient pressure and present a high latent heat. and for this reason. they are good candidates for being used as PCMs. The parameter that makes a PCM suitable to be used in buildings is. first of all. a melting temperature at about 25 C. The paper provides an overview of groups of clathrate hydrates. whose physical and chemical characteristics could meet the requirements needed for their application in buildings. Simulations with a dynamic building simulation tool are carried out to evaluate the performance of clathrate hydrates in enhancing thermal comfort through the moderation of summer temperature swings and. therefore. in reducing energy consumption. Simulations suggest that clathrate hydrates have a potential in terms of improvement of indoor thermal comfort and a reduction of energy consumption for cooling. Cooling effects of 0.5 C and reduced overheating hours of up to 1.1% are predicted.

Several energy storage technologies have been studied to find a solution to these issues. In particular. compressed air energy storage (CAES) plants work by pumping and storing air into a vessel or in an underground cavern; then when energy is needed. the pressurized air is expanded in an expansion turbine. Several CAES configurations have been proposed: diabatic. adiabatic and isothermal. The isothermal process seems to be the most promising to improve the overall efficiency. It differs from conventional CAES approaches as it employs near-isothermal compression and expansion. Currently. there are no commercial isothermal CAES implementations worldwide. but several methods are under investigation. In this paper. the use of phase change materials (PCM) for isothermal air expansion is discussed. Air expansion tests in presence of PCM were carried out in a high-pressure vessel in order to analyze the effect of PCM on the process. Results show that in presence of PCM near isothermal expansion conditions occur and therefore they affect positively the value of the obtainable expansion work.

Constraints such as the lack of space. especially within the historical centers and architectural peculiarities. make the application of technologies for renewable energy production and storage a challenging issue. This study presents a prototype system consisting of using the renewable energy from a photovoltaic (PV) array to compress air for a later expansion to produce electricity when needed. The PV-integrated small-scale compressed air energy storage system is designed to address the architectural constraints. It is located in the unoccupied basement of the building. An energy analysis was carried out for assessing the performance of the proposed system. The novelty of this study is to introduce experimental data of a CAES (compressed air energy storage) prototype that is suitable for dwelling applications as well as integration accounting for architectural constraints. The simulation. which was carried out for an average summer day. shows that the compression phase absorbs 32% of the PV energy excess in a vessel of 1.7 m 3. and the expansion phase covers 21.9% of the dwelling energy demand. The electrical efficiency of a daily cycle is equal to 11.6%. If air is compressed at 225 bar instead of 30 bar. 96.0% of PV energy excess is stored in a volume of 0.25 m 3. with a production of 1.273 kWh. which is 26.0% of the demand.

Many researches have been done to look at design efficiencies and operational controls for improving energy performance of buildings. but very few study the impacts of HVAC systems maintenance. Different practices of HVAC system maintenance can result in substantial differences in building energy use. If a piece of HVAC equipment is not well maintained. its performance will degrade. If sensors used for control purpose are not calibrated. not only building energy usage could be dramatically increased. but also mechanical systems may not be able to satisfy indoor thermal comfort. Properly maintained HVAC systems can operate efficiently. improve occupant comfort. and prolong equipment service life. In the paper. maintenance practices for HVAC systems are presented based on literature reviews and discussions with HVAC engineers. building operators. facility managers. and commissioning agents. We categorize the maintenance practices into three levels depending on the maintenance effort and coverage: 1) proactive. performance-monitored maintenance; 2) preventive. scheduled maintenance; and 3) reactive. unplanned or no maintenance. more»,True,vf17MokAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,26,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1172116,10410091201975065445,/scholar?cites=10410091201975065445,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1172116,0,0,0

ARCHITECTURAL INSTITUTE OF KOREA (AIK). ARCHITECTURAL SOCIETY OF CHINA (ASC),Heat transfer process and natural ventilation driven by a solar chimney attached to a sidewall of building are investigated with CFD technique (MITFLOW) in detail. In this paper. conditions and parameters studied in the modelling study are the cavity width of the solar chimney. the wall temperature. the height and breadth of the solar chimney. the ratio of outlet area to inlet area as well as the outlet location of the solar chimney. The ranges of calculation parameters focused on a solar chimney with single-sided solar collector (single-sided heated wall) cover following conditions: solar chimney length L= 0.5 m~ 5.0 m. breadth B= 0.1 m~ 0.5 m. height H= 2.0 m~ 5.0 m. and B/H= 0.05~ 0.25. Heated wall surface temperature Tw is changed in the range of 30 C~ 70 C; the ratio of the outlet area to inlet area A r is changed in the range of 0.6~ 1.0. It is found that for given building geometry and inlet areas. there is an optimum cavity width at which a maximum airflow rate can be achieved. Based on the prediction. the airflow rate reaches maximum when B/H is approximately 1/10. It is also found that for given chimney geometry. solar chimney ventilation flow rate can be increased with the enhancement of chimney height only the cross sectional area no more than the critical area. because cross section area has a strong effect on the transitional and/or turbulent convective heat transfer in an enclosure. From the view of economy technology. the optimized height of a solar chimney can be determined according to the optimized section ratio of breadth to height and available breadth in practice.

Solar chimney system can be used to enhance the natural ventilation effectiveness. which can make full use of solar energy to produce upward momentum to a mass of air. thereby converting the thermal energy into kinetic energy. In this paper. a numerical study has been carried out to predict mass flow rate. temperature field and velocity field for vertical roof solar chimney under steady-state conditions. Suggestions for optimum construction design of solar chimney have been put forward based on large numbers of simulation results. Results showed that for vertical roof solar chimney with both ends open. the optimum gap-toheight ratio 1/2 was found in the range of chimney gaps investigated. compared with Trombe wall optimum ratio 1/10. The predicted ventilation rate increases with solar radiation and solar chimney height. Meanwhile. reverse flow can be observed at the outlet when the chimney gap increased to a certain value.

Berkeley. CA (United States),This paper presents a new model to simulate energy performance of variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems in heat pump operation mode (either cooling or heating is provided but not simultaneously). The main improvement of the new model is the introduction of the evaporating and condensing temperature in the indoor and outdoor unit capacity modifier functions. The independent variables in the capacity modifier functions of the existing VRF model in EnergyPlus are mainly room wet-bulb temperature and outdoor dry-bulb temperature in cooling mode and room dry-bulb temperature and outdoor wet-bulb temperature in heating mode. The new approach allows compliance with different specifications of each indoor unit so that the modeling accuracy is improved. The new VRF model was implemented in a custom version of EnergyPlus 7.2. This paper first describes the algorithm for the new VRF model. which is then used to simulate the energy performance of a VRF system in a Prototype House in California that complies with the requirements of Title 24? the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards.

1261732,The impact of biomass consumption on CO2 emissions: Cointegration analyses with regime shifts,2012,Faik Bilgili,16,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,7,5349-5354,Pergamon,The source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has been of great interest to researcher(s) and/or policy maker(s) within ongoing efforts to diminish the emissions in the world due to CO2's serious adverse environmental effect. This paper investigates the possible existence of long run relationship between CO2 emissions and biomass consumption in US for the period January 1990–September 2011. To this end. paper first seeks for effect of biomass on CO2 through energy literature and later follows cointegration analyses with structural breaks to reveal parameter estimates of long run equilibrium of CO2 with fossil fuel consumption and biomass consumption. Eventually this paper explores that structural breaks are important to understand the course of CO2 and that. as expected. fossil fuel and biomass effect CO2 positively and negatively. respectively.

The classical-Harrodian model developed in Moudud (2000. 1999). which is an extension of Shaikh (1995. 1992. 1991). provides a demonstration of dynamic fiscal policy context. It asserts that the there is a crowding in of output growth in the short run. In the long run. however. the impact of government spending is subject to change under some circumstances of capital utilization. normal profit rate and social savings rate.  Blinder and Solow (1973). using IS-LM model. reveal that bond-financed fiscal expansion does not engender a complete crowding out. Friedman (1978. 1985) notices the possibility of crowding-in. Crowding-out or crowding-in debate can be extended to other economists. Blanchard and Perotti (1999) and Easterly and Rebelo (1993) reach crowding-in results. Bairam and Ward (1993) find crowding-out of private investment. Barro (1989. 1999) and Kormendi and Meguire (1985) obtain either a negative or no effect of government spending on the growth. whereas the works of Argimon et al. (1997). Devarajan et al.

The amount of water deposited on the above-grade building envelope by driving rain is generally larger than any other source. including condensation. in almost all cases. Rain deposition can result in staining. leakage. dimensional change. freeze-thaw damage. leaching. efflorescence. and biological deterioration. Water penetration of the cladding can cause similar problems within a wall. Vapour diffusion can also move water that penetrates or is stored in the cladding inward where it can cause serious wetting of framing. sheathing. etc.(Straube et al 1998a).Despite the importance of driving rain to building performance. there is a lack of quantitative data relating to the magnitude. duration. and frequency of rain deposition of on buildings.

1261754,Interior insulation retrofits of load-bearing masonry walls in cold climates,2007,John Straube and Chris Schumacher,2,,2,42-50,College Publishing,Reducing the energy consumption of buildings has become increasingly imperative because of the combined demands of energy security. rising energy costs. and the need to reduce the environmental damage associated with energy consumption. A significant amount of research has developed guidance and technology to assist designers and owners in significantly reducing the energy consumption of new buildings.

1261755,Assessing the freeze-thaw resistance of clay brick for interior insulation retrofit projects,2010,John Straube and Christopher Schumacher and Peter Mensinga,15,Proceedings of the performances of envelopes of whole buildings XI,,1-8,,Older load-bearing brick masonry buildings are common throughout North America and are considered good candidates for renovation and conversion. Insulation retrofits are typically implemented as part of this work. The addition of insulation can change the thermal and moisture balance in the wall assembly and. in some cases. initiate moisture problems such as freeze-thaw damage in masonry units.Designers have used 2D heat flow and 1D dynamic hygrothermal models to predict the temperature and moisture conditions in these retrofitted wall assemblies. Unfortunately. there are few guidelines for assessing the susceptibility of clay brick to freeze-thaw problems. Two pass/fail tests have been used in the past to assess the freeze-thaw resistance of bricks: the cold water/boiling water absorption ratio (c/b ratio). and the 50-cycle freeze-thaw test. These approaches do not adequately represent the freezing mechanisms or conditions that bricks experience in the field.,True,4FNaoWUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,46,https://www.buildingscience.com/sites/default/files/migrate/pdf/CP-1013_Assessing_Freeze_Thaw_Resistance_Clay_Brick_Insulation_Retrofit.pdf,7074211287462341905,/scholar?cites=7074211287462341905,,,https://www.buildingscience.com/sites/default/files/migrate/pdf/CP-1013_Assessing_Freeze_Thaw_Resistance_Clay_Brick_Insulation_Retrofit.pdf,0,0,0

Recently completed field and laboratory research has shown that cladding ventilation has the potential to increase drying and reduce wetting from absorptive claddings and sun-driven moisture.The use of one-dimensional hygrothermal simulation software has been well established for a wide range of wall and roof assemblies. However the use of such software has previously had a limited ability to accurately model the physics of enclosures with ventilated claddings. The most recent version of WUFI 4.1 (a widely used hygrothermal simulation package) has added the ability to model enclosure systems that incorporate embedded sources and sinks of moisture and heat.

West Conshohocken. PA,In the design of modern engineered buildings it is customary to use a variety of mathematical models to simulate the performance of the structural system and the service (HVAC) systems. Structural. mechanical. and electrical engineers use various different mathematical models to analyze the response of the modeled system or subsystem and then improve. adjust. or revise the system as needed until a final design is arrived at. Analysis. even crude analysis and. perhaps. with more than one model. is necessary to design a new facility or subsystem as well as to assess an existing building or part thereof.The building industry is moving toward a similar situation with building enclosures. However. we in North America still have some way to go in developing a professional consensus on which models are to be preferred. what analysis procedures are cost and qualitatively effective. and how to develop the necessary experience to use these models properly. Rapidly changing technologies. eg. materials and interior building environments. combined with higher expectations of performance for both the enclosure and the building. have created a very real need for the development and use of practical hygrothermal analysis methods. This chapter will provide some background and a brief overview of the various building hygrothermal analysis methods.

1261766,Assessing the Durability Impacts of Energy Efficient En-closure Upgrades using Hygrothermal Modeling,1991,John Straube and Christopher Schumacher,,,,,,Increased energy costs. decreasing energy security and fossil fuel reserves. and a growing awareness of the environmental impact of energy use in buildings has resulted in a renewed interest in energy efficiency. Space heating (and even cooling) of buildings is a major consumer of energy. and energy flows through the opaque vertical enclosure (walls) can be responsible for 20 to 50% of the heating/cooling load. There is a growing number of large masonry buildings built in Canada before the middle of the century that owners wish to renovate. Historical significance. increased energy costs. re-urbanization of city centers. and enhanced appreciation of traditional building architecture have generated the need.A common potential retrofit option considered that can reduce energy consumption in this type of building is an interior retrofit that increases wall insulation and air tightness levels. Such retrofits also allow for a renewal of the interior finishes and distribution of services. important features in creating more useful buildings. It is desirable if renovations of any type can improve durability. indoor air quality. and comfort. Although exterior insulation retrofits are often much easier to design and easily meet most performance objectives. they change the appearance of the exterior and hence are usually not acceptable.

1261776,Dynamic equalization during charging of serial energy storage elements,1993,Douglas C Hopkins and Charles R Mosling and Stephen T Hung,29,IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications,2,363-368,IEEE,A technique is described that equalizes the amount of charge in a serial string of energy-storage cells during charging by using DC-to-DC converters to divert portions of the charging current past selected cells (or groups of cells). When no converters are operating. the charging current through the string is equal to that of the charging source. As the string charges. one cell eventually reaches a threshold voltage V/sub A/. At threshold. a shunt converter is activated to divert current around the cell. thus maintaining it at V/sub A/.

One difficulty with charging serial cells is maintaining equal charge in all cells regardless of the charging conditions and initial condition of the cells. Continual unequal charging and discharging eventually causes certain cells to degrade rapidly and limits the energy capacity and lifetime of the string. To minimize unequal charging. battery manufacturers use extensive measures to match cells. Though the cells are guaranteed to match initially. aging and unpredictable charging and discharging leave longterm matching speculative. Described is a technique that uses dc-dc converters to shunt energy from cells (or groups of cells) while the entire string of cells is being charged. The amount of charging of each cell can be controlled by varying the amount of diverted energy.

A methodological procedure is developed and applied to two biomass fuels (cacao shells and olive cake) for producing high heating rate chars and characterizing their reactivity and morphology after the first steps of devolatilization. Different chars are produced in a drop tube reactor (rapid pyrolysis) by varying the nominal temperature and the residence time. Oxidation in air is performed to compare typical temperatures and kinetic parameters and evaluate the effect of the operating conditions on char reactivity.

1261876,Prediction of rapid biomass devolatilization yields with an upgraded version of the Bio-CPD model,2008,G Vizzini and A Bardi and Enrico Biagini and M Falcitelli and Leonardo Tognotti,,Combustion Institute Italian section,,,,Biomass represents renewable energy source. that curb the emissions of SOx. NOx and heavy metals. Biomass is a near CO2-neutral fuel. that can be used in pyrolysis. gasification. combustion and co-combustion to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. The direct combustion of biomass feedstocks is problematic and scarcely applied for power generation. especially because of technological (low heating value. flame instability due to the high reactivity and volatile matter content. fouling. slagging. and corrosion phenomena) and economical problems. Other processes usually find a practical application. namely. cocombustion. pyrolysis. and gasification. Devolatilization is the first step in all thermal processes and it produces a large amount and a variety of volatile species and a solid residue. Therefore. besides experimental characterization of biomass devolatilization products. the development of predictive numerical models is still a goal of primary importance for both improving and designing industrial processes. This work introduces an upgraded version of a network devolatilization model. called bio-CPD [1]. for the rapid pyrolysis of biomass feedstocks. Respect to the other affirmed network models such as the bio-FG DVC [2] and bio-FLASHCHAIN [3]. the formulation of bio-CPD is more sophisticated.

From the 1990s. this relationship has gained a position in environmental policy as well. De-coupling the use of natural resources from economic growth has been set as one of the policy goals in the sixth Environmental Action Programme by the European Commission. In the scientific discussion. the concept of environmental Kuznets curve deals closely with the de-coupling or de-linking phenomenon. Aggregated material flows. on the other hand. have often been considered as a macro-level proxy of environmental degradation.

Synergy is interaction among two or more actions. which will lead to an impact greater or less than the sum of individual effects. Therefore. synergy can be positive or negative (trade-off). This paper aims at developing an analytical framework to evaluate sectoral linkages and examine potential synergies and trade-offs among various SDGs’ goals and targets. Synergies and trade-offs related to energy access (SDG7). clean water and sanitation access (SDG6). food security and sustainable agriculture (SDG2) and poverty alleviation (SDG1) have been evaluated from the perspective of developing countries using examples from South Asia (Bangladesh. Nepal. and Sri Lanka) and Sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana. Ethiopia and Rwanda). and historical data for the period between 1990 and 2012. The analytical framework includes both qualitative and quantitative methods. Network analysis technique has been used for exploring the conceptual linkage among different indicators. and capturing the targets associated with SDGs. Advanced Sustainability Analysis (ASA) developed under the European framework programme has been used for quantifying the synergies and trade-offs among sustainability indicators.

The traditional approach to monitoring these changes considers economic. societal and environmental sustainability. A strong case has been made. however. that a fourth dimension. ethical. should also be considered. Conventionally. two main strategies have been used to assess the improvements in sustainability: efficiency and sufficiency. Efficiency is usually linked with technological improvements. and sufficiency is connected with a reduction in production or consumption. We introduce a third strategy to the analysis; namely consistency that is related mainly to the ethical dimension of sustainability.

The reasons and driving forces behind the changes are studied in the article using a complete decomposition methodology. The decomposition analysis explains energy use or CO2 emissions with three different factors: activity effect. structural effect and intensity effect. The authors provide an analysis of dynamic changes of energy consumption and CO2 emission flows. Intensity effects on energy use and CO2 emissions revealed large differences in the performance of ASEAN countries.

One of these methods is the ‘contraction and convergence’ approach. which defines emission permits on the basis of converging per capita emissions under a contracting global emission profile. The approach is unique in its simplicity. Only two major issues need to be negotiated and agreed upon: the target atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the date when the entitlements are to converge at equal per capita allocations. According to the contraction and convergence approach. developing countries can continue their current emission trends. whereas industrialized countries should reduce their emissions quite dramatically.

Main energy source on earth is the fossil fuels. However. the usage of fossil fuels causes global warming whose negative effects have recently been felt by all over the world. Also. because it is limited on earth. increased energy demand and high energy prices increase concerns on fossil fuels. For instance. petroleum reservoirs are present only in few countries therefore the other countries mostly purchase petroleum from these countries more than their production amount. Hence. decrease of fossil fuel reservoirs may create a new ‘energy crisis’ and/or “energy wars” as in 1970s in near future. For a sustainable world the usage of fossil fuels must be decreased. in fact ended. Instead. the usage of renewable energy sources must be increased. As it is known. the interest in renewable energy sources has increased because it does not cause greenhouse effect in contrary to the fossil fuels. These energy sources are indigenous. environmental friendly and. they help to reduce the usage of fossil fuels. Solar. wind. wave. biomass and geothermal energies are renewable energy sources. Sun is the source of all energies. Solar energy is usually used in two aims: for thermal applications and for electricity production.

Various methods for comparing experimental data and computational predictions are in evidence in the literature. along with limited insights into uncertainties associated with each approach. Plug flow is most often assumed in such works as a simple. chemically insightful physical reactor model; however. only brief qualitative justifications for such an interpretation are typically offered. Modern tools permit the researcher to quantitatively confirm the validity of this assumption.

When a recently proposed adsorption isotherm for a solid−vapor interface is combined with the equilibrium conditions and the system is assumed to be in a cylinder where the liquid−vapor interface can be approximated as spherical. the contact-angle−pressure relation can be made explicit. It indicates that a range of contact angles can be observed on a smooth homogeneous surface by changing the pressure at the three-phase line. but it also indicates that the adsorption at the solid−liquid interface is negative. and leads to the prediction that the contact angle increases with pressure.

In order to further explore this effect. Nafion 212 samples were subjected to various thermal treatments and then to various analytical techniques in order to probe whether changes to the membrane contributed to these performance gains in a substantial way. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurement sought to validate that the treatment caused a proton conductivity change. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements were implemented to determine whether chemical changes in the membrane occurred.

This is so because of the overwhelming challenge of thermally integrating a chemical process involving many steps. each at a unique temperature. within a confined volume. In addition. heat loss to the environment becomes correspondingly higher as overall size shrinks due to increasing surface-to-volume ratio. requiring an inordinate use of system volume on thermal insulation.

The basic principle is the recirculation of a fraction of the exhausts (still rich in oxygen) to a gasifier. in order to produce syngas to mix with natural gas fuel. As biomass is a CO2 neutral fuel. the fraction of replaced natural gas is a measure of CO2 removal potential of the powerplant.The investigated solution considers the conversion of solid fuel to a gaseous fuel into an atmospheric gasifier. which is blown with a recirculated fraction of hot gas turbine exhausts. typically still rich in air. In this way. the heat content of the exhausts may be exploited to partially sustain the gasification section.The produced syngas. after the tar removal into the high temperature cracker. is thus sent to the cooling section. consisting of three main components: (I) gas turbine recuperator.

From the results it was observed that the influence of zeolite Si/Al ratio on CuMFI catalytic activity for NO SCR by propene is dependent on the catalyst copper loading. Furthermore. the effect of catalyst copper loading on catalytic performance depended on the catalyst Si/Al ratio. The results also demonstrated that CuMFI catalysts with different Si/Al ratios and copper loadings. but with the same Cu/Al ratio and. therefore. the same copper exchange level have similar catalytic activity profiles for NO SCR.It was further observed that not all Cu cations exchanged into MFI catalysts have equivalent catalytic activity for NO SCR. which made the existence of different copper environments on CuMFI …,True,z7bAxH8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,45,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337396000574,10950710639173273298,/scholar?cites=10950710639173273298,,,,0,0,0

For this purpose. designed Bi- and V-containing beta zeolites prepared by incipient wetness impregnation have been used under different test conditions. While the zeolite proves to be photoactive under UVC irradiation toward the total oxidation process. the formation of V2O5 on the surface is an effective alternative for modifying the acid–base surface properties. thus significantly decreasing the undesired CO2 formation. At the same time the zeolite framework serves as a scaffold for increasing the surface area and distribution of the metal oxide.

Mg was added by incipient wetness impregnation and ion exchange. Whatever the Mg incorporation method used. Mg is able to improve the performance of the Ni-zeolite catalysts. Magnesium impregnation at lower contents (below 2.5%) over a 5%Ni/zeolite leads to an enhancement of the CO2 conversion into methane of 15% at 350–450 °C. probably due to the induced increase of the Ni particle dispersion. as well as to the possible activation of CO2 on the defects present on the MgO surface. At higher Mg contents. the stronger interaction between Ni and Mg oxides. leading to the formation of NiO–MgO solid solutions. seems to reduce the reducibility of the Ni species. decreasing the amount of nickel active sites available and thus the catalytic performance.

On a fundamental level. it is of great interest to explore whether the ultimate limits in light absorption per unit volume can be achieved by capitalizing on the advances in metamaterial science and nanosynthesis. Here. we combine block copolymer lithography and atomic layer deposition to tune the effective optical properties of a plasmonic array at the atomic scale.

Many candidate materials. including for example α-Fe2O3 (hematite). suffer from very poor charge transport with minority carrier diffusion lengths that are significantly shorter (nanometer scale) than the absorption depth of light (micrometer scale near the band edge). As a result. most of the photoexcited carriers recombine rather than participate in water-splitting reactions. For this reason. there is a tremendous opportunity for photon management.

High performance membranes are developed consisting of thin layers on a porous support. Oxygen transport through such asymmetric membranes can be considered as a series of different processes. each of which can be rate limiting depending on operation conditions.

Here we describe our approach to address both challenges. By designing an optical cavity structure for the plasmonic photoelectrode. light absorption in these particles can be significantly enhanced. resulting in efficient hot electron generation. Rather than utilizing a Schottky barrier to preserve the energy of the carriers. our structure allows for their direct injection into the adjacent electrolyte. On the substrate side. the plasmonic particles are in contact with a wide band gap oxide film that serves as an electron blocking layer but accepts holes and transfers them to the counter electrode.

Inc.,Ni‐CeO2 is a highly efficient. stable and non‐expensive catalyst for methane dry reforming at relative low temperatures (700 K). The active phase of the catalyst consists of small nanoparticles of nickel dispersed on partially reduced ceria. Experiments of ambient pressure XPS indicate that methane dissociates on Ni/CeO2 at temperatures as low as 300 K. generating CHx and COx species on the surface of the catalyst. Strong metal–support interactions activate Ni for the dissociation of methane. The results of density‐functional calculations show a drop in the effective barrier for methane activation from 0.9 eV on Ni(111) to only 0.15 eV on Ni/CeO2−x(111).

Grafting increases nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency in a number of plant species. including fruits. vegetables. and ornamentals. Selected rootstocks of the same species or close relatives are utilized in grafting. Rootstocks absorb more water and ions than self-rooted plants and transport these water and ions to the aboveground scion. Ion uptake is regulated by a complex communication mechanism between the scion and rootstock. Sugars. hormones. and miRNAs function as long-distance signaling molecules and regulate ion uptake and ion homeostasis by affecting the activity of ion transporters. This review summarizes available information on the effect of rootstock on nutrient uptake and utilization and the mechanisms involved. Information on specific nutrient-efficient rootstocks for different crops of commercial importance is also provided. Several other important approaches. such as interstocking (during double grafting). inarching. use of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria. use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. use of plant growth substances (e.g.. auxin and melatonin). and use of genetically engineered rootstocks and scions (transgrafting). are highlighted; these approaches can be combined with grafting to enhance nutrient uptake and utilization in commercially important plant species.

The utility of genotyping for clinical applications is only beginning to gain importance. Whether HBV genotyping will constitute part of the clinical evaluation of Hepatitis B patients depends largely on the availability of the relevance of the evidence based information. Since Pakistan has a HBV genotype distribution which has been considered less virulent as investigated by earlier studies from south East Asian countries. a study on correlation between HBV genotypes and risk of progression to further complex hepatic infection was much needed A total of 295 patients with HBsAg positive were selected from the Pakistan Medical Research Council's (PMRC) out patient clinics. Two hundred and twenty six (77%) were males. sixty nine (23%) were females (M to F ratio 3.3:1).

We find that the O1s binding energy of an oxygen adatom increases near linearly with its adsorption energy due to the ionic nature of the Ag/O interaction. Thus. contrary to widespread assignments. a weakly bound oxygen adatom does not account for the electrophilic species with an O1s binding energy of 530 eV that is thought to be active in ethylene epoxidation.

The temperature-induced compositional and structural changes of these alloy films are investigated in the catalytically relevant temperature range. Heating of multilayer Zn films to 500 K results in the formation of multilayer PdZn alloy films with surface and near-surface composition close to 1:1. In the temperature regime above 550 K the subsurface layers deplete quickly in Zn due to diffusion of Zn atoms into the Pd bulk. In contrast. the composition of the surface layer changes only slightly. indicating formation of a PdZn film with strong monolayer character.

This type of material is used in the manufacture of Laser Grooved Buried Contact (LGBC) solar cells. An advanced LGBC process optimally exploits an aluminium back surface field (BSF). Although high cell efficiency can be achieved using this technology the solar cells still suffer from so-called light-induced degradation (LID). This degradation effect is based on the fact that the minority carrier lifetime of boron-doped Cz-Si deteriorates under illumination or carrier injection. This is due to the formation of a boron-oxygen complex when both oxygen and boron are present in the material.

According to Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. the initial amorphous growth phase. typically observed for µc-Si films. could be avoided on AIC substrates.

Photovoltages of p+/n contacts were measured by surface photovoltage measurements (SPV) to amount to 260 mV.

We present here the results obtained at a background site in the Po Valley. Italy. in summer 2009. For the first time in Europe. six state-of-the-art spectrometric techniques were used in parallel: aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS). two aerosol mass spectrometers (high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer – HR-ToF-AMS and soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer – SP-AMS). thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography (TAG). chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CIMS) and (offline) proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy. The results indicate that. under high-pressure conditions. atmospheric stratification at night and early morning hours led to the accumulation of aerosols produced by anthropogenic sources distributed over the Po Valley plain. Such aerosols include primary components such as black carbon (BC). secondary semivolatile compounds such as ammonium nitrate and amines and a class of monocarboxylic acids which correspond to the AMS cooking organic aerosol (COA) already identified in urban areas.

The objective of the present study is to demonstrate that the key aerosol features and processes observed at Mace Head are characteristic of the open ocean. while acknowledging and allowing for spatial and temporal gradients. Measurements were conducted for a 5-week period at Mace Head and offshore. on the Research Vessel Celtic Explorer. in generally similar marine air masses. albeit not in connected-flow scenarios. The results of the study indicate. in terms of aerosol number size distribution. higher nucleation mode particle concentrations at Mace Head than offshore. pointing to a strong coastal source of new particles that is not representative of the open ocean. The Aitken mode exhibited a large degree of similarity. with no systematic differences between Mace Head and the open ocean. while the accumulation mode showed averagely 35% higher concentrations at Mace Head. The higher accumulation mode concentration can be attributed equally to cloud processing and to a coastal enhancement in concentration. Chemical analysis showed similar or even higher offshore concentrations for dominant species. such as nss-SO4-2. WSOC. WIOC and MSA. Sea salt concentration differences determined a 40% higher supermicron mass at Mace Head. although this difference can be attributed to a higher wind speed at Mace Head during the comparison period.

Sangiorgi,,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,,http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/2629/2015/acp-15-2629-2015.pdf, Chemical and dynamical processes lead to the formation of aerosol layers in the upper planetary boundary layer (PBL) and above it. Through vertical mixing and entrainment into the PBL these layers may contribute to the ground-level particulate matter (PM); however. to date a quantitative assessment of such a contribution has not been carried out. This study investigates this aspect by combining chemical and physical aerosol measurements with WRF/Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry) model simulations. The observations were collected in the Milan urban area (northern Italy) during the summer of 2007. The period coincided with the passage of a meteorological perturbation that cleansed the lower atmosphere. followed by a high-pressure period favouring pollutant accumulation. Lidar observations revealed the formation of elevated aerosol layers and evidence of their entrainment into the PBL. We analysed the budget of ground-level PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) with the help of the online meteorology–chemistry WRF/Chem model. focusing in particular on the contribution of upper-level processes. Our findings show that an important player in determining the upper-PBL aerosol layer is particulate nitrate. which may reach higher values in the upper PBL (up to 30% of the aerosol mass) than in the lower PBL. The nitrate formation process is predicted to be largely driven by the relative-humidity vertical profile. which may trigger efficient aqueous nitrate formation when exceeding the ammonium nitrate deliquescence point.

In the framework of Emilia-Romagna regional project “Supersito”. the southern Po Valley submicron aerosol chemical composition was characterized by means of high-resolution aerosol mass spectroscopy (HR-AMS) with the specific aim of organic aerosol (OA) characterization and source apportionment. Eight intensive observation periods (IOPs) were carried out over 4 years (from 2011 to 2014) at two different sites (Bologna. BO. urban background. and San Pietro Capofiume.

Novel technologies integrating waste gasification with reversible Solid-Oxide Cell (rSOC) systems are proposed to provide flexible grid balancing services. The rSOC system operated in electrolysis mode uses excess power from vRES to generate hydrogen (H2) which is combined with syngas derived from waste gasification to produce methane (CH4). The rSOC system can also be operated in fuel cell mode by oxidising syngas to produce electricity. In this work a methodology aimed at estimating the potential deployment of a novel rSOC technology in a future power system dominated by intermittent renewables is presented and applied to a well-defined case study. The hourly power grid residual loads (i.e. the difference between load and vRES power generation) and the low-grade organic waste and residues availability. are quantified and matched for the southern Italian peninsula in 2030. The results show that the theoretical grid flexibility needs - about 10 TWh of overproduction and 5 TWh of underproduction in 2030 - might be fully satisfied with the complete disposal of the municipal organic waste generated in 2030 (6.7 Mt) and the production of 1.4–2.4 Mt of renewable CH4. pointing to an intriguing perspective for the deployment of rSOC systems at large scale.

A wide range of bioactive compounds with attractive properties can be produced with microalgae. including pigments. vitamins. proteins. carbohydrates. and lipids. The biofuel yields from microalgae can exceed the yields obtained with energy crops by 10–100 times. Therefore. such cultivation is promising for the regulation of the biosynthesis of microalagae with phytohormones. which can enhance the production of high-valued bioproducts. This review reports the effect of auxins. abscisic acid. cytokinins. gibberellins. and ethylene on microalgal growth and metabolites. as well as the crosstalk of different phytohormones.

Especially in the case of digestate obtained from biogas plants fed with energy crops. this can be considered a lignin rich residue. The aim of this study is to investigate the pyrolytic kinetic characteristics of solid digestate. The Starink model-free method has been used for the kinetic analysis of the pyrolysis process. The average Activation Energy value is about 204.1 kJ/mol. with a standard deviation of 25 kJ/mol. which corresponds to the 12% of the average value. The activation energy decreased along with the conversion degree. The variation range of the activation energy is about 99 kJ/mol. this means that the average value cannot be used to statistically represent the whole reaction. The Master-plots method was used for the determination of the kinetic model. obtaining that n-order was the most probable one. On the other hand. the process cannot be modeled with a single-step reaction. For this reason it has been used an independent parallel reactions scheme to model the complete process.

Variations in PE pipe density . crystallinity (69–72%). crosslinking (60 and 76%). and oxidative induction time (33 to .) were detected. While numerically these differences seem minor. results show that slight material differences have a notable effect on contaminant diffusivity and solubility. Nonpolar contaminant diffusivity and solubility were best predicted by bulk density.

Algorithms must therefore balance utilizing well-characterized. good loads and learning about poorly characterized but potentially good loads; this is a manifestation of the classical tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We address this tradeoff in a restless bandit framework. a generalization of the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. The formulation yields index policies in which loads are ranked by a scalar index. and those with the highest are deployed.

The capabilities of demand response should therefore be represented in system operators’ planning and operational routines. However. incorporating models of every load in an aggregation into these routines could compromise their tractability by adding exorbitant numbers of new variables and constraints.In this paper. we propose a novel approximation for concisely representing the capabilities of a heterogeneous aggregation of flexible loads. We assume that each load is mathematically described by a convex polytope. i.e.. a set of linear constraints. a class which includes deferrable loads. thermostatically controlled loads. and generic energy storage. The set-wise sum of the loads is the Minkowski sum. which is in general computationally intractable.

The proposed approach is based on the sparsity-promoting optimal control.

We propose a regulation pricing methodology based on an idea of Berger and Schweppe: in the same manner that locational marginal prices are derived from the dual of economic dispatch. let regulation prices be the dual multipliers or costate of an optimal control problem. By specializing to the linear quadratic regulator. we formulate a regulation pricing policy. which in turn allows us to derive statistically correct payments such as imbalance fees. We then construct a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism to induce selfish agents to honestly report their private valuations and costs of regulation.

1262336,Conic Optimization of Electric Power Systems,2011,Joshua Adam Taylor,,,,,,The electric power grid is recognized as an essential modern infrastructure that poses numerous canonical design and operational problems. Perhaps most critically. the inherently large scale of the power grid and similar systems necessitates fast algorithms. A particular complication distinguishing problems in power systems from those arising in other large infrastructures is the mathematical description of alternating current power flow: it is nonconvex. and thus excludes power systems from many frameworks benefiting from theoretically and practically efficient algorithms. However. advances over the past twenty years in optimization have led to broader classes possessing such algorithms. as well as procedures for transferring nonconvex problem to these classes. In this thesis. we approximate difficult problems in power systems with tractable. conic programs. First. we formulate a new type of NP-hard graph cut arising from undirected multicommodity flow networks. An eigenvalue bound in the form of the Cheeger inequality is proven. which serves as a starting point for deriving semidefinite relaxations. We next apply a lift-and-project type relaxation to transmission system planning. The approach unifies and improves upon existing models based on the DC power flow approximation. and yields new mixed-integer linear. second-order cone. and semidefinite models for the AC case. The AC models are particularly applicable to scenarios in which the DC approximation is not justified. such as the all-electric ship. Lastly. we consider distribution system reconfiguration.

As a result. various steps are often taken to simplify the design problem and restrict the size of the design space prior to going through an optimization procedure.

Storage is different from the conventional generators that have traditionally balanced supply and demand on fast time scales due to its hard energy capacity constraints. dynamic coupling. and low marginal costs. These differences are leading system operators to propose new mechanisms for enabling storage to participate in reserve and real-time energy markets. The persistence of market power and gaming in electricity markets suggests that these changes will expose new vulnerabilities.

Models of loads in demand response programs are typically assumed to be known a priori. leaving the load aggregator the task of choosing the best command. However. accurate load models are often hard to obtain. To address this problem. we propose an online learning algorithm that performs demand response while learning the model of an aggregation of thermostatically controlled loads. Specifically. we combine an adversarial multi-armed bandit framework with a standard formulation of load-shifting. We develop an Exp3-like algorithm to solve the learning problems.

Such configurations lead to more efficient power transfers and better oscillation damping. but necessitate controllers with seemingly heavy communication requirements that rely on wide-area measurement systems. This paper shows that DC-segmented power systems are poset-causal. making them amenable to powerful decentralized control techniques that can substantially reduce their communication needs. Specifically. optimal decentralized control is attainable with communication only between AC subsystems that are directly connected by a DC line. The approach explicitly leverages the implied graph structure of power systems with AC and DC lines.

B,3B,287,David Publishing Company. Inc.,Biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester) has been identified as a non-toxic biodegradable alternative fuel that is obtained from renewable sources. Over the last decade. there has been increasing interest in producing biodiesel from conventional sources such as soybean. canola. sunflower. and coconut oils. Current efforts are directed towards the development of new non-edible resources. Among these Jatropha Curcas comes at the forefront. In Egypt. Jatropha Curcas has grown successfully using primary treated wastewater. Also. extensive R&D efforts identified the optimum conditions for the various processing stages namely crushing. extraction. transesterification and purification. Based on the research findings. the techno-economic appraisal of biodiesel production from Jatropha Curcas is conducted. Two nominal capacities namely 8.000 and 50.000 metric tons/yr have been proposed. Several scenarios have been formulated to take into consideration varying productivity (3.4 to 5.8 ton fruits per 4.000 m2 (acre)) and varying recovery rates of oil from seeds. Economic indicators including capital and production costs for the various processing stages and revenues according to current prices of oil and cake have been obtained. The price of biodiesel that provides a simple rate of return (SRR) on investments of 10% was in the range of $0.3-0.7/liter for the different assumed scenarios which is lower than the prevailing price of biodiesel (about $1/liter) in the US.

Record-performance FAPbI 3-based solar cells have relied on fabrication via the sequential-deposition method; however. these devices exhibit unstable output under illumination due to the difficulty of incorporating cesium cations (stabilizer) in sequentially deposited films. Here we devise a perovskite seeding method that efficiently incorporates cesium and beneficially modulates perovskite crystallization. First. perovskite seed crystals are embedded in the PbI 2 film. The perovskite seeds serve as cesium sources and act as nuclei to facilitate crystallization during the formation of perovskite.

It is known that ion-migration-driven decomposition represents a degradation pathway in perovskite solar cells and that it can occur within the perovskite material even in well-encapsulated devices. Here we find that quasi-two-dimensional (2.5D) perovskites suppress this ion-migration-induced degradation. Using TOF-SIMS. we confirm that iodide migration occurs in bulk perovskite photovoltaic devices operating at their maximum power point (MPP). We observe that iodine ions migrate across the spiro-OMeTAD layer to the spiro/gold contact interface. oxidizing and deteriorating the gold at the interface.

They offer thus a compelling suite of materials for technological applications. Their size‐ and facet‐tunable features are studied in synthesis; however. to exploit their features in optoelectronic devices. it will be essential to translate control over size and facets from the colloid all the way to the film. Larger‐diameter colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) offer the attractive possibility of harvesting infrared (IR) solar energy beyond absorption of silicon photovoltaics. These CQDs exhibit facets (nonpolar (100)) undisplayed in small‐diameter CQDs; and the materials chemistry of smaller nanocrystals fails consequently to translate to materials for the short‐wavelength IR regime.

1262416,Model for determining geographical distribution of heat saving potentials in Danish building stock,2014,Stefan Petrovic and Kenneth Karlsson,3,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,1,143-165,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Since the global oil crisis in the 1970s. Denmark has followed a path towards energy independency by continuously improving its energy efficiency and energy conservation. Energy efficiency was mainly tackled by introducing a high number of combined heat and power plants in the system. while energy conservation was predominantly approached by implementing heat saving measures. Today. with the goal of 100% renewable energy within the power and heat sector by the year 2035. reductions in energy demand for space heating and the preparation of domestic hot water remain at the top of the agenda in Denmark. A highly detailed model for determining heat demand. possible heat savings and associated costs in the Danish building stock is presented. Both scheduled and energy-saving renovations until year 2030 have been analyzed. The highly detailed GIS-based heat atlas for Denmark is used as a container for storing data about physical properties for 2.5 million buildings in Denmark. Consequently. the results of the analysis can be represented on a single building level. Under the assumption that buildings with the most profitable heat savings are renovated first. the consequences of heat savings for the economy and energy system have been quantified and geographically referenced. The possibilities for further improvements of the model and the application to other geographical regions have been discussed.

By systematic screening of the influence of both base concentration (0.1–1.8 M NaOH) and Si/Al ratio (10–1000) on the properties of the treated zeolites. we reveal that effective mesoporosity introduction (>200 m2 g–1) may be achieved in the Si/Al range of 12–200.

We designed earth-abundant. carbon-supported titanium tungsten carbide (TixW1−xC) nanoparticles decorated with surface Pt coatings ranging from the “single-atom” to the two-monolayer regime. Reactivity studies demonstrated that sub-monolayer Pt coverages are optimal and could activate the exposed metal carbide sites for both HER and HOR at low overpotentials. Specifically. a 0.25 monolayer coverage of Pt improved the exchange current density of Ti0.2W0.8C by more than three orders of magnitude.

1262474,Property-Function Interplay in the Design of Hierarchical Zeolite Catalysts,2014,Maria Milina,,,,,,In the last two decades. the potential of hierarchical zeolites. integrating different levels of porosity to complement the unique intrinsic properties with enhanced mass transfer. has been widely explored. Hierarchical zeolites are demonstrated to bring large catalytic benefits in many important classes of hydrocarbon transformations. such as aromatic alkylations and transalkylations. esterifications. alkane isomerizations. cracking. and the conversion of methanol to olefins. as well as in emerging processes. such as the conversion of biomass to fuels or chemicals. The post-synthetic modification of conventional zeolites by a single or by a strategic combination of individually-optimized base and/or acid treatments has arisen as a versatile. efficient. and scalable method for the design of superior hierarchical zeolite catalysts. Prior to the commencement of this thesis. the interpretation of the catalytic enhancements observed over hierarchical zeolites relied heavily on variations in the bulk textural parameters. However. demetallation also alters other properties such as the composition and corresponding acidic properties. To fully utilize the potential of these advanced materials. it is essential to develop an improved understanding of the property evolution in relation to the catalytic performance. This thesis investigates the complex interplay between the changes in the zeolite composition. porous and acidic properties upon demetallation. and their impact on the mass transport and catalytic function of hierarchical zeolites. One of the major challenges in tackling this task is the difficulty in isolating the impact of a single variable due to the multiple concurrent …,True,xqumez8AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/111890/1/eth-47262-01.pdf,,,,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/111890/1/eth-47262-01.pdf,0,0,0

E. Periodic variations of the material properties with nanoscale characteristic dimensions yield PnCs that operate at frequencies above 10 GHz. allowing for the manipulation of thermal properties. In this article. a 2D simple cubic lattice PnC operating at 33 GHz is reported. The PnC is created by nanofabrication with a focused ion beam. A freestanding membrane of silicon is ion milled to create a simple cubic array of 32 nm diameter holes that are subsequently backfilled with tungsten to create inclusions at a spacing of 100 nm. Simulations are used to predict the operating frequency of the PnC. Additional modeling shows that milling a freestanding membrane has a unique characteristic; the exit via has a conical shape. or trumpet-like appearance.,True,ren4yjQAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,21,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3676170,15780004401984144614,/scholar?cites=15780004401984144614,,,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.3676170,0,0,0

Evidence includes the lack of growth in the absence of a reacting mixture. sharp maxima as a function of temperature. and dramatic differences in temperature of growth as a function of mixture composition. The finding that the structure of the support strongly influenced the morphology of the solid carbon. and the temperature regime for deposition. is also consistent with this model. Carbon nanofibers were found to form on sputtered palladium films and palladium nanopowder (ca. 700 °C). whereas planar carbon structures deposited on palladium micrometer powder and foil (ca. 600 °C).

Electron microscopy. combined with focused ion beam cross-sectioning show particles sinter quickly. but can be stabilized by the addition of a short carbon deposition step at a temperature below the general reaction temperature. This step generates a thin layer of carbon on the catalyst which reduces sintering once the temperature is raised to the optimal reaction temperature. For example. high temperature (e.g. 500 °C) catalyst pre-treatment leads to catalyst particle sintering. and subsequent fiber growth produces large diameter fibers. In contrast. small diameter fibers form on catalyst particles pretreated at low temperature (ca. 350 °C). even if the fibers are grown at a temperature at which deposition rates are faster (e.g. 550 °C).

This paper highlights the combination of centralized and decentralized systems. which is referred to as hybrid water supply systems. The system is hypothesized to generate more sustainable and resilient urban water systems. The basic concept is to use decentralized water supply options such as rainwater tanks. storm water harvesting and localized wastewater treatment and reuse in combination with centralized systems. Currently the impact of hybrid water supply technologies on the operational performance of the downstream infrastructure and existing treatment processes is yet to be known. The paper identifies a number of significant research gaps related to interactions between centralized and decentralized urban water services. It indicates that an improved understanding of the interaction between these systems is expected to provide a better integration of hybrid systems by improved sewerage and drainage design. as well as facilitate operation and maintenance planning.

Understanding seasonal. daily and sub-daily water demand including peak demand by end-uses is an essential planning requirement to implement a fit-for-purpose water supply strategy. Studies in the literature assume that all indoor water uses except evaporative cooler water use are weather independent and do not exhibit seasonal variability. This paper presents an analysis undertaken to examine seasonal variability of residential water end-uses. The analysis was repeated using two sets of data to ensure the validity of findings. The study shows that shower water use is significantly different between winter and summer. in addition to irrigation. evaporative cooler and pool water end-uses. while other water end-uses are not. Weather is shown to be a significant determinant of shower water use; in particular it affects shower duration which increases with lower temperature. Further analysis on shower water use suggests that it is driven by behavioural factors in addition to weather. thus providing useful insights to improve detailed end-use water demand predictions.

Since that time. all new medical procedures must be evaluated for safety. effectiveness. and cost-effectiveness as a condition of the surgeon receiving public funding by means of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). Over these first 8 years. a significant number of applications for the public funding of new procedures have been given negative recommendations by the MSAC based on insufficient clinical evidence or lack of cost-effectiveness. In August 2006. after almost 2 years of processing. the MSAC made the decision to fund the new procedure. laparoscopic remotely assisted radical prostatectomy (LRARP). However. they stated that there was still uncertainty about the comparative cost-effectiveness. Methods: An observational study using provisional cost-utility data for LRARP based on a combination of costs taken from consecutive patients at the Epworth Hospital. Melbourne. Australia. and utilities from the prospectively collected data on all patients undergoing surgery for prostate cancer over a 4-year period at the Vattikuti Urology Institute. Michigan. United States.Results: The incremental cost for LRARP compared with the open surgery alternative is A $2.264 or A $24.457 per quality-adjusted life-year. well below the range accepted by the Australian pharmaceutical equivalent of the MSAC (the PBAC) of A $42.000 and A $76.000.

1262543,An integrated framework for assessment of hybrid water supply systems,2016,Mukta Sapkota and Meenakshi Arora and Hector Malano and Magnus Moglia and Ashok Sharma and Biju George and Francis Pamminger,8,Water,1,4,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Urban water managers around the world are adopting decentralized water supply systems. often in combination with centralized systems. While increasing demand for water arising from population growth is one of the primary reasons for this increased adoption of alternative technologies. factors such as climate change. increased frequency of extreme weather events and rapid urbanization also contribute to an increased rate of adoption of these technologies. This combination of centralized-decentralized water systems approach is referred to as “hybrid water supply systems” and is based on the premise that the provision of alternative water sources at local scales can both extend the capacity of existing centralized water supply infrastructures. and improve resilience to variable climatic conditions. It is important to understand. however. that decentralized water production and reuse may change the flow and composition of wastewater and stormwater. thereby potentially also having negative impacts on its effectiveness and performance. This paper describes a framework to assess the interactions between decentralized water supply systems and existing centralized water servicing approaches using several analytical tools. including water balance modelling. contaminant balance modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis. The framework enables the evaluation of impacts due to change in quantity and quality of wastewater and stormwater on the existing centralized system arising from the implementation of hybrid water supply systems.

India was seriously affected by a chikungunya epidemic in 2007. As this outbreak was the first of its kind. the morbidity incurred by the epidemic was a challenge to the state’s public health system. A cross sectional survey was conducted in five districts of Kerala that were seriously affected by the epidemic. using a two-stage cluster sampling technique to select households. and the patients were identified using a syndromic case definition. We calculated the direct health expenditure of families and checked whether it exceed the margins of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). The median (IQR) total out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure in the study population was USD7. 4 (16.7). The OOP health expenditure did not show any significant association with increasing per-capita monthly income. The major share (47.4%) of the costs was utilized for buying medicines. but costs for transportation (17.2%). consultations (16.6%). and diagnoses (9.9%) also contributed significantly to the total OOP health expenditure. The OOP health expenditure was high in private sector facilities. especially in tertiary care hospitals. For more than 15% of the respondents. the OOP was more than double their average monthly family income. The chikungunya outbreak of 2007 had significantly contributed to the OOP expenditure of the affected community in Kerala.

Australia,The aim of Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) is to provide a sustainable approach to plan and manage urban water systems. A key consideration of IUWM is to match water demands to sources of appropriate quality and quantity (ie supply water to fit-for-purpose). This enables use of a wide range of water sources such as grey water. roof water. stormwater. recycled water. groundwater and surface water at different spatial scales. Availability of some water sources. in particular roof water and stormwater can vary diurnally and such sources are commonly used at local scales (ie allotment and development). Understanding temporal and spatial variability of water demands at individual end-use scale is essential for the optimal use of alternative water sources. This understanding invariably leads to optimal use of decentralised sources as well. In addition. consideration of spatial and temporal variability of individual end uses improves the effectiveness of demand management strategies. since those strategies. such as creating awareness and promoting water efficient appliances. can be implemented more effectively by knowing where and how they are being used.End-use modelling is an approach for quantifying and predicting water demands of individual end uses using the relationships built on the data monitored at individual household scale. Recent residential end-use monitoring studies indicate that water consumption of residential end uses varies significantly. The aim of this paper is to review the suitability of currently available residential end-use models to adequately represent spatial and temporal variability of urban residential …,True,yawlg8sAAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC,23,https://www.academia.edu/download/40593133/Review_of_Residential_Urban_Water_End-Us20151202-31861-157nspm.pdf,8218378849097146094,/scholar?cites=8218378849097146094,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40593133/Review_of_Residential_Urban_Water_End-Us20151202-31861-157nspm.pdf,0,0,0

The main objective of this study was to obtain flooded paddy rice maps using multi-temporal images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Krishna River Basin. India. First. ground-based spectral samples collected by a field spectroradiometer.

It has been argued that new approaches need to be considered in order to cater for additional demand due to increasing population. changing climate. limited resource availability and a desire to protect ecosystems and build more livable cities. It has therefore been argued that providing additional capacity by using only conventional centralized systems is not economically or environmentally the best option. The use of decentralized water supply options such as rainwater tanks; storm water harvesting and reuse; and localized wastewater treatment and reuse in combination with centralized systems can help provide a sustainable solution to address these challenges by reducing the load on fresh water and decreasing the amount of wastewater to receiving environment. It is currently unknown how such technologies impact on the operational performance of the downstream infrastructure and existing treatment processes. For instance. reuse of greywater reduces the wastewater flow and hence there will be more change of solid deposition in the sewerage system. A comprehensive literature review has identified several significant research gaps related to interactions between centralized and decentralized water supply services. One of the prominent gaps is the effects of such hybrid water supply systems (combination of centralized and decentralized systems) on changes in the quantity and quality of wastewater and storm water of the existing system.

The use of whole cyanobacterial cells is a good compromise between the requirements of the biological material to be simply organized and transfer electrons efficiently to the anode. and also to be robust and able to self-assemble and self-repair. The principle that photosynthetic bacteria can generate and transfer electrons directly or indirectly to an anode has been demonstrated by a number of groups. although the power output obtained from these devices is too low …,True,1EiM2ksAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,84,https://portlandpress.com/biochemsoctrans/article/40/6/1302/66848,15411631556174771754,/scholar?cites=15411631556174771754,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paolo_Bombelli/publication/233766635_Biological_photovoltaics_Intra-_and_extra-cellular_electron_transport_by_cyanobacteria/links/56714ad108aececfd5551e55/Biological-photovoltaics-Intra-and-extra-cellular-electron-transport-by-cyanobacteria.pdf,0,0,0

The desiccant wheel is the heart of this heat-driven cooling system. The main drawback of conventional desiccant wheels is the excessive heating of the supply air and desiccant material during dehumidification. This increases the partial pressure of water on the desiccant material and reduces the amount of moisture that can be removed from the air.

The synthetic zeolite AQSOA benefits from a favourable S-shape isotherm whose steepest gradient zone is shifted towards higher vapour partial pressure values. An AQSOA-based desiccant wheel is experimentally characterized over a wide range of process and regeneration air inlet conditions. A one-dimensional. time-dependent numerical model is developed and calibrated using the experimental data with root mean square deviation of 0.66 g/kg and 0.99 °C for process outlet humidity ratio and temperature respectively. The model is used to investigate the influence of area ratio. process inlet temperature. humidity and air face velocity on performance. It is found that equal area split is essential to achieve maximum moisture removal capacity. while higher process area ratio leads to higher latent cooling …,True,kOfAEGoAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,23,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359431115000411,2333627692952561052,/scholar?cites=2333627692952561052,,,https://re.public.polimi.it/retrieve/handle/11311/920155/444911/Experimental%20analysis%20and%20numerical%20modelling%20of%20an%20AQSOA%20zeolite_11311-920155_Intini.pdf,0,0,0

1262601,Design and performance of an internal heat exchange desiccant wheel,2014,MJ Goldsworthy and S White,39,,,152-159,Elsevier,A fundamental limitation in the dehumidification performance of adiabatic desiccant wheels occurs due to heating of the air stream to be dried. This results from both the carry-over of heat stored in the wheel and the release of the adsorption heat. Previous authors have identified an isothermal dehumidification process as theoretically superior. though the practicalities of constructing such a wheel have meant that demonstrating the benefit is difficult. Recently experimental data from testing of an internally cooled wheel was published. Here we use this data to calibrate a mathematical heat and mass transfer model of the internally cooled heat exchange desiccant wheel. The model is then used to estimate the performance for selected modifications to the design and materials.

1262604,Residential air conditioning. thermal comfort and peak electricity demand management,2008,R De Dear and Stephen White,,Proceedings of conference: air conditioning and the low carbon cooling challenge,,27-29,Cumberland Lodge Windsor. UK,About one in every two Australian households owns at least one air conditioner (AC) and that ratio is increasing rapidly due to the availability of low cost AC imports combined with electricity that is grossly underpriced. Rapid growth in residential AC ownership threatens to undermine national energy efficiency and greenhouse reduction targets. Furthermore residential AC is placing a strain on the national electricity system. especially during heat waves when electricity demand peaks. These AC-driven peak loads occur just occasionally each summer. and so increasing grid capacity to meet them represents a grossly inefficient use of capital. For example. at present 10% of New South Wales' generating capacity is needed for just 1 per cent of the time (less than 100 hours a year). and if residential AC penetration increases as expected. this will rise to 20% of generating capacity for use just 1% of the time by 2014.The alternative to continually expanding grid capacity to supply an ever increasing residential AC peak demand is to focus on managing that demand. The Demand Response (DR) approach can be defined as a change in an electrical product’s normal mode of operation in response to an initiating signal originating from a remote agent. usually with the objective of reducing the product’s power demand at times of peak load. Two broad demand response strategies have emerged to date. The first is based on real-time pricing for electricity. During heat waves the kW cost is increased to a level that is supposed to dissuade enough householders from switching on their AC units that aggregate peak load is kept within manageable limits.

1262622,Production of coated and free-standing engineering components using the HVOF (High Velocity Oxy-Fuel) process,2003,Joseph Stokes,,,,,,The present study aims to establish the potential of producing various hard metal industrial thick components using the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray process. rather than by sintering or casting techniques currently used. It is innovative in that generally research work earned out on this process focuses on coating technologies. In order to spray-form thick tungsten carbide cobalt (WC-Co) components. certain problems have to be overcome. More specifically these problems include minimizing residual stresses (which cause shape distortion in the components). therefore maintaining the integrity of the deposit on a microstructural scale.  Residual stress arises during deposition and. in the present research. was reduced by limiting the rise and fluctuation of the deposition temperature. This was achieved by the utilization of a carbon dioxide cooling system and automated traverse movement of the spray gun. which together enabled continuous deposition at a steady temperature of 500°C. reducing the residual stress by 58% compared to manual spraying. A spraying distance of 200mm and a powder feed rate of 38gmm 1 exhibited the lowest stress within the deposit using the automated system.  The minimization of the residual stress increased the maximum deposit thickness achieved from 0 6mm to 1 2mm. Higher deposit thicknesses were achieved when the deposition area was reduced. These findings were simulated by the finite element analysis technique The present research describes the successful production of 9mm thick spray-formed WC-Co components (12mm m diameter) Associative work in this thesis includes the …,True,qc_nDqMAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,29,http://doras.dcu.ie/18232/,15634555126494119329,/scholar?cites=15634555126494119329,,,http://doras.dcu.ie/18232/1/Joseph_Stokes.pdf,0,0,0

Anaerobic digestion (AD) fulfils the requirements for a sustainable alternative fuel. and is also an environmentally friendly waste treatment method. It requires less energy than other methods such as gasification or pyrolysis due to its low operating temperature. Whiskey distillery and brewery waste streams are classed as high strength organic wastes due to their high BOD/COD content. thus rendering them a suitable feedstock for anaerobic digestion. Due to large global alcohol production. millions of tonnes of solid and liquid waste is discharged annually. so the potential for waste-to-energy conversion can make anaerobic digestion an attractive treatment option for the waste streams of distilleries and breweries rather than diversion to landfill or incineration.

In atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) one of many plasma spray methods. a coated layer is formed on a substrate surface by spraying melted powders onto a substrate at a high speed using a high-temperature plasma jet [2. 3]. Powder grains are transported within a carrier gas at hightemperature and high speed. injected into plasma jet. The melting powder is transferred to the substrate surface being coated and after impact. lamellar layer formation occurs [4]. Optimization of spray parameters is important for obtaining high-quality coating. In conventional plasma spray coatings. Argon (Ar) is used as the carrying gas. However. oxygen is also used as carrier gas in hightemperature plasma jet for the metal oxide powders to minimize decomposition of the metal oxide powder and the plasma coated material. as it improves the heat transfer characteristics of plasma during the spraying process [5]. Insufficient melting can occur if powder particles are too large. Optimum grain size and distribution affect the melting point of the material. the spray system used and application method of the coating [6].

Growing a photoelectrode with conductive nanoobjects embedded in the matrix is promising for enhanced charge transport but remains a challenge technically. We herein show a strategy of embedding laser generated nanocrystals in BiVO 4 photoanode matrix. which achieves photocurrent densities of up to 5.15 mA cm− 2 at 1.23 V RHE (from original 4.01 mA cm− 2) for a single photoanode configuration. and 6.22 mA cm− 2 at 1.23 V RHE for a dual configuration.

Here. the influence of annealing temperature and atmosphere on the formation and suppression of defects in BiVO4—one of the best performing metal oxide photoanodes—is elucidated. Annealing in argon has little or no effect on the photoelectrochemical performance due to the competing effects of an increase in grain size (i.e.. reduction of grain boundaries) and the unfavorable formation of oxygen vacancies. When annealing in air. the formation of oxygen vacancies is suppressed. resulting in up to ∼1.5-fold enhancement of the photocurrent and an order of magnitude increase of the charge carrier mobility. However. vanadium leaves the BiVO4 lattice above 500 °C. which leads to a decrease in carrier lifetime and …,True,4YBzXn0AAAAJ:1Ye0OR6EYb4C,34,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/ta/c8ta06269b,10362762777965473754,/scholar?cites=10362762777965473754,,,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/ta/c8ta06269b,0,0,0

FeVO4 has an ideal band gap for a photoanode of ∼2.0 eV. which corresponds to a potential solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency of 16%. However. our findings show that the photoelectrochemical performance of FeVO4 is limited by very poor charge carrier separation efficiency in the bulk. Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements revealed that the low mobility (∼5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and short diffusion length (∼2 nm) of undoped FeVO4 are the main reason for its fast bulk recombination.

1262658,The energetic implications of curtailing versus storing solar-and wind-generated electricity,2013,Charles J Barnhart and Michael Dale and Adam R Brandt and Sally M Benson,6,Energy & Environmental Science,10,2804-2810,Royal Society of Chemistry,We present a theoretical framework to calculate how storage affects the energy return on energy investment (EROI) ratios of wind and solar resources. Our methods identify conditions under which it is more energetically favorable to store energy than it is to simply curtail electricity production. Electrochemically based storage technologies result in much smaller EROI ratios than large-scale geologically based storage technologies like compressed air energy storage (CAES) and pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS). All storage technologies paired with solar photovoltaic (PV) generation yield EROI ratios that are greater than curtailment. Due to their low energy stored on electrical energy invested (ESOIe) ratios. conventional battery technologies reduce the EROI ratios of wind generation below curtailment EROI ratios. To yield a greater net energy return than curtailment. battery storage technologies paired with wind …,True,DLXrYLQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,181,https://pubs.rsc.org/az/content/articlehtml/2013/ee/c3ee41973h,7613251917688981728,/scholar?cites=7613251917688981728,,,https://pubs.rsc.org/az/content/articlehtml/2013/ee/c3ee41973h,0,0,0

These technologies require large. ‘up-front’ energetic investments. Conceptually. as these industries grow. some proportion of their electrical output is ‘re-invested’ to support manufacture and deployment of new generation capacity. As variable and intermittent. renewable generation capacity increases grid penetration. electrical energy storage will become an ever more important load-balancing technology. These storage technologies are currently expensive and energy intensive to deploy. We explore the impact on net energy production when wind and PV must ‘pay’ the energetic cost of storage deployment.

The ability of renewable technologies to enable a rapid transition to a low carbon energy system is highly dependent on the energy that must be “consumed” during their life-cycle. This paper presents the results of meta-analyses of life-cycle assessments (LCA) of energy costs of three renewable technologies: solar photovoltaic (PV). concentrating solar power (CSP). and wind. The paper presents these findings as energetic analogies with financial cost parameters for assessing energy technologies: overnight capital cost. operating costs and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).

1262663,A general mathematical framework for calculating systems-scale efficiency of energy extraction and conversion: Energy return on investment (EROI) and other energy return ratios,2011,Adam R Brandt and Michael Dale,4,Energies,8,1211-1245,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,The efficiencies of energy extraction and conversion systems are typically expressed using energy return ratios (ERRs) such as the net energy ratio (NER) or energy return on investment (EROI). A lack of a general mathematical framework prevents inter-comparison of NER/EROI estimates between authors: methods used are not standardized. nor is there a framework for succinctly reporting results in a consistent fashion. In this paper we derive normalized mathematical forms of four ERRs for energy extraction and conversion pathways. A bottom-up (process model) formulation is developed for an n-stage energy harvesting and conversion pathway with various system boundaries. Formations with the broadest system boundaries use insights from life cycle analysis to suggest a hybrid process model/economic input output based framework. These models include indirect energy consumption due to external energy inputs and embodied energy in materials. Illustrative example results are given for simple energy extraction and conversion pathways.

1262673,Comparing apples to apples: why the net energy analysis community needs to adopt the life-cycle analysis framework,2016,David J Murphy and Michael Carbajales-Dale and Devin Moeller,9,Energies,11,917,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,How do we know which energy technologies or resources are worth pursuing and which aren’t? One way to answer that question is to compare the energy return of a certain technology—ie. how much energy is remaining after accounting for the amount of energy expended in the production and delivery process. Such energy return ratios (the most famous of which is energy return on investment (EROI)) fall within the field of net energy analysis (NEA). and provide an easy way to determine which technology is “better”; ie. higher Energy Return Ratios (ERRs) are. certeris paribus. better than lower ERRs. Although useful as a broad measure of energy profitability. comparisons can also be misleading. particularly if the units being compared are different. For example. the energy content of electricity produced from a photovoltaic cell is different than the energy content of coal at the mine-mouth. yet these are often compared directly within the literature. These types of inconsistencies are common within the NEA literature. In this paper. we offer life cycle assessment (LCA) and the LCA methodology as a possible solution to the persistent methodological issues within the NEA community. and urge all NEA practitioners to adopt this methodology in the future.

Sequential. single-shot. quantitative velocity profiles of an underexpanded supersonic nitrogen jet were captured at a 100-kHz rate. The signal and lifetime characteristics of the FLEET emission were investigated in a methane flame above a Hencken burner at varying equivalence ratios. and room temperature gas mixtures involving air. methane. and nitrogen. In the post-flame region of the Hencken burner. the emission lifetime was measured as two orders of magnitude lower than lab air conditions. Increasing the equivalence ratio above 1.1 leads to a change in behavior. with a doubled lifetime. By measuring the emission in a cold methane flow. a short-lived signal was measured that decayed after the first microsecond. As a proof of concept for velocimetry in a reacting environment. the exhaust of a pulsed detonator was measured by FLEET.

In most buildings the base floor between the first floor apartments and crawl space is not air tight. As the apartments have lower pressure than the crawl space due to ventilation. contaminated air may flow from the crawl space to the apartments. The object of this study was to find out whether a potential air flow from crawl space has an influence on the indoor air quality. The results show that in most cases the concentration of fungal spores was clearly higher in the crawl space than inside the building. The size distribution of fungal spores depended on the fungal species. Correlation between the fungal spores in the crawl space and indoors varied with microbial species. Some species have sources inside the building. which confounds the possible relation between crawl pace and indoor concentrations. Some species. such as Acremonium. do not normally have a source indoors. but its concentration in the crawl space was elevated; our measurements showed also elevated concentrations of Acremonium in the air of the apartments.

Pressure difference over and air leakage through the structure were varied. Measurements at moderate pressure differences resulted in the penetration factors within the range of 0.05 to 0.2 for inert particles. and indicated also the penetration of fungal spores through the structure. The measurements showed that the penetration was highly dependent on pressure difference over the structure but not on holes in surface boards of the structure. The results show that surface contacts between the frames and mineral wool may have a significant effect on penetration. The penetration was approximately constant within particle size rage of 0.6-2.5 µm. but particles with diameter of 4.0 µm did not penetrate through the structure at all even at a higher-pressure difference of 20 Pa. except in the case of direct flow-path through the structure. Results have important consequences for practical design showing that penetration of fungal spores through the building envelope is difficult to prevent by sealing. The only effective way to prevent penetration seems to be balancing or pressurizing the building.

Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide a means for cities to successfully navigate the water-energy-climate relationship. thus enhancing urban resilience. Implementation of NBS can improve local or regional economic resilience underpinned by the sustainable use of natural resources. The innovative governance. institutional. business. and finance models and frameworks inherent to NBS implementation also provide a wealth of opportunity for social transformation and increased social inclusiveness in cities. The ultimate benefit of NBS implementation in cities is increased livability. which is typically measured as a function of multiple social. economic and environmental variables. Given the range of different interventions classified as NBS and the cross-sectoral character of their co-benefits. different assessment schemes can be used to evaluate NBS performance and impact. Herein. performance and impact indicators within three robust NBS- and Smart City-related assessment schemes – Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES).

1262722,Energy use in day care centers and schools,2011,Miimu Airaksinen,4,Energies,6,998-1009,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,Typically the aim in the construction process is to calculate the energy. space and cost efficiency in the design phase. These factors’ influence on decision making extends to the whole building process. How these decisions affect the use of the building and user satisfaction as well as maintenance is still not that well understood. This study analyses different schools and day care centers and their energy as well as primary energy use. The buildings are located in southern Finland. Each building has had different objectives with respect to energy efficiency in the design phase. Our objective was to find out how those decisions made in the design and construction phase have influenced the overall energy performance of the building compared to existing building stock of similar building type. The results show that the studied buildings had lower thermal energy consumption compared to existing building stock. Thus the special attention in the design phase allowed achieving the desired goal. However. for the electricity consumption such a correlation could not be found. One of the reasons could be also different service level of buildings (more equipment). Also other quality values could not be compared since such data were not available from the existing building stock. As many earlier studies have indicated users have a high influence on the energy consumption. In the future. when feed-back from the users are obtained it will be interesting to analyze the results and compare what kind of influence that user behavior will have on the overall energy consumption of the studied buildings.

As more and more people get together. smart systems and their integration need to be developed. not only to provide the services that people need but also to do so efficiently with minimum impact on the environment. It can be said that efficient ICT. one part of which is the Internet of Things. is a common dominator: tying together services. residency. mobility. infrastructure and energy. It is a global challenge to reduce environmental impact and the carbon footprint. At the same time. societal development needs to be addressed and the focus put on people's well-being. Pressure is growing to reduce our environmental impact. and there is a parallel compelling need for business to remain globally competitive. Sustainable transformation of cities is only possible when it is done in a smart way. Smart city design. operation and management need to be done at system level. Sub-optimization of individual components will not lead to optimal performance of the system. Multi-target optimization is not an easy task. but it becomes necessary as different components and systems are interlinked and interconnected-irrespective of where they are physically located.

1262731,Carbon efficient building solutions,2010,Miimu Airaksinen and Pellervo Matilainen,2,Sustainability,3,844-858,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,Traditionally. the Finnish legislation have focused on energy use and especially on energy used for heating space in buildings. However. in many cases this does not lead to the optimal concept in respect to minimizing green house gases. This paper studies how CO 2 emission levels are affected by different measures to reduce energy use in buildings. This paper presents two real apartment buildings with different options of energy efficiency and power sources. The calculations clearly show that in the future electricity and domestic hot water use will have high importance in respect to energy efficiency. and therefore also CO 2 equivalent (eq) emissions. The importance increases when the energy efficiency of the building increases. There are big differences between average Finnish production and individual power plants; CO 2 eq emissions might nearly double depending on the energy source and the power plant type. Both a building with an efficient district heating as a power source. and a building with ground heat in addition to nuclear power electricity as a complimentary electricity source performed very similarly to each other in respect to CO 2 eq emissions. However. it is dangerous to conclude that it is not important which energy source is chosen. If hypothetically. the use of district heating would dramatically drop. the primary energy factor and CO 2 eq emissions from electricity would rise. which in turn would lead to the increase of the ground heat systems emissions. A problem in the yearly calculations is that the fact that it is very important. sometimes even crucial. when energy is needed. is always excluded.

The design phase of the building is very important. In addition. it is vital to understand how to measure the energy efficiency in the building operation phase in order to encourage the right efficiency efforts. In understanding the building energy efficiency. it is important to comprehend the interplay of building occupancy. space efficiency. and energy efficiency. Recent studies found in the literature concerning energy efficiency in office buildings have concentrated heavily on the technical characteristics of the buildings or technical systems. The most commonly used engineering indicator for building energy efficiency is the specific energy consumption (SEC). commonly measured in kWh/m 2 per annum. While the SEC is a sound way to measure the technical properties of a building and to guide its design. it obviously omits the issues of building occupancy and space efficiency.

It is found that the most effective plasma actuator is derived from an electromagnetic perturbation and amplifies by a subsequent viscous–inviscid interaction. Computational efforts using drift-diffusion theory and a simple phenomenological plasma model. as well as experiments in a hypersonic plasma channel. have shown the effectiveness of using electro–aerodynamic interaction as a hypersonic flow control mechanism. In principle. the plasma actuator based on magneto–aerodynamic interaction should have an added mechanism in the Lorentz force. making it even more effective as a flow control mechanism.

Simulations are made for an atmospheric arc that has a length of 10 mm and an electric current of 200 amps. Predicted results for two different anode evaporation rates are compared to those from a pure argon arc with no copper vapor contamination. Copper vapor concentration. temperature. electric potential. and current density profiles are presented. Included in this analysis are radiation losses from both the argon and copper by using recently calculated net emission coefficients. It was found that evaporation of copper from the anode results in a cooling of the arc in a region close to the anode. but has an insignificant influence on the arc close to the cathode. Due to the arc flow characteristics most of the copper vapor tends to be confined to the anode region.               ,True,AknupjMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,79,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021635507382,15959885152940253723,/scholar?cites=15959885152940253723,,,,0,0,0

1262740,Effect of surface plasma discharges on boundary layers at Mach 5,2004,Roger Kimmel and James Hayes and James Menart and Joseph Shang,,,,509,,DC electrical discharges were generated between two electrodes in a flat plate at zero angle of attack. The discharge was in the streamwise direction with the upstream electrode being the cathode. The discharge increased the plate surface pressure immediately downstream of the cathode. For a 50 mA (approximately 60 W) discharge. the pressure increase was approximately 10%. The mechanism for the pressure increase is boundary-layer heating. Heating from the discharge causes the boundary layer to locally thicken. creating a pressure increase through viscous interaction. The heating is a result of Joule heating in the plasma and convective heating from the hot electrode and plate. The relative magnitudes of Joule heating and convective heating are unknown.

A short (10 s) incubation in a 2 mM FcC12SH solution labels the pre-existing defect sites present in a tetradecanethiol (C14S−Au) SAM. Additional defects in a C14S−Au SAM are then created by voltammetric cycling to reductive potentials. The effects of changing the desorption potential and the hold time at the desorption potential were investigated by monitoring the change in the two characteristic FcC12S−Au peaks. These two peaks are associated with FcC12S−Au filling individual single site defects (peak I at 260 mV) and pinhole defects (peak II at 380 mV). The reductive desorption potential applied to a binary (FcC12S−/C14S−Au) SAM results in a partial desorption and a potential “remixing” of the phase-separated state. ,True,l8vPa2oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,58,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la061684c,13740729809126603906,/scholar?cites=13740729809126603906,,,,0,0,0

Our experimental results show that. although convex structures enable faster droplet growth in an air-vapor mixture. the same structures impose the opposite effect during pure vapor condensation. hindering droplet growth. We developed a model for each case to predict the heat flux distribution along the structured surface. and the model shows reasonable agreement with experimental results. This work demonstrates that the effects of geometric features on dropwise condensation are not invariable but rather dependent on the scenario of resistances to heat and mass transfer in the system.

Electrowetting provides a means of preparing a droplet on a substrate for lift-off. When a voltage is applied between a water droplet and a dielectric-coated electrode. the wettability of the substrate increases in a controlled way. leading to the spreading of the droplet. Once the voltage is released. the droplet recoils. due to a sudden excess in surface energy. and droplet detachment may follow. The process of drop detachment and lift-off. prevalent in both biology and micro-engineering. has to date been considered primarily in terms of qualitative scaling arguments for idealized superhydrophobic substrates. We here consider the eletrically-induced ejection of droplets from substrates of finite wettability and analyze the process quantitatively.

Three that involve storage of information (rather than computation) include its usage of energy. the robustness of stored information over long times. and its ability to resist corruption through tampering. The difficulty in solving these problems using present methods has stimulated interest in the possibilities available through fundamentally different strategies. including storage of information in molecules. Here we show that storage of information in mixtures of readily available. stable. low-molecular-weight molecules offers new approaches to this problem.

Although omniphobic surfaces have been designed and demonstrated. they can fail during condensation. a phenomenon ubiquitous in both nature and industrial applications.

Van Hoa proposed a family of 2SHI (two stage hierarchical information) estimators for the coefficient vector of the linear regression model. These 2SHI estimators were demonstrated to dominate in average mean squared errors (MSE) the OLS and the Stein estimators. A number of applications of the 2SHI estimators in empirical economic studies based on static and dynamic regression models where the 2SHI dominance was calculated have also been reported (see Van Hoa 1992a. 1992b. 1993).In 1990 and 1993. Van Hoa and Chaturvedi extended the 2SHI further and considered a more general family of 2SHI estimators.

Notwithstanding. network robustness assessment has been mostly confined to the analysis of complete link breakdown based on topological metrics. We propose reliability indicators that encompass changes in network performance with respect to the entire range of possible capacity reductions. Link criticality and degradation rapidity are measured by constructing network degradation curve that describe the relation between local capacity reduction and global change in network performance. We develop a public transport robustness assessment model which computes passenger flow distribution and network performance metrics under planned capacity reductions. The model is applied to the urban rail-bound network of Amsterdam.

1262864,Language Based Security for Java and JML,2006,Martinus Elisabeth Warnier,,,,,,Programs contain bugs. Finding program bugs is important. especially in situations where safety and security of a program is required. This thesis proposes a number of analysis methods for enforcing the absence of such bugs. In the first part of the thesis the Java Modeling Language (JML) is the main object of study. The expressiveness of JML is shown by specifying the behavior a number of semantically complex Java program fragments.  Program verifications tools. such as the LOOP verification framework and ESC/Java. are used to formally prove the correctness of these specifications. We also show how JML can be used to ensure a safe and secure control flow for a complete Java card applet and how JML can be used to express secure information flow in Java programs. Secure information flow. or confidentiality. is central in the second part of the thesis. Several program verification techniques are introduced that enforce security properties. specifically confidentiality.  The idea is that we want a (provably sound) analysis technique that enforces a secure information flow policy for a program. Such a policy typically specifies what information -contained in the program- is secret and what information is publicly available. Non-interference is the technical notion used to prove confidentiality for programs. Informally. a program is deemed non-interfering if its low level (public) output values are completely independent of high level (secret) input variables of a program. Several forms of non-interference have been studied in the literature. The most common (and also the weakest) form is termination-insensitive non-interference.

One of the major barriers to commercialization is the recalcitrance of plant cell wall polysaccharides to enzymatic hydrolysis. Biomass pretreatment with ionic liquids (ILs) enables efficient saccharification of biomass. but residual ILs inhibit both saccharification and microbial fuel production. requiring extensive washing after IL pretreatment. Pretreatment itself can also produce biomass-derived inhibitory compounds that reduce microbial fuel production. Therefore. there are multiple points in the process from biomass to biofuel production that must be interrogated and optimized to maximize fuel production. Here. we report the development of an IL-tolerant cellulase cocktail by combining thermophilic bacterial glycoside hydrolases produced by a mixed consortia with recombinant glycoside hydrolases. This enzymatic cocktail saccharifies IL-pretreated biomass at higher temperatures and in the presence of much higher IL concentrations than commercial fungal cocktails. Sugars obtained from saccharification of IL-pretreated switchgrass using this cocktail can be converted into biodiesel (fatty acid ethyl-esters or FAEEs) by a metabolically engineered strain of E. coli. During these studies. we found that this biodiesel-producing E. coli strain was sensitive to ILs and inhibitors released by saccharification.

Thermophilic bacterial consortia are a potential source of cellulases and hemicellulases adapted to harsher reaction conditions than commercial fungal enzymes. Compost-derived microbial consortia were adapted to switchgrass at 60°C to develop thermophilic biomass-degrading consortia for detailed studies. Microbial community analysis using small-subunit rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing and short-read metagenomic sequencing demonstrated that thermophilic adaptation to switchgrass resulted in low-diversity bacterial consortia with a high abundance of bacteria related to thermophilic paenibacilli.

Here we identify cis-acting regulatory elements that target the Caenorhabditis elegans X chromosome for repression by the DCC. The DCC binds to discrete. dispersed sites on X of two types. rex sites (recruitment elements on X) recruit the DCC in an autonomous. DNA sequence-dependent manner using a 12-base-pair (bp) consensus motif that is enriched on X. This motif is critical for DCC binding. is clustered in rex sites. and confers much of X-chromosome specificity. Motif variants enriched on X by 3.8-fold or more are highly predictive (95%) for rex sites. In contrast. dox sites (dependent on X) lack the X-enriched variants and cannot bind the DCC when detached from X. dox sites are more prevalent than rex sites and. unlike rex sites …,True,bWJ7gj0AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,104,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/5/602.short,15752467502519790909,/scholar?cites=15752467502519790909,,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/5/602.full.pdf,0,0,0

For this technology to be commercially viable on a large scale. it is critical to make production cost efficient by streamlining both the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass and fuel production.

However. ecosystems most likely to yield relevant enzymes. such as tropical rain forest soil in Puerto Rico. are often too complex for enzyme discovery using current metagenomic sequencing technologies.

Here we report on the metagenomic and proteogenomic analyses of a compost-derived bacterial consortium adapted to switchgrass at elevated temperature with high levels of glycoside hydrolase activities. Near-complete genomes were reconstructed for the most abundant populations. which included composite genomes for populations closely related to sequenced strains of Thermus thermophilus and Rhodothermus marinus. and for novel populations that are related to thermophilic Paenibacilli and an uncultivated subdivision of the little-studied Gemmatimonadetes phylum.

The sex switch gene xol-1 is the direct molecular target of this X:A signal and integrates both X and autosomal components to determine sexual fate. X chromosome number is relayed by X signal elements (XSEs) that act cumulatively to repress xol-1 in XX animals. thereby inducing hermaphrodite fate. Ploidy is relayed by autosomal signal elements (ASEs). which counteract the single dose of XSEs in XO animals to activate xol-1 and induce the male fate. Our goal was to identify and characterize new XSEs and further analyze known XSEs to understand the principles by which a small difference in the concentration of an intracellular signal is amplified to induce dramatically different developmental fates.

For example. while molecular genetic tools have been developed. including CRISPR/Cas9. facile genome engineering of A. niger remains challenging. To address these challenges. we have developed a simple Cas9-based gene targeting method that provides selectable. iterative. and ultimately marker-free generation of genomic deletions and insertions. This method leverages locus-specific “pop-out” recombination to suppress off-target integrations. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by targeting the phenotypic marker albA and validated it by targeting the glaA and mstC loci. After two selection steps. we observed 100% gene editing efficiency across all three loci. This method greatly reduces the effort required to engineer the A. niger genome and overcomes low Cas9 transformations efficiency by eliminating the need for extensive screening. This method represents a significant addition to the A. niger genome engineering toolbox and could be adapted for use in other organisms. It is expected that this method will impact several areas of industrial biotechnology. such as the development of new strains for the secretion of heterologous enzymes and the discovery and optimization of metabolic pathways.,True,bWJ7gj0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,23,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210243,1578489934915083652,/scholar?cites=1578489934915083652,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210243,0,0,0

Solar energy technology has been touted as one of the most promising sources for low-carbon. non-fossil fuel energy production. However. the true potential of solar-based technologies is established by augmenting efficiency through satisfactory environmental performance in relation to other renewable energy systems. This paper presents an environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) of a solar-photovoltaic (PV) system and a solar-thermal system. Single crystalline Si solar cells are considered for the solar PV system and an evacuated glass tube collector is considered for the solar thermal system in this analysis. A life-cycle inventory (LCI) is developed considering all inputs and outputs to assess and compare the environmental impacts of both systems for 16 impact indicators. LCA has been performed by the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD). Impact 2002+. Cumulative Energy Demand (CED). Eco-points 97. Eco-indicator 99 and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methods. using SimaPro software.

The activation energy is found to be dependent on the conversion ratio in a broad range of 0.32−1.33 eV. and the oxidation kinetics is identified to be the classical nucleation mechanism that can be modeled by the Avrami−Erofeev equation.

Cham,A novel thermal energy storage system that can store large amounts of wind power by high temperature phase change materials (PCMs) has been developed. Wind power is growing rapidly due to the global environmental concern regarding green and clean energy. However. the extent of concerns become greater of wind curtailed loss due to insufficient transmission capacity. which contributes to serious wind power curtailment and reduction in economic benefits of wind farms.

1262929,Experimental and numerical study of nanoparticles for potential energy applications,2010,Pengxiang Song,,,,,,This thesis investigates both experimentally and numerically the oxidation. sintering. melting and solidification processes of different nanoparticles under various thermodynamic scenarios. with a background for energy applications. Two sets of main techniques are adopted in this work. which are isoconvensional kinetic analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. Based on the techniques of simultaneous Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). for first time the isoconvensional kinetic analysis is applied to study the oxidation of nickel and tin nanoparticles. This method is demonstrated capable of modelling one-step nanoscale oxidation and revealing underling kinetic mechanisms. Moreover. some distinct features of nanoparticle oxidation compared with their bulk counterparts are found such as melting depression. oxidation kinetic change in the vicinity of Curie point of nickel and pressure-related two-step oxidation of tin nanoparticles. The detailed study from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation establishes a three-stage sintering process of two nickel nanoparticles. which is unable to be described by bulk continuum-level models. MD is applied to study the interaction between nickel and aluminium and its consequent thermo-mechanical and structural property evolution in a nickel-coating aluminium particle in a heating and cooling cycle. The simulation successfully predicts the atomic diffusion during melting and the formation of glass and crystal phases. and allows for the estimation of interior core-shell pressure.

The numerical model used NaCl-MgCl2 mixture as PCMs and hot air as heat transfer fluid (HTF). An experimental system was built to validate the model. and the experimental data agrees reasonably well with the simulation results. The simulation results revealed the effects of the Reynolds and Stefan numbers and the surface topography of the zigzag plate on the charging process. Besides. the effect of the relationship between Reynolds and Stefan numbers on the charging process under a new boundary condition employing a fixed input power was studied. It is found that by modifying the shape of the zigzag plate surface it is feasible to enhance the heat transfer of the LHTES unit remarkably.

1262932,Structure–Property relationships for nanofluids,2011,Pengxiang Song and Sanjeeva Witharana and Yulong Ding,,,,,Brunel University,Nanofluids refer to dilute liquid suspensions of nanoparticles in commonly used heat transfer liquids. They triggered much excitement since mid 1990s mainly owing to the claims of anomalous enhancement of thermal conductivity even at very low nanoparticle concentrations. There have been numerous attempts to interpret the mechanism(s) that drive the displayed enhancement. A long debate within the research community supported by experimental and theoretical evidence has highlighted the nanoparticle structuring as the dominant underlying mechanism. On the other hand the viscosity increase as a result of nanoparticle structuring raises concerns about their suitability for certain applications.

Melting is a phase transformation from a crystalline solid state that is rigid and topologically long-range ordered into a liquid state that is topologically long-range disordered. Melting is crucial to thermodynamic properties of nanoparticles/clusters. Under equilibrium conditions. melting of a bulk material usually occurs in a very narrow temperature and pressure range. A small change in temperature or pressure could largely change the phase from one status to another. When the size of the material is reduced dramatically. the surface-to-volume ratio is increased. which makes the melting of the nanoparticles different from that of their bulk counterpart. For instance. reduced particles have complicated size dependence and premelting phenomena.
