1156372,Exceptional activity for methane combustion over modular Pd@ CeO2 subunits on functionalized Al2O3,2012,M Cargnello and JJ Delgado Jaén and JC Hernández-Garrido and K Bakhmutsky and T Montini and JJ Calvino Gámez and RJ Gorte and P Fornasiero,337,Science,6095,713-717,American Association for the Advancement of Science,There is a critical need for improved methane-oxidation catalysts to both reduce emissions of methane. a greenhouse gas. and improve the performance of gas turbines. However. materials that are currently available either have low activity below 400°C or are unstable at higher temperatures. Here. we describe a supramolecular approach in which single units composed of a palladium (Pd) core and a ceria (CeO2) shell are preorganized in solution and then homogeneously deposited onto a modified hydrophobic alumina. Electron microscopy and other structural methods revealed that the Pd cores remained isolated even after heating the catalyst to 850°C. Enhanced metal-support interactions led to exceptionally high methane oxidation. with complete conversion below 400°C and outstanding thermal stability under demanding conditions.,True,d5fY-0sAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,639,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6095/713.abstract,12786501201342152903,/scholar?cites=12786501201342152903,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53473793/Exceptional_activity_for_methane_combust20170612-10135-5qfez0.pdf,0,0,0

Ideally. a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of such a sample should contain only one grey level for each of the compositions in the sample. By exploiting this property in the reconstruction algorithm. either the quality of the reconstruction can be improved significantly. or the number of required projection images can be reduced. The discrete reconstruction typically contains fewer artifacts and does not have to be segmented. as it already contains one grey level for each composition.Recently. a new algorithm. called discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART). has been proposed that can be used effectively on experimental electron tomography datasets. In this paper. we propose discrete tomography as a general reconstruction method for electron tomography in materials science.

From both fundamental and technological standpoints. this field requires advancements in three principle directions: (a) understanding the mechanism and driving forces of three-dimensional (3D) SA with both nano- and microlevels of organization; (b) understanding disassembly/deconstruction processes; and (c) finding synthetic methods of assembly into continuous superstructures without insulating barriers. From this perspective. we investigated the formation of well-known star-like PbS superstructures and found a number of previously unknown or overlooked aspects that can advance the knowledge of NP self-assembly in these three directions.

The degradation of the TPPT molecule. which turned out to be a first-order reaction. started taking place after 6 h at both temperatures. leading to the breakage of the P=S bond with the formation of triphenyl phosphate.

PdO is reported to be the more active phase.[7] Although metallic Pd tends to be significantly less active.[5. 8] the PdO phase is not stable at high temperatures and low O2 partial pressures. The transition temperature at which the mechanism involving metallic Pd dominates is increased by increasing O2 pressures and by interactions between Pd and reducible supports.[9] It should be recognized that the above discussion is a greatly simplified picture of the reaction on working catalysts because the nature of CÀH bond cleavage changes with the Pd oxidation state and because Pd and PdO can co-exist under non-steady conditions.[8. 10] Ceria (CeO2) is one of the most effective promoters for Pd oxidation among oxides used as a support and it can. therefore. play a pivotal role in enhancing catalytic stability and activity for methane combustion.[11. 12] CeO2 is known to have two beneficial functions: it provides oxygen for the catalytic combustion at low temperature by transferring oxygen to Pd [9. 13. 14] and it can improve the stability of the active PdO phase at high temperatures.[15–17] However. pure ceria has limited thermal stability.[18] and direct contact between the ceria and Pd is required for oxygen transfer.[11. 19] For emissions-control applications in gasoline and lean-burn engines. the exhaust contains large amounts of water vapor (5.0–15.0%)[6. 20] and water is known to strongly inhibit catalytic combustion on Pd-based materials.[21 …,True,jm8hP-IAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,82,https://www.academia.edu/download/53473810/Methane_Catalytic_Combustion_over_Hierar20170612-10132-1s8x652.pdf,11762148992878232964,/scholar?cites=11762148992878232964,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53473810/Methane_Catalytic_Combustion_over_Hierar20170612-10132-1s8x652.pdf,0,0,0

1156527,Characteristics of laminar lifted flames in a partially premixed jet,1997,BJ Lee and MS Cha and SH Chung,127,Combustion science and technology,1-6,55-70,Taylor & Francis Group,The liftoff and blowout characteristics of laminar flames in a partially premixed jet are studied for propane and n-butane fuels mixed with air. As the flow rate increases. flame lifts off from a nozzle attached flame and liftoff height increases highly nonlinearly with flow rate. and then blowout occurs. The jet velocities at liftoff and at blowout decrease linearly with the increase in air dilution and are independent of nozzle diameter. The liftoff height at blowout is proportional to the square of nozzle diameter and to the square of fuel mass fraction. Correlations for the liftoff heights and blowout conditions are derived by using a cold jet theory for velocity and species concentrations. based on the tribrachial nature of lifted flames. That is. at the flame anchoring point. the flame has the characteristics of a stoichiometric flame and its propagation speed balances axial flow velocity.

Excess O2 in the partial oxidation process is known to increase the combustion portion. resulting in a decreased yield of H2 and CO. However. in this parametric investigation. there was no apparent decrease in the H2 and CO selectivity. Adding O2 did not increase the portion of combustion in the overall reaction. Rather. an excess O2 supply from partial oxidation stoichiometry resulted in an increase in CO2 selectivity without a reduction in CO selectivity. Heavy hydrocarbon species were identified as a source of CO2 in excess O2 conditions due to preferential oxidative cracking. The additional oxidation of C1–C4 species by excess O2 provided a minor contribution to CO2.

We found that the original flow field separates near the flame when it locates at a flow stagnation plane. resulting in a double-stagnant flow configuration.

1156549,On the extinction limit and flammability limit of non-adiabatic stretched methane–air premixed flames,1997,Yiguang Ju and Hongsheng Guo and Kaoru Maruta and Fengshan Liu,342,Journal of fluid mechanics,,315-334,Cambridge University Press,Extinction limits and the lean flammability limit of non-adiabatic stretched premixed methane–air flames are investigated numerically with detailed chemistry and two different Planck mean absorption coefficient models. Attention is paid to the combined effect of radiative heat loss and stretch at low stretch rate. It is found that for a mixture at an equivalence ratio lower than the standard lean flammability limit. a moderate stretch can strengthen the combustion and allow burning. The flame is extinguished at a high stretch rate due to stretch and is quenched at a low stretch rate due to radiation loss. A O-shaped curve of flame temperature versus stretch rate with two distinct extinction limits. a radiation extinction limit and a stretch extinction limit respectively on the left-and right-hand sides. is obtained. A C-shaped curve showing the flammability limit of the stretched methane–air flame is obtained by plotting these two extinction limits in the mixture strength coordinate. A good agreement is shown on comparing the predicted results with the experimental data. For equivalence ratio larger than a critical value. it is found that the O-shaped temperature curve opens up in the middle of the stable branch. so that the stable branch divides into two stable flame branches; a weak flame branch and a normal flame branch. The weak flame can survive between the radiation extinction limit and the opening point (jump limit) while the normal flame branch can survive from its stretch extinction limit to zero stretch rate. Finally. a G-shaped curve showing both extinction limits and jump limits of stretched methane–air flames is presented.

It is well known that radiative heat loss produces a lean and rich concentration limit for one-dimensional unstrained flames (Coward & Jones 1952; Spalding 1957; Buckmaster 1976; Lakashima. Paul & Mukunda 1988; Sibulkin & Frendi 1990; Law & Egolfopoulos 1992). These limits are sometimes called standard limits.

To date. the question of how the flammability limit of a stretched flame is related to the standard limit remains unresolved in the combustion literature. On the experimental side. a linear extrapolation method was suggested by Law. Zhu & Yu (1986) to determine the standard limit by extrapolating the stretch extinction limit of counterflow flames to zero stretch rate. Although it predicted reasonable results in some practical applications. this experiment-based method lacks sound theoretical ground. On the other hand. the application of the flamelet concept to turbulent combustion also requires an accurate determination of the flammability limit and the flame regimes of the stretched flame.Recent development of microgravity experiment provides an ideal environment to observe combustion phenomena near the flammability limit.

Both experimental and numerical investigations demonstrated that the bluff body can significantly extend the blow-off limit. In the present paper. the effect of solid materials (i.e.. quartz. stainless steel. and SiC) on the blow-off limit of this micro-combustor was investigated numerically. The results show that the blow-off limit of the quartz combustor is the largest. while that of the SiC combustor is the smallest. The underlying mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the interactions between the flow field. heat transfer processes and flame stabilization. It is demonstrated that when the thermal conductivity is small (i.e.. quartz). less heat is conducted to the upstream walls. the fresh mixture is not sufficiently preheated and the gaseous volume does not expanded so significantly.

Attention is paid to the combined effect of radiative heat loss and stretch at low stretch rate. It is found that for a mixture at an equivalence ratio lower than the standard lean flammability limit. a moderate stretch can strengthen the combustion and allow burning. The flame is extinguished at a high stretch rate due to stretch and is quenched at a low stretch rate due to radiation loss. A O-shaped curve of flame temperature versus stretch rate with two distinct extinction limits. a radiation extinction limit and a stretch extinction limit respectively on the left-and right-hand sides. is obtained. A C-shaped curve showing the flammability limit of the stretched methane–air flame is obtained by plotting these two extinction limits in the mixture strength coordinate. A good agreement is shown on comparing the predicted results with the experimental data. For equivalence ratio larger than a critical value. it is found that the O-shaped temperature curve opens up in the middle of the stable branch. so that the stable branch divides into two stable flame branches; a weak flame branch and a normal flame branch. The weak flame can survive between the radiation extinction limit and the opening point (jump limit) while the normal flame branch can survive from its stretch extinction limit to zero stretch rate.

The present study extends previous results by bridging the theories of the non-adiabatic stationary flame balls and travelling flames and allowing rigorous consideration of radiation heat losses. The results show that the effects of radiation heat loss play an important role in flame regimes and flame transition and result in a new isolated self-extinguishing flame.

Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. The results show that the addition of hydrogen can significantly enlarge the flammable region and extend the flammability limit to lower equivalence ratios. If the equivalence ratio is kept constant. the addition of hydrogen increases the emission of NO in a flame due to the enhancement in the rate of the NNH or N2O intermediate NO formation routes. The addition of hydrogen causes a monotonic decrease in the formation of NO2 and N2O. except flames near the extinction limits. where the emission of NO2 and N2O first increases. and then decreases with the increase in the fraction of hydrogen.

The receiver length is 2 m and has a diameter of 6 mm. A diluted solution of water-antifreeze is selected as working fluid. This solution is flowing as cycle through the focal pipe and serpentine. The solution in the heat exchanger is heated during the sunlight by means of solar energy concentrator (solar parabolic trough). The parabolic trough is tracking the sun using simple mechanism to collect the highest amount of solar radiation by optimum angle. The receiver is covered with transparent borosilicate glass to avoid the heat transfer by convection to the surrounding (ie the greenhouse effect is utilized) and the space between the glass and tube is evacuated. Aluminum serpentine of the heat exchanger is installed in the bottom of the still. It is attached extremely with thermally insulated pipelines through the trough. The fluid is forced flow using small pump which is powered by PV system. The multi-stage solar still water desalination system was designed to recover latent heat from evaporation and condensation processes in 2 stages.

Garg and Brian Waldecker,5,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,3,299-307,IEEE,This paper discusses detection of global predicates in a distributed program. Earlier algorithms for detection of global predicates proposed by Chandy and Lamport (1985) work only for stable predicates. A predicate is stable if it does not turn false once it becomes true. Our algorithms detect even unstable predicates. without excessive overhead. In the past. such predicates have been regarded as too difficult to detect. The predicates are specified by using a logic described formally in this paper. We discuss detection of weak conjunctive predicates that are formed by conjunction of predicates local to processes in the system. Our detection methods will detect whether such a predicate is true for any interleaving of events in the system. regardless of whether the predicate is stable. Also. any predicate that can be reduced to a set of weak conjunctive predicates is detectable.

1156610,Elements of distributed computing,2002,Vijay K Garg,,,,,John Wiley & Sons,A lucid and up-to-date introduction to the fundamentals of distributed computing systems As distributed systems become increasingly available. the need for a fundamental discussion of the subject has grown. Designed for first-year graduate students and advanced undergraduates as well as practicing computer engineers seeking a solid grounding in the subject. this well-organized text covers the fundamental concepts in distributed computing systems such as time. state. simultaneity. order. knowledge. failure. and agreement in distributed systems. Departing from the focus on shared memory and synchronous systems commonly taken by other texts. this is the first useful reference based on an asynchronous model of distributed computing. the most widely used in academia and industry. The emphasis of the book is on developing general mechanisms that can be applied to a variety of problems. Its examples-clocks. locks. cameras. sensors. controllers. slicers. and synchronizers-have been carefully chosen so that they are fundamental and yet useful in practical contexts. The text's advantages include: Emphasizes general mechanisms that can be applied to a variety of problems Uses a simple induction-based technique to prove correctness of all algorithms Includes a variety of exercises at the end of each chapter Contains material that has been extensively class tested Gives instructor flexibility in choosing appropriate balance between practice and theory of distributed computing,True,lHre0o0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,225,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NlVBtVPeR0QC&oi=fnd&pg=PR17&dq=info:KLiFYbvKMDEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=6iU6xYEcxx&sig=GEhpOffrxHSD24Gk2Yoaac3x-zw,3544555812884428840,/scholar?cites=3544555812884428840,,,0,0,0

Despite several major studies on susceptibility to leprosy. few genomic loci have been replicated independently. We have conducted an association analysis of more than 1.500 individuals from different case-control and family studies. and observed consistent associations between genetic variants in both TLR1 and the HLA-DRB1/DQA1 regions with susceptibility to leprosy (TLR1 I602S. case-control P = 5.7×10−8. OR = 0.31. 95% CI = 0.20–0.48. and HLA-DQA1 rs1071630. case-control P = 4.9×10−14. OR = 0.43. 95% CI = 0.35–0.54). The effect sizes of these associations suggest that TLR1 and HLA-DRB1/DQA1 are major susceptibility genes in susceptibility to leprosy. Further population differentiation analysis shows that the TLR1 locus is extremely differentiated. The protective dysfunctional 602S allele is rare in Africa but expands to become the dominant allele among individuals of European descent. This supports the hypothesis that this locus may be under selection from mycobacteria or other pathogens that are recognized by TLR1 and its co-receptors.

A DEDS is modeled as a state machine and is controlled by disabling some of its transitions. Two types of cost functions are defined: a cost of control function corresponding to disabling transitions in the state machine. and a penalty of control function corresponding to reaching some undesired states or not reaching some desired states in the controlled system. The control objective is to design an optimal control mechanism. if it exists. so that the net cost is minimized. Since a DEDS is represented as a state machine—a directed graph—network flow techniques are naturally applied for designing optimal supervisors. It is also shown that our techniques can be used to solve supervisory control problems under complete as well as partial observation.

Our algorithm is based on two novel concepts-a fault-tolerant vector clock to maintain causality information in spite of failures. and a history mechanism to detect orphan states and obsolete messages. These two mechanisms together with checkpointing and message-logging are used to restore the system to a consistent state after a failure of one or more processes. Our algorithm is completely asynchronous. It handles multiple failures. does not assume any message ordering. causes the minimum amount of rollback and restores the maximum recoverable state with low overhead.

A probabilistic language is a unit interval-valued map over the set of traces of the system satisfying certain consistency constraints. Regular language operators such as choice. concatenation. and Kleene-closure have been defined in the setting of probabilistic languages to allow modeling of complex systems in terms of simpler ones. The set of probabilistic languages is closed under such operators. thus forming an algebra. It also is a complete partial order under a natural ordering in which the operators are continuous. Hence. recursive equations can be solved in this algebra. This is alternatively derived by using the contraction mapping theorem on the set of probabilistic languages which is shown to be a complete metric space.

1156622,Principles of distributed systems,2012,Vijay K Garg,3144,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Distributed computer systems are now widely available but. despite a number of recent advances. the design of software for these systems remains a challenging task. involving two main difficulties: the absence of a shared clock and the absence of a shared memory. The absence of a shared clock means that the concept of time is not useful in distributed systems. The absence of shared memory implies that the concept of a state of a distributed system also needs to be redefined. These two important concepts occupy a major portion of this book. Principles of Distributed Systems describes tools and techniques that have been successfully applied to tackle the problem of global time and state in distributed systems. The author demonstrates that the concept of time can be replaced by that of causality. and clocks can be constructed to provide causality information. The problem of not having a global state is alleviated by developing efficient algorithms for detecting properties and computing global functions. The author's major emphasis is in developing general mechanisms that can be applied to a variety of problems. For example. instead of discussing algorithms for standard problems. such as termination detection and deadlocks. the book discusses algorithms to detect general properties of a distributed computation.

These sequences can be ordered to form a lattice. Since logical (untimed) DES behaviours described by regular languages also form a lattice. questions of controllability for timed DES's may be treated in much the same manner as they are for untimed systems. In this paper we establish conditions for the controllability of timed DES performance specification which are expressed as inequations on the lattice of sequences. These specifications may take the form of sets of acceptable event occurrence times. maximum or minimum occurrence times. or limits on the separation times between events. Optimal behaviours are found as extremal solutions to these inequations using fixed point results for lattices.,True,lHre0o0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,86,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/481519/,18127880530463500942,/scholar?cites=18127880530463500942,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.800.4241&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1156653,On decidability of distributed diagnosis under unbounded-delay communication,2007,Wenbin Qiu and Ratnesh Kumar and Shengbing Jiang,52,IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control,1,114-116,IEEE,In this note we show that the problem of distributed diagnosis under unbounded communication delay is decidable when there is no inferencing involved among the diagnosers. The notion of joint infin -diagnosability is introduced to capture the diagnosability property in this setting. We show the equivalence of joint infin -diagnosability and codiagnosability. which captures the diagnosability property in the decentralized setting (i.e.. one involving no communication). Thus the decidability result follows from the decidability of codiagnosability established in a previous paper.

Here the extensibility is defined as the adaptivity of the schedules to changes resulting from later upgrades. The idea is to use the time-slicing technique to assign transmission timewindows for messages on the bus so that the precedence relations between different processors are enforced by those time-window assignments. and the scheduling problems for each processor and the bus are decoupled. Thus. the existing uni-processor scheduling methods can be applied.

(The additional controlled- system level monitoring safeguards against any possible incompleteness at the software level monitoring.) A software fault is immediately detected when an observed behavior is rejected by a software level monitor. In contrast. when a system level monitor rejects an observed behavior it indicates a system level failure. and an additional isolation step is required to conclude whether a software fault occurred.

Our aim is to find conditions concerning the controller failure time. under which the system's stability and H∞ disturbance attenuation properties are preserved to a desired level. For stability. by using a piecewise Lyapunov function. we show that if the unavailability rate of the controller is smaller than a specified constant and the average time interval between controller failures (ATBCF) is large enough. then the global exponential stability of the system is guaranteed.

1156680,A framework for control-reconfiguration following fault-detection in discrete event systems,2012,Ratnesh Kumar and Shigemasa Takai,,Proc. 8th IFAC SAFEPROCESS,,,,We introduce a framework for control-reconfiguration in discrete event systems that performs fault-detection and then reconfigures the control to ensure that certain desired specifications are met. The controlled system has separate specifications prior to a fault versus after a fault (to allow for any changes in the specification owing to the occurrence of a fault). Prior to the occurrence of a fault. a certain controller is applied so as to ensure a given pre-fault specification. The same controller is continued to be used even after a fault and until its detection. Once a fault is detected. the control is reconfigured. All along the post-fault duration (prior to as well as after reconfiguration). the controlled system is required to satisfy a give post-fault specification. We mathematically formulate the above control problem and provide a condition for reconfigurability.

1156687,Simulation-based algorithms for Markov decision processes,2013,Hyeong Soo Chang and Jiaqiao Hu and Michael C Fu and Steven I Marcus,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Markov decision process (MDP) models are widely used for modeling sequential decision-making problems that arise in engineering. economics. computer science. and the social sciences. Many real-world problems modeled by MDPs have huge state and/or action spaces. giving an opening to the curse of dimensionality and so making practical solution of the resulting models intractable. In other cases. the system of interest is too complex to allow explicit specification of some of the MDP model parameters. but simulation samples are readily available (eg. for random transitions and costs). For these settings. various sampling and population-based algorithms have been developed to overcome the difficulties of computing an optimal solution in terms of a policy and/or value function. Specific approaches include adaptive sampling. evolutionary policy iteration. evolutionary random policy search. and model reference adaptive search.

Dordrecht,In this paper we provide an introduction to nonlinear filtering from two points of view: the innovations approach and the approach based upon an unnormalized conditional density. The filtering problem concerns the estimation of an unobserved stochastic process xt given observations of a related process yt; the classic problem is to calculate. for each t. the conditional distribution of xt given ys. 0 ≤ s ≤ t. First. a brief review of key results on martingales and markov and diffusion processes is presented. Using the innovations approach. stochastic differential equations for the evolution of conditional statistics and of the conditional measure of xt given ys. 0 ≤ s ≤ t are given; these equations are the analogs for the filtering problem of the kolmogorov forward equations.

The worst-case running-time complexity of the algorithm is O((|A|N)H). independent of the size of the state space. where |A| is the size of the action space and H is the horizon length. The algorithm can be used to create an approximate receding horizon control to solve infinite-horizon MDPs. To illustrate the algorithm. computational results are reported on simple examples from inventory …,True,UYbZ1bkAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC,137,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.1040.0145,7465423321227781028,/scholar?cites=7465423321227781028,,https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/6264/TR_2002-19.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

This paper presents a new type of tunable meta-atoms in the X-band frequency range (8–12 GHz) toward reconfigurable metamaterials. The meta-atom is made of all flexible materials compliant to the surface of an interaction object. It uses a liquid metal-based split-ring resonator as its core constituent embedded in a highly flexible elastomer. We demonstrate that simple mechanical stretching of the meta-atom can lead to the great flexibility in reconfiguring its resonance frequency continuously over more than 70% of the X-band frequency range.

At the heart of MCC is the idea that untrusted code comes equipped with a concise high-level model of its security-relevant behavior. This model helps bridge the gap between high-level security policies and low-level binary code. thereby enabling analyses which would otherwise be impractical. For instance. users can use a fully automated verification procedure to determine if the code satisfies their security policies. Alternatively. an automated procedure can sift through a catalog of acceptable policies to identify one that is compatible with the model. Once a suitable policy is selected. MCC guarantees that the policy will not be violated by the code. Unlike previous approaches. the MCC framework enables code producers and consumers to collaborate in order to achieve safety.

1156793,Choreography conformance via synchronizability,2011,Samik Basu and Tevfik Bultan,,,,795-804,ACM,Choreography analysis has been a crucial problem in service oriented computing. Interactions among services involve message exchanges across organizational boundaries in a distributed computing environment. and in order to build such systems in a reliable manner. it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing such interactions. Choreography conformance involves verifying that a set of services behave according to a given choreography specification that characterizes their interactions. Unfortunately this is an undecidable problem when services interact with asynchronous communication. In this paper we present techniques that identify if the interaction behavior for a set of services remain the same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication. This is called the synchronizability problem and determining the synchronizability of a set of services has been an open …,True,qa9dTwkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,87,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1963405.1963516,8138398239686745362,/scholar?cites=8138398239686745362,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samik_Basu/publication/221024014_Choreography_conformance_via_synchronizability/links/0912f509c4c39de557000000/Choreography-conformance-via-synchronizability.pdf,0,0,0

Services and goal are represented using I/O automata which can succinctly and precisely describe the interfaces of the services. Our technique considers existence and synthesis of two types of the choreographers: a simple choreographer capable of only relaying outputs from one service to input of another and a transducing choreographer which is capable of storing and reusing inputs/outputs from the services. The central theme of our technique relies on generating I/O automata representation of all possible choreographed behavior of existing services (captured in form of universal service automaton. a concept introduced in this paper) and verifying that the goal can be simulated by the universal set of choreographed behaviors.,True,qa9dTwkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,66,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4279620/,8849629141126197835,/scholar?cites=8849629141126197835,,https://www.cs.iastate.edu/~sbasu/research/papers/mkb.icws07.pdf,0,0,0

As the use of product lines has increased. so has the need to verify the models used to construct the products in the product line. However. this effort is currently hampered by the difficulty of composing model-checking results for the features in a way that allows reuse for subsequent products. The contributions of this paper are to remove restrictions on how the features can be sequentially composed. to describe how to generate obligations such that all sequentially composed systems can be verified. and to show how to compositionally model check the product in the product line by reusing the variation-point obligations.

Existing solutions to this problem rely on detecting the functional and behavioral equivalence of a particular service to be replaced and candidate services that could replace it. We introduce the notion of context-specific substitutability. where context refers to the overall functionality of the composition that is required to be maintained after replacement of its constituents.

It is well-known that verification of systems that use asynchronous message-based communication with unbounded FIFO queues is undecidable even when the component behaviors are expressed using finite state machines. In this paper we show that there is a sub-class of such systems. called synchronizable systems. for which certain reachability properties (over send actions and over states with no pending receives) remain unchanged when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication. Hence. if a system is synchronizable. then the verification of these reachability properties can be done on the synchronous version of the system and the results hold for the …,True,qa9dTwkAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,40,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-27940-9_5,16645699252075443060,/scholar?cites=16645699252075443060,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.8289&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Smaller operating frequency supports lower path losses but enhances the wavelength and hence the size of standard monpole (8.2 cm in height at 915MHz) or rectangular microstrip patch antenna (11.5 cm × 9.3 cm at 915 MHz). which is prohibitive for underground sensors.

1156842,An optimal client buffer model for multiplexing HTTP streams,2012,Saayan Mitra and Viswanathan Swaminathan,,,,283-288,IEEE,The basic tenet of HTTP streaming is to deliver fragments of video and audio that are individually addressable chunks of content over HTTP. Some media players consume incoming video and audio data only in a time ordered multiplexed format. If alternate tracks need to be added post packaging of the media. it has to be repackaged that involves duplication resulting in multiple multiplexed files. Additionally for adaptive streaming. a set of all those files need to be added for each bitrate. Alternatively. it is more efficient to store component tracks separately. fetching only the required tracks and multiplexing audio and video in the client before sending the data to the decoder. To deliver an optimal viewing experience. the client has to take care of the seemingly conflicting constraints viz.. handling the network jitter. minimizing the time to switch to an alternate track and minimizing the live latency.

This framework. called condition templates. allows the modeling of processes in which both single-instance and multiple-instance behaviors are exhibited concurrently. A single-instance behavior corresponds to a trace from a single finite-state process. and a multiple-instance behavior corresponds to the timed interleavings of an unspecified number of identical processes operating at the same time. The template framework allows the modeling of correct operation for systems consisting of concurrent mixtures of both single and multiple-instance behaviors. This representation can then be used in online fault monitoring for confirming the correct operation of a system.

Resilience is the ability of a system or enterprise to minimize the effects of a disruption. Although resilient manufacturing enterprises have been investigated in many different areas. there has been little analytical investigation into real-time control policies for resiliency. Our goal is to study the real-time resilient control for manufacturing systems through mathematical analysis. To achieve this. we start with developing a model for a general manufacturing network.

1156874,Forbidden state avoidance in controlled Petri nets under partial observation,1995,L Zhang and Lawrence E Holloway,33,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ANNUAL ALLERTON CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION CONTROL AND COMPUTING,,146-155,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS,Forbidden state avoidance control for controlled Petri nets has typically assumed full ob-servation of the system state. However. in many situations. it is difficult if not impossible for a supervisor to observe uniquely all states or events. In such situations. some events (transition firings) may be completely unobservable. or two events may be indistinguishable to the supervisor. Under this partial observation. the supervisor's state estimate of the plant is a set of possible states corresponding to the observations. A control policy must be formulated that will ensure that the plant will not reach a forbidden state. no matter which state in the estimate set the plant is currently in. This paper represents an initial investigation of enforcement of state-based specifications using event based (partial observations. We first present a relatively compact method for representing the state estimate set. In particular. the state estimate set is represented as just the possible markings which are minimal nodes in the unobservable reachability space.

A cantilevered magnetic microfiber will bend in response to an applied magnetic field. In a nonuniform field. generated for example by a single electromagnet or by a magnetic dipole. a magnetic microfiber displays position hysteresis as the field strength increases and decreases.

1156912,Identifying high risk Nk contingencies for online security assessment,2005,Qiming Chen and James D McCalley,20,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,2,823-834,IEEE,It is impractical to analyze all of the possible contingencies in a large-scale interconnected power network. Therefore. a standard approach is to analyze only a subset of the contingencies. The normal method of selecting this subset is via use of the so-called N-1 rule. This paper goes a step further by proposing a new method of forming a contingency list. based on substation configuration obtained from topology processing data and probability analysis of protection system failures. This method is particularly suited for online security assessment. Protection system failures assessed include stuck breakers and failure to operate. The method is described via application to a single substation. verified using the IEEE-RTS96. and illustrated using topology data from a large utilities EMS.,True,OL1VzgEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,232,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1425578/,11235851446613669703,/scholar?cites=11235851446613669703,,http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~jdm/WebJournalPapers/TopoChenFinal.pdf,0,0,0

1156932,PLC-based implementation of supervisory control for discrete event systems,1998,Martin Fabian and Anders Hellgren,3,,,3305-3310,IEEE,The supervisory control theory is a general theory for automatic synthesis of controllers (supervisors) for discrete event systems. given a plant model and a specification for the controlled behavior. Though the theory has for over a decade received substantial attention in academics. still very few industrial applications exist. The main reason for this seems to be a discrepancy between the abstract supervisor and its physical implementation.

1156933,Modeling of discrete event systems using finite automata with variables,2007,Markus Skoldstam and Knut Akesson and Martin Fabian,,,,3387-3392,IEEE,To get industrial acceptance of supervisory control theory. there is a need to bridge the gap between the signal-based industrial reality and the event-based supervisory control framework. This paper tries to do this by introducing a modeling formalism with automata extended with variables. guard expressions and action functions. The formalism is suitable for modeling plants and specifications in the supervisory control framework. An algorithm that transforms a set of extended automata into a set of ordinary automata with equivalent behavior. is presented. This allows the user to model complex behaviors with a compact representation. and at the same time use existing algorithms for analysis.,True,Vv2dq8EAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,160,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4434894/,3527578628733296505,/scholar?cites=3527578628733296505,,,0,0,0

The presented algorithms solve the controllability problem. In many real-world applications both the plant and specification is given as a set of interacting automata or processes.

The framework is based on sequences of operations and includes a formal relation between product properties and process operations. This relation includes liaisons (interfaces) and precedence relations. where the precedence relations generate preconditions for the related process operations. From this information a set of sequences of operations (SOPs) is generated. A formal graphical language for hierarchical operations and SOPs is then introduced and defined based on automata extended with variables.

The approach is based on compositional minimisation. using concepts of process equivalence. In this context. a large number of ways are suggested how a finite-state automaton can be simplified such that the results of supervisor synthesis are preserved.

Compositional synthesis exploits the modular structure of the input model. and therefore works best for models consisting of a large number of small automata. The state-space explosion is mitigated by the use of abstraction to simplify individual components. and the property of synthesis equivalence guarantees that the final synthesis result is the same as it would have been for the non-abstracted model. The paper describes synthesis equivalent abstractions and shows their use in an algorithm to efficiently compute supervisors.

This is mainly due to the fact that the SCT is stated in an event-based asynchronous setting whilst PLCs are signal-based. synchronous and sequential. Based on Petri nets. the PLC programming language sequential function chart (SFC) seems to be the ideal choice for this transition. However. the transition requires detailed knowledge of how the PLC and SFCs work. Different execution models for SFCs are presented and compared with the international standard IEC 61131-3.

In such cells. each robot has to avoid running into static obstacles and when the robots work together in a shared space they must also avoid colliding with each other.

Given a plant G and two marked specification languages K 1 and K 2. a supervisor S is said to be (K 1. K 2)-mutually nonblocking if (for i. j= 1. 2) L m (G|| S)∩ K i⊆ L m (G|| S)∩ K j. This means that when the closed-loop system marks a trace of K i. then it is always able to continue to a trace of K j. also marked in the closed-loop system.

The method is able to restart systems even after nonforeseen errors that cannot be planned for. and the online part of the restart method does not require use of more powerful computers than a standard Programmable Logic Controller. It is shown what properties the control function must have to ensure that there is at least one restart state for each controller state.

1156955,A framework for compositional nonblocking verification of extended finite-state machines,2016,Sahar Mohajerani and Robi Malik and Martin Fabian,26,Discrete Event Dynamic Systems,1,33-84,Springer US,This paper presents a framework for compositional nonblocking verification of discrete event systems modelled as extended finite-state machines (EFSM). Previous results are improved to consider general conflict-equivalence based abstractions of EFSMs communicating both via shared variables and events. Performance issues resulting from the conversion of EFSM systems to finite-state machine systems are avoided by operating directly on EFSMs. deferring the unfolding of variables into state machines as long as possible. Several additional methods to abstract EFSMs and remove events are also presented. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in the discrete event systems tool Supremica. and the paper presents experimental results for several large EFSM models that can be verified faster than by previously used methods.,True,Vv2dq8EAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,24,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10626-015-0217-y.pdf,2946450789600116588,/scholar?cites=2946450789600116588,,https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10289/10146/jdeds2014.pdf?sequence=6&isAllowed=n,0,0,0

The proposed strategy ensures that in a connection. each node receives two copies of the same data unit: one copy on the working circuit and a second copy that can be extracted from linear combinations of data units transmitted on a shared protection path. This guarantees instantaneous recovery of data units upon the failure of a working circuit. The strategy can be implemented at an overlay layer. which makes its deployment simple and scalable. While the proposed strategy is similar in spirit to the work of Kamal in 2007 2010. there are significant differences. In particular. it provides protection against multiple-link failures.

Kamal,,,,,ACM,"In the past few years. research in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) has grown at an unprecented rate. This is due to the large number of potential applications and environments WSNs can be used in. Nodes in WSNs communicate in multihop fashion to deliver the sensory information to a central processing unit. such as a base station or a sink node. This form of communication requires a degree of network connectivity which might not be always achievable. either due to the sensor deployment strategy. or due to sensor node failure. which can be malicious. or otherwise. In this thesis. we study the problem of data delivery in disconnected WSNs. A special class of disconnected sensor networks called"" Fragmented wireless sensor networks (FWSN)"" is considered. A FWSN consists of several groups of connected sensor nodes that we call"" fragments"". We propose a mobility based approach that exploits resource rich. in terms of power and buffer size. mobile agents that move in the network and operate as data relays between fragments to eventually deliver data to the base station. The movement of the mobile nodes and their role as relay stations is modeled using a closed queueing network approach. which is used to obtain steady state results. Building on these results. we derive the distributions of the fragment-to-fragment and fragment-to-sink delays. The results show that this model accurately captures the system behavior. Using the same model. the effect of the movement policy. the number and speed of mobile relays. and the service time at each fragment on the end-to-end delay has also been studied.

The allowance for a minimal overhead to be included in multi-segment message transmissions is provided through the use of the continuation-bit approach. while the slot release by destination stations. without increasing the stations latencies. is made possible by having stations keep track of the active message transmissions. This protocol requires few. but not major. changes to the slot format of the DQDB.

Mobility was adopted in two different ways; either using a network of mobile sensor nodes or deploying a few supplementary special mobile elements. usually referred to as mobile agents to help enhance connectivity and coverage. Different modes of operation (roles) were assigned to mobile agents including being a data relay. data collector. and data sink. In this paper we use a closed queueing network to model mobility and then evaluate data latency under all those roles.

A virtual backbone can play important roles related to routing and connectivity management. In this paper. the problem of providing such a virtual backbone with low overhead is investigated.

The strategy provides proactive protection to N link-disjoint full-duplex connections against single link failures. The implementation is efficient and uses a tree shaped minimum cost protection circuit. The protection circuit carries linear combinations of data units originally transmitted on the working circuits. and these linear combinations can be used to recover data units lost due to failures. This recovery is carried out with the assistance of one node on the protection tree. which is chosen to reduce the recovery time. This protection technique requires the same amount of protection resources used by 1:N protection. where the protection circuit is link disjoint from the protected connections.

Quality of Service (QoS) in Mobile Ad hoc networks (MANETs) as a research topic has started to receive attention from a growing number of researchers. Future MANETs are expected to support a wide range of real-time multimedia applications. The requirements for timely delivery of multimedia traffic raise new challenges for next generation MANETs. QoS routing is the first step towards achieving guaranteed end-toend QoS in MANETs. A QoS routing protocol selects network routes with sufficient resources for the satisfaction of the requested QoS parameters. Hence. the goal of QoS routing solutions is to satisfy the QoS requirements for each admitted connection. while achieving the global efficiency in resource utilization.

as the demand on the power grid increases. The demands are met by emergency/standby generation 
during short term peak loads or blackouts/failure. Smarter automated control responds within

The approach is aided by tools that allow graphical design. iterative redesign. and code generation for rapid deployment onto the target platform. The goal is to support current and future autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) programs to meet evolving requirements and capabilities.

To a certain extent this complexity can be reduced by applying existing modular control approaches to large-scale DES design. These solutions divide the system into different sections in such a way that its overall behavior is given by a suitable arrangement of the different sections. However. if the system is reconfigured frequently. the overall plant models and control specifications computed earlier would no longer be valid. Thus a new controlled system will have to be computed. We propose a new methodology. for ensuring that the new controlled plant will meet any valid control specifications taken from the existing modules.

In this context. conventional optoelectronic devices are replaced by novel photonic counterparts. both in transreceiver design as well as devices and systems. The major objective of this replacement is to reduce noise by means of lower scattering. where photons are only responsible for propagation of electromagnetic wave.

The meta-skin is composed of an array of liquid metallic split ring resonators (SRRs) embedded in a stretchable elastomer. When stretched. the meta-skin performs as a tunable frequency selective surface with a wide resonance frequency tuning range. When wrapped around a curved dielectric material. the meta-skin functions as a flexible “cloaking” surface to significantly suppress scattering from the surface of the dielectric material along different directions. We studied frequency responses of multilayer meta-skins to stretching in a planar direction and to changing the spacing between neighboring layers in vertical direction.

Our method provides a more homogeneous dielectric background allowing stronger diffraction coupling of MP resonances among SRRs leading to strong suppression of the radiative damping. We observe that compared to the on-substrate metamaterials. the embedded ones lead to a narrow-band hybridized MP mode. which results from the interference between MP resonances in individual SRRs and an in-plane propagating collective surface mode arising from light diffraction.

Each through-hole is covered by a circular drum-like graphene layer. namely a graphene “microdrum”.

At the hybridized magnetic resonances. we obtain both attractive and repulsive relative optical forces. which can be further exploited to control the separation between the two split ring resonators. Due to the strongest inductive coupling achieved for a twist angle of 180°. an attractive relative force as high as ~1200 piconewtons is realized at illumination intensities of 50 mW/µm^2. We show that a quasi-static dipole-dipole interaction model could predict well the characteristic and magnitude of the relative optical forces.

Safety was specified as an upper bound on the components of the state probability distribution. and the class of irreducible and aperiodic Markov chains was analyzed for satisfying such a safety property. Under the assumption of complete state observation. we identified (i) the set of all safety enforcing state-feedback controllers that impose the safety requirement for all safe initial distributions. and (ii) the maximal invariant set of safe distributions for a state-feedback controller. In this paper we extend the work reported in [A.

In this model. a system. such as a communication network. is composed of a finite number of users. and they compete for limited bandwidth resources. Each user adopts the decision that maximizes his or her own benefit characterized by the utility function. The decision space of each user is subject to constraints.

Given a set of constraint. an information state of a partially observed system is safe if it is in the set. A policy is safe if it makes a safe initial information state remain safe with probability 1 at each time step. The objective of safety control is to search for a safe policy and its corresponding set of safe initial information states. which is naturally a subset of the set of constraint. We first obtain a linear programming formulation to characterize the safe policy whose maximum set of safe initial information states is the entire set of constraint. Then we study the well-known machine maintenance problem under the safety control and give a numerical example to analyze the performance.

New tests of the random walk hypothesis are developed which permit a wide class of dependent and heterogeneous innovation sequences. A new limiting distribution theory is constructed based on the concept of continuous data recording. This theory. together with an asymptotic expansion that is developed in the paper for the unit root case. explain many of the interesting experimental results recently reported in Evans and Savin (1981. 1984).,True,TBvhBwgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3772,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1913237,10286185419428790385,/scholar?cites=10286185419428790385,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Phillips2/publication/4814947_Time_Series_Regression_with_a_Unit_Root/links/0912f5138e4ec335a5000000.pdf,0,0,0
1157107,Asymptotic properties of residual based tests for cointegration,1990,Peter CB Phillips and Sam Ouliaris,,Econometrica: journal of the Econometric Society,,165-193,Econometric Society,This paper develops an asymptotic theory for residual based tests for cointegration. These tests involve procedures that are designed to detect the presence of a unit root in the residuals of (cointegrating) regressions among the levels of economic time series. Attention is given to the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test that is recommended by Engle-Granger (1987) and the Zα and Zt unit root tests recently proposed by Phillips (1987). Two new tests are also introduced. one of which is invariant to the normalization of the cointegrating regression. All of these tests are shown to be asymptotically similar and simple representations of their limiting distributions are given in terms of standard Brownian motion. The ADF and Zt tests are asymptotically equivalent. Power properties of the tests are also studied. The analysis shows that all the tests are consistent if suitably constructed but that the ADF and Zt tests have slower …,True,TBvhBwgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,2373,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938339,16667774198535629066,/scholar?cites=16667774198535629066,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/385f/0f7917dbe55a7d1bb00e9e68c0843355fa5e.pdf,0,0,0
1157108,Understanding spurious regressions in econometrics,1986,Peter CB Phillips,33,Journal of econometrics,3,311-340,North-Holland,This paper provides an analytical study of linear regressions involving the levels of economic time series. An asymptotic theory is developed for regressions that relate quite general integrated random processes. This includes the spurious regressions of Granger and Newbold (1974) and the recent cointegrating regressions of Granger and Engle (1985). An asymptotic theory is developed for the regression coefficients and for conventional significance tests. It is shown that the usual t- and F-ratio test statistics do not possess limiting distributions in this context but actually diverge as the sample size T ↑ ∞. The limiting behavior of regression diagnostics such as the Durbin–Watson statistic. the coefficient of determination and the Box–Pierce statistic is also analyzed.

In particular. the cointegration revolution has had a substantial impact on applied analysis. As a consequence of the fast pace of development there are no textbooks that cover the full range of methods in current use and explain how to proceed in applied domains. This gap in the literature motivates the present volume. The methods are sketched out briefly to remind the reader of the ideas underlying them and to give sufficient background for empirical work. The treatment can also be used as a textbook for a course on applied time series econometrics. The coverage of topics follows recent methodological developments. Unit root and cointegration analysis play a central part. Other topics include structural vector autoregressions. conditional heteroskedasticity and nonlinear and nonparametric time series models. A crucial component in empirical work is the software that is available for analysis. New methodologyis typically only gradually incorporated into the existing softwarepackages.

It is shown that full system maximum likelihood brings the problem of inference within the family that is covered by the locally asymptotically mixed normal asymptotic theory provided that all unit roots in the system have been eliminated by specification and data transformation. This result has far reaching consequences. It means that cointegrating coefficient estimates are symmetrically distributed and median unbiased asymptotically. that an optimal asymptotic theory of inference applies. and that hypothesis tests may be conducted using standard asymptotic chi-squared tests.

Our asymptotic theory accommodates these possibilities and helps to unify earlier theory in which the unit root case appears as a singularity of the asymptotics.

Allowing for endogenously identified breaks in the cointegrating and error correction matrices. we find evidence for breaks after 1980:5. 1988:1. and 1999:9. There is a clear long-run relationship between these series for six OECD countries for 1971:1–1980.5 and 1988:2–1999.9. suggesting that stock market indices respond negatively to increases in the oil price in the long run. During 1980.6–1988.1. we find relationships that are not statistically significantly different from either zero or from the relationships of the previous period. The expected negative long-run relationship appears to disintegrate after 1999.9.

We model long-run sectoral electricity demand using a time-varying cointegrating vector. Specifically. the coefficient on income (residential sector) or output (commercial and industrial sectors) is allowed to follow a smooth semiparametric function of time. providing a flexible specification that allows more accurate out-of-sample forecasts than either fixed or discretely changing regression coefficients.

This effect is specified as a function of the density of temperatures observed at a high frequency with a functional coefficient. in contrast to conventional methods using a function of monthly heating and cooling degree days.

HadCRUT4 global mean temperatures slightly decreased over the 1998–2013 period. although a simple statistical model predicts that they should have grown by 0.016 ∘C/yr. in proportion to the increases in the concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs) and ozone. We employ a statistical approach to assess the contributions of model forcings and natural variability to the hiatus. Our point estimates suggest that none of the model forcings explain more than one-third of the missing heat. accounting for the upper bound of the confidence interval on the effect of tropospheric aerosols. which is the most prominent yet most uncertainly measured of the model forcings that could explain the missing heat. The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) explains up to about one-third of the missing heat. and two-thirds and possibly up to 81 % is explained by the unusually high temperature of 1998. Looking forward. the simple model also fails to explain the large increases since then (0.087 ∘C/yr from 2013 to 2016). This period coincides with another El Niño. but the ENSO fails to satisfactorily account for the increase. Instead. we propose a semiparametric cointegrating statistical model that augments an energy balance model with a novel multi-basin measure of the oceans' multidecadal temperature cycles.

Recent methodological advances using functional coefficients allow panel models to capture these features succinctly.

Common and intuitive solutions to these problems include interpolation and other types of imputation to a higher. regular frequency. However. interpolation is known to cause serious problems with the size and power of statistical tests. Due to the difficulty in dating paleoclimate data such as CO2 concentrations and surface temperatures. time series of such measurements are observed neither regularly nor contemporaneously. This article presents large‐ and small‐sample analyses of the size and power of cointegration tests of time series with these features and supports the robustness of cointegration of these two series found in the extant literature.

1157152,Dating Hiatuses: A Statistical Model of the Recent Slowdown in Global Warming–and the Next One,2018,J Isaac Miller and Kyungsik Nam,,Earth System Dynamics Discussions,,1-14,Copernicus GmbH, Much has been written about the so-called hiatus or pause in global warming. also known as the stasis period. the start of which is typically dated to 1998. HadCRUT4 global mean temperatures slightly decreased over 1998–2013. though a simple statistical model predicts that they should have grown by 0.016 °C/yr. in proportion to the increases in concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases and ozone. We employ a statistical approach to assess the contributions of model forcings and natural variability to the hiatus. We find that none of the model forcings explain more than a fifth of the missing heat and that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) explains at least half and possibly more than four fifths of the missing heat. Looking forward. the simple model also fails to explain the large increases since then (0.087 °C/year over 2013–2016). This period coincides with another El Niño. but the ENSO fails to satisfactorily account for the increase. We propose instead a semiparametric cointegrating statistical model that augments an energy balance model with a novel multibasin measure of the oceans' multidecadal temperatures cycles. The model partially explains the recent slowdown and explains nearly all of the subsequent warming. The natural cycle suggests the possibility of a much longer hiatus over roughly 2023–2061. with rather important policy implications.,True,Qrf5k68AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,1,https://esd.copernicus.org/preprints/esd-2018-81/,13481530214276201758,/scholar?cites=13481530214276201758,,https://esd.copernicus.org/preprints/esd-2018-81/esd-2018-81-manuscript-version6.pdf,0,0,0

The purpose of this note is not to propose an alternative classification. but to characterize the effect on the substitution term from a specified third good.

In the model. these effects are endogenously determined in a rational expectations equilibrium. For the effect of an interest rate shock. they have the opposite signs and the indirect risk premium effect can dominate the direct risk premium effect under reasonable parameters. This means that domestic short‐term bonds and foreign bonds are complements in the model even though domestic long‐term bonds and foreign bonds are substitutes. This model. focusing on the indirect risk premium effect and on the term structure of interest rates. can be combined with a small sample bias approach to explain stylized facts about the forward premium anomaly. which is found for short‐term interest rates. but not for long‐term interest rates.,True,KRUd3cYAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,28,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rode.12016,7383469600998314749,/scholar?cites=7383469600998314749,,http://www.kif.re.kr/kif/etc/files/hslim/RDE_2013_17(1).pdf,0,0,0

To test the implications of this model. this paper presents an experiment designed to elicit subject preferences on risk. time. intertemporal substitution. and uncertainty resolution. Results reveal that most subjects prefer early resolution of uncertainty and have relative risk aversion greater than the reciprocal of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. consistent with the predictions by recursive preferences.

By extending CAPM to incorporate the option-risk factor of stocks. we show that stockholders’ limited liability can explain Fama and French’s size and value effects. We use bonds’ excess credit spread as a proxy for stocks’ default risk to control for the changing non-diversifiable option-risk characteristic of stocks. Because sensitivity to the excess credit spread becomes smaller as size increases and as value decreases. excess credit spread explains the CAPM anomalies in a fashion similar to the Fama–French factors. While the excess credit spread is significant in explaining Fama and French’s size and value effects. adding the Fama–French factors does not improve the performance of our model.

To this end. we introduce a stochastic volatility model employing a latent nonstationary common volatility with two asymptotic regimes and smooth transition between them. We define the common volatility factor extracted from consumption and dividend growth rates as the macroeconomic uncertainty and analyze its effects on asset prices using a model with the Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences. The presence of smooth transition in our volatility model creates another layer of uncertainty in macroeconomic fluctuations. and thus provides an additional channel that generates a sizable risk premium for even a small amount of the consumption volatility. The channel can play an important role in determining asset prices. especially if the perceived macroeconomic uncertainty unravels slowly. Our estimates for the risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution are both around two. and the simulation results show that the model matches the first and the second moments of market return and the risk-free rate. hence the equity premium.,True,nchninUAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,22,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1360241,5061200674190990867,/scholar?cites=5061200674190990867,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5d80/b9d12d1bb5ed954995394ebfa6f9251f10c5.pdf,0,0,0

We calibrate a standard endowment model of multiple assets under recursive preferences. The momentum effect partly comes from investors' aversion to consumption risks. An unexpected dividend increase generates a positive return and increases the asset's proportion of consumption. raising the correlation between its future dividend growth and consumption growth. This is compensated by a higher expected return. generating the momentum effect. The cross-sectional difference in expected returns is also a key contributor. The quantified model produces sizable momentum profits. often close to the observed profits.,True,nchninUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,18,https://www.jstor.org/stable/43303871,9841626618358500954,/scholar?cites=9841626618358500954,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hwagyun_Kim/publication/256033356_Momentum_Effect_as_Part_of_a_Market_Equilibrium/links/56e1ddee08ae4e3e94281d58.pdf,0,0,0

Consistent with this. we find that a conditional default factor explains the cross-section returns of corporate bond portfolios sorted by past performance. Based on the evidence. we develop a model connecting bond momentum returns to the ability of bondholders to recover value when firms default. Specifically. we propose that firms with more (less) intangible capital and growth options are more (less) costly to liquidate and. therefore. they have lower (higher) recovery value. In this case. the bond momentum can exist. because the “recovery premium” becomes more important when firm default becomes highly probable. We provide strong empirical support to these predictions. Related. the US government bonds display no momentum. yet it emerges in sovereign bond returns.

In general. macro-finance models use low-frequency data to match with macroeconomic variables available only at low frequencies. To deal with this. we construct and estimate a tractable no-arbitrage affine model with both conventional latent factors and macro-factors by imposing cross-equation restrictions on the daily yields of bonds with different maturities. credit risks. and inflation indexation.

Money in our model facilitates transactions and is introduced through a transactions cost technology. This technology acts like a distortionary consumption tax which varies endogenously with the nominal interest rate. In this setup the resultant Phillips curve becomes a function of the nominal interest rate. Our analysis has important policy implications. First. we find. unlike Woodford (2003). accounting for realbalance effects does not result in the policy maker's loss function having an interest rate smoothing term. Second. we show that in the case of a temporary shock to productivity the optimal policy response under discretion is to allow for a trade-off between inflation and the output gap.

Specifically. we study the roles of asset market segmentation. sto& chastic risk aversion. and inflation targeting in a cash&in&advance model to generate stylized facts regarding interest rates and bond returns. Our model is consistent with both long&run and short&run monetary facts in that the quantity theory of money holds while there exist short&term deviations due to asset market frictions. We also let the relative risk aversion of bond market participants fluctuate depending on the uncertainties in the macroeconomic variables that determine consumption. inflation. and monetary policy. This allows us to investigate the nature of time&varying bond risk premia in reference to the macroeconomic variables. We derive an affi ne macroeconomic term structure of yields from the model. and then analyze how macroeconomic shocks affect the yield curve and expected holding period returns. Quantitative results show that our model can account for many of the observed behaviors of bond prices. in& cluding the liquidity effect. expectations puzzle. and upward sloping average yield curve.

We show that bond returns react significantly positive (negative) following upgrade (downgrade) Watchlist events but not necessarily following rating change events. Because Watchlist news precede rating changes. this suggests that the Watchlist contains less contaminated information. leading to the stronger short-run price effects. Additionally. we find that subordinated bond prices react more than secured bonds to Watchlist news. However. this finding does not hold when we compare investment and non-investment grade bonds. Cross-sectional regression results confirm this after controlling for issue-and issuer-specific characteristics.

1157205,A Consumption-Based Identification of Global Economic Uncertainty,2020,Hwagyun Kim and Eunhee Lee and Joon Y Park,,Available at SSRN 3678136,,,,One of the trends in financial markets over the last decade is significant increases in the amount and depth of interactions among market participants from different countries. Financial innovations. advances in information technology and regulations are responsible for this phenomenon. Integration of financial markets implies that investors’ discount factors can depend on both global shocks as well as country-specific shocks. and the market prices of financial assets can reflect risk and uncertainty associated with common and idiosyncratic fluctuations of key macroeconomic variables such as consumption and earnings of international economies. To properly identify factors that generate uncertainty. it is therefore desirable to consider market participants’ preferences regarding risk and uncertainty in conjunction with statistical models that capture both risk and uncertainty. In this light. we estimate an international asset pricing model in a long-run risk framework by Bansal and Yaron (2004) and Hansen et al.(2008) to incorporate a global economic uncertainty factor as well as country-specific uncertainty factors. The global uncertainty factor captures the time-varying fluctuations of common stochastic volatilities of both consumption and dividend growths from different countries. and it is identified as a latent factor that evolves over time between two asymptotic regimes of the macroeconomic volatilities with smooth transitions. Kim et al.(2010) and Kim and Park (2018) propose as a stochastic volatility model. a sinusoidal function such as a logistic function for smooth transition. The main rationale for this suggestion is that these nonlinear transitions in …,True,nchninUAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,0,https://apps.olin.wustl.edu/conf/SBIES/files/pdf/2020/100.pdf,,,,https://apps.olin.wustl.edu/conf/SBIES/files/pdf/2020/100.pdf,0,0,0

1157219,A nonparametric measure of convergence towards purchasing power parity,2006,Mototsugu Shintani,21,Journal of Applied Econometrics,5,589-604,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,It has been claimed that the deviations from purchasing power parity are highly persistent and have quite long half‐lives under the assumption of a linear adjustment of real exchange rates. However. inspired by trade cost models. nonlinear adjustment has been widely employed in recent empirical studies. This paper proposes a simple nonparametric procedure for evaluating the speed of adjustment in the presence of nonlinearity. using the largest Lyapunov exponent of the time series. The empirical result suggests that the speed of convergence to a long‐run price level is indeed faster than what was found in previous studies with linear restrictions.

The results from the Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the unit root tests based on an inconsistent estimator have less size distortion and more stability of size across different autocorrelation specifications as compared to the tests based on a consistent estimator.

The finite-sample power. in addition to the local asymptotic power. of the tests with an inconsistent estimator is shown to be much lower than that of conventional tests.

The proposed tests are generalizations of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Cramer–von Mises tests to the regression framework. They are consistent against all alternatives to the null hypothesis. powerful against 1/n local alternatives. not dependent on any smoothing parameters and simple to compute. A wild-bootstrap procedure is suggested to obtain critical values for the tests and is justified asymptotically.

Our framework includes many nonparametric testing problems in a unified framework. with a number of possible applications in auction models. game theoretic models. wage inequality. and revealed preferences. Our test involves a one-sided version of Lp functionals of kernel-type estimators (1 ≤ p < ∞) and is easy to implement in general. mainly due to its recourse to the bootstrap method. The bootstrap procedure is based on the nonparametric bootstrap applied to kernel-based test statistics. with an option of estimating “contact sets.” We provide regularity conditions under which the bootstrap test is asymptotically valid uniformly over a large class of distributions. including cases where the limiting distribution of the test statistic is degenerate.

We consider a wide spectrum of null and alternative hypotheses regarding conditional treatment effects. including (i) the null hypothesis of the conditional stochastic dominance between treatment and control groups;(ii) the null hypothesis that the conditional average treatment effect is positive for each value of covariates; and (iii) the null hypothesis of no distributional (or average) treatment effect conditional on covariates against a one-sided (or two-sided) alternative hypothesis. The test statistics are based on L_ {1}-type functionals of uniformly consistent nonparametric kernel estimators of conditional expectations that characterize the null hypotheses. Using the Poissionization technique of Gine et al.(2003). we show that suitably studentized versions of our test statistics are asymptotically standard normal under the null hypotheses and also show that the proposed nonparametric tests are consistent against general fixed alternatives. Furthermore. it turns out that our tests have non-negligible powers against some local alternatives that are n^{-1/2} different from the null hypotheses. where n is the sample size. We provide a more powerful test for the case when the null hypothesis may be binding only on a strict subset of the support and also consider an extension to testing for quantile treatment effects.

Although production exhibits constant returns to scale. endogenous growth can occur. In a laissez-faire equilibrium. firms generate rents that are the value of the pollution they create. These rents crowd out investment and slow economic growth. Such an equilibrium may not support Pareto optimal allocations. but a Pigouvian tax does. Hence. a pollution tax can yield a double dividend because it reduces pollution and increases growth.,True,c-VLlwsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,48,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09638199800000004,9473773306794936291,/scholar?cites=9473773306794936291,,http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&context=econ_fac,0,0,0

The growth rate of the world economy depends upon countries' savings propensities and common technology. Trade can reverse an economy's autarkic growth trajectory. and a country with a high savings rate runs a current account surplus. If a surplus country expands aggregate demand while a deficit country contracts analogously. world growth increases.

The subsidies a farmer receives are based upon historical plantings. also called base acreage. It is sometimes optimal for a farmer temporarily not to participate in a program in order to increase future subsidies. The farmer's optimal policy is the solution to a deterministic dynamic program. Farmers with low base acreage opt out of these programs. whereas those with high base acreage participate in them. The article examines aggregate data involving corn. cotton. rice. and wheat during 1987. It shows that these programs increase the output of each of these crops and represent an annual deadweight loss of more than $2 billion.,True,c-VLlwsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,29,https://www.jstor.org/stable/40986788,8110188363248727268,/scholar?cites=8110188363248727268,,http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=econ_fac,0,0,0

There is no bequest motive. nor are there any externalities. If the technology is convex. per capita growth can occur only if the economy has at least two sectors. This paper shows that the limiting marginal efficiency of investment determines the potential for growth and that the rate of growth depends upon the share of the capital stock devoted to investment.

In the long run. the foreign exchange forward premium reflects expected differences in inflation. but in the short run. it depends upon the diversity of prior beliefs. If some people have diffuse priors about a country's inflation process. then its currency commands a forward premium that is eventually dissipated. Using data on the dollar–mark premium from the 1980s. it shows that this kind of diversity really matters.

Dollarization is modeled as a fixed real exchange rate and also as a potentially increased inflow of capital from abroad. The effects of dollarization depend upon whether adopting a fixed exchange rate reduces the rate of return on emigration and helps to attract foreign capital. The paper investigates how Mexican emigration to the United States responds to changes in bilateral economic conditions. The evidence indicates that the flow of illegal immigrants from Mexico into the United States is sensitive to economic conditions and is more volatile when the Mexican monetary authorities have fixed the exchange rate in the past. In contrast. the legal immigrant flow is not sensitive to changes in relative economic conditions.,True,c-VLlwsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,14,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673920,12645840550872789273,/scholar?cites=12645840550872789273,,https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&context=econ_fac,0,0,0

1157291,Stochastic frontiers with bounded inefficiency,2009,P Alminidis and J Qian and R Sickles,,,,,Mimeo. rice university,The parametric approach to estimate stochastic production frontiers was introduced by Aigner. Lovell. and Schmidt (1977). Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977). and Battese and Corra (1977). These approaches specified a parametric production func (tion and a two (component error term. One component. reflecting the influence of many unaccountable factors on production as well as measurement error. is consid (ered pnoiseqand is usually assumed to be normally distributed. The other component describes ineffi ciency and is assumed to have a one (sided distribution. of which the conventional candidates include the half normal (Aigner. et al.. 1977). truncated nor (mal (Stevenson. 1980). exponential (Meeusen and van den Broeck. 1977) and gamma (Greene 1980a. b.

This stochastic frontier production function has become an iconic modeling paradigm in econometric research. rate making decisions in regulated industries across the world. in evaluating outcomes of market reforms in transition economies. and in establishing performance benchmarks for local. state. and federal governmental activities.In this paper we propose a new class of parametric stochastic frontier models with a more flexible specification of the ineffi ciency term. which we view as improvement on the basic iconic stochastic frontier production model. Instead of allowing unbounded support for the distribution of productive (cost) ineffi ciency term in the right (left) tail. we introduce an unobservable upper bound to ineffi ciencies or a lower bound to the effi ciencies. which we call the ineffi ciency bound.

For this purpose. we propose a predictive regression model that incorporates three factors of influence on the central parity rate: a smoothing factor. a market factor. and a basket factor. We first apply the model to analyze the effects of twelve exchange rate reforms since 2005. treating these reforms as pre-determined structural breaks. Among other results. we find that the main impact of introducing “counter-cyclical factor” is to weaken the role of the basket factor. Furthermore. we econometrically estimate structural breaks in data. assuming that the number and dates of breaks are unknown. We find that the majority of estimated breaks occur within the neighborhood of exchange rate reforms and that the “8.11” reform of 2015 is arguably the most important structural change after 2005 in the econometric sense.,True,9wCrKekAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC,0,http://jhqian.org/research/SuQian2020.pdf,,,,http://jhqian.org/research/SuQian2020.pdf,0,0,0

1157314,Functional-coefficient models for nonstationary time series data,2009,Zongwu Cai and Qi Li and Joon Y Park,148,Journal of Econometrics,2,101-113,North-Holland,This paper studies functional coefficient regression models with nonstationary time series data. allowing also for stationary covariates. A local linear fitting scheme is developed to estimate the coefficient functions. The asymptotic distributions of the estimators are obtained. showing different convergence rates for the stationary and nonstationary covariates. A two-stage approach is proposed to achieve estimation optimality in the sense of minimizing the asymptotic mean squared error. When the coefficient function is a function of a nonstationary variable. the new findings are that the asymptotic bias of its nonparametric estimator is the same as the stationary covariate case but convergence rate differs. and further. the asymptotic distribution is a mixed normal. associated with the local time of a standard Brownian motion. The asymptotic behavior at boundaries is also investigated.,True,oHPEDJYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,159,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030440760800167X,8769032949606696653,/scholar?cites=8769032949606696653,,https://wise.xmu.edu.cn/uploadfiles/paper-masterdownload/2009213820267055475115776.pdf,0,0,0

Conditional value-at-risk is estimated by inverting the weighted double kernel local linear estimate of the conditional distribution function. The nonparametric estimator of conditional expected shortfall is constructed by a plugging-in method. Both the asymptotic normality and consistency of the proposed nonparametric estimators are established at both boundary and interior points for time series data.

This leads to a simple one-step estimation procedure. We show that such a one-step method cannot be optimal when some coefficient functions possess different degrees of smoothness.

CEOs have different talents and are matched to firms in a competitive assignment model. In market equilibrium. a CEO's pay depends on both the size of his firm and the aggregate firm size. The model determines the level of CEO pay across firms and over time. offering a benchmark for calibratable corporate finance. We find a very small dispersion in CEO talent. which nonetheless justifies large pay differences. In recent decades at least. the size of large firms explains many of the patterns in CEO pay. across firms. over time. and between countries. In particular. in the baseline specification of the model's parameters. the sixfold increase of U.S. CEO pay between 1980 and 2003 can be fully attributed to the sixfold increase in market capitalization of large companies during that period.,True,ZKRWBZsAAAAJ:AvfA0Oy_GE0C,2264,https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/123/1/49/1889842,17001260708352831451,/scholar?cites=17001260708352831451,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12365/w12365.pdf,0,0,0

However. market microstructure poses challenges to this estimation approach. as evidenced by recent empirical studies in finance. The present work attempts to lay out theoretical grounds that reconcile continuous-time modeling and discrete-time samples. We propose an estimation approach that takes advantage of the rich sources in tick-by-tick data while preserving the continuous-time assumption on the underlying returns.

We test parametric models by comparing their implied parametric density to the same density estimated nonparametrically. We do not replace the continuous-time model by discrete approximations. even though the data are recorded at discrete intervals. The principal source of rejection of existing models is the strong non-linearity of the drift. Around its mean. where the drift is essentially zero. the spot rate behaves like a random walk. The drift then mean-reverts strongly when far away from the mean.

The estimates provide evidence of self-excitation both in the US and the other world markets. and of asymmetric cross-excitation. with the US market typically having more influence on the jump intensity of other markets than the reverse.

Among our more provocative findings is that growth slowdowns are more likely in countries that maintain undervalued real exchange rates.,True,nk6XKucAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,812,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ASEP_a_00118,4197389720994299014,/scholar?cites=4197389720994299014,,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/ASEP_a_00118,0,0,0
1157360,Growth slowdowns redux: New evidence on the middle-income trap,2013,Barry Eichengreen and Donghyun Park and Kwanho Shin,,,w18673,,National Bureau of Economic Research,We analyze the incidence and correlates of growth slowdowns in fast-growing middle-income countries. extending the analysis of an earlier paper (Eichengreen. Park and Shin 2012). We continue to find dispersion in the per capita income at which slowdowns occur. But in contrast to our earlier analysis which pointed to the existence of a single mode at which slowdowns occur in the neighborhood of $15.000-$16.000 2005 purchasing power parity dollars. new data point to two modes. one in the $10.000-$11.000 range and another at $15.000-$16. 0000. A number of countries appear to have experienced two slowdowns. consistent with the existence of multiple modes. We conclude that high growth in middle-income countries may decelerate in steps rather than at a single point in time. This implies that a larger group of countries is at risk of a growth slowdown and that middle-income countries may find themselves slowing down at lower income levels than implied by our earlier estimates. We also find that slowdowns are less likely in countries where the population has a relatively high level of secondary and tertiary education and where high-technology products account for a relatively large share of exports. consistent with our earlier emphasis of the importance of moving up the technology ladder in order to avoid the middle-income trap.,True,nk6XKucAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC,588,https://www.nber.org/papers/w18673,9144129607988613020,/scholar?cites=9144129607988613020,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w18673/w18673.pdf,0,0,0

Theoretically. however. increased trade could lead to either closer or looser business cycles across trading partners. This paper seeks to understand how the business cycles of 12 Asian economies have been influenced by increased trade among them. It finds that the increasing trade itself is not necessarily associated with an increased synchronization of their business cycles.

A simple econometric model is presented and applied to within-US and cross-country data in order to provide a framework for interpreting the literature. Using these estimates as a benchmark. data issues. alternative models. and still other approaches to quantifying sources of comovement are surveyed. Overall. the evidence suggests three general conclusions. First. common shocks are less important in international fluctuations than in within-country fluctuations. Second. region-specific shocks account for a larger share of variation in international data than in within-country data. Finally. industry-specific shocks. measured accurately. are a smaller source of variation internationally than within countries. The paper then argues that lowering economic borders among nations through pacts like EMU should make the sources of international fluctuations look somewhat more like the sources of within-country fluctuations. although the effects are uncertain.,True,nk6XKucAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,138,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=140283,2175044226042133231,/scholar?cites=2175044226042133231,,https://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/reswkpap/PDF/rwp98-04.pdf,0,0,0

We find. based on a dynamic factor model. regional common shocks have been quantitatively important for output variations in the Asian economies. We expect that continuing trade integration in the region will lead to further synchronization of business cycles. thereby encouraging East Asian countries to create a currency union in the region.

1157370,Regional and global financial integration in East Asia,2008,Soyoung Kim and Jong-Wha Lee and Kwanho Shin,,"China, Asia and the new world economy",,168-200,Oxford University Press,In East Asia. there has been a rapid increase in international capital mobility. as East Asian countries have been deregulating their financial markets since the early 1990s. This continuous financial opening process has enabled the economies of the region to become integrated into global financial markets. The available empirical evidence suggests that the East Asian financial markets have become increasingly integrated with the markets of developed countries over the last decades.(Bekaert and Harvey 1995. World Bank 1997; and Eichengreen and Park 2005a).However. it is not clear that the global financial liberalization and integration process has contributed to the integration of financial markets within the region. In general. trade liberalization tends to bring about trade integration on both global and regional levels. though possibly more on the regional level. In a similar vein. we might expect that capital market liberalization will also make these economies more closely linked with one another through crossborder financial transactions. On the contrary. several studies have claimed that the degree of financial market linkage in East Asia still remains low and that. unlike trade integration. the integration of financial markets in this region has been occurring more on a global level rather than on a regional level.,True,nk6XKucAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,115,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9006519266818040058&hl=en&oi=scholarr,9006519266818040058,/scholar?cites=9006519266818040058,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/695/1/MPRA_paper_695.pdf,0,0,0

Does this shift suggest that global trade and welfare levels will be raised? In contrast to unilateral trade liberalization. RTAs may well cause both ‘trade creation’ and ‘trade diversion.’ so that their net effect on global trade and welfare becomes ambiguous. It is conjectured that RTAs among “natural trading partners” are more likely to be trade-creating. and less likely to divert trade from non-member countries. in which case welfare will improve. We find that if an RTA involves geographically proximate countries (measured either by distance or border). trade significantly increases among them.

The central objective of this paper is to empirically analyze the prospects for the service sector as a future engine of growth. Our analysis of 12 Asian economies indicates that the service sector already contributed substantially to the region’s growth in the past. Furthermore. somewhat surprisingly in light of the difficulty of achieving productivity gains in services. we also find that services labor productivity grew at a healthy pace in much of the region. Overall our analysis provides substantial cause for optimism about the role of the service sector as an engine of growth in Asia.

We find evidence that trade integration enhances co‐movements of output but not of consumption across countries. Especially the fact that trade integration does not raise co‐movements of consumption as much as that of output is interpreted as trade integration does not improve the extent of risk sharing. Co‐movements of price arise most significantly as trade integration deepens. lowering the border effects and allowing better opportunities for resource reallocation across countries.

Our empirical analysis. based on an extended gravity model utilising a large panel dataset of 175 countries from 1948 to 1999. shows that RTAs on average increase global trade by raising intra‐bloc trade without damaging extra‐bloc trade. The net trade effects. however. heavily depend on the types of RTA strategic evolution over time. which we categorise as ‘expansionary’ RTAs. ‘duplicate’ RTAs or ‘overlapping’ RTAs. We find that countries excluded from an RTA can benefit more from duplicating a separate RTA than from joining an existing RTA.

One is the combination of perfect competition. a constant-returns-toscale (CRS) technology. and a symmetric adjustment cost of investment. This combination implies that the marginal value of capital is a convex function of the stochastic variable which characterizes uncertainty. Jensen’s inequality then implies that an increase in uncertainty increases the value of investment and. hence. investment expenditure. This is the familiar positive effect of uncertainty on investment [Richard Hartman (1972) and Andrew B. Abel (1983. 1985)].The other focus starts with the notion of irreversibility which has attracted much attention recently as a way of characterizing investment dynamics more realistically. 1 Giuseppe Bertola (1988) and Robert S.

In their studies the source of income risk is idiosyncratic. and agents can share risk across the entire economy. Using a sample of households from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics (PSID). we explore whether households share the risk associated with their industries and regions across households in other regions and industries.

1157383,Sowing consumers in the garden of mass retailing in Chile,2014,José Ossandón,17,Consumption Markets & Culture,5,429-447,Routledge,It is known that some key elements of modern consumer credit were originally developed in department stores. However. almost no attention has been given to new developments in this area. This paper studies the case of retail credit in Chile. Special attention is given to a particular technique known as “to sow” (or issuing small loans to risky consumers that are made to grow by carefully following and classifying purchase and debt behaviour). whose success has been enabled by the development of a wide quantitative datascape. Following the practice of “sowing” helps to understand not only how consumer credit is mediated by market devices. but how it practically works as a device of marketing on its own.,True,nk6XKucAAAAJ:uJ-U7cs_P_0C,53,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10253866.2013.849591,11780121552524018997,/scholar?cites=11780121552524018997,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32041222/Sowing_consumers_in_the_garden_of_mass_retailing_in_Chile_forthcoming_2_July.pdf,0,0,0
1157384,Impact of population aging on Asia’s future growth,2012,Donghyun Park and Kwanho Shin,,,,,Edward Elgar Publishing,Logically. demographic structure–the age structure of a country’s population–should affect that country’s economic performance. A country with a youthful population will be more productive than a country with an older one as it will have a larger labor force relative to population size. More workers produce more goods and services. so younger countries tend to grow faster economically than older countries. A general loss of economic dynamism explains why advanced economies with maturing populations are concerned about population aging and also helps to explain why such economies have become more open to immigration in recent years. The ongoing shift of global economic power from advanced economies to developing economies to some extent reflects the demographic differences between the two. Due to a wide range of economic and social factors. developing Asia has begun to follow in the …,True,nk6XKucAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,46,https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781781952306/9781781952306.00009.xml,2757880063722904536,/scholar?cites=2757880063722904536,,https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/30455/economics-wp281.pdf,0,0,0

Cambridge University Press, Chapt",,311-333,,There have been several approaches to testing for a unit root in panel data. These include Quah (1994); Levin and Lin (1992); 1 Im. Pesaran. and Shin (2003); and Choi (2001). All of these tests assume cross-sectional independence. although Im et al.(1995) consider a simple form of cross-sectional correlation using time-specific effects. It may be more appropriate. however. to assume cross-sectional correlation for some cross-country data sets because comovements of economies are often observed (eg. Backus and Kehoe 1992) and cross-sectional correlation may affect the finite-sample properties of panel unit root tests as studied in O'Connell (1998). In response to the need for panel unit root tests allowing cross-sectional correlation. researchers have devised various methods. Maddala and Wu (1999) bootstrap the critical values of Levin and Lin's (1992). Im et al.'s (2003). and Fisher's (1932) tests. Taylor and Sarno (1998) study the multivariate augmented Dickey-Fuller test. O'Connell (1998) considers a generalized least squares (GLS)-based unit root test for homogeneous panels.

The regressors and errors are assumed to be dependent both serially and contemporaneously. Using the triangular array asymptotics. the nonlinear least squares estimator is shown to be consistent. and its asymptotic distribution is derived. It is found that the asymptotic distribution involves a bias under the regressor-error dependence. which implies that the nonlinear least squares estimator is inefficient and unsuitable for use in hypothesis testing. Thus. this paper proposes a Gauss-Newton type estimator that uses the nonlinear least squares estimator as an initial estimator and is based on regressions augmented by leads and lags. Using leads and lags enables the Gauss-Newton estimator to eliminate the bias and have a mixture normal distribution in the limit. which makes it more efficient than the nonlinear …,True,q44EBDMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,143,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3533382,16226676908162268185,/scholar?cites=16226676908162268185,,,0,0,0
1157389,Nonstationary panels,2006,In Choi,1,Econometric theory,,511-539,,Recent years have seen growing interest in nonstationary panels. The initial main motivation for using panel data was to increase the power of unit root tests. Levin and Linjs (1992) 1 tests and subsequent panel unit root tests confirm the power ad# vantage of using panel data. Levin and Linjs and other tests have been applied on a large scale for different purposes (see the list below) and numerous theories for nonstationary panels have also been developed. These developments resemble those of nonstationary time series in the eighties and nineties when empirical applications and econometric theory had grown hand in hand. satisfying each otherjs needs and posing new problems for each other. Indeed. one who has observed the evolution of the econometric theory of nonstationary time series in those days may realize that the research paradigm of nonstationary panels is similar to that of nonstationary time series during that time. though nonstationary panels have some unique issues such as cross# sectional correlation and ways to handle two indices going to infinity. As with nonstationary time series. interest in the panel unit root test has extended to the panel cointegration test. panel cointegrating regression. panel VAR. and optimal unit root testing as will be discussed later.The purpose of this paper is to survey major developments in the econometrics of nonstationary panels since early nineties. complementing earlier surveys by Baltagi and Kao (2000).

These tests extend previous similar tests by considering I(1) regressors instead of stationary or mixing regressors and they also allow for more general transition mechanisms than in previous studies. As is typical in cointegrating regressions. the regressors and errors of the model can be serially and contemporaneously correlated. In order to allow for this feature. an endogeneity correction based on a leads‐and‐lags approach is employed. The proposed tests are very simple to use because ordinary least squares techniques and standard chi‐square limiting distributions apply.

This work extends previous results in Phillips (1989) where the coefficient vector of the exogenous variables is partially identified and that of the endogenous variables is totally unidentified.

The test statistics we use in this paper are Kwiatkowski. Phillips. Schmidt. and Shin's (1992; KPSS hereafter) tests for the null of stationarity. though using other kinds of tests is also possible.

Korea. Malaysia and Thailand during the period bordering the 1997 Asian currency crisis to investigate the appropriateness of tight monetary policy in stabilizing exchange rates. We employ VAR models consisting of spot rates. forward rates and interest rate differentials to study the causal relations. In particular. we test for long-run causality as well as short-run causality by taking into account non-stationarity of the involved variables and the cointegrating relations among them. The test results show that except for some subsamples for Malaysia there is no evidence that interest rate differentials caused spot exchange rates at all horizons. Considering the ineffectiveness of high interest rates in stabilizing exchange rates and the high economic cost associated with keeping high interest rates for an extended time period …,True,q44EBDMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0922142507000114,6804589368213812089,/scholar?cites=6804589368213812089,,,0,0,0

Mallows’(1973) C p criterion. Akaike’s (1973) AIC. Hurvich and Tsai’s (1989) corrected AIC and the BIC of Akaike (1978) and Schwarz (1978) are derived for the leads-and-lags cointegrating regression. Deriving model selection criteria for the leads-and-lags regression is a nontrivial task since the true model is of infinite dimension. This paper justifies using the conventional formulas of those model selection criteria for the leads-and-lags cointegrating regression. The numbers of leads and lags can be selected in scientific ways using the model selection criteria. Simulation results regarding the bias and mean squared error of the long-run coefficient estimates are reported.

The decision-based significance levels for popular unit root tests. chosen using the line of enlightened judgement under a symmetric loss function. are found to be much higher than conventional ones. We also propose simple calibration rules for the decision-based significance levels for a range of unit root tests. At the decision-based significance levels. many time series in Nelson and Plosser’s (1982)(extended) data set are judged to be trend-stationary. including real income variables. employment variables and money stock. We also find that nearly all real exchange rates covered in Elliott and Pesavento’s (2006) study are stationary; and that most of the real interest rates covered in Rapach and Weber’s (2004) study are stationary. In addition. using a specific loss function. the US nominal interest rate is found to be stationary under economically sensible values of relative loss and prior belief for the null hypothesis.

1157425,Improved stochastic progressive photon mapping with metropolis sampling,2011,Jiating Chen and Bin Wang and Jun‐Hai Yong,30,Computer Graphics Forum,4,1205-1213,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,This paper presents an improvement to the stochastic progressive photon mapping (SPPM). a method for robustly simulating complex global illumination with distributed ray tracing effects. Normally. similar to photon mapping and other particle tracing algorithms. SPPM would become inefficient when the photons are poorly distributed. An inordinate amount of photons are required to reduce the error caused by noise and bias to acceptable levels. In order to optimize the distribution of photons. we propose an extension of SPPM with a Metropolis‐Hastings algorithm. effectively exploiting local coherence among the light paths that contribute to the rendered image. A well‐designed scalar contribution function is introduced as our Metropolis sampling strategy. targeting at specific parts of image areas with large error to improve the efficiency of the radiance estimator.

One of the most difficult aspects of particle systems has been detecting collisions between particles and mesh surface. Due to the huge computation. a variety of proxy-based approaches have been proposed recently to perform visually correct simulation. However. all either limit the complexity of the scene. fail to guarantee non-penetration. or are too slow for real-time use with many particles. In this paper. we propose a new octree-based proxy for colliding particles with meshes on the GPU. Our approach works by subdividing the scene mesh with an octree in which each leaf node associates with a representative normal corresponding to the normals of the triangles that intersect the node. We present a view-visible method. which is suitable for both closed and non-closed models. to label the empty leaf …,True,o7AFnlUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,18,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11432-012-4616-5.pdf,8493889275771918805,/scholar?cites=8493889275771918805,,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00920666/document,0,0,0
1157427,Where to Prune: Using LSTM to Guide End-to-end Pruning.,2018,Jing Zhong and Guiguang Ding and Yuchen Guo and Jungong Han and Bin Wang,,,,3205-3211,,Recent years have witnessed the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in many related fields. However. its huge model size and computation complexity bring in difficulty when deploying CNNs in some scenarios. like embedded system with low computation power. To address this issue. many works have been proposed to prune filters in CNNs to reduce computation. However. they mainly focus on seeking which filters are unimportant in a layer and then prune filters layer by layer or globally. In this paper. we argue that the pruning order is also very significant for model pruning. We propose a novel approach to figure out which layers should be pruned in each step. First. we utilize a long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn the hierarchical characteristics of a network and generate a pruning decision for each layer. which is the main difference from previous works. Next. a channel-based method is adopted to evaluate the importance of filters in a to-be-pruned layer. followed by an accelerated recovery step. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is capable of reducing 70.1% FLOPs for VGG and 47.5% for Resnet-56 with comparable accuracy. Also. the learning results seem to reveal the sensitivity of each network layer.,True,o7AFnlUAAAAJ:AxCNl3k5ohkC,17,http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/MIG/2018-10.pdf,13456311393519262710,/scholar?cites=13456311393519262710,,http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/MIG/2018-10.pdf,0,0,0

Unfortunately. this effect is also extremely costly. It can take hundreds to thousands of samples to achieve noise‐free results using Monte Carlo integration. This paper introduces an efficient adaptive depth‐of‐field rendering algorithm that achieves noise‐free results using significantly fewer samples. Our algorithm consists of two main phases: adaptive sampling and image reconstruction. In the adaptive sampling phase. the adaptive sample density is determined by a ‘blur‐size’ map and ‘pixel‐variance’ map computed in the initialization. In the image reconstruction phase. based on the blur‐size map. we use a novel multiscale reconstruction filter to dramatically reduce the noise in the defocused areas where the sampled radiance has high variance. Because of the efficiency of this new filter. only a few samples are …,True,o7AFnlUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,16,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01854.x,2825013360056854627,/scholar?cites=2825013360056854627,,,0,0,0

Current works on FCN has brought great advances in the task of semantic segmentation. but the receptive field. which represents region areas of input volume connected to any output neuron. limits the available information of output neuron's prediction accuracy. We investigate how to involve the full-scale or full-image features into FCNs to enrich the receptive field. Specially. the full-scale feature network (FFN) extends the full-connected network and makes an end-to-end unified training structure. It has two appealing properties. First. the introduction of full-scale-features is beneficial for prediction. We build a unified extracting network and explore several fusion functions for concatenating features. Amounts of experiments have been carried out to prove that full-scale-features makes fair accuracy raising. Second. FFN is applicable to many variants of FCN which could be regarded as a general strategy to improve the segmentation accuracy.

1157434,Implicit Non-linear Similarity Scoring for Recognizing Unseen Classes.,2018,Yuchen Guo and Guiguang Ding and Jungong Han and Sicheng Zhao and Bin Wang,,,,4898-4904,,Recognizing unseen classes is an important task for real-world applications. due to: 1) it is common that some classes in reality have no labeled image exemplar for training; and 2) novel classes emerge rapidly. Recently. to address this task many zeroshot learning (ZSL) approaches have been proposed where explicit linear scores. like inner product score. are employed to measure the similarity between a class and an image. We argue that explicit linear scoring (ELS) seems too weak to capture complicated image-class correspondence. We propose a simple yet effective framework. called Implicit Non-linear Similarity Scoring (ICINESS). In particular. we train a scoring network which uses image and class features as input. fuses them by hidden layers. and outputs the similarity. Based on the universal approximation theorem. it can approximate the true similarity function between images and classes if a proper structure is used in an implicit non-linear way. which is more flexible and powerful.

Polarized Raman experiments show that the highest scattering intensity is obtained when both the incident and analyzed light polarizations are perpendicular to the nanowire axis. InAs wurtzite optical modes are observed. The obtained wurtzite modes are consistent with the selection rules and also with the results of calculations using an extended rigid-ion model. Additional resonant Raman scattering experiments reveal a redshifted E 1 transition for InAs nanowires compared to the bulk zinc-blende InAs transition due to the dominance of the wurtzite phase in the nanowires.

The nanowires exhibit two main optical emission bands at low temperatures. They are attributed to the recombination of carriers in quantum well structures. formed by zincblende–wurtzite alternating layers. and to the donor–acceptor pair. The blue-shift observed in the former emission band when the excitation power is increased is in good agreement with the type-II band alignment between the wurtzite and zincblende sections predicted by previous theoretical works. When increasing the temperature and the excitation power successively. an additional band attributed to the band-to-band recombination from wurtzite InAs appears.

We adopt a simple and effective approach for analyzing electromagnetic cloaks - instead of the originally proposed singular mapping. nonsingular mappings asymptotically approaching the ideal one are considered. Scattering and radiation from this type of imperfect cylindrical cloaks is solved analytically and the results are confirmed by full-wave finite element simulations. Our analysis sheds more light on the influence of this kind of imperfection on the cloaking performance and further explores the physics of cloaking devices.,True,6dnXK_UAAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,49,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-16-3-1413,1987935336046628006,/scholar?cites=1987935336046628006,,https://www.osapublishing.org/viewmedia.cfm?seq=0&uri=oe-16-3-1413,0,0,0

POLAND,The interest in ZnSe low-dimensional structures is caused by the possibility of creation of effective light--emitting devices with spontaneous or coherent radiation in the green-blue part of the visible spectrum [1–3] or white light emission [4]. Besides. thin nanostructured semiconductor films. in particular II–VI ones. are promising materials for gas sensor applications ([5] and references therein). since in such layers the sensing surface is significantly larger than the geometric one. An in-depth understanding of the phonon propagation is of great technological importance for possible applications. not only in designing semiconductor light emitting and other optoelectronic devices but also in fast electronic devices. In this study Raman scattering investigations are carried out on a series of ZnSe single layers and two kinds of periodic SiOx/ZnSe multilayers (MLs) deposited at room substrate temperature by thermal evaporation of ZnSe powder and glassy SiO in vacuum. It is shown that as-deposited single layers contain two phases. amorphous and crystalline.

Even though the Marcellus Shale lies 1-4 kilometers underground. its development has raised concerns for contaminating the overlying surficial aquifers used as drinking water sources. This potential contamination may occur from either hydraulic fracturing fluids containing toxic chemicals or highly saline (TDS> 100.000 mg/L) formation water that contains high naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM).Recent findings of Duke University researchers have shown that in northeastern Pennsylvania shallow drinking water wells near natural gas wells can be contaminated with methane that has a deep thermogenic geochemical and isotopic signatures. However. that study did not show chemical contamination and increased concentrations of major dissolved constituents or NORM. To develop diagnostic tools for delineating possible contamination of fracing fluids and produced waters. we present new data on the isotopic compositions of strontium and boron in brines and surficial aquifers of the Marcellus.

North-Central Arkansas. 2011,2012,Timothy M Kresse and Nathaniel R Warner and Phillip D Hays and Adrian Down and Avner Vengosh and Robert B Jackson,,,,,,The Mississippian Fayetteville Shale serves as an unconventional gas reservoir across north-central Arkansas. ranging in thickness from approximately 50 to 550 feet and varying in depth from approximately 1.500 to 6.500 feet below the ground surface. Primary permeability in the Fayetteville Shale is severely limited. and successful extraction of the gas reservoir is the result of advances in horizontal drilling techniques and hydraulic fracturing to enhance and develop secondary fracture porosity and permeability. Drilling and production of gas wells began in 2004. with a steady increase in production thereafter. As of April 2012. approximately 4.000 producing wells had been completed in the Fayetteville Shale. In Van Buren and Faulkner Counties. 127 domestic water wells were sampled and analyzed for major ions and trace metals. with a subset of the samples analyzed for methane and carbon isotopes to describe general water quality and geochemistry and to investigate the potential effects of gas-production activities on shallow groundwater in the study area. Water-quality analyses from this study were compared to historical (pregas development) shallow groundwater quality collected in the gas-production area. An additional comparison was made using analyses from this study of groundwater quality in similar geologic and topographic areas for well sites less than and greater than 2 miles from active gas-production wells.

1157604,Effect of government subsidies for upstream oil infrastructure on US oil production and global CO,2017,Peter Erickson and Adrian Down and Michael Lazarus and Doug Koplow and Earth Track,2,Seattle: Stockholm Environment Institute Working Paper,,,,The United States now produces as much crude oil as ever–over 3.4 billion barrels in 2015. just shy of the 3.5 billion record set in 1970. Indeed. the US has become the world’s No. 1 oil and gas producer. The oil production boom has been aided by tax provisions and other subsidies that support private investment in infrastructure for oil exploration and development. Federal tax preferences. for example. enable oil and gas producers to deduct capital expenditures faster. or at greater levels. than standard tax accounting rules typically allow. boosting investment returns. This paper quantifies the effect of a dozen US federal and state subsidies to oil production and estimates the corresponding effects on global CO2 emissions. At recent oil prices of $50 per barrel. subsidies push nearly half of yet-to-be-developed oil into profitability. potentially increasing US oil production by almost 20 billion barrels over the next few decades. Once burned. this oil would emit 8 billion tonnes of CO2. about 1% of the world’s remaining carbon budget to keep warming under 2 C. as envisioned in the Paris Agreement. This would represent a much greater share–perhaps a quarter–of a carbon budget for US oil production alone. These findings suggest an even stronger case for subsidy reform than has been articulated to date. Not only would removing federal and state support provide a large fiscal benefit to apply to other national spending priorities; it would also demonstrate US compliance with existing G20 commitments and generate substantial climate benefits as well.,True,UGJrzE8AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,14,http://sa.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/US-oil-and-gas-production-subsidies.pdf,6902177105519410084,/scholar?cites=6902177105519410084,,http://sa.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/US-oil-and-gas-production-subsidies.pdf,0,0,0

United States Department of Energy, Washngton, DC. July",,,,Substantial quantities of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions occur throughout the natural gas infrastructure. In 2012. approximately 155 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MMt CO2e) of CH4 were emitted as a result of inadvertent leakage and routine venting. In the same year. the natural gas industry emitted a similar amount of CO2 (approximately 164 MMt CO2e). primarily from the combustion of natural gas that is used as a fuel for compression and flared gas but also from the removal of non-hydrocarbon gases from raw gas by processing plants. Combined. these “midstream” and “upstream” emissions from natural gas infrastructure accounted for approximately 20% of total 2012 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural gas systems; the other 80% of GHG emissions from natural gas result from gas combustion by end-use consumers.

Future colliders that accelerate particles to higher energies could provide insight into the nature of mass and the unification of the fundamental forces of nature [2]. Constructing higher energy particle accelerators could contribute to research in many branches of physics. Particles accelerated to lower energy are useful for other purposes and are an important source of radiation for research and medical devices. In conventional colliders. particles are accelerated using electric fields produced by microwave radiation. These fields travel synchronously with the particles to be accelerated [2]. The energy of the accelerated particles is a function of the strength of the accelerating field and the distance over which the field acts. The fields that can be achieved by this radio frequency (RF) technology are fundamentally limited by the structural integrity of the collider apparatus. RF accelerating fields are generated in metal devices called slow wave cavities. Increasing the field in these cavities far beyond levels employed in current high energy colliders leads to electrical breakdown within the cavities and ionization of the materials with which the cavities are constructed [1].

In frozen soil. not all liquid water freezes at or below 0/spl deg/C. Based on the semi-empirical dielectric mixing model for soil water mixture. an extension of model has been made to describe the dielectric constant change of frozen soil as a function of temperature. An empirical function Wu=A/spl middot/|T-273.2|/sup -B/ has been used for estimating the fractions of liquid water and ice in frozen soil. where Wu is unfrozen water content. A and B are parameters related to soil texture. T is temperature in K. The item for calculation of dielectric constant of ice fraction is also added to the semi-empirical mixing model with extension of some related parameters adapted to temperature range below 0/spl deg/C.

Component flux estimate methods we consider sufficiently reliable for this purpose encompass fossil fuel emission inventories. biometric analysis of old-growth rainforests. estimation of carbon release associated with deforestation based on remote sensing and inventories. and agricultural export data. Alternative methods for the estimation of the continental-scale net land to atmosphere CO 2 flux. such as atmospheric transport inverse modelling and terrestrial biosphere model predictions. are. we find. hampered by the data paucity. and improved parameterisation and validation exercises are required before reliable estimates can be obtained. From our analysis of available data. we suggest that South America was a net source to the atmosphere during the 1980s (~ 0.3–0.4 Pg C a− 1) and close to neutral (~ 0.1 Pg C a− 1) in the 1990s.

After removing all the exchangeable lithium from the synthesized clays. Li isotope fractionation (Δ7Liclay-solution) was determined. This fractionation was linked to Li incorporation into the structural octahedral site. substituting for Mg2+. As predicted. experimental Δ7Liclay-solution inversely correlates with temperature. and ranges from −1.6‰ ± 1.3‰ at 250 °C to −10.0‰ ± 1.3‰ at 90 °C. and then stays relatively constant down to 25 °C.

Sediment samples from these large river basins provide a useful tool to calculate the average upper crustal composition because they are large-scale integrated samples of the weathering products of the present-day Upper Continental Crust (UCC). Two different and complementary calculations were done to estimate the average lead isotopic composition of the UCC. The first. based on the flux weighted average of particulate lead delivered by the rivers. gave values of 19.07. 15.74 and 39.35 for 206Pb/204Pb. 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios. respectively.

The aim of this study is to characterize the behaviour of Li and its isotopes during weathering at the scale of a large mixed lithology basin.

We clearly observed that the wide range of 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios in the waters (0.70755-0.72187) appear to be largely controlled by the dominant host lithologies with Sr isotopic signatures ranging from high values (resulting from interaction from granite and/or gneiss type > 0.714) to lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios (closer to …,True,YzwXz7wAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,59,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254107003427,6520176292290084638,/scholar?cites=6520176292290084638,,,0,0,0

Lithium. B. Sr and Nd isotopic signatures in thermo-mineral waters and bedrocks were combined in order to determine the origin of these fluids from a reservoir point of view.

1157733,Organic Compounds Associated with Hydraulic Fracturing,2014,Brian D Drollette,,,,,,As the United States slowly transitions from coal and foreign oil to more renewable energy sources. domestic natural gas is being utilized as an intermediate “bridge fuel”. Advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have increased gas extraction and exploration over the past ten years. The massive quantities of fluids used to fracture gas-producing shale plays contain potentially toxic chemicals and the wastes are highly saline and contain naturally occurring radioactive materials. It is unclear if there are risks to shallow drinking water aquifers and if the chemical constituents of fracking fluid are inherently biodegradable if released into the environment. Monitoring the fate of these chemicals as they enter the environment is critical to understanding potential health hazards and persistence. Here. groundwater monitoring for organic compounds coupled with spatial data analysis indicates no subsurface contamination from hydraulic fracturing of the Marcellus Shale in northeastern Pennsylvania. However. a chemical fingerprint is presented suggesting increased organic compounds in shallow groundwater are due to subsurface mixing with brine containing geogenic hydrocarbons from the Marcellus Shale.

Consequently. most researchers have attributed its origin to the interaction between the plume and the adjacent ridge. We propose that the WDL is caused only partially by the plume–ridge interaction. and instead that it is primarily the result of tensional stresses emanating from the inside corner of the transform fault at 91 W. An additional factor that amplifies the tension in this region is the oblique orientation of the major transform fault with respect to the Nazca plate's spreading direction. This setting creates a transtensional zone whereby strain is partitioned into strike‐slip motion along the transform and extension throughout the inside corner of the ridge–transform system.

We collected palaeomagnetic data from clasts in PDC deposits emplaced during historical eruptions of two volcanoes in Ecuador. the 2006 eruption at Tungurahua and the 1877 eruption at Cotopaxi. These eruptions were characterized by emplacement of PDCs mainly related to boiling-over activity. The deposits of these eruptions are similar and are characterized by cauliflower-textured juvenile scoria clasts up to 1 m in diameter and a diverse assemblage of lithic clasts surrounded by an unwelded ashy matrix. On the basis of progressive thermal demagnetization experiments. we infer that emplacement temperatures for most of the lithic clasts in PDC deposits are below 90 °C.

This titrimetric method involves eight pH observations. and typically. the full procedure takes approximately 15 min. An important feature of the method is a built-in quality control mechanism allowing the user a rapid means of assessing the reliability of the experimental procedure. To evaluate the accuracy of the method. both laboratory-made waters and industrial UASB effluent were tested. High accuracy for both VFA and carbonate alkalinity measure ments (error within 2% and 1%. respectively) plus good repetition (average standard deviation of 6.7% and 1.45%. respectively) was obtained.

1157796,Quality criteria for desalinated water following post-treatment,2007,Ori Lahav and Liat Birnhack,207,Desalination,1-3,286-303,Elsevier,In 2010 desalinated water is expected to provide approximately 25% of Israel’s fresh water supply. Since desalination is cost-effective only if operated constantly. areas adjacent to the desalination plants may receive unblended desalinated water for prolonged times while other sources are added only at peak demand. Notwithstanding that desalinated water is of superior quality. it is widely accepted that soft waters may be corrosive to water distribution systems. and that soft waters mingling with other sources can cause a variety of adverse effects. namely metal corrosion and red water events. Despite this. no unambiguous quantitative criteria have been proposed to-date to address the required quality of desalinated water. following the post treatment stage.

In addition. fresh water scarcity in dry regions or during periods of drought could limit shale gas development. This paper explores the possibility of using alternative water sources and their impact on NORM levels through blending acid mine drainage (AMD) effluent with recycled hydraulic fracturing flowback fluids (HFFFs).

In contrast to other studies of hybrid biological-ion exchange multireactor systems. the proposed process uses the ion exchange material. zeolite. as the carrier for the nitrifying biomass. This enables the two mode process to be carried out in a single reactor.In the first mode (ion exchange). secondary effluent is passed through an ion exchange column where ammonium is concentrated in the zeolite. During the second mode (bioregeneration). the absorbed ammonium is released gradually and converted to nitrate by the active biomass residing on the zeolite. Nitrification is carried out batchwise and in a small volume reactor where optimal conditions can easily be maintained.

However. allowing the accumulation of metabolic CO2(aq) results in pH reduction. thereby reducing the fraction of NH3 from TAN. Such operation strategy may allow increasing the design criteria for TAN. which can result in reduced water flow requirements in flow-through systems.In this study. growth parameters of sea bream Sparus aurata grown in high TAN and low pH values. were monitored. TAN toxicity was first tested in 27-l aquariums. where sea bream fingerlings were grown in TAN values of up to 20 mg N l− 1 and pH 6.8. without showing any significant negative effects.

The method is based on separating NH4+ from RAS water through an ion-exchange resin. which is subsequently regenerated by simultaneous chemical desorption and indirect electrochemical ammonia oxidation. Approach advantages include (1) only slight temperature dependence and no dependence on bacterial predators and chemical toxins; (2) no startup period is required and the system can be switched on and off at will; and (3) the fish are grown in much lower bacterial concentration. making the potential for both disease and off-flavor. lower.

In the first step. Mg2+ ions are separated from seawater by means of a specific ion exchange resin that has high affinity toward divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) and an extremely low affinity toward monovalent cations (namely Na+ and K+). In the second step. the Mg2+-loaded resin is contacted with the effluent of the calcite dissolution reactor and Mg2+ and Ca2+ are exchanged.

The process is based on convective aeration caused by a fill and draw operational sequence. and combines the advantages of the vertical wetlands concept with the high loading rates typically associated with trickling filters.

A maximal ammonium removal rate of 1100 g N/m2 reactor/d was achieved using simulative effluents and an effective gravel size of 0.96 mm. At all hydraulic loads applied. the nitrification rate was found to be limited by the oxygen transfer rate.

1157805,Bioregenerated ion-exchange process: The effect of the biofilm on ion-exchange capacity and kinetics,2000,Ori Lahav and Michal Green,26,Water Sa,1,51-57,,A new process for ammonium removal from wastewater using zeolite has been developed. The zeolite (chabazite) serves the dual purpose of an ion exchanger and a physical carrier for nitrifying bacteria which bio-regenerate the ammonium-saturated mineral. The entire process is carried out in a single. compact reactor and takes place in two phases: ion-exchange phase and bioregeneration phase.This paper describes the effects of the biofilm on ion-exchange capacity and kinetics. Batch and continuous experiments showed a reduction of about 25 to 30% in the ion-exchange rate in biofilm covered chabazite as compared to virgin chabazite. while the ion-exchange capacity did not change. Experiments conducted indicated that the rate-controlling step for ion exchange shifted from pore diffusion in the virgin chabazite to film diffusion in the biofilm-covered chabazite. The diffusion rate of NH4+ inside biofilms is of the same order of magnitude as diffusion rate of NH4+ in water and 3 to 4 orders of magnitude greater than typical pore diffusion rates reported in zeolites. Therefore. the biofilm coverage of the chabazite was originally not expected to affect the ion-exchange rate. In addition. chemical precipitation was experimentally found not to be the cause for the ion-exchange rate reduction. It was hypothesised that the rate-limiting factor for ion exchange was caused by the part of the biofilm adjacent to the chabazite which differs from the rest of the biofilm and is characterised by a much higher density which impedes diffusion.,True,Yvbr7usAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,60,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.461.1458&rep=rep1&type=pdf,287656345807883202,/scholar?cites=287656345807883202,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.461.1458&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Silver nanorice antennae are coupled with a patterned gold triangle nanoarray chip to create spatially broadened plasmonic “hot spots”. which enables a large density of Raman labels to experience strong local electromagnetic field. Finite difference time domain simulations have confirmed that the quasi-periodic structure increases the intensity and the area of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). which enhances the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal significantly. The SERS signal of the nanorice/DNA/nanoarray chip is compared with that of the nanorice/DNA/film chip. The SERS signal is greatly enhanced when the Ag nanorices are coupled to the periodic Au nanoarray instead of the planar film chip.

Inc,This study examined the consequences of surface carboxylation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) on bioactivity. Since commercial raw MWCNT contain impurities that may affect their bioactivity. HCl refluxing was exploited to purify raw “as-received” MWCNT by removing the amorphous carbon layer on the MWCNT surface and reducing the metal impurities (e.g. Ni). The removal of amorphous carbon layer was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Furthermore. the HCl-purified MWCNT provided more available reaction sites. leading to enhanced sidewall functionalization.

The gold core converts the energy of incident photons into localized surface plasmon resonance oscillations and transfers the plasmonic energy to the Cu2O semiconductor shell via resonant energy transfer (RET).

SPR transduces a signal in a colorimetric sensor through shifts in the spectral position and intensity in response to external stimuli. SPR can also concentrate the incident electromagnetic field in a nanostructure. modulating fluorescence emission and enabling plasmon-enhanced fluorescence to be used for ultrasensitive detection. Furthermore. plasmons have been extensively used for amplifying a Raman signal in a surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensor.

Strong plasmonic coupling between the Au nanostar and the Au nanohole array results in a large enhancement of the electromagnetic field. leading to amplification of the SERS signal. The SERS sensor has been used to detect Ag(I) and Hg(II) ions in human saliva because both the metal ions could be released from dental amalgam fillings. The developed SERS sensor can be adapted as a general detection platform for non-invasive measurements of a wide range of analytes such as metal ions. small molecules.

1157937,Plasmon-enhanced solar energy harvesting,2013,Scott K Cushing and Nianqiang Wu,22,The Electrochemical Society Interface,2,63,IOP Publishing,Solar energy can be directly converted to electrical energy via photovoltaics. Alternatively. solar energy can be converted and stored in chemical fuels through photoelectrochemical cells and photocatalysis (see front cover image). allowing continued power production when the sky is cloudy or dark. The conversion of solar energy is regulated by four processes: light absorption. charge separation. charge migration. and charge recombination. An individual material cannot be optimized for all four processes. Incorporation of plasmonic nanostructures with semiconductors offers an alternative route to improve the solar energy conversion efficiency. One enhancement mechanism is a so called photonic enhancement. the other one is plasmonic energy transfer enhancement. Two different mechanisms of plasmonic energy transfer enhancement are discussed: plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer (PIRET) from the …,True,dfpa1CUAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,74,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.F08132if/meta,15104524849220586808,/scholar?cites=15104524849220586808,,https://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum13/sum13_p063_067.pdf,0,0,0

Unfortunately. it is challenging to optimize these patterns for SERS sensing because their optical response is a complex mixture of localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and propagating surface plasmon polariton (SPP). In this paper. transmission and reflection measurements are combined with finite difference time domain simulations to identify and separate each plasmonic mode. discerning which resonance leads to the electromagnetic field enhancement. The SERS enhancement is found to be dominated by the absorption. which is shifted from the transmission and reflection dips usually used as tuning points. and by the ‘gap’ defects formed within the pattern.

Doping wide band gap oxide semiconductors usually introduces discrete mid-gap states. which extends the light absorption but has limited benefit for photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that compensated co-doping in AgTaO3 can overcome this problem by increasing the light absorption and simultaneously improving the charge carrier mobility. N/H and N/F co-doping can delocalize the discrete mid-gap states created by sole N doping in AgTaO3. which increases the band curvature and the electron-to-hole effective mass ratio. In particular. N/F co-doping creates a continuum of states that extend the valence band of AgTaO3. N/F co-doping thus improves the light absorption without creating the mid-gap states. maintaining the necessary …,True,dfpa1CUAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,51,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/cp/c3cp51902c,2097534952441260753,/scholar?cites=2097534952441260753,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dong_Guo7/publication/269991965_Photocatalytic_hydrogen_generation_enhanced_by_band_gap_narrowing_and_improved_charge_carrier_mobility_in_AgTaO3_by_compensated_co-doping/links/5886c88592851c21ff4d63ff/Photocatalytic-hydrogen-generation-enhanced-by-band-gap-narrowing-and-improved-charge-carrier-mobility-in-AgTaO3-by-compensated-co-doping.pdf,0,0,0

The stack model used is based on a one-dimensional co-flow cell model developed in prior work. The influence of radiative heat transfer between the PEN (positive electrode. electrolyte. negative electrode body) and the neighboring separator plates on the temperature distribution is also considered. Variations in cell voltage are attributed to asymmetries in stack geometry (boundary effects) and non-uniformity in flow rates. more particularly. flow thermal capacity.

The correlation is based on the assumption that the work performed by buoyancy force on the sediment particles is proportional to the production of turbulent kinetic energy. The proportionality constant is determined by calibration using a wide range of experimental data. The new formula does involve bed‐load correlations. and. hence. avoids the considerable uncertainty generic to those correlations. By assuming a suitable concentration profile. the formula can be used for calculating the maximum. full‐capacity concentration at a reference level. but the formula itself does not involve a priori profile assumptions. An approximate relation is provided between the depth‐averaged concentration and the transport concentration itself.

Numerical accuracy concerns primarily grid resolution. and model accuracy refers to how good a certain subgrid scale sgs or subfilter scale sfs model performs compared with “true” direct numerical simulation DNS and/or experimental data. Since in most applications the filtering process is convoluted with numerical discretization errors. it is difficult to segregate these factors. This is the reason for seeking some verifiable measures that could be used as indicators of numerical and/or modeling errors in LES.

Western Virginia University,Theoretical analysis and prediction of turbulence has been. and to this date still is. the fundamental problem of fluid dynamics. particularly of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The major difficulty arises from the random or chaotic nature of turbulence phenomena. Because of this unpredictability. it has been customary to work with the time averaged forms of the governing equations. which inevitably results in terms involving higher order correlations of fluctuating quantities of flow variables. The semi-empirical mathematical models introduced for calculation of these unknown correlations form the basis for turbulence modeling. It is the focus of the present study to investigate the main principles of turbulence modeling. including examination of the physics of turbulence. closure models. and application to specific flow conditions.

A commercial CFD code is used for this purpose. It is found that the application of the method is not straightforward and some aspects need careful consideration. Some of the problems are elucidated. The particular code used for the present application employs a hybrid scheme. and it does not give monotonic convergence for all the variables in all regions as the grid is refined. The flow regions and the variables which converge monotonically in these regions should be identified first before the method is applied. When this is done Richardson extrapolation gives good results in calculating the apparent order of the numerical procedure used. as well as obtaining grid independent results with which discretization error bounds can be calculated as measures of numerical uncertainty.

Cantilever probes with spring constants ranging from 0.4–150 N m were used to investigate a number of polymer systems. including an elastomer. several polyurethane systems. thermally cured epoxies. a thermoplastic polymer-thermosetting polymer adhesive system. and a thermoplastic matrix composite.,True,l50AOiwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,201,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00218469708010531,17983651138049451088,/scholar?cites=17983651138049451088,,,0,0,0
1157997,Effect of epoxy–amine stoichiometry on cured resin material properties,1992,GR Palmese and RL McCullough,46,Journal of applied polymer science,10,1863-1873,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,Sizings and/or surface treatments are commonly employed to enhance the interaction of fiber reinforcements in polymer matrix composites. These modifications can induce physical and chemical interactions that cause local stoichiometric imbalances to occur that can affect the properties of the polymer matrix in the vicinity of the fiber surface. This work reports the results of an experimental study of the influence of stoichiometric imbalance on the thermoelastic properties of an epoxy–amine resin. It is shown that the modulus and glass transition temperature are significantly affected by relatively small variations in stoichiometry. These results suggest that a fiber‐induced interphase region in thermosetting composites can exhibit material properties that are significantly different from those of the bulk resin. © 1992 John Wiley & Sons.

Methacrylated fatty acid (MFA) monomers are ideal candidates because they are inexpensive. have low volatilities. and free-radically polymerize with vinyl ester. The viscosity of VE resins using these fatty acid monomers ranged from 700–2000 cP. which is considerably higher than that of VE/styrene resins (∼100 cP). In addition. the Tg of VE/MFA polymers were only on the order of 80 °C. which is significantly lower than that of VE/styrene polymers. Decreasing the length of the base fatty acid chains from 18 to 12 carbon atoms improved the Tg by 20 °C. while lowing the resin viscosity from ∼2500 to ∼1000 cP.

The desired inertness increases storage and handling capabilities. Latent curatives have been developed using a variety of hardeners in either multicomponent or one-pot formulations. 1 In particular. the initiation and polymerization of epoxy resins are of commercial interest due to the great versatility in application of these systems.

The basis for glucose detection is the reversible competitive displacement of a ligand from a receptor protein with specific binding sites for certain carbohydrates. Detection of glucose is based on measurements of the change in fluorescent lifetime of the donor‐labeled protein. as it binds to the acceptor‐labeled ligand. The sensor was modeled as a hollow fiber membrane. permeable to glucose. which encapsulates a solution of the receptor protein and competing ligand. Model equations that describe the diffusion of glucose through the fiber membrane and the subsequent displacement reactions within the fiber lumen were solved numerically to predict the response time of the sensor following a step change in bulk glucose concentration.

A Wiley Company,The diffusion of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) in two vinyl alcohol/vinyl butyral (VA/VBu) copolymers (11‐ and 19‐wt. % VA) was studied at low vapor activities using Fourier transform infrared‐attenuated total reflectance (FTIR‐ATR) spectroscopy. MEK has the ability to interact through hydrogen bonding to sites in the polymer and was chosen to study the effect of penetrant–polymer solvation on molecular diffusion. The assumption of local equilibrium was verified by examining the time‐evolved concentrations of hydrogen‐bound and free MEK determined from the carbonyl (C = O) stretching bands. A mathematical model that accounted explicitly for solvation during the diffusion process was developed. Solvation hindered the diffusion of MEK in the VA/VBu copolymer by factors of 2.0 (11‐wt. % VA) and 2.6 (19‐wt. % VA).

Inc.,The development of a new model for the diffusion of gas molecules in glassy polymers is presented which utilizes concepts from free volume theory and relies on a dual‐mode interpretation of sorptive dilation in glassy polymers. Three assumptions are made in the development of the model. First. the free volume available for molecular transport processes is taken as constant below the glass transition temperature. Second. two populations of gas molecules are assumed to exist—one which contributes to the maintenance of an iso‐free volume state upon sorptive dilation and one which does not contribute owing to sorption into regions of unrelaxed volume. Third. the former population is assumed to be mobile while the latter is not. The resulting model predicts. at constant temperature. a diffusion coefficient that is independent of solute volume fraction.

To this end. we investigate the structure-property relationships of homopolymer and block copolymer systems containing imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs).

In both acrylate-based and vinylimidazolium PIL homopolymers. nanoscale segregation of polar and non-polar moieties is detrimental for ionic conductivity. Increasing the length of alkyl pendant groups increases ion aggregation and decreases ion mobility. while increasing the size of mobile anions decreases ionic aggregate formation and the glass transition temperature. leading to increased ionic conductivity.

Achieving high power typically requires sacrificing energy densities. as the latter demands a high specific surface area and narrow porosity that impedes ion transport. We present a novel solution for this optimization problem: a nanostructured core–shell carbonaceous material that exhibits a microporous carbon core surrounded by a mesoporous. graphitic shell. Our tunable synthesis parameters yielded a structure that features either a sharp or a gradual transition between the core and shell sections.

These properties make CDCs viable substrates in several energy-relevant applications. such as gas storage media. electrochemical capacitors. and catalytic supports. These materials are heterogenous. non-ideal structures and include several important parameters that govern their performance. Therefore. a realistic model of the CDC structure is needed in order to study these systems and their nanoscale and macroscale properties with molecular simulation. We report the use of the ReaxFF reactive force field in a quenched molecular dynamics routine to generate atomistic CDC models. The pair distribution function. pore size distribution. and adsorptive properties of this model are reported and corroborated with experimental data. Simulations demonstrate that compressing the system after quenching changes the pore size distribution to better match the experimental target. Ring size distributions of this model demonstrate the prevalence of non-hexagonal carbon rings in CDCs. These effects may contrast the properties of CDCs against those of activated carbons with similar pore size distributions and explain higher energy densities of CDC-based supercapacitors.

Of all potential fillers for polymer nanocomposites. carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are of particular interest due to their low mass density. high aspect ratio. and excellent mechanical. electrical. and thermal properties. In semicrystalline polymer CNT nanocomposites (PCNs). CNTs are viewed as nucleation agents that can affect polymer crystallization. However. it is challenging to quantify and compare results from different research groups. mainly due to the complexity of CNTs. Different chiralities. diameters. surface functional groups. surfactants used. and sample preparation processes can affect PCN crystallization.

Inc.,Optimal conditions for drying polymer–solvent coatings result from a trade‐off between minimizing the residual solvent level and creating defects. This article describes an application of automated constrained optimization with a detailed mathematical drying model to find the optimal drying conditions for a prototypical coating in a single‐zone oven. The optimization process seeks oven conditions that minimize the residual solvent level for a fixed oven residence time without boiling the solvent within the coating. The optimal oven conditions include the air temperature and coating‐side and substrate‐side heat‐transfer coefficients. The conditions are constrained to physically reasonable values. According to our results. the optimal coating‐side heat‐transfer coefficient is always equal to or greater than the optimal substrate‐side heat‐transfer coefficient. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons. Inc.

Specifically. the full-Newton-coupled heat. mass. momentum. and pseudo-solid mesh motion algorithm makes GOMA ideally suited for simulating processes in which the bulk fluid transport is closely coupled to the interfacial physics. Examples include. but are not limited to. coating and polymer processing flows. soldering. crystal growth. and solid-network or solution film drying. The code is based on the premise that any boundary can be (1) moving or free. with an apriori unknown position dictated by the distinguishing physics.(2) fixed. according to a global analytical representation. or (3) moving in time and space under user-prescribed kinematics. The goal is to enable the user to predict boundary position or motion simultaneously with the physics of the problem being analyzed and to pursue geometrical design studies and fluid-structure interaction problems.The moving mesh algorithm treats the entire domain as a computational Lagrangian solid that deforms subject to the physical principles which dictate boundary position. As an added benefit. the same Lagrangian solid mechanics can be exploited to solve multi-field problems for which the solid motion and stresses interact with other transport phenomena. either within the same material phase (eg shrinking coating) or in neighboring material phases (eg flexible blade coating).

A Wiley Company,As a sequel to our study on experimental measurements of trapping skinning in a poly(methyl methacrylate)/acetone coating. a mathematical model of non‐Fickian diffusion that predicts trapping skinning is reported here including solvent transport due to a stress gradient that develops because of coating shrinkage. The predicted solvent concentration profile shows a sigmoidal shape and a front that moves into the coating. In the nearly constant rate period. the stress relaxes near the coating surface due to short relaxation times at high coating temperature. The stress relaxation causes negative non‐Fickian flux. At higher gas flow rates. the negative non‐Fickian flux causes the development of a thinner layer of low solvent concentration near the coating surface and a thicker layer of high solvent concentration inside the coating.

Through subsequent chemical cross-linking. electrostatic destabilization. evaporation or some combination thereof. the fluid sol may be transformed into a rigid gel. which is a substance containing a continuous solid skeleton enclosing a continuous liquid phase.

We investigate this correlation using three common gold meta-atom geometries: L-shapes. triangles. and nanorod dimers. over a broad range of geometric parameters. We show that this correlation holds for both contiguous plasmonic meta-atoms and non-contiguous structures which support plasmonic coupling effects. A potential application for this correlation is the rapid optimization of plasmonic nanostructure for maximum broadband CDOA.,True,cXNnnlMAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,2,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-27-4-5097,12755513462580412449,/scholar?cites=12755513462580412449,,https://www.osapublishing.org/viewmedia.cfm?uri=oe-27-4-5097&seq=0,0,0,0

Atomistic simulations based on the use of the continuous cellular automaton (CCA) conclude that the interface atoms react faster with the etchant. thus initiating a step flow process that results in increased etch rates for the obtuse facets. By generating a wide range of complex cavities on high-index silicon wafers with a single-side. single-step etching. the comparison of the experimental and simulated results strongly indicates that the CCA method is suitable for accurately describing not only the development of micron-scaled structures but also. for the first time. the formation of submicron shapes.

Since the biological as well as the optical activity of molecules strongly depend on their handedness. chirality has recently attracted high interest in the field of nano-optics. Various aspects of associated phenomena including the influences of internal and external degrees of freedom on the optical response have been discussed. Here. we propose a constructive method to evaluate the possibility of observing any chiral response from an optical scatterer. Based on solely the T-matrix of one enantiomer. planes of minimal chiral response are located and compared to geometric mirror planes. This provides insights into the relation of geometric and optical properties and enables identifying the potential of chiral scatterers for nano-optical experiments.

For this purpose short circuit current densities and absorption spectra within the investigated solar cell model are systematically analyzed. Furthermore. the authors employ a topology simulation method to accurately predict the material layer interfaces within the investigated solar cell model. The method simulates the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that is typically used to fabricate thin-film solar cells by combining a ballistic transport and reaction model (BTRM) with a level-set method in an iterative approach. Predicted solar cell models are far more realistic compared to solar cell models created assuming conformal material growth.

The synthesis of TTz was streamlined down to four high-yielding steps. resulting in the new polymer PBnDT–TTz for organic solar cells. By incorporating TTz. a nitrogen is directly introduced into the polymer backbone which tunes the HOMO level and eliminates the reliance on external substituents. Compared to its TT analogue. PBnDT–TTz exhibits the same HOMO level of −5.06 eV and the same Voc of 0.69 eV. yet a higher power conversion efficiency of  2.5%.

A semipermeable membrane that allows sweat to escape a chemical protection garment. while rejecting chemical agents. would provide a potential solution for both of these issues. Few semipermeable membranes transport water vapor at a sufficient rate to cool a Soldier working at moderate levels of effort. and the mechanical properties of these materials are also of concern. Membranes fabricated from reactive block copolymers and a small molecule cross-linker using ring-opening metathesis chemistry were tested for their water transport properties.

1158337,The Synthesis and Optimization of Conjugated Polymers for Photovoltaic Applications,2011,Samuel Chesson Price,,,,,,Conjugated polymer solar cells have the potential to be a cheap. light weight. robust source of solar power and could contribute to solving the energy problems our future faces. The primary limiting factor for commercialization of these devices is the power conversion efficiency. which is governed by the conjugated polymer semiconductor in the active layer of these devices. However. the current state of the art materials are not optimized. and progress in the design of conjugated polymers must be made for these devices to be financially viable. Synthetic modification of the polymer p-type semiconductor is necessary to fully understand the structure-property relationships that govern the underlying principle performance criteria of these polymer photovoltaic cells. By synthesizing new conjugated polymers with a variety of chemical structures. more insight can be gained into the factors that govern the band gap. oxidation and reduction potential. hole mobility. and phase separation behavior of the conjugated polymer is achieved. The culmination of this knowledge allows for the synthesis of new polymer materials which show exceptionally high photovoltaic efficiency of 7%. Additionally. these polymers are able to form exceptionally thick films and still maintain high efficiencies. The exceptional performance of these materials grants a unique insight that will affect polymer design strategies in the future.,True,MtplCY0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,1,https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/5m60qs746,15764015727134998119,/scholar?cites=15764015727134998119,,https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/downloads/vx021g14d,0,0,0

In addition to the desired benefit of providing skin hygiene. surfactants also extract skin components during cleansing and remain in the stratum corneum (SC) after rinsing. These side effects disrupt SC structure and degrade its barrier properties. Recent applications of vibrational spectroscopy and two-photon microscopy in skin research have provided molecular-level information to facilitate our understanding of the interaction between skin and surfactant. In the arena of commercial skin cleansers. technologies have been developed to produce cleansers that both cleanse and respect skin barrier. The main approach is to minimize surfactant interaction with skin through altering its solution properties. Recently. hydrophobically modified polymers (HMPs) have been introduced to create skin compatible cleansing systems. At the presence of HMP. surfactants assemble into larger. more stable structures.

1158377,Designing cleansers for the unique needs of baby skin,2008,Russel M WALTERS and Michael J FEVOLA and Joseph J LIBRIZZI and Katharine MARTIN,123,Cosmetics and toiletries,12,,Allured,The skin’s primary function is to provide a protective barrier that maintains internal hydration and electrolytes while preventing entry of exogenous substances such as bacteria. allergens. particulates. pollution. etc. The outermost layers of the skin. the stratum corneum (SC). are often described as a bricks (cells)-and-mortar (lipid) structure. Scientist and clinicians believe that this structure creates a tortuous path through the “mortar” that inhibits the flow of water from the skin and contaminants into the skin. Cleansing infants is critical for both infant and family hygiene. Microbial colonization occurs shortly after birth. and a baby’s proclivity to be in contact with many substances is well-known. Cleansing removes unwanted surface material and can prevent infection. ingestion. and transmission of microbes and matter on the surface of the baby skin.

Large subject-to-subject variability within an age group requires a large population to observe trends in skin barrier properties over time. Barrier function. quantified by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and SC thickness. was measured on the upper inner arm and dorsal forearm in subjects aged 3 months to 4 years (n = 171) and a subset of mothers (n = 44). The rate of skin surface area expansion as a function of age peaked before birth (∼90 cm2/week) and declined to a steady plateau (∼10 cm2/week) by 1 year of age. SC thickness increased and TEWL decreased. but did not reach adult values until 3-4 years of age.

It is restricted to loading conditions since elasticity is entirely neglected. The single crystal behavior is based on crystallographic slip. and the slip rate is a non-linear function of the resolved shear stress. The time independent plasticity is obtained as a limit when the rate sensitivity tends to zero. The polycrystal behavior is obtained from the single crystal constitutive relation by solving integral equations derived from the field equations. A self-consistent approach is developed. where each grain is assumed to be a single ellipsoidal inclusion in a homogeneous equivalent medium. An interaction formula is derived and the local strain rates are calculated by resolving a nonlinear system of equations.

These mechanically induced rotations are shown to occur at the high strain rate associated with adiabatic shear band formation. Recrystallized grain formation is proposed to occur by the formation and mechanical rotation of subgrains during deformation. coupled with boundary refinement via diffusion during shear band cooling.

We studied the effects of fillers geometry (long cylinders to sphere and thin discs). volume fraction and properties contrast and particularly the effect of interphase thickness and properties contrast on the effective thermal conductivity and elastic modulus of nanocomposite structures. Our results show that while the interphase effect is significant for the spherical fillers. it turns to be less effective as the fillers’ geometry deviates more from spherical shape.

Elasticity modulus. density and thickness of the disc are assumed to vary radially according to a power low function. The natural frequencies and critical speeds of the rotating FG annular disc of variable thickness with two types of boundary conditions are obtained employing the numerical generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM). The boundary conditions considered in the analysis is the both edges clamped (C-C) and the inner edge clamped and the outer edge free (C-F).The influence of the graded index. thickness variation. geometric parameters and angular velocity on the dimensionless natural frequencies and critical speeds are demonstrated. It is shown that using a plate with a convergent thickness profile. we have a higher critical speed and natural frequency and using a divergent thickness profile. we can lower the critical speed. It is found that increase in the ratio of inner-outer radii could increase the critical speed of the FG annular disk.

The influences of material grades. material thickness. piercing direction and the use of structural adhesive on the rivet samples’ fatigue behaviors were investigated. Fatigue test results indicate that SPR joints have superior fatigue strength than resistance spot weld (RSW) joints for the same material combinations.

The baseline alloy is AA5083. Nominally this alloy contains about 4.5% Mg. 0.8% Mn. 0.2% Cr. 0.037% Si. 0.08% Fe and 0.025% Ti by weight. The experimental program consists of uniaxial tension tests and digital image analysis for measuring cavitation. The experiments reveal that evolution of damage is due to both nucleation and growth of voids.

Actual microstructures of DP steels obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used as representative volume elements (RVEs) in the finite element calculations. Ductile failure of the RVE is predicted as plastic strain localization during the deformation process. Systematic computations are conducted on the RVE to quantitatively evaluate the influence of the martensite mechanical properties and volume fraction on the macroscopic mechanical properties of DP steels. These properties include the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). ultimate ductility. and failure modes.

The main problem is to carry out rigorous analyses to simulate the deformation of single crystal metals (fcc and bcc) of finite domains. While the overall macroscopic response of the crystal is based on the continuum theory. the constitutive response is determined by discrete dislocation dynamics analyses using micro3d. Size effects are investigated by considering two boundary value problems: (1) uniaxial loading of a single crystal cube. and (2) bending of a single crystal micro-beam.

However. it is limited in application due to the presence of small voids that grow and coalesce during the forming process. often causing premature failure. In order to understand and control this phenomenon accurate constitutive models must be developed which account for void parameters that affect the macroscopic behavior of the material.

One approach is to design fabrication processes capable of tailoring desirable cathode microstructures to enhance mass and charge transfer properties through the porous medium. The aim of this study is to develop a cost effective fabrication technique for deposition of novel microstructures. specifically. functionally graded thin films of LSM oxide with porosity graded structure for use as IT- SOFCs cathode. Spray pyrolysis method was chosen as a low-temperature processing technique for deposition of porous LSM films onto dense YSZ substrates. The effort was directed toward the optimization of the processing conditions for deposition of high quality LSM films with variety of morphologies in the range of dense to porous microstructures. Results of optimization studies on spray parameters revealed that the substrate surface temperature is the most critical parameter influencing the roughness and morphology. porosity. cracking and crystallinity of the film. Physical and chemical properties of deposited thin films such as porosity. morphology. phase crystallinity and compositional homogeneity have shown to be extensively dependent on the deposition temperature as well as solution flow rate and the type of precursor solution among other parameters.

1158603,Low-dissipation and low-dispersion Runge–Kutta schemes for computational acoustics,1996,FQ Hu and M Yousuff Hussaini and JL Manthey,124,Journal of computational physics,1,177-191,Academic Press,In this paper. we investigate accurate and efficient time advancing methods for computational acoustics. where nondissipative and nondispersive properties are of critical importance. Our analysis pertains to the application of Runge–Kutta methods to high-order finite difference discretization. In many CFD applications. multistage Runge–Kutta schemes have often been favored for their low storage requirements and relatively large stability limits. For computing acoustic waves. however. the stability consideration alone is not sufficient. since the Runge–Kutta schemes entail both dissipation and dispersion errors. The time step is now limited by the tolerable dissipation and dispersion errors in the computation. In the present paper. it is shown that if the traditional Runge–Kutta schemes are used for time advancing in acoustic problems. time steps greatly smaller than those allowed by the stability limit are necessary.

A compressible generalization of the linear combination of the Smagorinsky model and scale-similarity model. in terms of Favre-filtered fields. is obtained for the subgrid-scale stress tensor. An analogous thermal linear combination model is also developed for the subgrid-scale heat flux vector. The two dimensionless constants associated with these subgrid-scale models are obtained by correlating with the results of direct numerical simulations of compressible isotropic turbulence performed on a 963 grid using Fourier collocation methods.

The nature of the compressible velocity field. which generates these dilatational terms. is explored by asymptotic analysis of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the case of homogeneous turbulence. The lowest-order equations for the compressible field are solved and explicit expressions for some of the associated one-point moments are obtained. For low Mach numbers. the compressible mode has a fast timescale relative to the incompressible mode. Therefore. it is proposed that. in moderate Mach number homogeneous turbulence. the compressible component of the turbulence is in quasi-equilibrium with respect to the incompressible turbulence.

1158610,Stochastic approaches to uncertainty quantification in CFD simulations,2005,Lionel Mathelin and M Yousuff Hussaini and Thomas A Zang,38,Numerical Algorithms,1-3,209-236,Springer US,This paper discusses two stochastic approaches to computing the propagation of uncertainty in numerical simulations: polynomial chaos and stochastic collocation. Chebyshev polynomials are used in both cases for the conventional. deterministic portion of the discretization in physical space. For the stochastic parameters. polynomial chaos utilizes a Galerkin approximation based upon expansions in Hermite polynomials. whereas stochastic collocation rests upon a novel transformation between the stochastic space and an artificial space. In our present implementation of stochastic collocation. Legendre interpolating polynomials are employed. These methods are discussed in the specific context of a quasi-one-dimensional nozzle flow with uncertainty in inlet conditions and nozzle shape. It is shown that both stochastic approaches efficiently handle uncertainty propagation.

1158623,The analysis and simulation of compressible turbulence,1990,Gordon Erlebacher and MY Hussaini and HO Kreiss and S Sarkar,2,Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics,2,73-95,Springer-Verlag,This paper considers compressible turbulent flows at low turbulent Mach numbers. Contrary to the general belief that such flows are almost incompressible (i.e.. the divergence of the velocity field remains small for all times). it is shown that even if the divergence of the initial velocity field is negligibly small. it can grow rapidly on a nondimensional time scale which is the order of the fluctuating Mach number. An asymptotic theory which enables a description of the flow in terms of its divergence-free and vorticity-free components has been developed to solve the initial-value problem. As a result. the various types of low Mach number turbulent regimes have been classified with respect to the initial conditions. Formulae are derived that accurately predict the level of compressibility after the initial transients have disappeared.

The 3D reconstruction starts by analyzing 2D SEM micrographs of real composite materials. which yield initial nucleation sites for different phases. The so-called cellular automaton algorithm. which is observed in insect colonies and bacteria growth in nature. controls growth kinetics of the initial nuclei. After successful growth and completion of the reconstruction process. FEM simulations are applied to characterize elastic and thermal properties of the reconstructed material.

To realize this purpose. samples were machined under different cutting speeds and material feed rates at two extreme levels. Microscopy imaging reveals that activation of dynamic recrystallization or grain growth depends on the combination of applied cutting parameters. Increasing the cutting speed intensifies recrystallization. while the feed rate governs the grain growth. Adjusting the cutting parameters enables one to obtain a desired average grain size below the machined surface. up to a $180 lm depth. The average grain size of the initial material was 31.6 lm.

1158634,On residual stress development. prevention. and compensation in metal additive manufacturing,2020,Kevin Carpenter and Ali Tabei,13,,2,255,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,One of the most appealing qualities of additive manufacturing (AM) is the ability to produce complex geometries faster than most traditional methods. The trade-off for this advantage is that AM parts are extremely vulnerable to residual stresses (RSs). which may lead to geometrical distortions and quality inspection failures. Additionally. tensile RSs negatively impact the fatigue life and other mechanical performance characteristics of the parts in service. Therefore. in order for AM to cross the borders of prototyping toward a viable manufacturing process. the major challenge of RS development must be addressed. Different AM technologies contain many unique features and parameters. which influence the temperature gradients in the part and lead to development of RSs. The stresses formed in AM parts are typically observed to be compressive in the center of the part and tensile on the top layers. To mitigate these stresses. process parameters must be optimized. which requires exhaustive and costly experimentations. Alternative to experiments. holistic computational frameworks which can capture much of the physics while balancing computational costs are introduced for rapid and inexpensive investigation into development and prevention of RSs in AM. In this review. the focus is on metal additive manufacturing. referred to simply as “AM”. and. after a brief introduction to various AM technologies and thermoelastic mechanics. prior works on sources of RSs in AM are discussed.

Beside its relatively high rigidity (high tensile strength and modulus compared with many common thermoplastics such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). high impact poly(styrene) (HIPS) and poly(propylene) (PP)). PLA suffers from an inherent brittleness. which can limit its applications especially where mechanical toughness such as plastic deformation at high impact rates or elongation is required. Therefore. the curve plotting stiffness vs. impact resistance and ductility must be shifted to higher values for PLA-based materials. while being preferably fully bio-based and biodegradable upon the application. This review aims to establish a state of the art focused on the recent progresses and preferably economically viable strategies developed in the literature for significantly improve the mechanical performances of PLA.

Indeed such films are deposited by alternate dipping of the substrates in aqueous solutions containing the interacting species or spraying these solutions on the surface of the substrate. Spin coating is more and more used to produce similar films. The aim of this short review article is to provide an unifying picture about the deposition mechanisms of polyelectrolyte multilayer films. Often those films are described as growing either in a linear or in a supralinear growth regime with the number of deposited “layer pairs”. The growth regime of PEM films can be controlled by operational parameters like the temperature or the ionic strength of the used solutions. The control over the growth regime of the films as a function of the number of deposition steps allows to control their functional properties: either hard and impermeable films in the case of linear growth or soft and permeable films in the case of supralinear growth. Such different properties can be obtained with a given combination of interacting species by changing the operational parameters during the film deposition.,True,teDb5tcAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,68,https://www.hindawi.com/isrn/materials.science/2012/701695/abs/,6242120653037224734,/scholar?cites=6242120653037224734,,https://www.hindawi.com/isrn/materials.science/2012/701695/abs/,0,0,0

The ZnO films have a hexagonal wurtzite structure with a grain size of about 50 nm. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of Zn2+ and of zinc hydroxyl groups at the film. Optical properties were studied by photoluminescence (PL) and absorption spectroscopy at low and room temperatures. The absorption spectrum is dominated by a sharp excitonic peak at room and low temperatures. At room temperature. PL observations show two transitions: one near the absorption edge in the ultraviolet (UV) region and the second centered at 640 nm. characteristic of the deep electronic levels in the bandgap.

Various criteria have been proposed to capture this failure mechanism for various materials. In this study. ductile failure of dual phase steels is predicted in the form of plastic strain localization resulting from the incompatible deformation between the harder martensite phase and the softer ferrite matrix. Microstructure-level inhomogeneity serves as the initial imperfection triggering the instability in the form of plastic strain localization during the deformation process. Failure modes and ultimate ductility of two dual phase steels are analyzed using finite element analyses based on the actual steel microstructures.

Because aluminum has high thermal conductivity. low melting temperature and low yield strength. deformation resulting from resistance spot welding is expected to be more severe than for steel. Compared with most of the published work in this area. this paper takes into account the incremental changes in sheet-deformed shape. contact area and current density profile as well as large deformation effects. The present analysis procedures consider electrical contact resistivities to be not only functions of contact temperature but also functions of pressure. Joule heating at the contact surfaces is computed using an equivalent surface heat generation concept. This new procedure is suitable for analyzing many important parameters such as contact area changes. electrode movement and dynamic resistance. as well as other factors that contribute to weld quality such as weld size. weld indentation. sheet separation and weld residual stresses.

Systematic computations are conducted on the RVE to quantitatively evaluate the influence of the martensite mechanical properties and volume fraction on the macroscopic mechanical properties of DP steels. These properties include the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). ultimate ductility. and failure modes. The computational results show that. as the strength and volume fraction of the martensite phase increase. the UTS of DP steels increases. but …,True,wyN2Iz8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,113,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11661-009-9792-6.pdf,8734899444677800864,/scholar?cites=8734899444677800864,,,0,0,0

This paper discusses the principal features of deformation twinning in faced-centered cubic austenitic steels and shows how a physically based macroscopic model can be derived from microscopic-level considerations. In fact. a dislocation-based phenomenological model. with internal state variables including dislocation density and micro-twins volume fraction describing the microstructure evolution during deformation process. is proposed to model the deformation behavior of TWIP steels.

Instead of applying confining pressure. cuboid specimens with the material axis inclining to the loading direction at different angles (0°. 3°. 5°. and 7°) are used to generate higher shear stresses. A high‐speed digital camera. synchronized with the loading stress pulse. is used to record the dynamic crack initiation and propagation. Experimental results show that the equivalent stress at failure decreases with increasing shear portion in the stress. Digital images show that the cracks initiate randomly in the right specimen. whereas cracks initiate from the stress‐concentrated corners in the inclined specimens.

These savings. which are essential for today's technologies. are primarily due to the material's high modulus and low density combined with its better than average specific strength.

It was seen that AZ31 exhibited unusually high normalized strain-hardening rates compared to α-Ti that occurred beyond the strain levels where extension twins have completely altered the underlying texture. This observation challenges the validity of the generally accepted notion in the current literature that the high strain-hardening rates in AZ31 are directly caused by extension twins.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The hypothesis of incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the interfacial layers of fiber‐reinforced polymer composites fiber‐reinforced Polymers (FRPs) to enhance their mechanical properties and mitigate the stress wave propagation during a blast event is investigated. A numerical model is developed to simulate the stress wave propagation in a laminated elastic/viscoelastic FRP. Coupled with multiobjective optimization paradigms. the optimal CNTs contents in the interfacial layers are determined to minimize the stress‐to‐strength ratio in each layer. A case study demonstrating the design of a five‐layered FRP subjected to a blast event is presented. The simulation revealed that the viscoelastic properties of the matrix material contribute significantly to the energy dissipation during stress wave propagation.

The considered EOC content was 0 wt. %. 10 wt. % and 20 wt. %. and the investigated number of recycling passes (extrusions) was 0. 1. 3 and 6. Up to 6 re-extrusions. an increase of the melt flow index (MFI). a slight increase of the crystallinity. a slight decrease of the decomposition temperature (Tonset). and no significant oxidation were noted. Therefore. the recycling of the blends induces thermomechanical degradation by chain scission without oxidation. Increasing the content of EOC increases the MFI and the Tonset of the PP blends.

The distribution. shape and orientation of the two phases are taken into account using two- and three-point probability distribution functions. A new approximation for the three-point probability function appropriate for two-phase media is proposed and discussed. Computed results for the effective conductivity using the strong-contrast formulation are compared to the Voigt and the Hashin-Shtrikman upper-bound estimates. These results show that the predicted effective conductivity is lower than both Voigt and Hashin-Shtrikman bounds.

This method only needs the segmentation of the bones. viscera and lungs in the preoperative image and a tracking of the patient skin motion. Prediction of internal organ motions is very important for radiotherapy since it can allow to reduce the healthy tissue irradiation.

As in the case of eutectoid steels with vanadium additions. the predominant carbide species at the grain boundaries is cementite. rather than vanadium carbide. even at the higher vanadium levels (0.2 wt.%).

Both alloy additions were found to result in the formation of nonlamellar products in the vicinity of austenite grain boundaries in hypereutectoid compositions (0.77 to 0.95 wt pct C). The products comprise discrete initial cementite particles and grain boundary ferrite. which is embedded with interphase precipitates of vanadium carbide. As the carbon content is increased further (up to 1.05 wt pct). the amount of grain boundary ferrite gradually decreases without any dramatic change in the morphology of the initial cementite particles.

A careful examination of the initial stages of austenite decomposi~ion has been made. using a range of high resolution metallographic techniques. It has been confirmed that vanadium addition results in the formation of grain boundary ferrite films. even in the eutectoid composition range.

This is because the first event is the nucleation of carbide particles along the grain boundaries. These carbides have been identified mainly as cementite.

1158833,Bio-inspired polymer nanocomposites for tissue engineering applications,2014,Parisa Pooyan,,,,,,Increasing emphasis has been placed on the use of renewable resources. on decreased reliance on petroleum in order to better utilize global energy needs. Biological structures available in nature have been a constant inspiration to the design and fabrication of the new line of functional biomaterials whose unique phenomena can be exploited in novel applications. In tissue engineering for example. a natural biomimetic material with close resemblance to the profile features existed in a native extracellular matrix could provide a temporary functional platform to regulate and control cellular interactions at a molecular level and to subsequently direct a tissue regeneration. However. the lack of rigidity of natural materials typically limits their mass production. One promising approach to address this shortcoming is to introduce a biomimetic composite material reinforced by high purity nanofibers found in nature. As an attractive reinforcing filler phase. cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) offer exceptional properties such as high aspect ratio. large interface area. and significant mechanical performance. As such. CNWs could integrate a viable nanofibrous porous candidate. resulting in superior structural diversity and functional versatility. Inspired by the fascinating properties of cellulose and its derivatives. we have designed two bio-inspired nanocomposite materials reinforced with CNWs in this work.

1158840,Fabrication of a Bioinspired Cellulose-based Composite with Biocompatible Surface as a Potential Scaffold in Vascular Tissue Engineering,,Parisa Pooyan and Luke P Brewster and Rina Tannenbaum and Hamid Garmestani,,,,,,Methods: In our initial design. cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) were embedded in a matrix of cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) to fabricate a fully bio-based scaffold possessing a controlled biodegradability. 3D porosity. and non-acidic byproducts. To ensure uniform distribution. CNWs were delicately extracted from a multi-stage process including: a rigorous acid hydrolysis under controlled temperature. a repeated cycles of ultracentrifuge followed by a few minutes of ultrasonication. and a multiple dialysis exchange against distilled water to obtain a neutral aqueous suspension of CNWs with a pH near 6-7. Then. the suspension was gently freeze-dried and delicately dispersed in acetone prior to mixing with the matrices to reduce the hydroxyl group interactions and improve the quality of nanowhisker dispersion within the medium. This technique notably reduced the agglomeration of the CNWs while preserved the nature of the nanofibers without using toxic chemicals. In our current design. we have developed a collagen-reinforced scaffold by welldispersed nano-sized cellulose whiskers to effectively enhance the mechanical/thermal stability of collagen and to better mimic the morphology and profile features existed in the ECM of a human vessel.Results: Comparable to carbon nanotubes or Kevlar.

For the samples exhibiting exchange coupling. both the remanence ratio and coercive squareness increase.,True,y1TGPNoAAAAJ:OR75R8vi5nAC,199,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1467976,8187536029792071650,/scholar?cites=8187536029792071650,,https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/27088/2002-16a-APL.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore the process of attributing every single spike to a particular neuron. called spike sorting. is particularly important in electrophysiological data analysis. This task however is greatly complicated because of numerous factors. Bursts or fast changes in ion channel activation or deactivation can cause a large variability of spike waveforms. Another considerable source of uncertainties results from noise caused by firing of nearby neurons. Movement of electrodes and external electrical noise from the environment also hamper the spike sorting.

The problem is formulated to find the minimum number of cameras of different types and their best configurations to maximise the coverage of the monitored workplace such that the given set of target points of interest are each k-covered with a predefined minimum spatial resolution. Since the problem is NP-complete. and even NP-hard to approximate. a novel method based on Simulated Annealing is presented to solve the optimisation problem. A new neighbourhood generation function is proposed to handle the discrete nature of the problem. The visual coverage is modelled using realistic and coherent assumptions of camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters making it suitable for many real world camera based applications.

Studies have shown that these neuropathies are the result of significant death of neuronal progenitor cells in the central nervous system of the embryo. targeted by the virus. Although cell death via apoptosis is well acknowledged. little is known about possible pathogenic cellular mechanisms triggering cell death in neurons. We used in vitro embryonic mouse primary neuron cultures to study possible upstream cellular mechanisms of cell death. Neuronal networks were grown on microelectrode array and electrical activity was recorded at different times post Zika virus infection. In addition to this method. we used confocal microscopy and Q-PCR techniques to observe morphological and molecular changes after infection. Zika virus infection of mouse primary neurons triggers an early spiking excitation of neuron cultures. followed by dramatic loss of this activity. Using NMDA receptor antagonist. we show that this excitotoxicity mechanism. likely via glutamate. could also contribute to the observed nervous system defects in human embryos and could open new perspective regarding the causes of adult neuropathies.

Vector monitoring often requires fecundity estimation by counting eggs laid by female mosquitoes. Traditionally. manual data analyses have been used but this requires a lot of effort and is the methods are prone to errors. An easy tool to assess the number of eggs laid would facilitate experimentation and vector control operations. This study introduces a built-in software called ICount allowing automatic egg counting of the mosquito vector. Aedes aegypti. ICount egg estimation compared to manual counting is statistically equivalent. making the software effective for automatic and semi-automatic data analysis. This technique also allows rapid analysis compared to manual methods. Finally. the software has been used to assess p-cresol oviposition choices under laboratory conditions in order to test the system with different egg densities. ICount is a powerful tool for fast and precise egg count analysis. freeing experimenters from manual data processing. Software access is free and its user-friendly interface allows easy use by non-experts. Its efficiency has been tested in our laboratory with oviposition dual choices of Aedes aegypti females.

Simulated Dutch natural gas was used as the fuel to produce a flame closely matching those in which a wide range of previous investigations. both experimental and modelling. have been performed.

The influence of fuel type. equivalence ratio. carrier gas. operating pressure and air jet velocity on the combustion stability and emissions are investigated. Ethanol. acetone and n-heptane are vaporised and carried to the combustor using either nitrogen or air. It is found that the combustion stability is highly dependent on fuel type. with n-heptane being the most unstable due to its fast ignition under all high-pressure conditions studied. Measured CO emissions emitted from all fuels are very low except when the equivalence ratio approaches the lean extinction limit. and this effect is not dependent on the pressure.

Therefore many flames of practical significance are strongly radiating. Under these conditions. the coupling between the turbulence. chemistry and radiative heat transfer processes is significant. making it necessary to obtain simultaneous measurement of controlling parameters. These environments are also particularly challenging for laser-based measurements. since soot and other particles increase the interferences to the signal and the attenuation of the beam.

The ability to image temperature using the two-line atomic fluorescence (TLAF) technique is demonstrated. Previous TLAF theory is extended from linear excitation into the nonlinear fluence regime. Nonlinear regime two-line atomic fluorescence (NTLAF) provides superior signal and reduces single-shot uncertainty from 250 K for conventional TLAF down to 100 K. NTLAF is shown to resolve the temperature profile across the stoichiometric envelope for hydrogen. ethylene. and natural gas flames. with deviation from thermocouple measurements not exceeding 100 K. and typically ≲30 K.

It is found experimentally that large-scale vortices and flame stretch can lead to spatial thinning and a decrease in OH concentration. This reduction in OH is described as a weakening of the reaction zone. Accompanying reaction zone weakening is also an increase in H2CO levels. The reduction in reaction rates is most noticeable at low oxidant stream O2 levels. The heated and low oxygen oxidant conditions typify those of moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion.

Photographs and imaging of OH* chemiluminescence reveal a distinctive flame structure when ethanol carried by air burns in a 3% O2 coflow (typical of MILD combustion). differing from that at higher oxygen levels. In comparison to flames carried by air in a 9% O2 coflow. the spatial gradient and the peak in the OH* signal profile are significantly reduced in the 3% O2 coflow. indicating a more uniform distribution of heat release and temperature. The use of N2 as a carrier gas renders the OH* profile for the 6% O2 coflow case similar to that of flames carried by air in the 3% O2 coflow.

It has been observed that increasing the temperature and/or oxygen concentration in the coflow can lead to an increase in flame liftoff height. The paper isolates the role of chemistry. and in particular flame intermediates. on the observed phenomenon with a view to better understand how the behaviour changes over a range of conditions. A descriptive theory for this behaviour is proposed. which is based on the well-established theory that a build-up of radicals and intermediate species is responsible for autoignition of these flames.

The probability of energy change seems less important in this respect. In the light of this we suggest a model for RT in which the probability of AM change is calculated directly and present a formalism for this purpose. We demonstrate that such a calculation leads to an exponential‐like fall of RT probabilities with transferred AM. a consequence of the radial dependence of the repulsive part of the intermolecular potential. Thus in this AM model. the exponential gap law has a simple physical origin. The AM model we describe may be used as the basis of an inversion routine through which it is possible to convert RT data into a probability density of the repulsive anisotropy.

Particle temperature during the combustion was measured by two-color pyrometry. A calculation method was developed to determine the K release flux across the plume based on LIBS measurement and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. For all the 4 particle sizes. the temporal release rate of K showed a peak during devolatilization. a monotonous increase during char combustion and a monotonous decrease during the ash stage. It is found that the cumulative fraction of released K was below 4% in the devolatilization stage and ∼20% in the char combustion stage.

Here. a 5-kWel xenon-arc solar simulator and natural gas were used as the energy sources. while the combustion mode was operated in the Moderate or Intense Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion regime to offer low NOx emissions and good heat transfer. The thermal efficiency. heat losses. heat flux distribution within the cavity and pollutant emissions are reported for the solar-only. combustion-only and mixed-modes of operation. The thermal performance was found to be similar in all modes of …,True,6UwcoUoAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626191830713X,18135997325327155297,/scholar?cites=18135997325327155297,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alfonso_Chinnici/publication/325103130_Experimental_demonstration_of_the_hybrid_solar_receiver_combustor/links/5b2854a1aca2727335b6f7b5/Experimental-demonstration-of-the-hybrid-solar-receiver-combustor.pdf,0,0,0
1158981,Ignition features of methane and ethylene fuel-blends in hot and diluted coflows,2017,MJ Evans and A Chinnici and PR Medwell and J Ye,203,Fuel,,279-289,Elsevier,Turbulent flames in the moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion regime have previously exhibited less susceptibility to lift-off than conventional autoignitive flames in a jet-in-hot-coflow (JHC) burner. This has been demonstrated through laser-based diagnostics and examination of CH* chemiluminescence. New experimental observations are presented of turbulent flames of natural gas. ethylene and blends of the two fuels. in coflows with temperatures from 1250–1385 K and oxygen concentrations from 3–11% (vol./vol.). Zero- and one-dimensional simulations. as well as turbulent flame modelling. are used to explain the trends seen experimentally with different coflows and fuels. Numerical simulations using simplified batch reactors and opposed-flow flames demonstrate that blending of methane and ethylene fuels is most significant near 1100 K. Near this temperature. pure ethylene exhibits a …,True,6UwcoUoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236117305392,948691889862070785,/scholar?cites=948691889862070785,,,0,0,0

It aims to investigate the differences between performance in these two modes of operation and to reduce the uncertainties of an analytical model of the device developed previously for the techno-economic assessments. The influence of the dominant geometrical parameters. burner configuration and flux distribution of the incident solar radiation on the thermal efficiency. heat losses. heat transfer mechanisms and heat flux distribution within the cavity was investigated with a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the device. For the solar-only mode of operation. the model employs a Monte-Carlo ray tracing approach to calculate the heat flux distribution incident on the pipes containing the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and the overall thermal efficiency …,True,6UwcoUoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,18,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X1730155X,5675051670528251468,/scholar?cites=5675051670528251468,,https://www.academia.edu/download/55776023/1-s2.0-S0038092X1730155X-main.pdf,0,0,0

The experimental and numerical results confirmed that the SEVR generates a well-established vortex flow pattern. which approaches a forced vortex near to the injection plane and a combined (free and forced) vortex in the main body of the cavity. The SEVR also features a reversed flow in the vortex core region and a complex precessing vortex core (PVC) structure. which is stronger in both the inlet and outlet regions of the cavity. The primary mechanism for particle deposition was identified as a primary recirculation zone near to the aperture that transports fluid from the main cavity through the …,True,6UwcoUoAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,16,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X16305527,9921723826041713479,/scholar?cites=9921723826041713479,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alfonso_Chinnici/publication/310426592_Experimental_and_numerical_investigation_of_the_flow_characteristics_within_a_Solar_Expanding-Vortex_Particle_Receiver-Reactor/links/584df5bf08aed95c25032c18/Experimental-and-numerical-investigation-of-the-flow-characteristics-within-a-Solar-Expanding-Vortex-Particle-Receiver-Reactor.pdf,0,0,0
