They were designed on the basis of partial enzyme amino acid sequences. The gene was found to encode a 882 residues polypeptide chain with a deduced molecular mass of about 100 kDa. By comparison with other archaeal genes. putative regulatory sites were identified in the gene-flanking regions.

Here. we report that two Y‐family DNA polymerases of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus strains P1 and P2 incorporate oxidized dNTPs into nascent DNA in an erroneous manner: the polymerases exclusively incorporate 8‐OH‐dGTP opposite adenine in the template. and incorporate 2‐OH‐dATP opposite guanine more efficiently than opposite thymine.

The lectin pathway of the complement system activates after infection and oxidative stress on endothelial cells generating active serine proteases: MASP-1 and MASP-2. Our aim was to study whether activated MASPs are able to digest HK to release BK. Initially we were trying to find potential new substrates of MASP-1 in human plasma by differential gel electrophoresis. and we identified kininogen cleavage products by this proteomic approach. As a control. MASP-2 was included in the study in addition to MASP-1 and kallikrein. The proteolytic cleavage of HK by MASPs was followed by SDS-PAGE. and BK release was detected by HPLC. We showed that MASP-1 was able to cleave HK resulting in BK production. MASP-2 could also cleave HK but could not release BK. The cleavage pattern of MASPs is similar but not strictly identical to that of kallikrein.

Plant defensins are encoded by small multigene families and are expressed in various plant tissues. but are best characterized in seeds. They are typically produced as preproteins. however. a small subset are produced as larger precursors with C-terminal prodomains. To date. the three-dimensional solution structures of seven seed- and two floral-derived defensins have been elucidated by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Despite limited amino acid sequence identities. these defensins have comparable global folds with features that are characteristic of the cysteine-stabilized αβ (CSαβ) motif.

Many CAPs act at the plasma membrane of cells leading to membrane destabilization and permeabilization. In this study. we describe a novel cell lysis mechanism for fungal and tumor cells by the plant defensin NaD1 that acts via direct binding to the plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4.5-bisphosphate (PIP2). We determined the crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP2 complex. revealing a striking oligomeric arrangement comprising seven dimers of NaD1 that cooperatively bind the anionic headgroups of 14 PIP2 molecules through a unique ‘cationic grip’ configuration. Site-directed mutagenesis of NaD1 confirms that PIP2-mediated oligomerization is important for fungal and tumor cell permeabilization. These observations identify an innate recognition system by NaD1 for direct binding of PIP2 that permeabilizes cells via a novel membrane disrupting mechanism.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01808.001,True,lL4E7YAAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,122,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01808,4316312507213031485,/scholar?cites=4316312507213031485,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01808.pdf,0,0,0

Several BTB domain structures have been experimentally determined. revealing a highly conserved core structure. We surveyed the protein architecture. genomic distribution and sequence conservation of BTB domain proteins in 17 fully sequenced eukaryotes. The BTB domain is typically found as a single copy in proteins that contain only one or two other types of domain. and this defines the BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF). BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK). voltage-gated potassium channel T1 (T1-Kv). MATH-BTB. BTB-NPH3 and BTB-BACK-PHR (BBP) families of proteins. among others. In contrast. the Skp1 and ElonginC proteins consist almost exclusively of the core BTB fold. There are numerous lineage-specific expansions of BTB proteins. as seen by the relatively large number of BTB-ZF and BBK proteins in vertebrates. MATH-BTB proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans. and BTB-NPH3 proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Using the structural homology between Skp1 and the PLZF BTB homodimer. we present a model of a BTB-Cul3 SCF-like E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that shows that the BTB dimer or the T1 tetramer is compatible in this complex. Despite widely divergent sequences. the BTB fold is structurally well conserved.

We found a clade of polyspecific receptors. including one that is sensitive to picomolar concentrations of strigolactone. A crystal structure of a highly sensitive strigolactone receptor from Striga revealed a larger binding pocket than that of the Arabidopsis receptor. which could explain the increased range of strigolactone sensitivity.

Legionella pneumophila. an intracellular pathogen that can cause a severe pneumonia in humans. is able to modulate autophagy through the action of effector proteins that are translocated into the host cell by the pathogen’s Dot/Icm type IV secretion system. Many of these effectors share structural and sequence similarity with eukaryotic proteins. Indeed. phylogenetic analyses have indicated their acquisition by horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic host. Here we report that L. pneumophila translocates the effector protein sphingosine-1 phosphate lyase (LpSpl) to target the host sphingosine biosynthesis and to curtail autophagy.

The mice drawer system (MDS) program. sponsored by Italian Space Agency. for the first time aimed to investigate the consequences of long-term (91 days) exposure to microgravity in mice within the International Space Station. Muscle atrophy was present indistinctly in all fiber types of the slow-twitch soleus muscle. but was only slightly greater than that observed after 20 days of spaceflight. Myosin heavy chain analysis indicated a concomitant slow-to-fast transition of soleus. In addition. spaceflight induced translocation of sarcolemmal nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS1) into the cytosol in soleus but not in the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Most of the sarcolemmal ion channel subunits were up-regulated. more in soleus than EDL. whereas Ca2+-activated K+ channels were down-regulated. consistent with the phenotype transition. Gene expression of the atrophy-related ubiquitin-ligases was up-regulated in both spaceflown soleus and EDL muscles. whereas autophagy genes were in the control range. Muscle-specific IGF-1 and interleukin-6 were down-regulated in soleus but up-regulated in EDL. Also. various stress-related genes were up-regulated in spaceflown EDL. not in soleus.

The computational domain includes the entire submerged entry nozzle (SEN) starting from the tundish exit and the complete mold region. The results show a large. elongated recirculation zone in the SEN below the slide gate. The simulation also shows that the flow exiting the nozzle ports has a complex time-evolving pattern with strong cross-stream velocities. which is also seen in the experiments. With a few exceptions. which are probably due to uncertainties in the measurements. the computed flow field agrees with the measurements.

The light chain-binding region of myosin is thought to act as a lever arm that amplifies movements near the catalytic site. This model has been challenged by findings that myosin VI takes larger steps along actin filaments than early interpretations of its structure seem to allow.

Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a disorder of intracellular transport where glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and cholesterol accumulate in endosomal compartments. The mechanisms of altered intracellular trafficking are not known but may involve the mistargeting and disrupted function of proteins associated with GSL membrane microdomains.

Ceramide. the central molecule in cellular glycosphingolipid metabolism. has recently been identified as an important mediator of this process. Indeed. one of the events elicited by application of many cytotoxic drugs is an accumulation of this lipid. Treatment failure in cancer chemotherapy is largely attributable to multidrug resistance. in which tumor cells are typically cross-resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents.

Mutations that either inhibit or stimulate inclusion of the upstream alternative exon deeply affect inclusion of the downstream one. However. similar mutations at the downstream alternative exon have little effect on the upstream one. This polar effect is promoter specific and is enhanced by inhibition of transcriptional elongation. Consistently. cells from mutant mice with either constitutive or null inclusion of a fibronectin alternative exon revealed coordination with a second alternative splicing region. located far downstream.

Despite conservation of its basic structure and function. autoinhibition by one of its rotary stalk subunits occurs in bacteria and chloroplasts but not in mitochondria. The crystal structure of the ATP synthase catalytic complex (F 1) from Escherichia coli described here reveals the structural basis for this inhibition. The C-terminal domain of subunit ɛ adopts a heretofore unknown. highly extended conformation that inserts deeply into the central cavity of the enzyme and engages both rotor and stator subunits in extensive contacts that are incompatible with functional rotation. As a result. the three catalytic subunits are stabilized in a set of conformations and rotational positions distinct from previous F 1 structures.,True,1Y9rUO8AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,217,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb.2058.pdf?origin=ppub,352849081722871984,/scholar?cites=352849081722871984,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3109198/,0,0,0

A βD380C/γC87 crosslinked hybrid F1 having epitope-tagged βD380C subunits (βflag) exclusively in the two noncrosslinked positions was bound to Fo in F1-depleted membranes. After reduction of the β–γ crosslink. a brief exposure to conditions for ATP synthesis followed by reoxidation resulted in a significant amount of βflag appearing in the β–γ crosslinked product. Such a reorientation of γC87 relative to the three β subunits can only occur through subunit rotation. Rotation was inhibited when proton transport through Fo was blocked or when ADP and Pi were omitted.

Here we review earlier evidence both for and against subunit rotation and then discuss our most recent studies using reversible intersubunit disulfide cross-links to test for rotation. We conclude that the γ subunit of F1 rotates relative to the surrounding catalytic subunits during catalytic turnover by both soluble F1 and membrane-bound F0F1.

Bacterial F-type ATP synthase is the target of a new. FDA-approved antibiotic to combat drug-resistant tuberculosis. Understanding bacteria-specific auto-inhibition of ATP synthase by the C-terminal domain of subunit ε could provide a new means to target the enzyme for discovery of antibacterial drugs. The C-terminal domain of ε undergoes a dramatic conformational change when the enzyme transitions between the active and inactive states. and catalytic-site ligands can influence which of ε's conformations is predominant.

The mechanism-of-action of this Zn 2+-metalloenzyme has been the subject of considerable controversy over the past 50 years.

1027264,Evolution of selenium utilization traits,2005,Héctor Romero and Yan Zhang and Vadim N Gladyshev and Gustavo Salinas,6,Genome biology,8,1-11,BioMed Central,The essential trace element selenium is used in a wide variety of biological processes. Selenocysteine (Sec). the 21st amino acid. is co-translationally incorporated into a restricted set of proteins. It is encoded by an UGA codon with the help of tRNASec (SelC). Sec-specific elongation factor (SelB) and a cis-acting mRNA structure (SECIS element). In addition. Sec synthase (SelA) and selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) are involved in the biosynthesis of Sec on the tRNASec. Selenium is also found in the form of 2-selenouridine. a modified base present in the wobble position of certain tRNAs. whose synthesis is catalyzed by YbbB using selenophosphate as a precursor. We analyzed completely sequenced genomes for occurrence of the selA. B. C. D and ybbB genes. We found that selB and selC are gene signatures for the Sec-decoding trait. However. selD is also present in organisms that do not utilize Sec. and shows association with either selA. B. C and/or ybbB. Thus. selD defines the overall selenium utilization. A global species map of Sec-decoding and 2-selenouridine synthesis traits is provided based on the presence/absence pattern of selenium-utilization genes. The phylogenies of these genes were inferred and compared to organismal phylogenies. which identified horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events involving both traits. These results provide evidence for the ancient origin of these traits. their independent maintenance. and a highly dynamic evolutionary process that can be explained as the result of speciation. differential gene loss and HGT.

Pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members should function in harmony for the regulation of the apoptosis machinery. and their relative levels are critical for cell fate. Any mechanism breaking down this harmony by changing the relative levels of these antagonistic proteins could contribute to many diseases. including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

Overexpression of Mcl-1. a potent antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family. has also been reported in cholangiocarcinomas.

Deoxycholate increased cellular Mcl-1 protein in a concentration-dependent manner. The deoxycholate-mediated increase of cellular Mcl-1 protein was blocked equally by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or an EGFR-neutralizing antibody.

The protein is unusual among family members in that it has a very short half-life of 2–3 h. In this report. we show that sodium salicylate (at 10 mM) greatly enhances the rate at which neutrophils undergo apoptosis and. in parallel. greatly accelerates the turnover rate of Mcl-1. decreasing its half-life to only 90 min. Whereas constitutive and GM-CSF-modified Mcl-1 turnover is regulated by the proteasome. the accelerated sodium salicylate-induced Mcl-1 turnover is mediated largely via caspases. Sodium salicylate resulted in rapid activation of caspase-3. -8. -9. and -10. and salicylate-accelerated Mcl-1 turnover was partly blocked by caspase inhibitors.

The consensus term creates and maintains the desired formation shape. while the CAT avoids the collision. During the collision avoidance. the potential function based CAT makes the agents repel from each other.

The peroxide value (PV). which depends on temperature. time and light. measures the extent of primary oxidation of oils (rancidification). Rancidity of oils can produce potentially toxic compounds associated with long-term health effects such as neurological disorders. heart and cancer. Oils with a high degree of unsaturation are highly susceptible to oxidation as compared to saturated oils. Moreover vegetable oils become rancid much faster than animal oils. Oils also become susceptible to microbial rancidity. in which microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast use their enzymes to break down chemical structures in the oil. leading to the production of unwanted odors and flavors. To investigate oxidative initial rancidity of oils the PV value is determined. Twenty different oils were selected and subjected to two different frying temperatures: 130 0 C and 170 0 C. This change from 130 0 C to 170 0 C using same frying time (20 minutes) was noticed to cause changes in PV of pure oil. though in many cases (except Seasons corn oil. Season canola. Kausar banaspati. Dalda Groundnut) the PV value was constant after 130 0 C.

DNA replication is generally followed by DNA mismatch repair (MMR). MMR starts when a MutS homolog recognizes a mismatch and undergoes an ATP-dependent transformation to an elusive sliding clamp state. How this transient state promotes MutL homolog recruitment and activation of repair is unclear. Here we present a crystal structure of the MutS/MutL complex using a site-specifically crosslinked complex and examine how large conformational changes lead to activation of MutL. The structure captures MutS in the sliding clamp conformation. where tilting of the MutS subunits across each other pushes DNA into a new channel. and reorientation of the connector domain creates an interface for MutL with both MutS subunits. Our work explains how the sliding clamp promotes loading of MutL onto DNA. to activate downstream effectors. We thus elucidate a crucial mechanism that ensures that MMR is initiated only after detection of a DNA mismatch.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06744.001,True,iYB1URkAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,69,https://elifesciences.org/articles/06744,12329816770737947632,/scholar?cites=12329816770737947632,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/06744.pdf,0,0,0

Although metformin can act on cells autonomously to inhibit tumor growth. the doses of metformin that inhibit proliferation in tissue culture are much higher than what has been described in vivo. Here. we show that the environment drastically alters sensitivity to metformin and other complex I inhibitors. We find that complex I supports proliferation by regenerating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+. and metformin’s anti-proliferative effect is due to loss of NAD+/NADH homeostasis and inhibition of aspartate biosynthesis. However. complex I is only one of many inputs that determines the cellular NAD+/NADH ratio. and dependency on complex I is dictated by the activity of other pathways that affect NAD+ regeneration and aspartate levels.

It has been shown that F420 has a direct and important role in archaeal energy metabolism whereas the role of F420 in mycobacterial metabolism has only begun to be uncovered in the last few years. It has been suggested that cofactor F420 has a role in the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. the causative agent of tuberculosis. In the absence of a commercial source for F420. M. smegmatis has previously been used to provide this cofactor for studies of the F420-dependent proteins from mycobacterial species. Three proteins have been shown to be involved in the F420 biosynthesis in Mycobacteria and three other proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in F420 metabolism. Here we report the over-expression of all of these proteins in M. smegmatis and testing of their importance for F420 production. The results indicate that co–expression of the F420 biosynthetic proteins can give rise to a much higher F420 production level. This was achieved by designing and preparing a new T7 promoter–based co-expression shuttle vector. A combination of co–expression of the F420 biosynthetic proteins and fine-tuning of the culture media has enabled us to achieve F420 production levels of up to 10 times higher compared with the wild type M. smegmatis strain.

Using radiolabeled probes. we have identified a pheromone binding protein that is abundant in the mucus of the trunk; this protein is homologous to a class of lipocalins known as odorant binding proteins (OBPs). To test five previously proposed roles for the OBP in chemosensory perception. we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant of the OBP−pheromone complex. as well as the association and dissociation rates. Using a mathematical model in conjunction with experimental data. we suggest that the binding and release of the pheromone by the OBP are too slow for the OBP to function in transporting the pheromone through the mucus that covers the olfactory sensory epithelium.

However. resistance is rarely considered in drug development and may inadvertently be facilitated. as many designed inhibitors contact residues that can mutate to confer resistance. without significantly impairing function. Contemporary drug design often ignores the detailed atomic basis for function and primarily focuses on disrupting the target's activity. which is necessary but not sufficient for developing a robust drug. In this study. we examine the impact of drug-resistant mutations in HIV-1 protease on substrate recognition and demonstrate that most primary active site mutations do not extensively contact substrates. but are critical to inhibitor binding.

From this structural understanding the molecular basis for drug resistance in HIV-1 protease can be elucidated. Selected mutations in response to therapy and diversity between clades in HIV-1 protease have altered the shape of the active site. potentially altered the dynamics and even altered the sequence of the cleavage sites in the Gag polyprotein. All of these interdependent changes act in synergy to confer drug resistance while simultaneously maintaining the fitness of the virus.

One of the first drug-resistant mutations to arise in the protease. particularly in patients receiving indinavir or ritonavir treatment. is V82A. which compromises the binding of these and other inhibitors but allows the virus to remain viable. To probe this drug resistance. we solved the crystal structures of three natural substrates and two commercial drugs in complex with an inactive drug-resistant mutant (D25N/V82A) HIV-1 protease. Through structural analysis and comparison of the protein-ligand interactions. we found that Val82 interacts more closely with the drugs than with the natural substrate peptides.

The fast removal of H2O2 by antioxidant enzymes is able to generate a gradient if H2O2 is produced in a different compartment from that containing the enzymes (Antunes. F.. and Cadenas. E.

In this work. we extended these studies and tested whether an active regulation of biomembranes permeability characteristics is part of the cell response to oxidative stress. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model. we showed that: (a) H2O2 gradients across the plasma membrane are formed upon exposure to external H2O2; (b) there is a correlation between the magnitude of the gradients and the resistance to H2O2;(c) there is not a correlation between the intracellular capacity to remove H2O2 and the resistance to H2O2; (d) the plasma membrane permeability to …,True,WCYOtnIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,180,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818446017,16067793087226312216,/scholar?cites=16067793087226312216,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818446017,0,0,0

Ferrous iron (Fe(II)) was abundant in the primordial ocean until the oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere led to its widespread oxidation and precipitation. This change of iron bioavailability likely put selective pressure on the evolution of life. This element is essential to most extant life forms and is an important cofactor in many redox-active proteins involved in a number of vital pathways. In addition. iron plays a central role in many environments as an energy source for some microorganisms. This review is focused on Fe(II) oxidation. The fact that the ability to oxidize Fe(II) is widely distributed in Bacteria and Archaea and in a number of quite different biotopes suggests that the dissimilatory Fe(II) oxidation is an ancient energy metabolism.

Neither of these sensors works sufficiently in the absence of the other. making the simultaneous presence of both stress conditions a necessary requirement for Hsp33's full activation.

Activation of Hsp33 is triggered by the oxidative unfolding of its own redox-sensor domain. making Hsp33 a member of a recently discovered class of chaperones that require partial unfolding for full chaperone activity. Here we address the long-standing question of how chaperones recognize client proteins. We show that Hsp33 uses its own intrinsically disordered regions to discriminate between unfolded and partially structured folding intermediates. Binding to secondary structure elements in client proteins stabilizes Hsp33's intrinsically disordered regions. and this stabilization appears to mediate Hsp33's high affinity for structured folding intermediates.

In this study. it is demonstrated that TorD is required to maintain the integrity of the twin-arginine signal sequence of the cytoplasmic TorA precursors. In the absence of TorD. 35 out of the 39 amino acid residues of the signal peptide were lost and the proteolysis of the N-terminal extremity of TorA precursors was not prevented by the molybdenum cofactor insertion. We thus propose that one of the main roles of TorD is to protect the TorA signal peptide to allow translocation of the enzyme by the TAT system.,True,bcCVWzoAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,60,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0502646X,1133886188588956764,/scholar?cites=1133886188588956764,,,0,0,0

In a complex architecture of nested. zonated lobules. the liver consists of approximately 80 % hepatocytes and 20 % non-parenchymal cells. the latter being involved in a secondary phase that may dramatically aggravate the initial damage. Hepatotoxicity. as well as hepatic metabolism. is controlled by a set of nuclear receptors (including PXR. CAR. HNF-4α. FXR. LXR. SHP. VDR and PPAR) and signaling pathways. When isolating liver cells. some pathways are activated. e.g.. the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. whereas others are silenced (e.g. HNF-4α). resulting in up- and downregulation of hundreds of genes.

In contrast to previous reports. Pc B-1 cells did not show RAG1 expression in adolescent or elderly mice. RAG1 expression was not induced in Pc B-1 cells in vivo after stimulation by oral or i.p. administration of LPS.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes genetic adaptation resulting in progressively increased persistence and the generation of adaptive colony morphotypes. This includes small colony variants (SCVs). auto-aggregative. hyper-adherent cells whose appearance correlates with poor lung function and persistence of infection. The SCV morphotype is strongly linked to elevated levels of cyclic-di-GMP. a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates the transition between motile and sessile. cooperative lifestyles. A genetic screen in PA01 for SCV-related loci identified the yfiBNR operon. encoding a tripartite signaling module that regulates c-di-GMP levels in P. aeruginosa. Subsequent analysis determined that YfiN is a membrane-integral diguanylate cyclase whose activity is tightly controlled by YfiR. a small periplasmic protein. and the OmpA/Pal-like outer-membrane lipoprotein YfiB. Exopolysaccharide synthesis was identified as the principal downstream target for YfiBNR. with increased production of Pel and Psl exopolysaccharides responsible for many characteristic SCV behaviors. An yfi-dependent SCV was isolated from the sputum of a CF patient. Consequently. the effect of the SCV morphology on persistence of infection was analyzed in vitro and in vivo using the YfiN-mediated SCV as a representative strain.

While whole genome sequencing has opened up the analysis of genetic changes occurring during long-term infections. the identification and characterization of adaptive traits is often obscured by a lack of knowledge of the underlying molecular processes. Our research addresses the role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa small colony variant (SCV) morphotypes in long-term infections. In the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. the appearance of SCVs correlates with a prolonged persistence of infection and poor lung function. Formation of P. aeruginosa SCVs is linked to increased levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP. Our previous work identified the YfiBNR system as a key regulator of the SCV phenotype. The effector of this tripartite signaling module is the membrane bound diguanylate cyclase YfiN. Through a combination of genetic and biochemical analyses we first outline the mechanistic principles of YfiN regulation in detail. In particular. we identify a number of activating mutations in all three components of the Yfi regulatory system. YfiBNR is shown to function via tightly controlled competition between allosteric binding sites on the three Yfi proteins; a novel regulatory mechanism that is apparently widespread among periplasmic signaling systems in bacteria.

1027534,Hydroxycinnamic acid antioxidants: an electrochemical overview,2013,José Teixeira and Alexandra Gaspar and E Manuela Garrido and Jorge Garrido and Fernanda Borges,2013,,,,Hindawi,Hydroxycinnamic acids (such as ferulic. caffeic. sinapic. and p-coumaric acids) are a group of compounds highly abundant in food that may account for about one-third of the phenolic compounds in our diet. Hydroxycinnamic acids have gained an increasing interest in health because they are known to be potent antioxidants. These compounds have been described as chain-breaking antioxidants acting through radical scavenging activity. that is related to their hydrogen or electron donating capacity and to the ability to delocalize/stabilize the resulting phenoxyl radical within their structure. The free radical scavenger ability of antioxidants can be predicted from standard one-electron potentials. Thus. voltammetric methods have often been applied to characterize a diversity of natural and synthetic antioxidants essentially to get an insight into their mechanism and also as an important tool for the rational design of new and potent antioxidants. The structure-property-activity relationships (SPARs) correlations already established for this type of compounds suggest that redox potentials could be considered a good measure of antioxidant activity and an accurate guideline on the drug discovery and development process. Due to its magnitude in the antioxidant field. the electrochemistry of hydroxycinnamic acid-based antioxidants is reviewed highlighting the structure-property-activity relationships (SPARs) obtained so far.,True,kKC7Ej0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,255,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/251754/abs/,1190777962391673263,/scholar?cites=1190777962391673263,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/251754/abs/,0,0,0

The SAR data indicate that chromone derivatives with substituents in position 3 of γ-pyrone nucleus act preferably as MAO-B inhibitors. with IC50 values in the nanomolar to micromolar range. Almost all chromone 3-carboxamides display selectivity toward MAO-B. Identical substitutions on position 2 of γ-pyrone nucleus result in complete loss of activity in both isoforms (chromones 2–12 except 3 and 5). Notably. chromone (19) exhibits an MAO-B IC50 of 63 nM. greater than 1000-fold selectivity over MAO-A. and behaves as a quasi-reversible inhibitor.

Control animals received the control diet containing starch while fructose-fed animals received a fructose-enriched diet (greater than 60 percent of total calories). Fructose and taurine rats received the fructose diet and two percent taurine solution to drink. Control and taurine rats received the control diet and two percent taurine solution. After the treatment period of 30 days. insulin resistance index. by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was determined. The levels of lipid peroxidation markers. the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants status in heart and kidney tissues were measured.Results: Fructose rats showed high values of HOMA. increased lipid peroxidation and impaired antioxidant status. Taurine treatment to fructose rats attenuated the increased lipid peroxidation. enhanced the levels of antioxidants and improved insulin sensitivity.Conclusion: Inhibition of peroxidation markers and upregulation of antioxidant activity in rat tissues by taurine signify the potential utility of taurine as an adjunct in treatment of insulin resistance.,True,W7k4WI0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,138,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.560.436&rep=rep1&type=pdf,18028453926938502500,/scholar?cites=18028453926938502500,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.560.436&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Differentiation is fuelled by asymmetric division of stem cells that reside in normally quiescent niches in the resting gland in response to pregnancy-associated hormones. Loss of regulation of stem cells is believed to underlie some breast cancers. This process is poorly understood in humans since it is difficult to extract stem cells from the lactating gland. We have identified a p63-positive population in breastmilk that proliferates and differentiates into at least two separate mammary lineages in culture. Nuclear translocation of p63 coincides with expression of the cell-cycle arrest protein 14-3-3σ (Sigma) and precedes differentiation. Transient down-regulation of Sigma promotes maintenance of the p63-positive population without affecting normal differentiation. We propose that p63-postive cells from breastmilk …,True,UoSXO_cAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,37,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cc.10.2.14470,13547496855478348781,/scholar?cites=13547496855478348781,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/cc.10.2.14470,0,0,0

However. their broad applications in practical settings have been hampered by the low efficiency of H2O2 decomposition. Here. we report that metal sulfides (MoS2. WS2. Cr2S3. CoS2. PbS. or ZnS) can serve as excellent co-catalysts to greatly increase the efficiency of H2O2 decomposition and significantly decrease the required dosage of H2O2 and Fe2+ in AOPs. Unsaturated S atoms on the surface of metal sulfides can capture protons to form H2S and expose metallic active sites with reductive properties to accelerate the rate-limiting step of Fe3+/Fe2+ conversion. The efficiency of AOPs involving co-catalysts can be further enhanced by visible-light illumination thanks to the sensitization of organic pollutants.

In that study. some clinical specimens were found to be positive for both types I‐ and II‐ fimA specific primers. likely due to the coexistence of two clonal types or a single clone of an unknown genotype in the samples. In the present study. we cloned a new variant of the fimA gene. designated as type Ib fimA. from P. gingivalis HG1691.

We report that folding efficiency of the Escherichia coli multidomain protein SufI can be severely perturbed by alterations in ribosome-mediated translational attenuation. Such alterations were achieved by global acceleration of the translation rate with tRNA excess in vitro or by synonymous substitutions to codons with highly abundant tRNAs both in vitro and in vivo.

In the ribosomal tunnel. the nascent peptide may establish local interactions and stabilize α-helical structures. Long-range contacts are more likely outside the ribosomes after release of larger segments of the nascent chain. Examples suggest that domains can attain native-like structure on the ribosome with and without population of folding intermediates. The co-translational folding is limited by the speed of the gradual extrusion of the nascent peptide which imposes conformational restraints on its folding landscape.

We have developed an algorithm to evaluate the relative rate of translation which allows large-scale comparisons of the non-uniform translation rate on the protein biogenesis. Using the complete genomes of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis we show that stretches of codons pairing to minor tRNAs form putative sites to locally attenuate translation; thereby the tendency is to cluster in near proximity whereas long contiguous stretches of slow-translating triplets are avoided. The presence of slow-translating segments positively correlates with the protein length irrespective of the protein abundance. The slow-translating clusters are predominantly located down-stream of the domain boundaries presumably to fine-tune translational accuracy with the folding fidelity of multidomain proteins. Translation attenuation patterns at highly structurally and functionally conserved domains are preserved across the species suggesting a concerted selective pressure on the codon selection and species-specific tRNA abundance in these regions.,True,rWtBLqYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,98,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005036,7181057594618054997,/scholar?cites=7181057594618054997,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005036,0,0,0

Unlike the well-studied translational responses to oxidative stress in eukaryotic systems. little is known regarding how prokaryotes respond rapidly to oxidative stress in terms of translation. In this study. we measured protein synthesis from the entire Escherichia coli proteome and found that protein synthesis was severely slowed down under oxidative stress. With unchanged translation initiation. this slowdown was caused by decreased translation elongation speed. We further confirmed by tRNA sequencing and qRT-PCR that this deceleration was caused by a global. enzymatic downregulation of almost all tRNA species shortly after exposure to oxidative agents.

Here. we present a systematic analysis of the tRNAome of Lactococcus lactis. Using the next‐generation sequencing approach. we identified 40 tRNAs which carry 16 different post‐transcriptional modifications as revealed by mass spectrometry analysis. While small modifications are located in the tRNA body. hypermodified nucleotides are mainly present in the anticodon loop. which through wobbling expand the decoding potential of the tRNAs. Using tRNA‐based microarrays. we also determined the dynamics in tRNA abundance upon changes in the growth rate and heterologous protein overexpression stress. With a fourfold increase in the growth rate. the relative abundance of tRNAs cognate to low abundance codons decrease. while the tRNAs cognate to major codons remain mostly …,True,rWtBLqYAAAAJ:5Y7y0xowK3MC,50,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mmi.12710,9590601840891455235,/scholar?cites=9590601840891455235,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mmi.12710,0,0,0

1027670,Adsorptive stratification in gels,1916,Samuel Clement Bradford,10,Biochemical Journal,2,169-175,Portland Press Ltd.,In a previous paper [Bradford. 1916] the author proposed the theory that the Liesegang phenomenon might be due to gradual adsorption of the solute in the gel by the growing precipitate. so that. the adjacent layer ofgel presently becoming exhausted of solute. the reacting substance would be able to diffuse further into the gel before commencing to form a fresh stratum of precipitate. Hatschek [1914] had proved that Ostwald's hypothesis of metastable solutions was not of generalapplication. Moreover experiments with gels containing additional quantities of the soluble produc'ts of the double decomposition. which had been assumed by some to play an essential part in the formation of the strata. showed no appreciable effect on their character or separation. The theory affords an explanation of the fact observed by Pringsheimn that diffusion takes place from the hypertonic into the hypotonic region. whether liquid or …,True,G9hB9vEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,28,https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-pdf/10/2/169/758975/bj0100169.pdf,4739143111627493730,/scholar?cites=4739143111627493730,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1258700/pdf/biochemj01198-0001.pdf,0,0,0
1027671,Complete documentation,1947,SC Bradford,159,,4029,105-106,Nature Publishing Group,THIS Conference is important historically. because it marks the beginning of a second stage in the progress of documentation. In the past. our main endeavour has been directed to bring about the collaboration of documentary agencies in the single task of making accessible the scattered records of thought and achievement. especially in science and technology. until to-day more decimally classified references are produced than different papers abstracted. But. as the result of statistical investigations. made in the main by the British National Section. we have come to see that this alone will not suffice to produce a tolerably complete index to the records of human endeavour. Half the records are overlooked by the existing abstracting arid indexing agencies. We need a means of covering all this literature. The means has been discovered. Its promotion has commenced. and this begins a second stage in our activities.,True,G9hB9vEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,27,https://www.nature.com/articles/159105a0,4047934750696219299,/scholar?cites=4047934750696219299,,,0,0,0
1027672,The documentary chaos,1953,Samuel C Bradford,,Documentation. London: Lockwood,,106,,Federation. has not yet penetrated into more than half the lump of documentary material. The condition of this un-leavened lump is described in the title of this chapter. Docu-mentalists have need to realise the position. before they can consent to join in improving it. The facts have been ascer-tained. These facts lead to a simple plan for bringing order out of disorder. This plan. which is described in the next chapter. has been adopted by the International Federation for Documentation. But. before the plan can be applied. documentalists have to be convinced that the facts are real and that the simple plan is workable. That is the object of this chapter. It is important to realize at the outset. as we have seen already. that the making of abstracts of scientific papers can be achieved only in two stages. In the first stage we endeavour to produce a digest of the main subjects treated in a paper. leaving the very special points of view. the individual com-pounds dealt with. or the details of the apparatus described. to be treated in the second stage. by the specialists themselves. or by special abstractors. or information officers. working for individual concerns.

Using mass spectrometry. we previously demonstrated four phosphorylated serines (Ser256. Ser261. Ser264. and Ser269) in the carboxyl-terminal tail of rat AQP2. Here. we used phospho-specific antibodies and protein mass spectrometry to investigate the roles of vasopressin and cyclic AMP in the regulation of phosphorylation at Ser269 and addressed the role of this site in AQP2 trafficking. The V2 receptor-specific vasopressin analog dDAVP increased Ser(P)269-AQP2 abundance more than 10-fold. but at a rate much slower than the corresponding increase in Ser256 phosphorylation.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed intense pS261 labeling of inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) from wild-type mice. while sections from AQP2 knockout animals showed a general absence of labeling.

Protein methylation plays a central role in both of these fields. as several different residues (Arg. Lys. Gln) are methylated in cells and methylation plays a central role in the “histone code” that regulates chromatin structure and impacts transcription. In some cases. a single lysine can be mono-. di-. or trimethylated. with different functional consequences for each of the three forms.

Upon binding estrogen. ER recruits coactivator complexes with histone acetyltransferase or methyltransferase activities to activate downstream target genes. In addition to histones. coactivators can modify ER itself and other proteins in the transactivation complex. Here. we show that ER is directly methylated at lysine 302 (K302) by the SET7 methyltransferase. SET7-mediated methylation stabilizes ER and is necessary for the efficient recruitment of ER to its target genes and for their transactivation. The SET7-ER complex structure reveals the molecular basis for ER peptide recognition and predicts that modifications or mutations of nearby residues would affect K302 methylation.

G9a and G9a-like protein (GLP) are euchromatin-associated methyltransferases that repress transcription by mono-and dimethylating histone H3 at Lys9 (H3K9). Here we demonstrate that the ankyrin repeat domains of G9a and GLP bind with strong preference to N-terminal H3 peptides containing mono-or dimethyl K9. X-ray crystallography revealed the basis for recognition of the methylated lysine by a partial hydrophobic cage with three tryptophans and one acidic residue. Substitution of key residues in the cage eliminated the H3 tail interaction. Hence.

Sequence alignment of all histone lysine MTases with known product specificity suggested that a key residue in the active site determines how many methyl groups they add. We examined this possibility both in vitro and in vivo and found that a Phe at the position equivalent to Phe281 of Neurospora crassa DIM-5 or Phe1205 of human G9a allows the enzyme to perform di and tri-methylation. whereas a Tyr at this position is restrictive. inhibiting tri-methylation and thus yielding a mono- or di-MTase.

Plasma Lp (a) levels above the common cut-off level of 300 mg/L place individuals at risk of developing heart disease particularly if combined with other lipid and thrombogenic risk factors. Studies in humans have shown Lp (a) levels to be hugely variable and under strict genetic control. largely by the apolipoprotein (a)[apo (a)] gene. In general. Lp (a) levels have proven difficult to manipulate. although some factors have been identified that can influence levels.

Proteomics and metabolomics methods provide invaluable information on the biomolecular content of CSF and thereby on the possible status of the central nervous system. including neurological pathologies. The combined information provides a more complete description of CSF content. Extracting the full combined information requires a combined analysis of different datasets i.e. fusion of the data. A novel fusion method is presented and applied to proteomics and metabolomics data from a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis: an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in rats. The method follows a mid-level fusion architecture. The relevant information is extracted per platform using extended canonical variates analysis.

Linear data fusion is performed most commonly. However. many data display non-linear parameter dependences. The linear methods are bound to fail in such situations. We used proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. two well established techniques. to generate metabolic profiles of Cerebrospinal fluid of Multiple Sclerosis (MScl) individuals. These datasets represent non-linearly separable groups. Thus. to extract relevant information and to combine them a special framework for data fusion is required.   Methodology The main aim is to demonstrate a novel approach for data fusion for classification; the approach is applied to metabolomics datasets coming from patients suffering from MScl at a different stage of the disease. The approach involves data fusion in kernel space and consists of four main steps. The first one is to extract the significant information per data source using Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination. This method allows one to select a set of relevant variables. In the next step the optimized kernel matrices are merged by linear combination. In step 3 the merged datasets are analyzed with a classification technique. namely Kernel Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis. In the final step. the variables in kernel space are visualized and their significance established.

We present an X-ray crystal structure of a 2Cp-Mpo complex at 4.7 Å resolution. This structure allows one to identify major protein–protein interaction areas and provides an explanation for a competitive inhibition of Mpo by Cp and for the activation of p-phenylenediamine oxidation by Mpo. Small angle X-ray scattering was employed to construct low-resolution models of the Cp-Lf complex and. for the first time. of the ternary 2Cp-2Lf-Mpo complex in solution. The SAXS-based model of Cp-Lf supports the predicted 1∶1 stoichiometry of the complex and demonstrates that both lobes of Lf contact domains 1 and 6 of Cp. The 2Cp-2Lf-Mpo SAXS model reveals the absence of interaction between Mpo and Lf in the ternary complex. so Cp can serve as a mediator of protein interactions in complex architecture. Mpo protects antioxidant properties of Cp by isolating its sensitive loop from proteases. The latter is important for incorporation of Fe3+ into Lf. which activates ferroxidase activity of Cp and precludes oxidation of Cp substrates.

The contact between CP and MPO probably entails conformational changes close to the p-phenylenediamine binding site in CP. which explains the observed activation by MPO of the substrate's oxidation. CP subjected to partial proteolysis was virtually unable to inhibit activity of MPO.

In contrast. many [NiFe]-hydrogenases catalyze hydrogen oxidation as part of energy metabolism and were likely key enzymes in early life and arguably represent the predecessors of modern respiratory metabolism.

This evidence supports the hypothesis that the dynamic association of transporters and enzymes creates functional membrane transport metabolons that channel substrates typically obtained from the extracellular compartment directly into their cellular metabolism. The immediate modification of substrates on the inner surface of the membrane prevents back-flux through facilitated transporters. increasing the efficiency of transport. In some cases products of the enzymes are themselves substrates for the transporters that efflux the products in an exchange or antiport mechanism.

Cyclophilin D (CypD) is an important component of the MPT. Brain mitochondria are more resistant to the MPT when compared to heart or liver mitochondria. We found that this increased resistance correlates with low expression of CypD in brain when compared to heart or liver. In newborn rats. sensitivity of brain mitochondria to the MPT and CypD expression are significantly higher than in mature animals. In an in vitro model of neuronal development. mitochondria in differentiated neuronal-like cells exert a higher calcium threshold toward MPT induction and express significantly less CypD when compared to undifferentiated precursor cells. Gain and loss of function experiments confirm the role of CypD in sensitivity to the MPT.

For two unrelated bacterial species. the ‘NC10’ phylum bacterium ‘Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera’ and the γ-proteobacterial strain HdN1 it has been suggested that under anoxic conditions with nitrate and/or nitrite. monooxygenases are used for methane and hexadecane oxidation. respectively.

Mammals have seven sirtuins. Sirt1 to Sirt7. Four of them (Sirt4 to Sirt7) have no detectable or very weak deacetylase activity. We found that Sirt5 is an efficient protein lysine desuccinylase and demalonylase in vitro. The preference for succinyl and malonyl groups was explained by the presence of an arginine residue (Arg105) and tyrosine residue (Tyr102) in the acyl pocket of Sirt5. Several mammalian proteins were identified with mass spectrometry to have succinyl or malonyl lysine modifications. Deletion of Sirt5 in mice appeared to increase the level of succinylation on carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1. which is a known target of Sirt5.

This is very intriguing and raises the question of what is the actual role of this amino acid in cancer metabolism. Cancer cells are greedy for glycine. In particular. the mitochondrial production of glycine seems to be utterly important. Overexpression of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase. the enzyme converting l-serine to glycine. assures an adequate supply of glycine to rapidly proliferating cancer cells. In fact. silencing of mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase was shown to halt cancer cell proliferation. Direct incorporation of glycine carbon atoms into the purine ring has been proposed to be one main reason for the importance of glycine in cancer cell metabolism.

Conversely. under nutrient stress. p53 can protect cells by supporting metabolic adaptation. Many cancers express mutant p53 proteins that have lost the cell-elimination properties of wild-type p53.

However. many tumors that retain wild-type p53 inappropriately maintain the MDM2-p53 regulatory loop in order to continuously suppress p53 activity. We have shown previously that single point mutations in the human MDM2 RING finger domain prevent the interaction of MDM2 with the E2/ubiquitin complex. resulting in the loss of MDM2's E3 activity without preventing p53 binding.

These protein–protein and protein–membrane interactions are critical for apoptosis regulation. since MOMP irreversibly leads to cell death. Whereas the distinct roles of tBid and Bim as sensors of different types of stress are well recognized. it is not known whether the molecular mechanisms whereby they initiate MOMP are the same. In the present study. we compare membrane permeabilization by Bax activated by either cBid [cleaved Bid (p7 and p15)] or Bim and we examine the role of membrane lipids in the recruitment and activation of these three Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) pro-apoptotic proteins. We employ fluorescently-labelled proteins and liposomes to quantify the effects of specific lipids on each of the well-characterized steps in Bax-mediated membrane permeabilization. We show that high levels of cholesterol in the membrane inhibit permeabilization by categorically identifying the recruitment of Bax by the activators and Bax insertion in the membrane as the steps being hindered by cholesterol. Furthermore. we show that binding of both cBid and Bim to membranes is facilitated by electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids.

In this study. the anti-proliferative activity of plant extracts from Origanum majorana (marjoram) was tested on human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat. Cytotoxicity was examined using non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay and the IC50 was calculated. At non-cytotoxic concentrations. the viability of cells decreased with increase of concentration of plant extract. The anti-proliferative effect was also found to be dose-dependent. Analysis via flow cytometry shows that marjoram extracts stimulated apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was caused by an up-regulation of p53 protein levels and down-regulation of Bcl-2α. Marjoram exhibited a strong scavenging activity (SC50 = 0.03 mg dry weight).

A decrease of chromate content in the yeast culture coincides with an increase of Cr(III) content in extra-cellular liquid. At these conditions. cell-bound chromium level was insignificant and a dominant part of extra-cellular Cr(III) species was detected in the reaction with chromazurol S only after mineralization of the cell-free samples. This phenomenon of chromium “disappearance” can be explained by the formation of Cr(III) stable complexes with extra-cellular yeast-secreted components which are “inaccessible” in the reaction with chromazurol S without mineralization.

The family Rutaceae can be divided into 7 subfamilies. including Aurantioideae. The genus Citrus belongs to the subfamily Aurantioideae. In this study. we sequenced the chloroplast matK genes of 135 accessions from 22 genera of Aurantioideae and analyzed them phylogenetically. Our study includes many accessions that have not been examined in other studies. The subfamily Aurantioideae has been classified into 2 tribes. Clauseneae and Citreae. and our current molecular analysis clearly discriminate Citreae from Clauseneae by using only 1 chloroplast DNA sequence. Our study confirms previous observations on the molecular phylogeny of Aurantioideae in many aspects. However. we have provided novel information on these genetic relationships. For example. inconsistent with the previous observation. and consistent with our preliminary study using the chloroplast rbcL genes. our analysis showed that Feroniella oblata is not nested in Citrus species and is closely related with Feronia limonia. Furthermore. we have shown that Murraya paniculata is similar to Merrillia caloxylon and is dissimilar to Murraya koenigii. We found that “true citrus fruit trees” could be divided into 2 subclusters. One subcluster included Citrus. Fortunella. and Poncirus. while the other cluster included Microcitrus and Eremocitrus.

Here we review most of the described MJ activities in an attempt to get an integrated view and better understanding of its multifaceted modes of action. MJ (1) arrests cell cycle. inhibiting cell growth and proliferation. (2) causes cell death through the intrinsic/extrinsic proapoptotic. p53-independent apoptotic. and nonapoptotic (necrosis) pathways. (3) detaches hexokinase from the voltage-dependent anion channel. dissociating glycolytic and mitochondrial functions. decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential. favoring cytochrome                  release and ATP depletion. activating pro-apoptotic. and inactivating antiapoptotic proteins. (4) induces reactive oxygen species mediated responses. (5) stimulates MAPK-stress signaling and redifferentiation in leukemia cells. (6) inhibits overexpressed proinflammatory enzymes in cancer cells such as aldo-keto reductase 1 and 5-lipoxygenase. and (7) inhibits cell migration and shows antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activities. Finally. MJ may act as a chemosensitizer to some chemotherapics helping to overcome drug resistant.

The canonical nucleosome is the octasome. which is composed of two H2A/H2B dimers and two H3/H4 dimers. During transcription elongation. one of the H2A/H2B dimers is removed from the octasome. The depletion of the H2A/H2B dimer is also suggested to occur during DNA replication and repair. The remaining histone components are believed to maintain a nucleosomal structure called a “hexasome”. which is probably important for the regulation of gene expression.

However. the precise molecular mechanism and biological relevance are not fully understood. Here. we report that HIV-1 infection causes double-strand breaks in chromosomal DNA. We further found that Vpr. an accessory gene product of HIV-1. is a major factor responsible for HIV-1–induced double-strand breaks. The purified Vpr protein promotes double-strand breaks when incubated with isolated nuclei. although it does not exhibit endonuclease activity in vitro. A carboxyl-terminally truncated Vpr mutant that is defective in DNA-binding activity is less capable of Vpr-dependent double-strand break formation in isolated nuclei.

To distinguish this chromosomal region from other genomic loci. the centromere contains a specific chromatin structure including specialized nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP–A. In addition to CENP–A nucleosomes. we have found that centromeres contain a nucleosome-like structure comprised of the histone-fold CENP–T–W–S–X complex. However. it is unclear how the CENP–T–W–S–X complex associates with centromere chromatin.

We used a synthetic system to dissect how CenH3CENP-A contributes to the accumulation of CENP-C and CENP-T. two key components that are necessary for the formation of functional kinetochores. We find that de novo CENP-T accumulation depends on CENP-C and that recruitment of these factors requires two domains in CenH3CENP-A: the HJURP-binding region (CATD) and the CENP-C-binding region (CAC). Notably. HJURP interacts directly with CENP-C and is critical for de novo accumulation of CENP-C at synthetic centromeres.

The profound suppression of HBV by the nucleos(t)ide analogs and their ability to cure some patients indicates that they can push HBV to the brink of extinction. Consequently. more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV replication further using a new drug in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs. The HBV ribonuclease H (RNAseH) is a logical drug target because it is the second of only two viral enzymes that are essential for viral replication. but it has not been exploited. primarily because it is very difficult to produce active enzyme. To address this difficulty. we expressed HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs in E. coli and enriched the enzymes by nickel-affinity chromatography. HBV RNAseH activity in the enriched lysates was characterized in preparation for drug screening. Twenty-one candidate HBV RNAseH inhibitors were identified using chemical structure-activity analyses based on inhibitors of the HIV RNAseH and integrase. Twelve anti-RNAseH and anti-integrase compounds inhibited the HBV RNAseH at 10 µM. the best compounds had low micromolar IC50 values against the RNAseH. and one compound inhibited HBV replication in tissue culture at 10 µM.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether quercetin. an oxygen free radical scavenger. protects kidney tissue. METHODS: A renal I/R injury was induced by a left renal pedicle occlusion by ischemia for 45 min. followed by 60 mins of reperfusion with contralateral nephrectomy in rats. The rats were pretreated intraperitoneally with a quercetin suspension (50 mg/kg) 60 min before the ischemia induction. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). protein carbonyl content. tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined in renal tissue. RESULTS: There were 3 groups of rats. the control group. the I/R group and the I/R+ Q group. Our results indicate that TBARS. TNF-alpha levels. MPO activity and protein carbonyl content were significantly higher in the I/R group than those in the control group (p< 0.05. p< 0.01. p< 0.01 and p< 0.01. respectively). Quercetin administration significantly decreased these parameters (p< 0.05. p< 0.01. p< 0.05 and p< 0.01. respectively). GSH levels. SOD. and CAT activities significantly decreased after I/R injury when compared to the control group (p< 0.01. p< 0.05 and p< 0.01. respectively).

We show here that the mouse Suv39h2 enzyme differs from Suv39h1 by containing an N-terminal basic domain that facilitates retention at mitotic chromatin and provides an additional affinity for major satellite repeat RNA. To analyze an RNA-dependent interaction with chromatin. we purified native nucleosomes from mouse ES cells and detect that Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 exclusively associate with poly-nucleosomes. This association was attenuated upon RNaseH incubation and entirely lost upon RNaseA digestion of native chromatin. Major satellite repeat transcripts remain chromatin-associated and have a secondary structure that favors RNA:DNA hybrid formation.

Since many of the factors that accumulate in PML NBs and PML-containing structures in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells are known histone methyltransferases. histone deacetylases or DNA methyltransferases. we suggest that PML NBs may have a role as epigenetic regulators.

Established techniques have provided both qualitative and quantitative information regarding these interactions. leading to a general view that proteins bind with a variety of affinities to particular sequences within heparin or heparan sulfate chains. The mechanism by which heparan sulfate regulates the activity of proteins through such interactions has. however. proved more elusive. We survey some relevant details of the structural characteristics of heparin/heparan sulfate and the approaches used to investigate their interactions with proteins. For the latter. the interactions of heparin/heparan sulfate with fibroblast growth factors and their receptors will be emphasized. because these proteins have been the subject of many studies.

In addition. the potential signal is split because both positive and. to a greater extent. negative ions are formed while signals are frequently complicated as the result of partial alkali‐salt formation. In order to stabilize the sialic acid moieties under MALDI conditions and to divert all of the signal into the positive‐ion mode. a method involving their conversion into methyl esters has been developed. The method is relatively rapid and produces strong positive‐ion signals from N‐linked oligosaccharides containing sialic acid and from gangliosides. The latter compounds are stable. even in the presence of α‐cyano‐4‐hydroxycinnamic acid.

The approach is based on the creation of a hydrazide-derivatized. self-assembled monolayer on a gold surface in a single or two-step procedure. for efficient and selectively oriented anchoring of oligosaccharide probes via their reducing ends. with detection using fluorescence detection of bound proteins. The biggest hurdles in employing gold-based substrate for fluorescence-based microarray detection include fluorescence quenching and nonspecific surface adsorption of proteins.

The concentration of curcumin required to quench the peroxidation to about 80% was only 4 μM.

Therefore narrow-bandgap conjugated polymers are currently sought for the fabrication of such devices. A significant challenge is being able to predict device function and performance from consideration of the molecular connectivity and dimensions of the partners within the active layer. Improved chemical syntheses are therefore required to make structurally varied polymers and enable the delineation of structure–function relationships with the aim of improving power conversion efficiencies. Here. we demonstrate that microwave heating in combination with the screening of comonomer reactant ratios can be used to obtain donor–acceptor copolymers with high average molecular weights and properties that make them suitable for solar cell incorporation.

Certain lineages appear to branch deeply and may be part of a major phylum radiation. The structure of this radiation and the physiology of the organisms remain almost unknown.We used genome-resolved metagenomic analyses to investigate the diversity. genomes sizes. metabolic capacities. and potential roles of Archaea in terrestrial subsurface biogeochemical cycles. We sequenced DNA from complex sediment and planktonic consortia from an aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River (USA) and reconstructed the first complete genomes for Archaea using cultivation-independent methods.

1028186,The Toxoplasma gondii cyst wall protein CST1 is critical for cyst wall integrity and promotes bradyzoite persistence,2013,Tadakimi Tomita and David J Bzik and Yan Fen Ma and Barbara A Fox and Lye Meng Markillie and Ronald C Taylor and Kami Kim and Louis M Weiss,9,PLoS Pathog,12,e1003823,Public Library of Science,Toxoplasma gondii infects up to one third of the world's population. A key to the success of T. gondii as a parasite is its ability to persist for the life of its host as bradyzoites within tissue cysts. The glycosylated cyst wall is the key structural feature that facilitates persistence and oral transmission of this parasite. Because most of the antibodies and reagents that recognize the cyst wall recognize carbohydrates. identification of the components of the cyst wall has been technically challenging. We have identified CST1 (TGME49_064660) as a 250 kDa SRS (SAG1 related sequence) domain protein with a large mucin-like domain. CST1 is responsible for the Dolichos biflorus Agglutinin (DBA) lectin binding characteristic of T. gondii cysts. Deletion of CST1 results in reduced cyst number and a fragile brain cyst phenotype characterized by a thinning and disruption of the underlying region of the cyst wall. These defects are reversed by complementation of CST1. Additional complementation experiments demonstrate that the CST1-mucin domain is necessary for the formation of a normal cyst wall structure. the ability of the cyst to resist mechanical stress. and binding of DBA to the cyst wall. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis demonstrated dysregulation of bradyzoite genes within the various cst1 mutants. These results indicate that CST1 functions as a key structural component that confers essential sturdiness to the T. gondii tissue cyst critical for persistence of bradyzoite forms.,True,6K17cYsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,94,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003823,7386091717252100695,/scholar?cites=7386091717252100695,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003823,0,0,0

The source of the isolated bacteria was from tropical forest soils that decompose litter rapidly with low and fluctuating redox potentials. making it likely that bacteria using oxygen-independent enzymes play an important role in decomposition. We have used transcriptomics and proteomics to examine the increased growth of the anaerobic isolate Enterobacter lignolyticus SCF1 when grown on media amended with lignin compared to unamended growth. Proteomics revealed accelerated xylose uptake and metabolism under lignin-amended growth. and lignin degradation via the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate degradation pathway. catalase/peroxidase enzymes. and the glutathione biosynthesis and glutathione S-transferase proteins. We also observed increased production of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase. other electron transport chain proteins. and ATP synthase and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We detected significant lignin degradation over time by absorbance. and also used metabolomics to demonstrate increased xylose utilization in lignin-amended compared to unamended growth. Our data shows the advantages of a multi-omics approach. where incomplete pathways identified by genomics were completed. and new observations made on coping with poor carbon availability.

We demonstrate that the uptake of amorphous silica ENPs by macrophage cells. and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. is strongly inhibited by silencing expression of scavenger receptor A (SR-A). Conversely. ENP uptake is augmented by introducing SR-A expression into human cells that are normally non-phagocytic. Confocal microscopy analyses show that the majority of single or small clusters of silica ENPs co-localize with SR-A and are internalized through a pathway characteristic of clathrin-dependent endocytosis.

One of these glycogen synthase kinases is the enzyme cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase [3. 4] which may underlie the inhibition of glycogen synthase that occurs in vivo in response to adrenaline [5. 6]. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase has been shown to phosphorylate glycogen synthase on three serine residues in vitro termed site-l a. site-lb and site-2 [7. 8]. The initial rate of phosphorylation of site-l a is 7-lo-fold faster than site-2 and 15-20-fold faster than site-lb; the activity of glycogen synthase is determined by the state of phosphorylation of site-2 as well as site-l a [8]. The phosphorylation of site-lb does not appear to have a direct effect on the activity [7. 8]. Site-2. which is located seven residues from the N-terminus of glycogen synthase. is the major site phosphorylated by phosphorylase kinase [9. 10].

Results: Two characteristics (expected probability of hydrogen bonds formation and expected packing density of residues) have been introduced by us to detect amyloidogenic regions in a protein sequence.

Our findings support the concept that the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation is similar for different peptides and proteins. Moreover. we have demonstrated that regions with weak expected packing density are responsible for the appearance of disordered regions. Our method has been tested on datasets of globular proteins and long disordered protein segments. and it shows improved performance over other widely used methods.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,We demonstrate that chain length is the main determinant of the folding rate for proteins with the three‐state folding kinetics. The logarithm of their folding rate in water (kf) strongly anticorrelates with their chain length L (the correlation coefficient being −0.80). At the same time. the chain length has no correlation with the folding rate for two‐state folding proteins (the correlation coefficient is −0.07). Another significant difference of these two groups of proteins is a strong anticorrelation between the folding rate and Baker's “relative contact order” for the two‐state folders and the complete absence of such correlation for the three‐state folders.

In accordance with the conventional view that folding and binding are coupled. in many of our cases the disorder-to-order transition occurs upon complex formation and can be localized to binding interfaces. Moreover. analysis of disorder in protein complexes depicts a significant fraction of intrinsically disordered regions. with up to one third of all residues being disordered. We find that the disorder in homodimers. especially in symmetrical homodimers. is significantly higher than in heterodimers and offer an explanation for this interesting phenomenon.

In this article. we demonstrate that the competence of a protein to be folded or to be unfolded may be determined by the property of amino acid residues to form a sufficient number of contacts in a globular state. The expected average number of contacts per residue calculated from the amino acid sequence alone (using the average number of contacts for 20 amino acid residues in globular proteins) can be used as one of the simple indicators of natively unfolded proteins.

Consequently. compounds counteracting amyloid aggregation have been investigated for their ability (i) to stabilize toxic amyloid precursors;(ii) to prevent the growth of toxic oligomers or speed that of fibrils;(iii) to inhibit fibril growth and deposition;(iv) to disassemble preformed fibrils; and (v) to favor amyloid clearance.

Amyloid beta (Aβ deposition is also found in muscle fibers of individuals affected by inclusion body myositis (sIBM). a rare muscular degenerative disease affecting people over 50. Both conditions are presently lacking an effective therapeutic treatment. There is increasing evidence to suggest that natural polyphenols may prevent the formation of toxic amyloid aggregates; this applies also to oleuropein aglycone (OLE). the most abundant polyphenol in extra virgin olive oil. previously shown to hinder amylin and Aβ aggregation. Here we evaluated the ability of OLE to interfere with Aβ proteotoxicity in vivo by using the transgenic CL2006 and CL4176 strains of Caenorhabditis elegans. simplified models of AD and of sIBM. which express human Aβ in the cytoplasm of body wall muscle cells. OLE-fed CL2006 worms displayed reduced Aβ plaque deposition. less abundant toxic Aβ oligomers. remarkably decreased paralysis and increased lifespan with respect to untreated animals. A protective effect was also observed in CL4176 worms but only when OLE was administered before the induction of the Aβ transgene expression. These effects were specific. dose-related. and not mediated by the known polyphenolic anti-oxidant activity. suggesting that. in this model organism.

These events are regulated by mitochondria-shaping proteins. Changes in the expression and/or localization of these proteins lead to a mitochondrial dynamics impairment and may promote apoptosis. Increasing evidence correlates the mitochondrial dynamics disruption with the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore. we focused on this topic in Manganese (Mn)-induced Parkinsonism. a disorder associated with Mn accumulation preferentially in the basal ganglia where mitochondria from astrocytes represent an early target. Using MitoTracker Red staining we observed increased mitochondrial network fission in Mn-exposed rat astrocytoma C6 cells. Moreover. Mn induced a marked decrease in fusion protein Opa-1 levels as well as a dramatic increase in the expression of fission protein Drp-1. Additionally. Mn provoked a significant release of high MW Opa-1 isoforms from the mitochondria to the cytosol as well as an increased Drp-1 translocation to the mitochondria. Both Mdivi-1. a pharmacological Drp-1 inhibitor. and rat Drp-1 siRNA reduced the number of apoptotic nuclei. preserved the mitochondrial network integrity and prevented cell death.

Brassinosteroids (BRs). acting specifically in the epidermis. can both drive and restrict shoot growth. However. our knowledge of how BRs affect meristem size is scant. Here. we study the root meristem and show that BRs are required to maintain normal cell cycle activity and cell expansion. These two processes ensure the coherent gradient of cell progression. from the apical to the basal meristem. In addition. BR activity in the meristem is not accompanied by changes in the expression level of the auxin efflux carriers PIN1. PIN3 and PIN7. which are known to control the extent of mitotic activity and differentiation.

In the present mini-review. we focus specifically on Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria. The mechanisms by which bacteria oxidize Mn(II) include a two-electron oxidation reaction catalysed by a novel multicopper oxidase that produces Mn(IV) oxides as the primary product. Bacteria also produce organic ligands. such as siderophores. that bind to and stabilize Mn(III).

Genetic evidence from several bacteria indicates that multicopper oxidases (MCOs) are required for MnO2 formation. However. MCOs catalyze one-electron oxidations. whereas the conversion of Mn(II) to MnO2 is a two-electron process. Trapping experiments with pyrophosphate (PP). a Mn(III) chelator. have demonstrated that Mn(III) is an intermediate in Mn(II) oxidation when mediated by exosporium from the Mn-oxidizing bacterium Bacillus SG-1. The reaction of Mn(II) depends on O2 and is inhibited by azide. consistent with MCO catalysis. We show that the subsequent conversion of Mn(III) to MnO2 also depends on O2 and is inhibited by azide.

However. understanding of the microbiology of this process is limited because most culture-independent methods cannot link metabolic processes to the organisms present. and this link to causative agents is necessary to predict the results of perturbations on the system. We collected soil samples at two sub-root depths (10–20 cm and 30–40 cm) before and after a rainfall-driven nutrient perturbation event in a Northern California grassland that experiences a Mediterranean climate. From ten samples. we reconstructed 198 metagenome-assembled genomes that represent all major phylotypes. We also quantified 6.835 proteins and 175 metabolites and showed that after the rain event the concentrations of many sugars and amino acids approach zero at the base of the soil profile. Unexpectedly. the genomes of novel members of the Gemmatimonadetes and Candidate Phylum Rokubacteria phyla encode pathways for methylotrophy. We infer that these abundant organisms contribute substantially to carbon turnover in the soil. given that methylotrophy proteins were among the most abundant proteins in the proteome. Previously undescribed Bathyarchaeota and Thermoplasmatales archaea are abundant in deeper soil horizons and are inferred to contribute appreciably to aromatic amino acid degradation.

It has been proposed that MDA5 forms higher-order structures upon viral dsRNA recognition or during antiviral signaling. however the organization and nature of this proposed oligomeric state is unknown. We report here that MDA5 cooperatively assembles into a filamentous oligomer composed of a repeating segmental arrangement of MDA5 dimers along the length of dsRNA. Binding of MDA5 to dsRNA stimulates its ATP hydrolysis activity with little coordination between neighboring molecules within a filament. Individual ATP hydrolysis in turn renders an intrinsic kinetic instability to the MDA5 filament. triggering dissociation of MDA5 from dsRNA at a rate inversely proportional to the filament length.

Furthermore. RIG-I filaments directly stimulate mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) filament formation without any cofactor. such as polyubiquitin chains. and forced juxtaposition of the isolated signaling domain of RIG-I. as it would be in the filament. is sufficient to activate interferon signaling.

Although DNA sequence-dependent histone octamer binding is important for nucleosome activity. many aspects of this phenomenon have remained elusive. We studied nucleosome structure and stability with diverse DNA sequences. including Widom 601 derivatives with the highest known octamer affinities. to establish a simple model behind the mechanics of sequence dependency. This uncovers the unique but unexpected role of TA dinucleotides and a propensity for G|C-rich sequence elements to conform energetically favourably at most locations around the histone octamer. which rationalizes G|C% as the most predictive factor for nucleosome occupancy in vivo.

While much is known about how these receptors recognize viral RNAs. how they interact with their common signaling adaptor molecule MAVS and activate the downstream signaling pathway had been less clear. Previous studies have shown that the signaling domains (tandem CARDs or 2CARDs) of RIG-I and MDA5 must form homo-oligomers in order to interact with MAVS. and that their interactions lead to filament formation of MAVS. a pre-requisite for downstream signal activation.

The ability to discriminate dsRNA length at this scale sets MDA5 apart from other dsRNA receptors of the immune system. We have shown previously that MDA5 forms filaments along dsRNA that disassemble upon ATP hydrolysis. Here. we demonstrate that filament formation alone is insufficient to explain its length specificity. because the intrinsic affinity of MDA5 for dsRNA depends only moderately on dsRNA length. Instead. MDA5 uses a combination of end disassembly and slow nucleation kinetics to “discard” short dsRNA rapidly and to suppress rebinding.

These denaturing environments are thought to be good solvents for generic protein sequences because properties of conformational distributions align with those of canonical random coils. Previous studies showed that water is a poor solvent for polypeptide backbones. and therefore. backbones form collapsed globular structures in aqueous solvents. Here. we ask if polypeptide backbones can intrinsically undergo the requisite chain expansion in aqueous solutions with high concentrations of urea and GdmCl. We answer this question using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.

Continued increases in seed yield. composition. and quality require an improved understanding of how the developing seed converts carbon and nitrogen supplies into storage. Current knowledge of this process is often based on the premise that transcriptional regulation directly translates via enzyme concentration into flux. In an attempt to highlight metabolic control. we explore genotypic differences in carbon partitioning for in vitro cultured developing embryos of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). We determined biomass composition as well as 79 net fluxes. the levels of 77 metabolites. and 26 enzyme activities with specific focus on central metabolism in nine selected germplasm accessions.

1028377,RNA PROCESSING FACTOR3 is crucial for the accumulation of mature ccmC transcripts in mitochondria of Arabidopsis accession Columbia,2011,Christian Jonietz and Joachim Forner and Tatjana Hildebrandt and Stefan Binder,157,Plant physiology,3,1430-1439,American Society of Plant Biologists,RNA PROCESSING FACTOR1 (RPF1) and RPF2 are pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins involved in 5′ processing of different mitochondrial mRNAs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Both factors are highly similar to RESTORERS OF FERTILITY (RF). which are part of cytoplasmic male sterility/restoration systems in various plant species. These findings suggest a predominant role of RF-like PPR proteins in posttranscriptional 5′ processing. To further explore the functions of this group of proteins. we examined a number of T-DNA lines carrying insertions in the corresponding PPR genes. This screening identified a nearly complete absence of mature ccmC transcripts in an At1g62930 T-DNA insertion line. a phenotype that could be restored by the introduction of the intact At1g62930 gene into the mutant.

By using a hydroponic culture system. we systematically investigate modification in amino acid profiles and the proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves during initial recovery from low water potential or high salinity. Both treatments elicited oxidative stress leading to a biphasic stress response during recovery. Degradation of highly abundant proteins such as subunits of photosystems and ribosomes contributed to an accumulation of free amino acids. Catabolic pathways for several low abundant amino acids were induced indicating their usage as an alternative respiratory substrate to compensate for the decreased photosynthesis.

This proofreading step is accomplished in eukaryotes by the TFIIH complex. The critical damage recognition component of TFIIH is the XPD protein. a DNA helicase that unwinds DNA and identifies the damage. Here. we describe the crystal structure of an archaeal XPD protein with high sequence identity to the human XPD protein that reveals how the structural helicase framework is combined with additional elements for strand separation and DNA scanning. Two RecA-like helicase domains are complemented by a 4Fe4S cluster domain. which has been implicated in damage recognition. and an α-helical domain. The first helicase domain together with the helical and 4Fe4S-cluster–containing domains form a central hole with a diameter sufficient in size to allow passage of a single stranded DNA.

1028415,Prokaryotic nucleotide excision repair,2013,Caroline Kisker and Jochen Kuper and Bennett Van Houten,5,,3,a012591,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,Nucleotide excision repair (NER) has allowed bacteria to flourish in many different niches around the globe that inflict harsh environmental damage to their genetic material. NER is remarkable because of its diverse substrate repertoire. which differs greatly in chemical composition and structure. Recent advances in structural biology and single-molecule studies have given great insight into the structure and function of NER components. This ensemble of proteins orchestrates faithful removal of toxic DNA lesions through a multistep process. The damaged nucleotide is recognized by dynamic probing of the DNA structure that is then verified and marked for dual incisions followed by excision of the damage and surrounding nucleotides. The opposite DNA strand serves as a template for repair. which is completed after resynthesis and ligation.,True,8EAPxXoAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,147,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/5/3/a012591.short,9861086647633124389,/scholar?cites=9861086647633124389,,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/5/3/a012591.full.pdf,0,0,0

In these particles. a 39-nucleotide-long fragment from the 59 region of Drosophila initiator methionine tRNA (tRNA(iMet) is used as the primer for copia minus-strand reverse transcription. To function as primer for this reverse transcription. the Drosophila tRNA(iMet) must be cleaved in vivo at the site between nucleotides 39 and 40. When a synthetic Drosophila tRNA(iMet) precursor was incubated with M1RNA. the catalytic RNA of Escherichia coli RNase P. other cleavages within the mature tRNA sequence were detected in addition to the efficient removal of the 59 leader sequence of this tRNA precursor. One of these cleavage sites is between nucleotides 39 and 40 of Drosophila tRNA(iMet).

This has resulted in a concomitant increase in solar ultraviolet-B radiation (280? 320 nm). High levels of UV-B radiation are responsible for multiple biologically harmful effects in both plants and animals. Many different plant responses to supplemental UV-B radiation have been observed. mostly injurious but sometimes beneficial. UV-B can influence plant processes either through direct damage or via various regulatory effects. In plants. direct effects include DNA damage. membrane changes and protein denaturation. which often cause heritable mutations affecting various physiological processes. including the photosynthetic apparatus. These could adversely affect plant growth. development and morphology. especially the productivity of sensitive crop species.

The seedlings were grown as a substrate culture under controlled climatic conditions. Seven-day-old plants were exposed to low temperature stress by placing them in a cold room at a temperature of 2±1ºC for 10 days–the first phase of hardening.-4±1ºC for 3 days–the second phase of hardening and freezing.-10±1ºC for 1 day–the third phase of hardening and freezing. After exposure to stress. the seedlings were returned to a climatic chamber with controlled climatic conditions. Under stress conditions the growth rates of the PBZ-treated seedlings measured by height. fresh and dry weights were greater than the control. Low temperature stress (LTS) induced lipid peroxidation and increased peroxidase activity. It was also found that LTS decreased the chlorophyll and carotenoid levels. A decrease in fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) indicated lower photosynthetic efficiency. These deteriorative symptoms in the control seedlings were ameliorated by the PBZ treatment.

As a result. mitochondrial tRNA genes and their products have emerged as novel and essential molecular markers for wide biochemical and genetic screenings among different human populations. So far. 139 pathogenic and 243 polymorphic mt tRNA mutations have been described and they have become the foreground of numerous case reports. Given the complexity of mitochondrial genetics and biochemistry. the clinical manifestations of mitochondrial disorders are extremely heterogeneous. They range from lesions of single tissues or structures to more severe impairements including myopathies. encephalomyopathies. cardiomyopathies. or complex multisystem syndromes.

Until recently. the study of aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis in archaea had received little attention. However. as in so many areas of molecular biology. the advent of archaeal genome sequencing has now drawn researchers to this field. Investigations with archaea have already led to the discovery of novel pathways and enzymes for the synthesis of numerous aminoacyl-tRNAs. The most surprising of these findings has been a transamidation pathway for the synthesis of asparaginyl-tRNA and a novel lysyl-tRNA synthetase. In addition. seryl- and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases that are only marginally related to known examples outside the archaea have been characterized. and the mechanism of cysteinyl-tRNA formation in Methanococcus jannaschii and …,True,q-KogacAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,66,https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article-abstract/152/4/1269/6047770,14212628023836320949,/scholar?cites=14212628023836320949,,https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/152/4/1269.full.pdf,0,0,0

Stable complexes were formed between the biotinylated target lipid and an appropriate PH domain. and phosphoinositides present in samples were detected by their ability to compete for binding to the PH domain. Complexes were detected using AlphaScreen technology or time-resolved FRET. The assay procedure was validated using recombinant PI 3-kinase γ with diC8PtdIns(4.5)P2 as substrate and general receptor for phosphoinositides-1 (GRP1) PH domain as a PtdIns(3.4.5)P3-specific probe.

One driving factor may be an immune response towards proteins in the cartilage. Here it is shown that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). expressed specifically in cartilage. is arthritogenic in the rat. Both native and denatured rat COMP induced severe arthritis in selected rat strains. The arthritis occurred only in peripheral joints which were attacked by an erosive inflammatory process similar to that seen in the human disease. The disease was self-limited and no permanent destruction of joints was seen macroscopically. Disease development appeared to be dependent on an immune response to autologous (rat) COMP and not on cross-reactivity to other cartilage rat collagens (types II. IX and XI).

This review summarises findings from cellular. animal and human trials that have examined the effects of oxidised lipids and their potential to affect health outcomes. and proposes that oxidised products in fish oils may attenuate their beneficial effects.

However. the aglycone forms investigated in many previous studies do not circulate in appreciable quantities because they are metabolised in the gut and liver. We investigated effects of various isoflavone metabolites. including for the first time the sulphated conjugates formed in the liver and the mucosa of the small intestine. on copper-induced LDL oxidation. The parent aglycones inhibited oxidation. although only 5% as well as quercetin. Metabolism increased or decreased their effectiveness.

The studies were carried out at fixed temperatures (60°C. 65°C. 70°C and 80°C) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. pH 7.0. at BSA concentration of 1 mg/ml. Thermal denaturation of the protein was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Analysis of the experimental data shows that at 65°C the stage of protein unfolding and individual stages of protein aggregation are markedly separated in time. This circumstance allowed us to propose the following mechanism of thermal aggregation of BSA. Protein unfolding results in the formation of two forms of the non-native protein with different propensity to aggregation. One of the forms (highly reactive unfolded form. Uhr) is characterized by a high rate of aggregation. Aggregation of Uhr leads to the formation of primary aggregates with the hydrodynamic radius (Rh.1) of 10.3 nm. The second form (low reactive unfolded form. Ulr) participates in the aggregation process by its attachment to the primary aggregates produced by the Uhr form and possesses ability for self-aggregation with formation of stable small-sized aggregates (Ast). At complete exhaustion of Ulr. secondary aggregates with the hydrodynamic radius (Rh.2) of 12.8 nm are formed. At 60°C the rates of unfolding and aggregation are commensurate. at 70°C the rates of formation of the primary and secondary aggregates are commensurate. at 80°C the registration of the initial stages of aggregation is complicated by formation of large-sized aggregates.,True,zMDpqtYAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,118,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153495,13923655472922758537,/scholar?cites=13923655472922758537,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153495,0,0,0

All small heat shock proteins did not affect thermal unfolding of F-actin measured by differential scanning calorimetry. but effectively prevented aggregation of thermally denatured actin. Small heat shock protein formed stable complexes with denatured (but not with intact) F-actin. The size of these highly soluble complexes was smaller than the size of intact F-actin filaments.

To understand the interplay between the organic template and the mineral crystal it is important to explicitly address the issue of structural adaptation of the template during mineralization. To this end we have developed a series of self-organizing surfactants (1−4) consisting of a dodecyl chain connected via a bisureido-heptylene unit to an amino acid head group. In Langmuir monolayers the spacing of these molecules in one direction is predetermined by the hydrogen-bonding distances between the bis-urea units.

To date. this activity. whereby misactivated amino acids are hydrolyzed either before or after transfer to noncognate tRNAs. has been characterized extensively only in the case of class I synthetases. Class II synthetases have an active-site architecture that is completely distinct from that of class I. Thus. findings on editing by class I synthetases may not be applicable generally to class II enzymes. Class II Escherichia coli proline-tRNA synthetase is shown here to misactivate alanine and to hydrolyze the noncognate amino acid before transfer to tRNAPro. This enzyme also is capable of rapidly deacylating a mischarged Ala-tRNAPro variant. A single cysteine residue (C443) that is located within the class II-specific motif 3 consensus sequence was shown previously to be dispensable for proline-tRNA …,True,auHkDbsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,161,https://www.pnas.org/content/97/16/8916.short,5688386243440399529,/scholar?cites=5688386243440399529,,https://www.pnas.org/content/97/16/8916.full.pdf+html,0,0,0

Due to the similarity in many amino acid side chains. certain synthetases misactivate non-cognate amino acids to an extent that would be detrimental to protein synthesis if left uncorrected. To ensure accurate translation of the genetic code. some synthetases therefore utilize editing mechanisms to hydrolyze non-cognate products. Previously class II Escherichia coli proline-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) was shown to exhibit pre- and post-transfer editing activity. hydrolyzing a misactivated alanine-adenylate (Ala-AMP) and a mischarged Ala-tRNAPro variant. respectively.

Through primary sequence alignments. prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRSs) have been divided into two phylogenetically divergent groups. We have been interested in understanding whether the unusual evolutionary pattern of ProRSs corresponds to functional differences as well. Previously. we showed that some features of tRNA recognition and aminoacylation are indeed group-specific. Here. we examine the species-specific differences in another enzymatic activity. namely amino acid editing.

During the first chemical step of tRNA aminoacylation. noncognate amino acids that are smaller than or isosteric with the cognate substrate can be misactivated. Thus. to maintain high accuracy during protein translation. some synthetases have evolved an editing mechanism. Previously. we showed that class II Escherichia coli proline-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) is capable of (1) weakly misactivating Ala. (2) hydrolyzing the misactivated Ala-AMP in a reaction known as pretransfer editing. and (3) deacylating a mischarged Ala-tRNAPro variant via a post-transfer editing pathway.

Proteins follow the EX1 kinetic regime when cooperative unfolding events simultaneously expose multiple residues to solvent such that they all become deuterated together before the region is able to refold. A number of factors can contribute to what we call “false EX1” in which it appears as though EX1 occurs in a protein when it probably does not. One of the contributors to false EX1 is peptide carryover between chromatographic runs. In this work. we explore the origins of peptide carryover in HX MS. describe how carryover causes mass spectra to indicate false EX1 kinetics and then describe an optimized washing protocol that can be used to eliminate peptide carryover.

Lutjanus argentimaculatus (red snapper) and Lutjanus johnii (golden snapper) locally known as merah and jenahak. respectively. are among the most commonly consumed fish in Malaysia. The objective of this study is to identify the IgE-binding proteins and major allergens of these species of fishes. Extracts of both fish species were prepared and fractionated by sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). IgE binding patterns were then demonstrated by immunoblotting using sera from patients allergic to the fishes. The raw extracts of both fish produced 26 protein bands. Both species of fishes had similar protein profiles. In cooked extracts. several protein bands in the range of about 40 to 90 kD which were present in the uncooked extracts appeared to be denatured and formed high molecular weight complexes. The immunoblotting of golden snapper and red snapper revealed 16 and 15 various IgE-binding bands. in the range of 151 to 12-11 kD. respectively. A 51 kD protein was identified as a major allergen for both fishes. A 46 kD protein was also demonstrated as a major allergen in golden snapper and a 42 kD protein was also seen as a major allergen in red snapper.

However. its regulon has not been well characterized.   Methodology/Principal Findings The binding site of PhoP transcription regulator was identified in the upstream regions of msl3. pks2. lipF and fadD21 genes. by using gene fusions. electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting experiments. A consensus sequence for PhoP binding was deduced. It consists of two direct repeats. DR1/DR2. associated with a third repeat. DR3. important in some cases for PhoP binding to DR1/DR2 but located at a variable distance from these direct repeats. DR1/DR2 and DR3 consensus sequences were used to screen the whole-genome sequence for other putative binding sites potentially corresponding to genes directly regulated by PhoP. The identified 87 genes. encoding transcription regulators. and proteins involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis. transport and catabolism are proposed to belong to the PhoP regulon.   Conclusions/Significance A consensus sequence derived from the analysis of PhoP binding to four gene promoter regions is proposed. We show for the first time the involvement of a third direct repeat motif in this binding reaction.

Acetylation of lysines 9 and 14 does not impede 14-3-3 binding to serine 10-phosphorylated H3 tails. In vivo. 14-3-3 is inducibly recruited to c-fos and c-jun nucleosomes upon gene activation. concomitant with H3 phosphoacetylation.

Active site phosphorylation of other members of the CDK family that regulate cell cycle progression instates checkpoints that are fundamental to eukaryotic cell cycle regulation. Kinetic and crystallographic analyses of CDK2-cyclin A complexes reveal that this inhibitory mechanism operates through steric blockade of peptide substrate binding and through the creation of an environment that favors a non-productive conformation of the terminal group of ATP.

The majority of mitotic motors are members of the kinesin superfamily.

These distinct behaviors and functional specificity are generated by variations in the enzymatic domain as well as the non‐conserved regions outside of the kinesin motor domain and the stalk.

However. due to the time and cost associated with developing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). mass spectrometric approaches are playing an increasingly important role. Protein quantification at or below the nanogram per milliliter level using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) typically utilizes an immunoaffinity (IA) enrichment step such as immunoprecipitation. In order to maximize mass spectrometry (MS) sensitivity. protein enrichment is followed by a proteolytic cleavage step used to generate a surrogate peptide with better mass spectrometric properties. Unlike ELISA. IA−LC/MS/MS is a serial technique that can require up to 3 days for a single batch analysis due to lengthy incubation and digestion steps.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae a key event in TLS is the monoubiquitination of PCNA. which enables recruitment of the specialized polymerases to the damaged site through their ubiquitin-binding domain. In mammals. however. there is a debate on the requirement for ubiquitinated PCNA (PCNA-Ub) in TLS. We show that UV-induced Rpa foci. indicative of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions caused by UV. accumulate faster and disappear more slowly in PcnaK164R/K164R cells. which are resistant to PCNA ubiquitination. compared to Pcna+/+ cells. consistent with a TLS defect. Direct analysis of TLS in these cells. using gapped plasmids with site-specific lesions. showed that TLS is strongly reduced across UV lesions and the cisplatin-induced intrastrand GG crosslink. A similar effect was obtained in cells lacking Rad18. the E3 ubiquitin ligase which monoubiquitinates PCNA.

We explored the importance of HAS2 expression for breast cancer tumorigenicity. by specifically silencing the HAS2 gene using RNA interference (RNAi)‐mediated suppression in the invasive breast cancer cell line Hs578T. This led to a less aggressive phenotype of the breast tumor cells. as assessed by cell growth. both in …,True,RsEeswEAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,148,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.22550,5653019925248284197,/scholar?cites=5653019925248284197,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ijc.22550,0,0,0

The Fe(III) was supplied to enrichment cultures as a soluble complex with the bidentate ligand maltol (3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pyrone). Advantages that were afforded by the use of Fe(III)(maltol)3 over previously published methods included negation of the requirement for assays of Fe(II) formation. Because Fe(III)(maltol)3 has a characteristic deep red colour. Fe(III) reduction could be quantified spectrophotometrically by monitoring the disappearance of the complex in liquid cultures.

In this study. we show that low miR-137 expression is correlated with poor survival in stage IV melanoma patients. We identified and validated two genes (c-Met and YB1) as direct targets of miR-137 and confirmed two previously known targets. namely enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Functional studies showed that miR-137 suppressed melanoma cell invasion through the downregulation of multiple target genes.

Although the BRAFV600E kinase inhibitor vemurafenib has remarkable antitumor activity in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma. its effects are limited by the onset of drug resistance. We found that exposure of melanoma cell lines with the BRAFV600E mutation to vemurafenib decreased the abundance of antiapoptotic proteins and induced intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis.

1028660,β-Catenin signaling increases during melanoma progression and promotes tumor cell survival and chemoresistance,2011,Tobias Sinnberg and Moritz Menzel and Daniel Ewerth and Birgit Sauer and Michael Schwarz and Martin Schaller and Claus Garbe and Birgit Schittek,6,PloS one,8,e23429,Public Library of Science,Beta-catenin plays an important role in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis by controlling either cadherin-mediated cell adhesion or transcriptional activation of target gene expression. In many types of cancers nuclear translocation of beta-catenin has been observed. Our data indicate that during melanoma progression an increased dependency on the transcriptional function of beta-catenin takes place. Blockade of beta-catenin in metastatic melanoma cell lines efficiently induces apoptosis. inhibits proliferation. migration and invasion in monolayer and 3-dimensional skin reconstructs and decreases chemoresistance. In addition. subcutaneous melanoma growth in SCID mice was almost completely inhibited by an inducible beta-catenin knockdown. In contrast. the survival of benign melanocytes and primary melanoma cell lines was less affected by beta-catenin depletion. However. enhanced expression of beta-catenin in primary melanoma cell lines increased invasive capacity in vitro and tumor growth in the SCID mouse model. These data suggest that beta-catenin is an essential survival factor for metastatic melanoma cells. whereas it is dispensable for the survival of benign melanocytes and primary. non-invasive melanoma cells. Furthermore. beta-catenin increases tumorigenicity of primary melanoma cell lines.

In a series of patients. we observed that treatment with vemurafenib resulted in substantial regression of extracerebral metastases. but brain metastases developed.

Among those is β-catenin. an important player in cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. Phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK1α at Ser45 is the priming reaction for the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin. Interestingly. aside from this role in β-catenin degradation. very little is known about the expression and functional role of CK1α in tumor cells. Here. we show that CK1α expression in different tumor types is either strongly suppressed or completely lost during tumor progression and that CK1α is a key factor determining β-catenin stability and transcriptional activity in tumor cells. CK1α reexpression in metastatic melanoma cells reduces growth in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo. and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. whereas suppression of CK1α in primary melanoma cells induces invasive tumor growth …,True,RA-CMP0AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,90,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/70/17/6999.short,8232354530171988905,/scholar?cites=8232354530171988905,,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/70/17/6999.full.pdf,0,0,0
