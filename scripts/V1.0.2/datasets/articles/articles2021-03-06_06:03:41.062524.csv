The System of Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA) is undergoing continuous refinement with these objectives in mind. In SEEA. there is a need for databases to encompass the global dimension of societal metabolism. In this paper. we focus on the latest effort to construct a global multi-regional input− output database (EXIOBASE) with a focus on environmentally relevant activities. The database and its broader analytical framework allows for the as yet most detailed insight into the production-related impacts and “footprints” of our consumption. We explore the methods used to arrive at the database. and some key relationships extracted from the database.

The large number of studies applying economy-wide material flow analysis so far mostly produced aggregated national indicators. making the results difficult to connect to policies. which are often designed for single sectors or consumption areas. This paper provides a detailed assessment of the composition of EU’s material footprint in its global context. aiming at identifying the main product groups contributing to overall material consumption and specifying the geographical sources for the raw materials required to satisfy EU’s final demand. Based on multi-regional input–output (MRIO) modeling. we apply production layer decomposition to assess supply chains and their structural changes from 1995 to 2011. The global MRIO database used in this study is EXIOBASE 3. which disaggregates 200 products and 163 industries. of which 33 represent material extraction sectors. By that means. we increase the level of detail to a degree where policies can more easily connect to. We find that the generally growing material footprint of the EU was characterized by a dramatic shift regarding the origin of raw materials. with the share of materials extracted within the EU territory falling from 68 % in 1995 to 35 % in 2011. In 2011. raw materials extracted in China to produce exports to the EU already contributed an equal share to EU’s material footprint as material extraction within the EU itself.

Hence. in most recent global MRIO tables these countries are either roughly estimated or summarised in one rest of the world (RoW) region.

We conceptualise the importance of RoW in several environmental footprint accounts and present algorithms to estimate the structure of RoW.

1114939,Building energy management systems: Global potentials and environmental implications of deployment,2016,Severin Beucker and Joseph D Bergesen and Thomas Gibon,20,Journal of Industrial ecology,2,223-233,,One of the key drivers that influence building energy consumption is the demand for space heating. Particularly in countries with cold climates and a large stock of residential buildings with central heating. building energy management systems (BEMS) are an option to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These systems can be combined with existing space heating technologies and other efficiency measures. such as building insulation. They are ideal for retrofitting purposes owing to their low up‐front costs. A prospective life cycle assessment model is used to analyze the environmental impacts of the technology today. in 2030. and in 2050. This allows for a first‐ever. order‐of‐magnitude assessment of the environmental impacts of BEMS over their life cycle. The assessment is based on manufacturer information and generic life cycle inventory data for electronic components.

September 5. 2017,2018,Laurent Vandepaer and Thomas Gibon,23,The international journal of life cycle assessment,4,970-977,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,The Life Cycle Management Conference. held in Luxembourg from the 3rd to the 6th of September 2017. was the opportunity for LCA practitioners to sit and discuss the integration of external models in prospective LCA models. The workshop organizers feel that as a growing LCA subdiscipline. prospective LCA lacks a shared foundation in terms of methods. data. best practices. and software solutions. For practitioners. this workshop was organized as a first step to introduce their research. identify overlaps. pinpoint further needs. and discuss the near future of prospective LCA. The focus was placed on the use of energy scenarios in prospective LCA due to the important role of energy in the environmental profile of many products. For this reason. most of the examples are related to energy system models and energy scenarios.

Hertwich and Roberto Parra-Saldívar,,Journal of Cleaner Production,,,,Assessing the environmental impacts of electricity generation is fundamental for designing a low-carbon future for our societies. The amount of data collected for that purpose has significantly increased over the past decade due to the emergence of various methods. such as life cycle assessment and input-output analysis. We present here a comparison of environmental assessment methods for geothermal plants. based on physical and/or monetary data. Results show that some hybrid (mass-monetary) inventories yield results that vary significantly between impact categories. However. for the particular geothermal system investigated. direct emissions of geothermal fluids dominate the few impact categories to which they contribute.,True,I3ATYsQAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616318625,4866963284229021504,/scholar?cites=4866963284229021504,,,0,0,0

It became clear to us that Yang (2017b) does not mainly criticise the hybrid LCA method. but rather the misconception around the idea that hybrid LCA would lead for sure to higher accuracy if a more complete system boundary is obtained. as also well specified in another work of his (Yang et al. 2017). We agree that this is a misconception because of data and methodological restrictions. However. this does not mean that the method as such. from a conceptual point of view. should be solely criticised for general limitations in the linear framework and system boundaries in comparison to other linear LCA. what Yang (2017b) though appeared to do. This entails another discussion.

The main innovation lies in the combination of full temporalization of the background inventory and a graph search algorithm leading to full dynamic LCI. further coupled to dynamic LCIA. The following objectives were addressed: (1) development of a database with temporal parameters for all processes of ecoinvent 3.2. (2) implementation of the model and the database in integrated software. and (3) demonstration on a case study comparing a conventional internal combustion engine car to an electric one.Calculation of dynamic LCA (including temporalization of background and foreground system) implies (i) a dynamic LCI model.

Yang (2017)(hereafter BYang^) concludes that Bbecause of restrictive assumptions. hybrid LCA may not necessarily yield adequate results for product promotion^. The main restrictions he refers to seem to be those related to the limitation of hybrid LCA in covering large economic effects associated with its linear framework. This message is not wrong and some of the presented arguments have their value. However. his manuscript presents a skewed message to the reader because (i) the work often only focuses on hybrid LCA while the linear framework is inherent to other types of LCA alike.(ii) the fact that the demand for a product automatically affects production in every single process of the worldwide economy in hybrid LCA is not true as it depends on the data and not only on the methodology and (iii) the adequacy for product promotion can be questioned for any …,True,I3ATYsQAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC,8,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11367-017-1291-1.pdf,7700649564643447214,/scholar?cites=7700649564643447214,,,0,0,0
