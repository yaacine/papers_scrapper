It comprises between seven and nine bones. all of which vary widely in their contribution to this region among the different mammalian orders and families. It is hypothesised that the structure of the mammalian orbit is principally influenced by the forces generated by the jaw‐closing musculature. In order to quantify the orbit. fourteen linear. angular and area measurements were taken from 84 species of placental mammals using a Microscribe‐3D digitiser. The results were then analysed using principal components analysis. The results of the multivariate analysis on untransformed data showed a clear division of the mammalian taxa into temporalis‐dominant forms and masseter‐dominant forms. This correlation between orbital structure and masticatory musculature was reinforced by results from the size‐corrected data. which showed a …,True,yzEF4p4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,37,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00031.x,5534554610615551145,/scholar?cites=5534554610615551145,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philip_Cox2/publication/5641023_A_quantitative_analysis_of_the_Eutherian_orbit_Correlations_with_masticatory_apparatus/links/56e69f9408ae65dd4cc1b2f9/A-quantitative-analysis-of-the-Eutherian-orbit-Correlations-with-masticatory-apparatus.pdf,0,0,0

This book brings together the latest research on rodents to better understand the evolution of both living and extinct members of this fascinating group. Topics analysed include the role of molecular techniques in the determination of robust phylogenetic frameworks; how geometric morphometric methods help quantify and analyse variation in shape; and the role of developmental biology in elucidating the origins of skeletal elements and the teeth. The editors unite these disciplines to present the current state of knowledge in rodent biology. whilst setting the landscape for future research.

In this study. the spatial relationships of these muscles and canals were investigated to assess their relative alignments in mammalian species commonly used in studies of the VOR. The head region of each specimen was scanned using magnetic resonance imaging and 28 anatomical landmarks were recorded from the images to define the six extraocular muscles and the anatomical planes of the three semicircular canals. The vector rotation of a semicircular canal that does not stimulate either of its two sister canals. referred to as the prime direction. was also calculated as an estimate of the maximal response plane. Significant misalignments were found between the extraocular muscles and the canals by which they are …,True,yzEF4p4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,34,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00983.x,10125411231119828499,/scholar?cites=10125411231119828499,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-7580.2008.00983.x,0,0,0
1153535,Predicting bite force and cranial biomechanics in the largest fossil rodent using finite element analysis,2015,Philip G Cox and Andrés Rinderknecht and R Ernesto Blanco,226,Journal of anatomy,3,215-223,,Josephoartigasia monesi. from the Pliocene of Uruguay. is the largest known fossil rodent. with an estimated body mass of 1000 kg. In this study. finite element analysis was used to estimate the maximum bite force that J. monesi could generate at the incisors and the cheek teeth. Owing to uncertainty in the model inputs. a sensitivity study was conducted in which the muscle forces and orientations were sequentially altered. This enabled conclusions to be drawn on the function of some of the masticatory muscles. It was found that J. monesi had a bite of 1389 N at the incisors. rising to 4165 N at the third molar. Varying muscle forces by 20% and orientations by 10° around the medio‐lateral aspect led to an error in bite force of under 35% at each tooth.

Yet. despite this impressive behavior. little information exists on their masticatory musculature or the biomechanics of their jaw movements. It was hypothesized that beavers would have a highly efficient arrangement of the masticatory apparatus. and that gnawing efficiency would be maintained at large gape. The head of an American beaver. Castor canadensis. was dissected to reveal the masticatory musculature. Muscle origins and insertions were noted. the muscles were weighed and fiber lengths measured. Physiological cross-sectional areas were determined. and along with the muscle vectors. were used to calculate the length of the muscle moment arms. the maximum incisor bite force. and the proportion of the bite force projected along the long axis of the lower incisor. at occlusion and 30° gape.

Laonastes aenigmamus. and the function of the zygomaticomandibularis muscle,2013,Philip G Cox and Joanna Kirkham and Anthony Herrel,1,PeerJ,,e160,PeerJ Inc.,The Laotian rock rat. Laonastes aenigmamus. is one of the most recently discovered species of rodent. and displays a cranial morphology that is highly specialised. The rostrum of L. aenigmamus is exceptionally elongate and bears a large attachment site for the infraorbital portion of the zygomaticomandibularis muscle (IOZM). which is particularly well-developed in this species. In this study. we used finite element analysis to investigate the biomechanical performance of the Laotian rock rat cranium and to elucidate the function of the IOZM. A finite element model of the skull of L. aenigmamus was constructed and solved for biting on each of the teeth (incisors. premolar and molars). Further load cases were created and solved in which the origin of the IOZM had been moved anteriorly and posteriorly along the rostrum. Finally. a set of load cases were produced in which the IOZM was removed entirely. and its force was redistributed between the remaining masticatory muscles. The analysis showed that. during biting. the most stressed areas of the skull were the zygomatic and orbital regions. Compared to other rodents. L. aenigmamus is highly efficient at incisor gnawing. but less efficient at molar chewing. However. a relatively constant bite force across the molar tooth row may be an adaptation to folivory. Movement of the origin of the IOZM had little on the patterns of von Mises stresses. or the overall stress experienced by the cranium. However. removal of the IOZM had a substantial effect on the total deformation experienced by the skull. In addition. the positioning and presence of the IOZM had large impact on bite force.

However. there are a number of other behaviours that can influence craniodental morphology. Previous work has shown that subterranean rodents that use their incisors to dig (chisel‐tooth digging) have a constrained cranial shape. which is probably driven by a necessity to create high bite forces at wide gapes. Chisel‐tooth‐digging rodents also have an upper incisor root that is displaced further back into the cranium compared with other rodents.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The vestibulo‐ocular reflex is the system of compensatory ocular movements in response to stimulation of the kinetic labyrinth seen in all vertebrates. It allows maintenance of a stable gaze even when the head is moving. Perhaps the simplest influence on the VOR is the spatial orientation of the planes of the semicircular canals relative to the extraocular muscles. It is hypothesized that the extraocular muscles are in parallel alignment with their corresponding semicircular canals in order to reduce the amount of neural processing needed and hence keep reflex times to a minimum. However. despite its obvious importance. little is known of this spatial arrangement.

Previous research has shown that chisel-tooth digging mole-rats (which use their incisors to dig burrows) are clearly distinguishable from scratch diggers (which only use the forelimbs to tunnel) on the basis of morphology of the skull. and that the differences are linked to the production of high bite forces and wide gapes.

Fin regeneration is dependent on formation of a blastema. a progenitor cell pool accumulating at the amputation plane. It is unclear which cells the blastema is derived from. whether it forms by dedifferentiation of mature cells. and whether blastema cells are multipotent. We show that mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate and form part of the blastema. Osteoblasts downregulate expression of intermediate and late bone differentiation markers and induce genes expressed by bone progenitors. Dedifferentiated osteoblasts proliferate in a FGF-dependent manner and migrate to form part of the blastema.

An improved understanding of these changes through the development of experimental models may lead to improvements in existing clinical treatment options. The zebrafish is a well-established model for the study of skeletogenesis with significant potential in gerontological research. With advancing age. zebrafish frequently develop gross deformities of their vertebral column. previously ascribed to reduced trunk muscle tone. In this study. we assess degenerative changes specifically within the bone and cartilage of the vertebral column of zebrafish at 1. 2 and 3-years of age. We show increased frequency and severity of spinal deformities/curvatures with age. Underlying the most severe phenotypes are partial or complete vertebral dislocations and focal thickening of the vertebral bone at the joint margins. MicroCT examination demonstrates small defects. fractures and morphological evidence suggestive of bone erosion and remodeling (i.e. osteophytes) within the vertebrae during aging. but no significant change in bone density.

1153595,Patterns of morphological and functional evolution in Mesozoic marine reptiles,2015,Thomas L Stubbs,,,,,,The primary goal of numerical palaeobiology is to understand the processes that generate and eliminate extinct and extant biodiversity. It is important to examine key clades and adaptive assemblages. whose evolution appears intrinsically related to major events in deep time. Mesozoic marine reptiles represent an excellent candidate for investigation. having ascended to ecological dominance in the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction and passed through multiple biotic crises. Observations from the rich Triassic marine reptile fossil record highlight diverse ecologies. providing tentative evidence for an exceptional radiation driven by new trophic opportunities - but quantitative tests for this are scarce. Others have highlighted the potential long-term impacts of extinction. and revealed that ichthyosaur evolution was reset following an extinction interval in the Late Triassic. Although a recent body of research has provided new insights into marine reptile macroevolution. many questions remain unanswered. In this thesis. I present several diverse case studies exploring the impacts of ecological opportunity and biotic perturbations in Mesozoic marine reptile macroevolution. Throughout. focus is placed on examining temporal and group-wide patterns of morphological and functional diversity (disparity) and testing rates of phenotypic evolution. Chapters 2-4 focus on Sauropterygia. the most diverse and ecologically disparate Mesozoic marine reptiles. while chapter 5 incorporates all Mesozoic marine reptiles as an inclusive adaptive assemblage.

Squamates have a long history. dating back to at least 240 million years ago (Ma). and showing increasing species richness in the Late Cretaceous (84 Ma) and Early Palaeogene (66–55 Ma). We confirm that the major expansion of dietary functional morphology happened before these diversifications. in the mid-Cretaceous. 110–90 Ma. Until that time. squamates had relatively uniform tooth types. which then diversified substantially and ecomorphospace expanded to modern levels. This coincides with the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution. when angiosperms began to take over terrestrial ecosystems. providing new roles for plant-eating and pollinating insects. which were. in turn. new sources of food for herbivorous and insectivorous squamates.

Hundreds of theoretical models have been proposed and there is much confusion about the relationship between these models. To clarify the situation. we developed a synthetic conceptual framework that delineates the conditions necessary for the evolution of altruism and cooperation. We show that at least one of the four following conditions needs to be fulfilled: direct benefits to the focal individual performing a cooperative act; direct or indirect information allowing a better than random guess about whether a given individual will behave cooperatively in repeated reciprocal interactions; preferential interactions between related individuals; and genetic correlation between genes coding for altruism and phenotypic traits that can be identified.

We propose that this association stems from pleiotropic effects of the genes regulating the synthesis of brown to black eumelanin. The most important regulators are the melanocortin 1 receptor and its ligands. the melanocortin agonists and the agouti-signalling protein antagonist. On the basis of the physiological and behavioural functions of the melanocortins. we predict five categories of traits correlated with melanin-based coloration. A review of the literature indeed reveals that. as predicted. darker wild vertebrates are more aggressive. sexually active and resistant to stress than lighter individuals.

This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants. but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero. The introduction of the Argentine ant in Europe was apparently accompanied by a dramatic loss of inter-nest aggression and the formation of two immense supercolonies (which effectively are two unicolonial populations). Introduced populations experienced only limited loss of genetic diversity at neutral markers. indicating that the breakdown of recognition ability is unlikely to be merely due to a genetic bottleneck.

That the presence of queen(s) often seems to affect worker behaviour in situations of potential conflict has given rise to the idea of queen control over reproduction. In small colonies queen control is possible via direct aggression against workers. but in large colonies queens cannot be effectively aggressive towards all the workers. This. plus evidence that queen-produced chemicals affect worker behaviour. has led to the conclusion that physical intimidation has been replaced by pheromonal queen control. whereby queen(s) chemically manipulate workers into behaving in ways that increase the queen's fitness at the worker's expense. It is argued in this paper. however. that pheromonal queen control has never conclusively been demonstrated and is evolutionarily …,True,MGzRFIoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,512,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347283710924,236853002481227475,/scholar?cites=236853002481227475,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_33D007041E33.P001/REF.pdf,0,0,0
1153608,Levels of selection in evolution,1999,Laurent Keller,66,,,,Princeton University Press,Ever since the groundbreaking work of George Williams. WD Hamilton. and Richard Dawkins. evolutionary biologists have recognized that natural selection generally does not operate for the good of the group. but rather for the good of lower-level units such as the individual. the cell. even the gene. One of the fundamental problems of biology is: what keeps competition between these various levels of natural selection from destroying the common interests to be gained from cooperation? In this volume twelve prominent scientists explore this question. presenting a comprehensive survey of the current theoretical and empirical research in evolutionary biology. Recent studies show that at many levels of biological organization. mechanisms have evolved to prevent potential conflict in natural selection. Editor Laurent Keller's aim in this book is to bring together leading researchers from all biological disciplines to outline these potential conflicts and discuss how they are resolved. A multi-level approach of this kind allows important insights into the evolution of life. as well as bridging the long-standing conceptual chasm between molecular and organismal biologists.

1153613,Why do females mate with multiple males? The sexually selected sperm hypothesis,1995,Laurent Keller and Hudson K Reeve,24,,,291-316,New York: Academic Press. 1965-,One of the more debated issues in evolutionary biology is why in many species females mate with multiple males. For females. the primary function of copulation is to fertilize their ova. If one mating provides females with sufficient sperm. and the males provide little but gametes in mating. there are no obvious reasons why females should benefit from further matings (Daly. 1978; Parker. 1979). Mating entails costs such as:(1) time and energy costs devoted to courtship and copulation;(2) increased risk of predation while mating; and (3) risk of disease from parasite transmission.(4) negative effects of some seminal fluid products transferred by males during mating. all of which may shorten the female's life-span (Daly. 1978; Thornhill and Alcock. 1983; Sherman. Seeley. and Reeve. 1988; Arnqvist. 1989. Fowler and Patridge. 1989; Chapman. Hutchings. and Partridge. 1993. 1995; Sheldon. 1993; Chapman. Liddle. Kalb. Wolfner. and Partridge. 1995; Keller. 1995).

Eusociality was once thought to occur only in termites. ants. and some bee and wasp species. but striking evolutionary convergences have recently become apparent between the societies of these insects and those of cooperatively breeding birds and mammals. These parallels have blurred distinctions between cooperative breeding and eusociality. leading to calls for either drastically restricting or expanding usage of these terms. We favor the latter approach. Cooperative breeding and eusociality are not discrete phenomena. but rather form a continuum of fundamentally similar social systems whose main differences lie in the distribution of lifetime reproductive success among group members.

We used a tracking system to continuously monitor individually tagged workers in six colonies of the ant Camponotus fellah over 41 days. Network analyses of more than 9 million interactions revealed three distinct groups that differ in behavioral repertoires. Each group represents a functional behavioral unit with workers moving from one group to the next as they age. The rate of interactions was much higher within groups than between groups. The precise information on spatial and temporal distribution of all individuals allowed us to calculate the expected rates of within- and between-group interactions.

Altruism may evolve through kin selection when the donor and recipient of altruistic acts are related to each other. as generally is the case in social birds and mammals. Similarly. social insect workers are highly related to the brood they rear when colonies are headed by a single queen. However. recent studies have shown that insect colonies frequently contain several queens. with the effect of decreasing relatedness among colony members. How can one account for the origin and maintenance of such colonies?

Here we report an extreme case of such conflicts in the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata. We found that sterile workers are produced by normal sexual reproduction. whereas daughter queens are invariably clonally produced. Because males usually develop from unfertilized maternal eggs in ants and other haplodiploid species. they normally achieve direct fitness only through diploid female offspring. Hence. although the clonal production of queens increases the queen's relatedness to reproductive daughters. it potentially reduces male reproductive success to zero. In an apparent response to this conflict between sexes. genetic analyses reveal that males reproduce clonally. most likely by eliminating the maternal half of the genome in diploid eggs.

Provided that cumulative damage has an accelerating impact on fitness. a female who has already been harmed by previous partner(s) may do best to refrain from remating to avoid suffering still further damage. Consequently. a male can gain through the imposition of mating costs. even though this may reduce female fitness because by doing so he minimizes the chances that his mate will copulate again. We develop a game theoretical model of this possibility. focusing on toxin transfer as an illustrative example. We show that toxicity as a means of inhibiting remating is phenotypically stable over a broad range of conditions (although. under some circumstances. it may be …,True,MGzRFIoAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,259,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/303392,12842490004046522638,/scholar?cites=12842490004046522638,,https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_5FA8A4DD17CD.P001/REF.pdf,0,0,0

Despite the rapid increase in available mitogenomes. the taxonomic sampling often poorly reflects phylogenetic diversity and is often also biased to represent deeper (family-level) evolutionary relationships. We present the first fully sequenced ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) mitochondrial genomes. We sampled four mitogenomes from three species of fire ants. genus Solenopsis. which represent various evolutionary depths. Overall. ant mitogenomes appear to be typical of hymenopteran mitogenomes. displaying a general A+T-bias. The Solenopsis mitogenomes are slightly more compact than other hymentoperan mitogenomes (~15.5 kb). retaining all protein coding genes. ribosomal. and transfer RNAs. We also present evidence of recombination between the mitogenomes of the two conspecific Solenopsis mitogenomes. Finally. we discuss potential ways to improve the estimation of phylogenies using complete mitochondrial genome sequences. The ant mitogenome presents an important addition to the continued efforts in studying hymenopteran mitogenome architecture. evolution. and phylogenetics. We provide further evidence that the sampling across many taxonomic levels (including conspecifics and congeners) is useful and important to gain detailed insights into mitogenome evolution.

Like other OBPs. the different fire ant OBPs share little sequence similarity (∼20%). rendering evolutionary analyses difficult.

In the eusocial Hymenoptera. queens and workers have divergent phenotypes that may be produced via either expression of alternative sets of caste-specific genes and pathways or differences in expression patterns of a shared set of multifunctional genes.

1153636,Molecular variation at a candidate gene implicated in the regulation of fire ant social behavior,2007,Dietrich Gotzek and D DeWayne Shoemaker and Kenneth G Ross,2,PloS one,11,e1088,Public Library of Science,The fire ant Solenopsis invicta and its close relatives display an important social polymorphism involving differences in colony queen number. Colonies are headed by either a single reproductive queen (monogyne form) or multiple queens (polygyne form). This variation in social organization is associated with variation at the gene Gp-9. with monogyne colonies harboring only B-like allelic variants and polygyne colonies always containing b-like variants as well. We describe naturally occurring variation at Gp-9 in fire ants based on 185 full-length sequences. 136 of which were obtained from S. invicta collected over much of its native range. While there is little overall differentiation between most of the numerous alleles observed. a surprising amount is found in the coding regions of the gene. with such substitutions usually causing amino acid replacements. This elevated coding-region variation may result from a lack of negative selection acting to constrain amino acid replacements over much of the protein. different mutation rates or biases in coding and non-coding sequences. negative selection acting with greater strength on non-coding than coding regions. and/or positive selection acting on the protein. Formal selection analyses provide evidence that the latter force played an important role in the basal b-like lineages coincident with the emergence of polygyny. While our data set reveals considerable paraphyly and polyphyly of S. invicta sequences with respect to those of other fire ant species. the b-like alleles of the socially polymorphic species are monophyletic.

An important feature of this system is that polymorphism in social organization is completely associated with allelic variation at Gp-9. such that single-queen colonies (monogyne form) include only inhabitants bearing B-like alleles while multiple-queen colonies (polygyne form) additionally include inhabitants bearing b-like alleles. A recent study of this system by Leal and Ishida (2008) made two major claims. the validity and significance of which we examine here. After reviewing existing literature. analyzing the methods and results of Leal and Ishida (2008). and generating new data from one of their study sites. we conclude that their claim that polygyny can occur in Solenopsis invicta in the U.S.A. in the absence of expression of the b-like allele Gp-9b is unfounded. Moreover. we argue that available information on insect OBPs (the family of proteins to which GP-9 belongs). on the evolutionary/population genetics of Gp-9. and on pheromonal/behavioral control of fire ant colony queen number fails to support their view that GP-9 plays no role in the chemosensory-mediated communication that underpins regulation of social organization. Our analyses lead us to conclude that there are no new reasons to question the existing consensus view of the Gp-9 system outlined in Gotzek and Ross (2007).,True,xnyxkTIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,25,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007713,10646303133651588966,/scholar?cites=10646303133651588966,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007713,0,0,0

News,,47-53,,In social insects. natural selection operates at the level of the colony. rather than the individual. but our understanding of how colony-level phenotypes arise and vary between species is lacking. Here. we test how colony-level phenotypes vary within the fire ants by measuring the composition of colonies of the tropical fire ant. Solenopsis geminata. over a wide range of sizes at multiple times throughout the year. Similar to the well-studied fire ant species S. invicta. we find that S. geminata colony composition varies strongly with colony size. such that as colonies grow they produce increasingly large workers as well as queens and males. However. major production increases more rapidly with colony size in S. geminata than in S. invicta. which may explain our observation that S. geminata also possesses a smaller maximum colony size. Unlike S. geminata or S. invicta in the USA. we find no evidence for seasonal variation in colony composition in S. geminata in Costa Rica. Solenopsis geminata colonies from Costa Rica also exhibit continuous variation in queen number. from one to two to hundreds.

A parasitoid lifestyle is one of two dominant life strategies within the hymenopteran superfamily Cynipoidea. with the other being an unusual plant-feeding behavior known as galling. Less commonly. cynipoid wasps exhibit inquilinism. a strategy where some species have adapted to usurp other species’ galls instead of inducing their own. Using a phylogenomic data set of ultraconserved elements from nearly all lineages of Cynipoidea. we here generate a robust phylogenetic framework and timescale to understand cynipoid systematics and the evolution of these life histories. Our reconstructed evolutionary history for Cynipoidea differs considerably from previous hypotheses. Rooting our analyses with non-cynipoid outgroups. the Paraulacini. a group of inquilines. emerged as sister-group to the rest of Cynipoidea. rendering the gall wasp family Cynipidae paraphyletic. The families Ibaliidae and Liopteridae. long considered archaic and early-branching parasitoid lineages. were found nested well within the Cynipoidea as sister-group to the parasitoid Figitidae. Cynipoidea originated in the early Jurassic around 190 Ma. Either inquilinism or parasitoidism is suggested as the ancestral and dominant strategy throughout the early evolution of cynipoids. depending on whether a simple (three states: parasitoidism. inquilinism and galling) or more complex (seven states: parasitoidism. inquilinism and galling split by host use) model is employed.

Solenopsis invicta Buren. and close relatives. Colony queen number is associated with a certain allele at the nuclear proteincoding locus general protein-9 (Gp-9). Multiple queen colonies (polygyny) always contain the b allele. Single queen colonies (monogyny) always and only contain the B allele. The research presented here seeks to begin to bridge the gap between molecular pattern and process in our understanding of the association between Gp-9 and polygyny in fire ants. I have sought to show how a relatively small number of the b allele carrying workers are sufficient to elicit polygyne behavior and that queen effects do not influence the acceptance of supernumerary queens. This represents an important first step into understanding the ties between individual genotypes and colony level expression of social organization.,True,xnyxkTIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/gotzek_dietrich_a_200612_phd.pdf,,,,https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/gotzek_dietrich_a_200612_phd.pdf,0,0,0

The fire ant Solenopsis invicta is characterized by a remarkable form of social polymorphism. with the presence of one or several queens per colony and the expression of other phenotypic and behavioral differences being completely associated with allelic variation at a single Mendelian factor marked by the gene Gp-9. Microarray analyses of adult workers revealed that differences in the Gp-9 genotype are associated with the differential expression of an unexpectedly small number of genes. many of which have predicted functions. implying a role in chemical communication relevant to the regulation of colony queen number. Even more surprisingly. worker gene expression profiles are more strongly influenced by indirect effects associated with the Gp-9 genotypic composition within their colony than by the direct effect of their own Gp-9 genotype.

Centromere drive predicts rapid turnover because some centromeric sequences may compete better than others during female meiosis. In addition to sequence composition. longer centromeres may have a transmission advantage. We report the first observations of extremely long centromeres. covering on average 34 % of the chromosomes. in the red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta. By comparison. cytological examination of Solenopsis geminata revealed typical small centromeric constrictions. Bioinformatics and molecular analyses identified CenSol. the major centromeric satellite DNA repeat. We found that CenSol sequences are very similar between the two species but the CenSol copy number in S. invicta is much greater than that in S. geminata. In addition. centromere expansion in S. invicta is not correlated with the duplication of CenH3. Comparative analyses revealed that several closely related fire ant species also possess long centromeres. Our results are consistent with a model of simple runaway centromere expansion due to centromere drive. We suggest expanded centromeres may be more prevalent in hymenopteran insects. which use haplodiploid sex determination. than previously considered.,True,cLG5FeIAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,18,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0760-7,17226024593832777515,/scholar?cites=17226024593832777515,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0760-7,0,0,0

Several species of Pristionchus (Nematoda: Diplogastridae). including Pristionchus pacificus. have been reported to be necromenic. i.e. to associate with beetles in their dauer diapause stage and wait until the death of their host to resume development and feed on microbes in the decomposing beetle corpse. We review the literature and suggest that the association of Pristionchus to beetles may be phoretic and not necessarily necromenic. The view that Pristionchus nematodes have a necromenic lifestyle is based on studies that have sought Pristionchus only by sampling live beetles. By surveying for nematode genera in different types of rotting vegetal matter. we found Pristionchus spp. at a similar high frequency as Caenorhabditis. often in large numbers and in feeding stages. Thus. these Pristionchus species may feed in decomposing vegetal matter. In addition. we report that one species of Panagrellus (Nematoda: Panagrolaimidae). Panagrellus redivivoides. is found in rotting fruits but not in rotting stems. with a likely association with Drosophila fruitflies. Based on our sampling and the observed distribution of feeding and dauer stages. we propose a life cycle for Pristionchus nematodes and Panagrellus redivivoides that is similar to that of C. elegans. whereby they feed on the microbial blooms on decomposing vegetal matter and are transported between food patches by coleopterans for Pristionchus spp.. fruitflies for Panagrellus redivivoides and isopods and terrestrial molluscs for C. elegans.,True,cLG5FeIAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200851,11771691817858222319,/scholar?cites=11771691817858222319,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200851,0,0,0

We explored this issue in Drosophila suzukii. an emerging model that reproduces on fresh fruit rather than in fermenting substrates like most other Drosophila.

Tsetse flies are distinguished from other Diptera by unique adaptations. including lactation and the birthing of live young (obligate viviparity). a vertebrate blood-specific diet by both sexes. and obligate bacterial symbiosis. This work describes the comparative analysis of six Glossina genomes representing three sub-genera: Morsitans (G. morsitans morsitans. G. pallidipes. G. austeni). Palpalis (G. palpalis.

Here we study the demographic history and the possible existence of local adaptation in two related species of Brassicaceae. Cardamine impatiens and Cardamine resedifolia. which occupy separate habitats along the elevation gradient. Previous genome-wide analyses revealed the occurrence of distinct selective pressures in the two species. with genes involved in cold response evolving particularly fast in C. resedifolia.

We inferred the population structure and demographic history of the two species. and tested the occurrence of signatures of local adaptation in these genes.

In the model organism Drosophila melanogaster many attempts have been made in recent years to identify such genes by conducting so-called genome scans of selection. These analyses consisted in typing a large number of genetic markers along the genomes of a sample of individuals and then identifying those loci that harbor patterns of genetic variation. which are compatible with the ones generated by a selective sweep. In this study we conduct an in-depth analysis of a genomic region located on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster that was identified as a potential target of recent positive selection by a previous genome scan of selection. To this end we re-sequenced 20 kilobases around the Flotillin-2 gene (Flo-2) and conducted a detailed analysis of the allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria observed in this new dataset.

This naturally acquired microbial flora can modulate the mosquito's vectorial capacity by inhibiting the development of Plasmodium and other human pathogens through an unknown mechanism. We have undertaken a comprehensive functional genomic approach to elucidate the molecular interplay between the bacterial co-infection and the development of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in its natural vector Anopheles gambiae. Global transcription profiling of septic and aseptic mosquitoes identified a significant subset of immune genes that were mostly up-regulated by the mosquito's microbial flora. including several anti-Plasmodium factors. Microbe-free aseptic mosquitoes displayed an increased susceptibility to Plasmodium infection while co-feeding mosquitoes with bacteria and P. falciparum gametocytes resulted in lower than normal infection levels. Infection analyses suggest the bacteria-mediated anti-Plasmodium effect is mediated by the mosquitoes' antimicrobial immune responses. plausibly through activation of basal immunity.

The advent of transcriptomics now makes it possible to test this hypothesis and compare host gene expression responses to multiple pathogens at a genome-wide scale. Here. we performed a meta-analysis of multiple published and new transcriptomes using a newly developed bioinformatics approach that filters genes based on their expression profile across datasets. Thereby. we identified common and unique molecular responses of a model host species. the honey bee (Apis mellifera). to its major pathogens and parasites: the Microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. RNA viruses. and the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor. which transmits viruses. We identified a common suite of genes and conserved molecular pathways that respond to all investigated pathogens. a result that suggests a commonality in response mechanisms to diverse pathogens. We found that genes differentially expressed after infection exhibit a higher evolutionary rate than non-differentially expressed genes. Using our new bioinformatics approach. we unveiled additional pathogen-specific responses of honey bees; we found that apoptosis appeared to be an important response following microsporidian infection. while genes from the immune signalling pathways. Toll and Imd. were differentially expressed after Varroa/virus infection.

Despite a long‐standing interest in worker DOL. the molecular mechanisms regulating this process have only been investigated in detail in honey bees. and little is known about the regulatory mechanisms operating in other social insects. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. one of the most studied ant species. workers are permanently sterile and the tasks performed are modulated by the worker's internal state (age and size) and the outside environment (social environment). which potentially includes the effect of the queen presence through chemical communication via pheromones.

The majority of studies seeking to identify the genes regulating these behaviors have been performed in systems where behavioral and physiological differences are relatively fixed. such as in the honey bee. During colony founding in the monogyne (one queen per colony) social form of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. newly-mated queens may start new colonies either individually (haplometrosis) or in groups (pleometrosis). However. only one queen (the “winner”) in pleometrotic associations survives and takes the lead of the young colony while the others (the “losers”) are executed. Thus. colony founding in fire ants provides an excellent system in which to examine the genes underpinning cooperative behavior and how the social environment shapes the expression of these genes. We developed a new whole genome microarray platform for S. invicta to characterize the gene expression patterns associated with colony founding behavior. First. we compared haplometrotic queens. pleometrotic winners and pleometrotic losers. Second. we manipulated pleometrotic couples in order to switch or maintain the social ranks of the two cofoundresses. Haplometrotic and pleometrotic queens differed in the expression of genes involved in stress response. aging. immunity. reproduction and lipid biosynthesis. Smaller sets of genes were differentially expressed between winners and losers.

One of the most intriguing groups of parasitic castrators is represented by the insects belonging to the order Strepsiptera. The macroparasite Xenos vesparum can produce dramatic phenotypic alterations in its host. the paper wasp Polistes dominula. Parasitized female wasps have undeveloped ovaries and desert the colony without performing any social task. However. very little attention has been given to the parasitic impact of X. vesparum on the male phenotype. Here. we investigated the effects of this parasite on the sexual behaviour and the morpho-physiology of P. dominula males. We found that. differently from female wasps. parasitized males are not heavily affected by Xenos: they maintain their sexual behaviour and ability to discriminate between female castes. Furthermore. the structure of their reproductive apparatus is not compromised by the parasite.

Plasmatocytes differ from prohemocytes being larger. showing lower nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and they possess many phagolysosomes. The substantial uniformity of most subcellular features and the presence of “intermediate forms” support the “single-cell theory” i.e.. there is only one cell line that originates from the prohemocyte and leads to the granular cell passing through the plasmatocyte.

However. understanding of the genetic underpinnings of these changes is limited. Honey bees are both a model system in behavioural genomics. and the dominant managed pollinator of human crops; consequently understanding the mating process has both pure and applied value. We used next-generation transcriptomics to probe changes in gene expression in the brains of honey bee queens. as they transition from virgin to mated reproductive status. In addition. we used CO2-narcosis. which induces oviposition without mating. to isolate the process of reproductive maturation. The mating process produced significant changes in the expression of vision. chemo-reception. metabolic. and immune-related genes. Differential expression of these genes maps clearly onto known behavioural and physiological changes that occur during the transition from being a virgin queen to a newly-mated queen. A subset of these changes in gene expression were also detected in CO2-treated queens. as predicted from previous physiological studies. In addition. we compared our results to previous studies that used microarray techniques across a range of experimental time-points. Changes in expression of immune- and vision-related genes were common to all studies. supporting an involvement of these groups of genes in the mating process.

1153726,Fire ant viruses: host-parasite dynamics and transcriptomics of the infection,2014,Fabio Manfredini and DeWayne Shoemaker and Christina Grozinger,,,,,IUSSI,The fire ant Solenopsis invicta is an invasive pest at a global scale. In most recent invasive ranges such as South-East Asia and Australia. fire ant colonies are not affected by natural parasites. as predicted by the Enemy Release Hypothesis. Conversely. in less recent areas of expansion such as North America. fire ants are commonly infected by microsporidia and viruses. These parasites can have a negative impact on fire ant colonies. in particular after translocation from the field to the lab. In this study. we characterized the association between two RNA viruses (SINV-1 and SINV-2) and S. invicta founding queens at multiple levels. by examining the dynamics of the infection and correlating this with changes in the physiology and transcriptome of infected queens. We collected newly mated queens and we reared them in the lab for two months. The two viruses showed different patterns of infection. with SINV-1 infecting more queens than SINV-2 at time 0 while SINV-2 was detected more frequently after one and two months. SINV-2 infection was also associated with lower fertility in founding queens (fewer eggs produced) while SINV-1 infection had no visible effect on queens fitness. Finally. transcriptomic analysis with whole-genome microarrays on a subset of queens revealed that viral infection altered the expression of~ 4000 genes. many of which related to reproductive functions and immune processes. Interestingly. infection by SINV-2 alone or coinfection by both viruses altered the expression of these genes more than infection by SINV-1. despite the fact that SINV-1 was more prevalent than SINV-2 as revealed by subsequent quantification of …,True,CbJWCx8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/11041/OR351.pdf?sequence=2,,,,,0,0,0

In contrast to previous studies that have associated the 1.3 Mb genome of Ca. Pelagibacter ubique with the less than 1.5 Mb genomes of the Rickettsiales. our phylogenetic analysis suggests that Ca. Pelagibacter ubique is most closely related to soil and aquatic Alphaproteobacteria with large genomes. This implies that the SAR11 clade and the Rickettsiales have undergone genome reduction independently. A gene flux analysis of 46 representative alphaproteobacterial genomes indicates the loss of more than 800 genes in each of Ca. Pelagibacter ubique and the Rickettsiales.

Species for which genome data are available have been classified into a species tree based on a conserved set of vertically inherited core genes. By mapping the variation in gene content onto the species tree. genomic changes can be associated with adaptations to specific growth niches. Genes for adaptive traits are mostly located in ‘plasticity zones’ in the bacterial genome. which also contain mobile elements and are highly variable across strains. By physically separating genes for information processing from genes involved in interactions with the surrounding environment. the rate of evolutionary change can be substantially enhanced for genes underlying adaptation to new growth habitats. possibly explaining the ecological success of the α …,True,wCMYviUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,86,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2008.0793,17394633512148023632,/scholar?cites=17394633512148023632,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2679921/,0,0,0

Anoxybacillus flavithermus is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium found in super-saturated silica solutions and in opaline silica sinter. The ability of A. flavithermus to grow in super-saturated silica solutions makes it an ideal subject to study the processes of sinter formation. which might be similar to the biomineralization processes that occurred at the dawn of life. We report here the complete genome sequence of A. flavithermus strain WK1. isolated from the waste water drain at the Wairakei geothermal power station in New Zealand. It consists of a single chromosome of 2.846.746 base pairs and is predicted to encode 2.863 proteins. In silico genome analysis identified several enzymes that could be involved in silica adaptation and biofilm formation. and their predicted functions were experimentally validated in vitro. Proteomic analysis confirmed the regulation of biofilm-related proteins and crucial enzymes for the synthesis of long-chain polyamines as constituents of silica nanospheres. Microbial fossils preserved in silica and silica sinters are excellent objects for studying ancient life. a new paleobiological frontier.

A novel putative GTA was recently discovered in the mouse-infecting bacterium Bartonella grahamii. Although GTAs are widespread in phylogenetically diverse bacteria. their role in evolution is largely unknown. Here. we present a comparative analysis of 16 Bartonella genomes ranging from 1.4 to 2.6 Mb in size. including six novel genomes from Bartonella isolated from a cow. two moose. two dogs. and a kangaroo. A phylogenetic tree inferred from 428 orthologous core genes indicates that the deadly human pathogen B. bacilliformis is related to the ruminant-adapted clade. rather than being the earliest diverging species in the genus as previously thought. A gene flux analysis identified 12 genes for a GTA and a phage-derived origin of replication as the most conserved innovations. These are located in a region of a few hundred kb that also contains 8 insertions of gene clusters for type III. IV. and V secretion systems. and genes for putatively secreted molecules such as cholera-like toxins. The phylogenies indicate a recent transfer of seven genes in the virB gene cluster for a type IV secretion system from a cat-adapted B. henselae to a dog-adapted B. vinsonii strain. We show that the B. henselae GTA is functional and can transfer genes in vitro. We suggest that the maintenance of the GTA is driven by selection to increase the likelihood of horizontal gene transfer and argue that this process is beneficial at the population level. by facilitating adaptive evolution of the host-adaptation systems and thereby expansion of the host range size.

On the residual cumulative G+C content curve. a G+C-rich 19-kb region was observed. This sequence is part of a 100-kb chromosome region. containing 100 highly co-oriented ORFs. flanked by two 17-bp direct repeats. Two identical gly-tRNA genes in tandem are present at the proximal end of this genetic element. Several mobility genes encoding transposases and bacteriophage-related proteins are located within this chromosome region. Thus. this region largely fulfills the criteria of GIs. The G+C content analysis shows that several modules compose this GI. Surprisingly. one of them encodes all genes essential for F-like conjugative DNA transfer (traF. traG. traH. traN. traU. traW. and trbC). involved in sex pilus retraction and mating pair stabilization. strongly suggesting that. similarly to the other F-like operons. the parachlamydial tra unit is devoted to DNA transfer. A close relatedness of this tra unit to F-like tra operons involved in conjugative transfer is confirmed by phylogenetic analyses performed on concatenated genes and gene order conservation. These analyses and that of gly-tRNA distribution in 140 GIs suggest a proteobacterial origin of the parachlamydial tra unit.

Here. we present the draft genome sequence of a strain isolated in Sweden from a patient who had travelled to Tunisia in 2010 (E112/10) and was found to differ from the outbreak strains by only 38 SNPs in non-repetitive regions. 16 of which were mapped to the branch to the outbreak strain. We identified putatively adaptive mutations in genes for transporters. outer surface proteins and enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates. A comparative analysis with other historical strains showed that E112/10 contained Shiga toxin prophage genes of the same genotype as the outbreak strain. while these genes have been replaced by a different genotype in two otherwise very closely related strains isolated in the Republic of Georgia in 2009. We also present the genome sequences of two enteroaggregative E. coli strains affiliated with phylogroup A (C43/90 and C48/93) that contain the agg genes for the AAF/I-type fimbriae characteristic of the outbreak population. Interestingly. C43/90 also contained a tet/mer antibiotic resistance island that was nearly identical in sequence to that of the outbreak strain. while the corresponding island in the Georgian strains was most similar to E. coli strains of other serotypes.

Although Blastocystis has been linked to intestinal disorders. its pathogenicity remains controversial because most carriers are asymptomatic. Here. the genome sequence of Blastocystis subtype (ST) 1 is presented and compared to previously published sequences for ST4 and ST7. Despite a conserved core of genes. there is unexpected diversity between these STs in terms of their genome sizes. guanine-cytosine (GC) content. intron numbers. and gene content. ST1 has 6.544 protein-coding genes. which is several hundred more than reported for ST4 and ST7. The percentage of proteins unique to each ST ranges from 6.2% to 20.5%. greatly exceeding the differences observed within parasite genera. Orthologous proteins also display extreme divergence in amino acid sequence identity between STs (i.e.. 59%–61% median identity). on par with observations of the most distantly related species pairs of parasite genera. The STs also display substantial variation in gene family distributions and sizes. especially for protein kinase and protease gene families. which could reflect differences in virulence. It remains to be seen to what extent these inter-ST differences persist at the intra-ST level. A full 26% of genes in ST1 have stop codons that are created on the mRNA level by a novel polyadenylation mechanism found only in Blastocystis. Reconstructions of pathways and organellar systems revealed that ST1 has a relatively complete membrane-trafficking system and a near-complete meiotic toolkit. possibly …,True,8FOe6yMAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC,57,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003769,2443821337935876703,/scholar?cites=2443821337935876703,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003769,0,0,0

Up to now. it has been described only in Metazoa. Other eukaryotes present a variety of structures implied in the last steps of cell division. such as the septum in fungi or the phragmoplast in plants. However. it is unclear whether these structures are homologous (derive from a common ancestral structure) or analogous (have distinct evolutionary origins). Recently. the proteome of the hamster midbody has been characterized and 160 proteins identified.  Methodology/Principal Findings Using phylogenomic approaches. we show here that nearly all of these 160 proteins (95%) are conserved across metazoan lineages. More surprisingly. we show that a large part of the mammalian midbody components (91 proteins) were already present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes (LECA) and were most likely involved in the construction of a complex multi-protein assemblage acting in cell division.  Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that the midbodies of non-mammalian metazoa are likely very similar to the mammalian one and that the ancestor of Metazoa possessed a nearly modern midbody. Moreover. our analyses support the hypothesis that the midbody and the structures involved in cytokinesis in other eukaryotes derive from a large and complex structure present in LECA. likely involved in cytokinesis.

There is evidence that biochar amendment causes fundamental changes in soil nutrient cycles. often resulting in marked increases in crop production. particularly in acidic and in infertile soils with low soil organic matter contents. although comparable outcomes in temperate soils are variable. We offer insight into the mechanisms underlying these findings by focusing attention on the soil nitrogen (N) cycle. specifically on hitherto unmeasured processes of organic N cycling in arable soils. We here investigated the impacts of biochar addition on soil organic and inorganic N pools and on gross transformation rates of both pools in a biochar field trial on arable land (Chernozem) in Traismauer. Lower Austria. We found that biochar increased total soil organic carbon but decreased the extractable organic C pool and soil nitrate. While gross rates of organic N transformation processes were reduced by 50–80%. gross N mineralization of organic N was not affected. In contrast. biochar promoted soil ammonia-oxidizer populations (bacterial and archaeal nitrifiers) and accelerated gross nitrification rates more than two-fold. Our findings indicate a de-coupling of the soil organic and inorganic N cycles. with a build-up of organic N. and deceleration of inorganic N release from this pool. The results therefore suggest that addition of inorganic fertilizer-N in combination with biochar could compensate for the reduction in organic N mineralization. with plants and microbes drawing on fertilizer-N for growth. in turn …,True,i9rHLcYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,185,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086388,14729073163621980959,/scholar?cites=14729073163621980959,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086388,0,0,0

1153853,Polysaccharide degradation potential of bacterial communities in Arctic deep-sea sediments (1200-5500 m water depth),2016,Josephine Z Rapp and Christina Bienhold and Pierre Offre and Antje Boetius,,,,,,The majority of the Earth’s surface is covered by fine-grained deep-sea sediments. with bacteria dominating total benthic biomass. These benthic bacterial communities depend on organic matter input from the upper ocean. but as they comprise mostly unknown and uncultivated taxa. we have very limited knowledge of their enzymatic machinery to break down this material. Here we studied deep-sea surface sediments along a seafloor depth gradient from 1000 to 5500 m at the Arctic long-term ecological research station HAUSGARTEN. We applied Illumina 16S rRNA gene surveys based on DNA and cDNA and metagenomic sequencing to elucidate total and active bacterial community composition. and the key functional potentials. Some sequence-dominant taxa of the total community (e.g. members of the Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria) were underrepresented in the cDNA fraction. while other groups (e.g. Flavobacteriaceae; SAR202 clade) were overrepresented in the active fraction when compared to total community reads. We used the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (http://www.cazy.org) to identify protein families in the generated metagenomes. which are associated with polysaccharide degradation. e.g. glycoside hydrolases. We found the same families of glycoside hydrolases in all metagenomes. but their relative contribution to glycoside hydrolase-coding genes varied according to depth. A larger number of hydrolases involved in polysaccharide degradation of algae material (e.g. for laminarin; xylan) was found at shallower depths. while those responsible for the breakdown of bacterial cell walls (e.g. for components of …,True,i9rHLcYAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,3,https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/41571/,17703277381293831182,/scholar?cites=17703277381293831182,,https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/41571/1/ISME_JRapp_Poster_final.pdf,0,0,0

These markers represent only a fraction of the genes that were likely present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). but are useful for deep phylogenetic reconstructions because their mode of inheritance appears to be mainly vertical. which satisfies the assumptions of gene concatenation and supertree methods. Previous phylogenetic analyses of these genes recovered a long branch between Archaea and Bacteria. By contrast. a recent study made use of a greatly expanded set of 381 marker genes and recovered a much shorter branch length between Archaea and Bacteria. comparable to some divergences within the domains. These analyses suggest that the apparent deep split between Archaea and Bacteria may be the result of accelerated evolution of ribosomal genes. Here we re-evaluate the evolutionary history of the expanded marker gene set and show that substitutional saturation. inter-domain gene transfer. hidden paralogy. and poor model fit contribute to the inference of an artificially shortened inter-domain branch. Our results do not exclude a moderately faster rate of ribosomal gene evolution during the divergence of Archaea and Bacteria. but indicate that vertically-evolving marker genes across all functional categories support a major genetic divergence between the two primary domains of life.,True,i9rHLcYAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.427276v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/20/2021.01.19.427276.full.pdf,0,0,0

Bacteria dominate benthic communities both in biomass and abundance. and have been recognized as the key players in the remineralization of organic material. Since most sediment bacteria remain however uncultivated and represent unknown taxa. we have very limited knowledge of their metabolic capabilities and enzymatic machinery. Here we studied deep-sea surface sediments along a seafloor depth gradient from 1200 m to 5500 m at the Arctic long-term ecological research station HAUSGARTEN. We applied Illumina 16S rRNA gene surveys based on DNA and cDNA. as well as metagenomic and -transcriptomic sequencing to elucidate total and active bacterial community composition and gain insight into the carbohydrate processing and uptake capabilities of deep-sea benthic bacteria. We identified specific taxa of interest and quantified their cellular abundance using CAtalyzed Reporter Deposition–Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization.  Results from the different molecular approaches were in good agreement and suggested similar community structures with the same dominant members. Interestingly. typically predominant sediment taxa. i.e. the JTB255 marine group. the Sh765B.TzT29 group or the OM1 clade. were underrepresented in the active part of the community. while other usually low-abundant taxa. i.e. Flavobacteriia and the SAR202 clade. were overrepresented.

1153856,Towards an integrated microbial observatory in the Arctic Ocean,2016,Eduard Fadeev and Josephine Rapp and Pierre Offre and Ian Salter and Christina Bienhold and Antje Boetius,,,,,,The Fram Strait separates Northeast Greenland from the Svalbard Archipelago. and is the only deep connection to the Arctic Ocean. Therefore. this strait is the only gateway for direct exchange of intermediate and deep waters between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic. Two main currents influence the exchanges: i) the West Spitsbergen Current. bringing Atlantic waters northwards. and ii) the East Greenland Current. which carries cold Arctic waters and ice southwards. These two currents consist of water masses with different origin. generate distinct physical and chemical conditions between the eastern and western parts of the strait. which effects the biological characteristics in this region. Oceanographic observations in the Fram Strait have been carried out for ~15 years with microbial research in the water column focusing mainly on eukaryotes. while very little exploratory work was conducted on pelagic Bacteria and Archaea. Here we present a preliminary report of the first extensive survey across the waters of the Fram Strait focused on Bacterial and Archaeal domains. conducted as part of the Arctic long-term observatory HAUSGARTEN annual expedition in summer 2016. Besides the investigation of “who is out there”. the observations gained in this survey will be integrated with other biological and physical data of the long-term observatory framework and will provide an essential step towards the understanding of the biochemical dynamics in the Fram Strait.

This has resulted in a steadily growing collection of marker sequences. most notably of the small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene. and an increased understanding of microbial phylogeny. diversity and community composition patterns. However. to utilize these large datasets together with new sequencing technologies. a reliable and flexible system for taxonomic classification is critical. We developed CREST (Classification Resources for Environmental Sequence Tags). a set of resources and tools for generating and utilizing custom taxonomies and reference datasets for classification of environmental sequences. CREST uses an alignment-based classification method with the lowest common ancestor algorithm. It also uses explicit rank similarity criteria to reduce false positives and identify novel taxa. We implemented this method in a web server. a command line tool and the graphical user interfaced program MEGAN. Further. we provide the SSU rRNA reference database and taxonomy SilvaMod. derived from the publicly available SILVA SSURef. for classification of sequences from bacteria. archaea and eukaryotes. Using cross-validation and environmental datasets. we compared the performance of CREST and SilvaMod to the RDP Classifier.

The results were compared with previously obtained data from the more active G11 pockmark. characterized by higher methane flux. A downcore stratification and high relative abundance of ANME was observed in both cores. with transition from an ANME-2a/b dominated community in low-sulfide and low-methane horizons to ANME-1 dominance in horizons near the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The stratification was over a wider spatial region and at greater depth in the core with lower methane flux. and the total 16S rRNA copy numbers were two orders of magnitude lower than in the sediments at G11 pockmark. A fine-scale view into the ANME communities at each location was achieved through OTU clustering of ANME-affiliated sequences. The majority of ANME-1 sequences from both sampling sites clustered within one OTU. while ANME-2a/b sequences were represented in unique OTUs. We suggest that free living ANME-1 is the most abundant taxon in Nyegga cold seeps. and also the main consumer of methane.

However. the microbial community of the non-filtering carnivorous sponges (Porifera. Cladorhizidae) has been the subject of less scrutiny. Here. we present the results from a comparative study of the methanotrophic carnivorous sponge Cladorhiza methanophila from a mud volcano-rich area at the Barbados Accretionary Prism (BAP). and five carnivorous species from the Jan Mayen Vent Field (JMVF) at the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge.

However. the potential effect of extracellular DNA. arising from dead or moribund cells. on sequencing surveys is a critical concern that has largely not been addressed for marine sedimentary habitats. To address this concern. we interrogated freshly collected Arctic and Pacific sediment for extracellular 16S rRNA genes using the photoactive DNA-binding dye Propidium Monoazide. Significant differences between relative abundances of total (intracellular + extracellular) Bacterial 16S rRNA genes and relative abundances of intracellular Bacterial 16S rRNA genes are only detected in three of twelve shallow [10 cm below seafloor (cmbsf)] samples. Relative abundances of total Bacterial 16S rRNA genes are statistically indistinguishable from relative abundances of intracellular Bacterial 16S rRNA genes in all interrogated samples from depths greater than 10 cmbsf. 16S rRNA gene sequencing shows that even where significantly higher abundances of extracellular genes are detected. they have little or no influence on prokaryote community composition.

In anoxic environments C1-utilizing microbes (methylotrophs) play an important role in controlling 25 global carbon degradation. Currently described anaerobic methylotrophs are limited to methanogenic archaea. acetogenic bacteria. and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Here. we report the first archaeal lineage outside of methanogenic taxa that are capable of anaerobic methylotrophy. Phylogenetic analyses suggest these archaea form a new phylum within the TACK superphylum. which we propose be named Brockarchaeota. A survey revealed 30 Brockarchaeota are globally distributed in geothermal springs. Metabolic inference from 15 metagenome-assembled genomes from hot springs and deep-sea sediments indicates that Brockarchaeota are strict anaerobes. They contain a variety C1 metabolisms including the methanol and trimethylamine methyltransferases system. the ribulose bisphosphate pathway coupled with the non-oxidative pentoses phosphate pathway. and reductive glycine 35 pathway.

Cultivation-independent approaches have revealed the existence of at least ten archaeal lineages whose members have small cell and genome sizes and limited metabolic capabilities and together comprise the tentative DPANN archaea. However. the phylogenetic diversity of DPANN and the placement of the various lineages of this group in the archaeal tree remain debated. Here. we reconstructed additional metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) of a thus far uncharacterized archaeal phylum-level lineage UAP2 (Candidatus Undinarchaeota) affiliating with DPANN archaea. Comparative genome analyses revealed that members of the Undinarchaeota have small estimated genome sizes and. while potentially being able to conserve energy through fermentation. likely depend on partner organisms for the acquisition of vitamins. amino acids and other metabolites. Phylogenomic analyses robustly recovered Undinarchaeota as a major independent lineage between two highly supported clans of DPANN: one clan comprising Micrarchaeota. Altiarchaeota and Diapherotrites. and another encompassing all other DPANN. Our analyses also suggest that DPANN archaea may have exchanged core genes with their hosts by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). adding to the difficulty of placing DPANN in the archaeal tree.

They were described as a separate domain of life by C.R. Woese and coworkers in 1977 following a sequencing comparison of small ribosomal RNAs (rRNA).Archaea possess numerous unique features. including their genetic or structural characteristics. Beyond extremophile. they have been found to be widespread in numerous ecosystems. including the digestive tracts of holobionts. The archaea tree of life is highly dynamic. and novel discoveries fuel hypotheses on the evolution of life on Earth. Archaeal viruses are structurally diverse and not well characterized yet.

Soil bacteria can colonize the rhizosphere and roots of plants and influence plant growth via interference with hormones. mobilization of nutrients or suppression of phytopathogens. With the advances in the last years. we begin to understand the structure of the root and rhizosphere bacterial microbiota and the factors that influence community assembly. However. remarkably little is known about the stability and functional abilities of bacteria in a community context. To address these gaps. two approaches were undertaken that will be discussed in two chapters within this study.  In the first chapter. I compared root bacterial communities of the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Cardamine hirsuta and Arabis alpina to the corresponding soil microbiota by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries. Further. A. alpina was used as a model system to dissect the influence of residence time of plants in the soil. plant developmental stage and growth under natural conditions on bacterial community structure using Illumina sequencing. Additionally. I isolated bacteria from roots of the three plants species and assessed their influence on plant growth. Using this experimental setup. I demonstrated that the tested Brassicaceae plant species assembled highly similar bacterial root communities and only few quantitative differences allowed to distinguish the three host plant species. By this a shared bacterial microbiota was defined that consisted of a few bacterial families.

These markers represent only a fraction of the genes that were likely present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). but are useful for deep phylogenetic reconstructions because their mode of inheritance appears to be mainly vertical. which satisfies the assumptions of gene concatenation and supertree methods. Previous phylogenetic analyses of these genes recovered a long branch between Archaea and Bacteria. By contrast. a recent study made use of a greatly expanded set of 381 marker genes and recovered a much shorter branch length between Archaea and Bacteria. comparable to some divergences within the domains. These analyses suggest that the apparent deep split between Archaea and Bacteria may be the result of accelerated evolution of ribosomal genes. Here we re-evaluate the evolutionary history of the expanded marker gene set and show that substitutional saturation. inter-domain gene transfer. hidden paralogy. and poor model fit contribute to the inference of an artificially shortened inter-domain branch. Our results do not exclude a moderately faster rate of ribosomal gene evolution during the divergence of Archaea and Bacteria. but indicate that vertically-evolving marker genes across all functional categories support a major genetic divergence between the two primary domains of life.,True,KmsnV2MAAAAJ:DyXnQzXoVgIC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.427276v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/20/2021.01.19.427276.full.pdf,0,0,0

Unlike other viruses. Mimivirus and its NCLDV relatives encode homologs of broadly conserved informational genes found in Bacteria. Archaea. and Eukaryotes. raising the possibility that they could be placed on the tree of life. A recent phylogenetic analysis of these genes showed the NCLDVs emerging as a monophyletic group branching between Eukaryotes and Archaea. These trees were interpreted as evidence for an independent “fourth domain” of life that may have contributed DNA processing genes to the ancestral eukaryote. However. the analysis of ancient evolutionary events is challenging. and tree reconstruction is susceptible to bias resulting from non-phylogenetic signals in the data. These include compositional heterogeneity and homoplasy. which can lead to the spurious grouping of compositionally-similar or fast-evolving sequences. Here. we show that these informational gene alignments contain both significant compositional heterogeneity and homoplasy. which were not adequately modelled in the original analysis. When we use more realistic evolutionary models that better fit the data. the resulting trees are unable to reject a simple null hypothesis in which these informational genes. like many other NCLDV genes. were acquired by horizontal transfer from eukaryotic hosts.

The fish-infecting microsporidian Spraguea lophii shows one of the most striking host cell manipulations known for these parasites. converting host nervous tissue into swollen spore factories known as xenomas. In order to investigate the basis of these interactions between microsporidian and host. we sequenced and analyzed the S. lophii genome. Although. like other microsporidia. S. lophii has lost many of the protein families typical of model eukaryotes. we identified a number of gene family expansions including a family of leucine-rich repeat proteins that may represent pathogenicity factors. Building on our comparative genomic analyses. we exploited the large numbers of spores that can be obtained from xenomas to identify potential effector proteins experimentally. We used complex-mix proteomics to identify proteins released by the parasite upon germination. resulting in the first experimental isolation of putative secreted effector proteins in a microsporidian.

Vigorous ongoing debate about eukaryote origins is based on assertions that the topology of the tree of life depends on the taxa included and the choice and quality of genomic data analysed. Here we have reanalysed the evidence underpinning those claims and apply more data to the question by using supertree and coalescent methods to interrogate> 3.000 gene families in archaea and eukaryotes. We find that eukaryotes consistently originate from within the archaea in a two-domains tree when due consideration is given to the fit between model and data.

Here we show that hif alpha genes were duplicated in the teleost specific whole‐genome duplication. Although one of each paralogous gene pair was lost in most teleosts. both copies were retained in cyprinids. Computational analyses suggest that these duplicates have become subfunctionalized with complementary changes in coding and regulatory sequences within each paralogous gene pair.

We have investigated the evolution. cellular locations and substrate specificities of a family of nucleotide transport (NTT) proteins from Trachipleistophora hominis. a microsporidian isolated from an HIV/AIDS patient. Transport proteins are critical to microsporidian success because they compensate for the dramatic loss of metabolic pathways that is a hallmark of the group. Our data demonstrate that the use of plasma membrane-located nucleotide transport proteins (NTT) is a key strategy adopted by microsporidians to exploit host cells. Acquisition of an ancestral transporter gene at the base of the microsporidian radiation was followed by lineage-specific events of gene duplication. which in the case of T. hominis has generated four paralogous NTT transporters. All four T. hominis NTT proteins are located predominantly to the plasma membrane of replicating intracellular cells where they can mediate transport at the host-parasite interface. In contrast to published data for Encephalitozoon cuniculi. we found no evidence for the location for any of the T. hominis NTT transporters to its minimal mitochondria (mitosomes). consistent with lineage-specific differences in transporter and mitosome evolution.

One hypothesis that has achieved recent prominence suggests that the first role of the cyanobiont was in energy provision for a host cell whose reserves were being depleted by an intracellular chlamydial pathogen. A pivotal claim is that it was chlamydial proteins themselves that converted otherwise unusable cyanobacterial metabolites into host energy stores. We test this hypothesis by investigating the origins of the key enzymes using sophisticated phylogenetics.

To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of adaptation. we sequenced the 13.7-megabase genome of G. sulphuraria. This alga shows an enormous metabolic flexibility. growing either photoautotrophically or heterotrophically on more than 50 carbon sources. Environmental adaptation seems to have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer from various bacteria and archaea. often followed by gene family expansion. At least 5% of protein-coding genes of G. sulphuraria were probably acquired horizontally.

Despite a conserved core of genes. there is unexpected diversity between these STs in terms of their genome sizes. guanine-cytosine (GC) content. intron numbers. and gene content. ST1 has 6.544 protein-coding genes. which is several hundred more than reported for ST4 and ST7.

The distribution of this pathway among eukaryotes has been thought to be very limited. with only two specialized groups living in low oxygen environments (Parabasalia and Diplomonadida) known to possess the complete set of all three enzymes. We have performed an extensive survey of available sequence data in order to map the distribution of these enzymes among eukaryotes and to reconstruct their phylogenies. We have found genes for the complete pathway in almost all examined representatives of Metamonada. the anaerobic protist group that includes parabasalids and diplomonads. Phylogenetic analyses indicate the presence of the complete pathway in the last common ancestor of metamonads and heterologous transformation experiments suggest its cytosolic localization in the metamonad ancestor. Outside Metamonada. the complete pathway occurs rarely. nevertheless. it was found in representatives of most major eukaryotic clades. Phylogenetic relationships of complete pathways are consistent with the presence of the Archaea-derived ADI pathway in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. although other evolutionary scenarios remain possible. The presence of the incomplete set of enzymes is relatively common among eukaryotes and it may be related to the fact that these enzymes are involved in other cellular processes. such as the ornithine-urea cycle.

It is expected that organisms inhabiting a common niche may exchange their genes even more often due to their physical proximity and similar demands. One such niche is anaerobic or microaerophilic environments in some sediments and intestines of animals. Indeed. enzymes advantageous for metabolism in these environments often exhibit an evolutionary history incoherent with the history of their hosts indicating potential transfers. The evolutionary paths of some very basic enzymes for energy metabolism of anaerobic eukaryotes (pyruvate formate lyase. pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. [FeFe]hydrogenase and arginine deiminase) seems to be particularly intriguing and although their histories are not identical they share several unexpected features in common.

Dordrecht,While many multicellular anaerobes possess mitochondria that resemble those of aerobic eukaryotes. microbial eukaryotes that live exclusively in anoxic and low oxygen environments harbor mitochondrion-related organelles (MROs). Currently. these organelles are broadly classified as either hydrogenosomes (anaerobic ATP-producing organelles that produce molecular hydrogen) or mitosomes (organelles that do not generate ATP); however. ongoing studies of diverse microbial lineages are revealing a wider spectrum of functional types. In adaptation to low oxygen conditions. the MROs of anaerobic eukaryotes have acquired unique characteristics. some of which do not appear to derive from the α-proteobacterium that gave rise to the ancestral mitochondrion.

Unlike other diplomonad parasites. such as the human pathogen Giardia intestinalis. Spironucleus species can infiltrate the blood stream of their hosts eventually colonizing organs. skin and gills. How this presumed anaerobe can persist and invade oxygenated tissues. despite having a strictly anaerobic metabolism. remains elusive. To investigate how S. salmonicida response to oxygen stress. we performed RNAseq transcriptomic analyses of cells grown in the presence of oxygen or antioxidant-free medium. We found that over 20% of the transcriptome is differentially regulated in oxygen (1705 genes) and antioxidant-depleted (2280 genes) conditions. These differentially regulated transcripts encode proteins related to anaerobic metabolism. cysteine and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. as well as a large number of proteins of unknown function. S. salmonicida does not encode genes involved in the classical elements of oxygen metabolism (e.g.. catalases. superoxide dismutase. glutathione biosynthesis. oxidative phosphorylation). Instead. we found that genes encoding bacterial-like oxidoreductases were upregulated in response to oxygen stress. Phylogenetic analysis revealed some of these oxygen-responsive genes (e.g.. nadh oxidase. rubrerythrin. superoxide reductase) are rare in eukaryotes and likely derived from lateral gene transfer (LGT) events into diplomonads from prokaryotes.

The Integrin Mediated Adhesion Complex (IMAC). mediates various cell physiological process. The IMAC was thought to be an animal specific machinery until over the last decade these complexes were discovered in Obazoa. the group containing animals. fungi. and several microbial eukaryote lineages.  Amoebozoa is the eukaryotic supergroup sister to Obazoa. Even though Amoebozoa represents the closest outgroup to Obazoa. little genomic-level data and attention to gene inventories has been given to the supergroup. To examine the evolutionary history of the IMAC. we examine gene inventories of deeply sampled set of 100+ Amoebozoa taxa. including new data from several taxa. From these robust data sampled from the entire breadth of known amoebozoan clades. we show the presence of an ancestral complex of integrin adhesion proteins that predate the evolution of the Amoebozoa. Our results highlight that many of these proteins appear to have evolved earlier in eukaryote evolution than previously thought.

Gene tree–species tree reconciliation methods model these processes by drawing gene trees into the species tree using a series of gene and species-level events. The reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alone almost always involves choosing between statistically equivalent or weakly distinguishable relationships that could be much better resolved based on a putative species tree. To exploit this potential for accurate reconstruction of gene trees. the space of reconciled gene trees must be explored according to a joint model of sequence evolution and gene tree–species tree reconciliation.

Linkage generates interference interactions. by which simultaneously occurring mutations affect each other’s chance of fixation. Here. we develop a comprehensive model of adaptive evolution in linked genomes. which integrates interference interactions between multiple beneficial and deleterious mutations into a unified framework. By an approximate analytical solution. we predict the fixation rates of these mutations. as well as the probabilities of beneficial and deleterious alleles at fixed genomic sites. We find that interference interactions generate a regime of emergent neutrality: all genomic sites with selection coefficients smaller in magnitude than a characteristic threshold have nearly random fixed alleles. and both beneficial and deleterious mutations at these sites have nearly neutral fixation rates.

In the presence of lateral gene transfer. however. this may not be the case. because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species. we must describe the evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species. the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing working memory function in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls was performed. Following a comprehensive literature search. meta-analyses were conducted on 36 measures of phonological. visuospatial and central executive working memory functioning. encompassing 441 separate results from 187 different studies.Results. Statistically significant effect sizes were found for all working memory measures. indicating deficits in schizophrenia groups. Some of these were robust findings in the absence of evidence of significant heterogeneity or publication bias. Meta-regression analyses showed that the working memory deficit was not simply explained by discrepancies in current IQ between schizophrenia and control groups.Conclusions. Large deficits in working memory were demonstrated in schizophrenia groups across all three working memory domains. There were. however. no clear differences across subdomains or between particular working memory tasks. There was substantial heterogeneity across results that could only be partly explained.,True,J8P1wnwAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,496,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Lawrie/publication/23409327_Working_memory_in_schizophrenia_A_meta-analysis/links/54196a700cf2218008bf75f2.pdf,12557216343533076850,/scholar?cites=12557216343533076850,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Lawrie/publication/23409327_Working_memory_in_schizophrenia_A_meta-analysis/links/54196a700cf2218008bf75f2.pdf,0,0,0

This work is principally being conducted along two empirical fronts: genetics—quantitative and molecular—and brain imaging. Quantitative genetic studies have established that there are additive genetic contributions to different aspects of cognitive ability—especially general intelligence—and how they change through the lifespan. Molecular genetic studies have yet to identify reliably reproducible contributions from individual genes. Structural and functional brain-imaging studies have identified differences in brain pathways. especially parieto-frontal pathways. that contribute to intelligence differences.

Recent studies have identified biomarkers of chronological age based on DNA methylation levels. It is not yet known whether DNA methylation age captures aspects of biological age. Here we test whether differences between people’s chronological ages and estimated ages. DNA methylation age. predict all-cause mortality in later life. The difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age (Δage) was calculated in four longitudinal cohorts of older people. Meta-analysis of proportional hazards models from the four cohorts was used to determine the association between Δage and mortality. A 5-year higher Δage is associated with a 21% higher mortality risk. adjusting for age and sex. After further adjustments for childhood IQ. education. social class. hypertension. diabetes. cardiovascular disease. and APOE e4 status. there is a 16% increased mortality risk for those with a 5-year higher Δage. A pedigree-based heritability analysis of Δage was conducted in a separate cohort. The heritability of Δage was 0.43.

1154083,Looking down on human intelligence: From psychometrics to the brain,2000,Ian J Deary,,,,,Oxford University Press,What is it about human brains that make some people more capable than others? In an authoritative and critical account. Professor Ian Dreary reviews historical. cognitive. and biological research on the foundations of human mental ability. Where most previous accounts of intelligence have examined how human mental ability can predict success in education. work. and social life. few books have taken as a starting point mental ability (and individual differences in intelligence). and attempted to see what factors could have influenced. and have even predicted mental ability. This book reveals what we know about the origins of intelligence. It describes research on genetic influences on intelligence. and evidence that has been obtained from biological studies. including examinations of'brain size'. event related potentials. and the recent profusion of studies involving functional brain imaging. Coupled with fascinating historical stories. the book provides a highly original and thought provoking guide to try and answer the age old question of why some people seem more clever than others.,True,aL7MX3sAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,644,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6OPnCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=info:O3Kwpib50F0J:scholar.google.com&ots=5DfTmdUfip&sig=eZLNa--rbZaaJBerZ7rZgArJOsg,6760176985083769403,/scholar?cites=6760176985083769403,,,0,0,0

A number of measures of biological age have been proposed which harness age-related changes in DNA methylation profiles. These measures include five ‘epigenetic clocks’ which provide an index of how much an individual’s biological age differs from their chronological age at the time of measurement. The five clocks encompass methylation-based predictors of chronological age (HorvathAge. HannumAge). all-cause mortality (DNAm PhenoAge. DNAm GrimAge) and telomere length (DNAm Telomere Length). A sixth epigenetic measure of ageing differs from these clocks in that it acts as a speedometer providing a single time-point measurement of the pace of an individual’s biological ageing. This measure of ageing is termed DunedinPoAm. In this study. we test the association between these six epigenetic measures of ageing and the prevalence and incidence of the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in high-income countries (n ≤ 9537.

Two commonly used measures. derived from DNA methylation. are Horvath-based (Horvath-EAA) and Hannum-based (Hannum-EAA) epigenetic age acceleration. We conducted genome-wide association studies of Horvath-EAA and Hannum-EAA in 13.493 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. to elucidate genetic determinants of differential epigenetic ageing. We identified ten independent SNPs associated with Horvath-EAA. five of which are novel. We also report 21 Horvath-EAA-associated genes including several involved in metabolism (NHLRC. TPMT) and immune system pathways (TRIM59. EDARADD). GWAS of Hannum-EAA identified one associated variant (rs1005277). and implicated 12 genes including several involved in innate immune system pathways (UBE2D3. MANBA.

Both measures had nominal inverse genetic correlations with father’s age at death. a rough proxy for lifespan.

A preliminary resource earning task was added before players decided how to allocate the resource they jointly earned. Participants’ decision in allocation. their responses to equal or unequal offers. whether advantageous or disadvantageous. and subjective ratings of fairness were all assessed in the current study. Behavioral results revealed that participants proposed more generous offers and showed enhanced tolerance to disadvantageous unequal offers from others when they performed worse than their presumed “partners.” while the reverse was true in the better-performance condition. The subjective ratings also indicated the effect of earned entitlement. such that worse performance was associated with higher perceived feelings of fairness for disadvantageous unequal offers. while better performance was associated with higher feelings of fairness for advantageous unequal offers. Equal offers were considered “fair” only when earned entitlement was even between two parties. In sum. the perception of fairness is modulated by an integration of egalitarian motivation and entitlement. In addition to justice principles. participants were also motivated by self-interest. such that participants placed more weight on entitlement in the better-performance condition than in the worse-performance condition. These results imply that earned entitlement is evaluated in a self-serving way.,True,d_VoC2MAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073106,13003659734329440507,/scholar?cites=13003659734329440507,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073106,0,0,0

Inc.,Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been the subject of many neuroimaging case–control classification studies. Although some studies report accuracies ≥80%. most have investigated relatively small samples of clinically‐ascertained. currently symptomatic cases. and did not attempt replication in larger samples. We here first aimed to replicate previously reported classification accuracies in a small. well‐phenotyped community‐based group of current MDD cases with clinical interview‐based diagnoses (from STratifying Resilience and Depression Longitudinally cohort. ‘STRADL’). We performed a set of exploratory predictive classification analyses with measures related to brain morphometry and white matter integrity.

Identifying distinct subtypes should lead to more effective diagnosis and treatment. while providing more useful targets for further research. Genetic and clinical overlap between MDD and schizophrenia (SCZ) suggests an MDD subtype may share underlying mechanisms with SCZ.MethodsThe present study investigated whether a neurobiologically distinct subtype of MDD could be identified by SCZ polygenic risk score (PRS).

The identification of mutations underlying QTLs is a challenge because each locus explains only a fraction of the phenotypic variation 3. 4. A paternally expressed QTL affecting muscle growth. fat deposition and size of the heart in pigs maps to the IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) region 5. 6. Here we show that this QTL is caused by a nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of IGF2. The mutation occurs in an evolutionarily conserved CpG island that is hypomethylated in skeletal muscle.

For many species crossing inbred lines is not a practical proposition. although crosses between genetically very different outbred lines are possible. Here we develop a least squares method for the analysis of crosses between outbred lines which simultaneously uses information from multiple linked markers. The method is suitable for crosses where the lines may be segregating at marker loci but can be assumed to be fixed for alternative alleles at the major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting the traits under analysis (e.g.. crosses between divergent selection lines or breeds with different selection histories).

Two simple approaches using multiple markers are proposed. one using least squares and the other maximum likelihood. These methods are intended to provide a relatively fast screening of the entire genome to pinpoint regions of interest for further investigation. They are compared with a more traditional single-marker least-squares approach. The use of multiple markers is shown to increase power and has the advantage of providing an estimate for the location of the QTL.

No current biological mechanism substantially explains MDD but both neurostructural and neurochemical pathways have been suggested. Further explication of these may aid in identifying subgroups of MDD that are better defined by their aetiology. Specifically. genetic stratification provides an array of tools to do this. including the intermediate phenotype approach which was applied in this thesis. This thesis explores genetic overlap with regional brain volume and MDD and the genetic and non-genetic components of antidepressant response. The first study utilised the most recent published data from ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-analysis) Consortium’s genome-wide association study (GWAS) of regional brain volume to examine shared genetic architecture between seven subcortical brain volumes and intracranial volume (ICV) and MDD. This was explored using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). polygenic risk scoring (PRS) techniques. Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis and BUHMBOX (Breaking Up Heterogeneous Mixture Based On Cross-locus correlations). Results indicated that hippocampal volume was positively genetically correlated with MDD (rg= 0.46. P= 0.02). although this did not survive multiple comparison testing.

We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study accounting for gene-alcohol consumption interaction for BP might identify additional BP loci and contribute to the understanding of alcohol-related BP regulation. We conducted a large two-stage investigation incorporating joint testing of main genetic effects and single nucleotide variant (SNV)-alcohol consumption interactions. In Stage 1. genome-wide discovery meta-analyses in ≈131K individuals across several ancestry groups yielded 3.514 SNVs (245 loci) with suggestive evidence of association (P < 1.0 x 10−5). In Stage 2. these SNVs were tested for independent external replication in ≈440K individuals across multiple ancestries. We identified and replicated (at Bonferroni correction threshold) five novel BP loci (380 SNVs in 21 genes) and 49 previously reported BP loci (2.159 SNVs in 109 genes) in European ancestry. and in multi-ancestry meta-analyses (P < 5.0 x 10−8). For African ancestry samples. we detected 18 potentially novel BP loci (P < 5.0 x 10−8) in Stage 1 that warrant further replication.

Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles. The mutations include an 11-base pair deletion. a 1-base pair insertion. a stop codon. a missense substitution. and an inferred regulatory mutation. The BRCA1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues. including breast and ovary. and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids. This protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino-terminal region. but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins.

In psychology. perhaps the first important use of observer ratings was Webb’s 1915 study of trait ratings of teacher trainees (Deary. 1996). and the discovery of the five-factor model (FFM) of personality was made through the analysis of eight observer rating studies (Tupes & Christal. 1961/1992). Yet despite their historical impor-tance. observer ratings are used far less often than self-reports in personality assessment. This is unfortunate. because self-reports have well-known limitations. and observer ratings can complement and supplement them. There is now a solid body of evidence that ratings by informants well acquainted with a target pro-vide reliable. stable. and valid assessments of personality traits (eg. Funder. Kolar. & Blackman. 1995; Riemann. Angleitner. & Strelau. 1997).There are several methods of obtaining observer rating data. When members of a group are asked to assess each other. a ranking technique is sometimes used. in which each group member ranks every other member. Alternately. group members may nominate the single individual who shows the highest level of a trait. Expert raters can be asked to complete a Q-sort to describe targets (see. eg. Lanning. 1994). However. in recent years most informant ratings have been obtained by the use of questionnaires that parallel familiar self-report instruments.

Recent studies have identified biomarkers of chronological age based on DNA methylation levels. It is not yet known whether DNA methylation age captures aspects of biological age. Here we test whether differences between people’s chronological ages and estimated ages. DNA methylation age. predict all-cause mortality in later life. The difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age (Δage) was calculated in four longitudinal cohorts of older people.

Our study had four goals: first. to facilitate the discovery of new genetic loci associated with intelligence; second. to add to our understanding of the biology of intelligence differences; third. to examine whether combining genetically correlated traits in this way produces results consistent with the primary phenotype of intelligence; and. finally …,True,gA3Ik3MAAAAJ:4fKUyHm3Qg0C,158,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-017-0001-5,9732663280498884002,/scholar?cites=9732663280498884002,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-017-0001-5,0,0,0

1154438,Handbook of frontal lobe assessment,2015,Sarah E MacPherson and Sergio Della Sala and Simon Riddington Cox and Alessandra Girardi and Matthew H Iveson,,,,,Oxford University Press. USA,There are several tests used in clinical practice and research worldwide that have been devised to assess the functions subsumed by the frontal lobes of the brain. Anatomical localisation has revealed that the frontal lobes can be divided into sub-regions with different functional domains. As a result. a number of authors working in the frontal lobe literature have made a case for patients with frontal lobe damage to be considered in their distinct subgroups. rather than considered together in one unitary group. As a result. it is important for clinicians and researchers to be made aware of the functions assessed by individual frontal tests and understand which frontal regions might be impaired in their patient groups. as patients with damage to one of these regions will perform poorly on tasks tapping that region yet may perform well on tasks tapping the unaffected regions within the frontal lobes. The'Handbook of frontal lobe assessment'provides a critical review and appraisal of both the neuropsychological and experimental tests that have been devised to assess frontal lobe functions. It includes many tests that have not been included in previously published neuropsychological compendia. Throughout. the book discusses the available frontal tests in relation to patient and lesion data. neuroimaging data and aging data in order to offer clinicians and researchers the opportunity to choose the best assessment instrument for their purpose.,True,bYhRjYwAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,171,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=S_sJCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:0ggf-OXpEOEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=qBex4IUrkl&sig=7gbccmY4m_LpqCAWakiFUaeVX5E,16217719432080722130,/scholar?cites=16217719432080722130,,,0,0,0

We investigate associations between older age brain white matter structure. several measures of information processing speed and childhood cognitive ability in 581 subjects. Analysis of diffusion tensor MRI data using Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) showed that all measures of information processing speed. as well as a general speed factor composed from these tests (g speed). were significantly associated with fractional anisotropy (FA) across the white matter skeleton rather …,True,bYhRjYwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,53,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00429-015-1097-5,5656954553133369796,/scholar?cites=5656954553133369796,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00429-015-1097-5,0,0,0

One hundred and fifty-four reports were identified. of which 76 met the criteria for inclusion; 54 were case series and 22 were case–control studies. The median proportion of cases with mental disorder was 91%(95% CI 81–98%) in the case series. In the case–control studies the figure was 90%(88–95%) in the cases and 27%(14–48%) in the controls. Co-morbid mental disorder and substance abuse also preceded suicide in more cases (38%. 19–57%) than controls (6%. 0–13%).

1154467,Working memory in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis,2009,NF Forbes and LA Carrick and AM McIntosh and SM Lawrie,39,,6,889,Cambridge University Press,Background. Memory impairment is being recognized increasingly as an important feature of the neuropsychology of schizophrenia. Dysfunction of working memory. a system for the short-term storage and manipulation of information. may relate to a number of core symptoms of schizophrenia. Many studies have examined working memory function in schizophrenia but a clear understanding of the nature and extent of any deficit has been elusive.Method. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing working memory function in subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls was performed. Following a comprehensive literature search. meta-analyses were conducted on 36 measures of phonological. visuospatial and central executive working memory functioning. encompassing 441 separate results from 187 different studies.Results. Statistically significant effect sizes were found for all working memory measures. indicating deficits in schizophrenia groups. Some of these were robust findings in the absence of evidence of significant heterogeneity or publication bias. Meta-regression analyses showed that the working memory deficit was not simply explained by discrepancies in current IQ between schizophrenia and control groups.Conclusions. Large deficits in working memory were demonstrated in schizophrenia groups across all three working memory domains. There were. however. no clear differences across subdomains or between particular working memory tasks. There was substantial heterogeneity across results that could only be partly explained.,True,I10f4BsAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,496,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Lawrie/publication/23409327_Working_memory_in_schizophrenia_A_meta-analysis/links/54196a700cf2218008bf75f2.pdf,12557216343533076850,/scholar?cites=12557216343533076850,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Lawrie/publication/23409327_Working_memory_in_schizophrenia_A_meta-analysis/links/54196a700cf2218008bf75f2.pdf,0,0,0

To exploit this. various methods which consider variant association with multiple traits jointly have been developed. However. most effort has been put on improving discovery power: how to replicate and interpret these discovered pleiotropic loci using multivariate methods has yet to be discussed fully. Using only multiple publicly available single-trait GWAS summary statistics. we develop a fast and flexible multi-trait framework that contains modules for (i) multi-trait genetic discovery. (ii) replication of locus pleiotropic profile. and (iii) multi-trait conditional analysis. The procedure is able to handle any level of sample overlap. As an empirical example. we discovered and replicated 23 novel pleiotropic loci for human anthropometry and evaluated their pleiotropic effects on other traits. By applying conditional multivariate analysis on the 23 loci. we discovered and replicated two additional multi-trait associated SNPs. Our results provide empirical evidence that multi-trait analysis allows detection of additional. replicable. highly pleiotropic genetic associations without genotyping additional individuals.

1154491,Haplotype heritability mapping method uncovers missing heritability of complex traits,2018,Masoud Shirali and Sara A Knott and Ricardo Pong-Wong and Pau Navarro and Chris S Haley,8,Scientific reports,1,1-9,Nature Publishing Group,We propose a novel approach to analyze genomic data that incorporates haplotype information for detecting rare variants within a regional heritability mapping framework. The performance of our approach was tested in a simulation study based on human genotypes. The phenotypes were simulated by generating regional variance using either SNP (s) or haplotype (s). Regional genomic relationship matrices. constructed with either a SNP-based or a haplotype-based estimator. were employed to estimate the regional variance. The results from the study show that haplotype heritability mapping captures the regional effect. with its relative performance decreasing with increasing analysis window size. The SNP-based regional mapping approach often misses the effect of causal haplotype (s); however. it has a greater power to detect simulated SNP-based-variants.

Joint-modeling of multiple anthropometric traits. has the potential to boost discovery power. but has not been applied to global-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWAS). Here. we develop a simple method to perform multi-trait meta-GWAS using summary statistics reported in standard single-trait meta-GWAS and replicate the findings in an independent cohort. Using the summary statistics reported by the GIANT consortium meta-GWAS of 270.000 individuals5. we discovered 359 novel loci significantly associated with six anthropometric traits. The “overeating gene” GRM5 (P = 4.38×10−54) was the strongest novel locus6-8. and was independently replicated in the Generation Scotland cohort (n = 9.603. P = 4.42×10−3). The novel variants had an enriched rediscovery rate in the replication cohort. Our results provide new important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying anthropometric traits and emphasize the value of combining multiple correlated phenotypes in genomic studies.

The collection and analysis of sufficient data on both disease resistance and host genetics has. however. been a major obstacle to dissection the genetics of resistance to single or multiple pathogens. A severe challenge in the estimation of heritabilities and genetic correlations from pedigree-based studies has been the confounding effects of the common environment shared among relatives which are difficult to model in pedigree analyses. especially for health traits with low incidence rates. To circumvent this problem we used genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data and implemented the Genomic-Restricted Maximum Likelihood (G-REML) method to estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations for resistance to 23 different infectious pathogens in calves and cows in populations undergoing natural pathogen challenge. Furthermore. we conducted gene-based analysis and generalized gene-set analysis to understand the biological background of resistance to infectious diseases. The results showed relatively higher heritabilities of resistance in calves than in cows and significant pleiotropy (both positive and negative) among some calf and cow resistance traits. We also found significant pleiotropy between resistance and performance in both calves and cows. Finally. we confirmed the role of the B-lymphocyte pathway as one of the most important biological pathways associated with resistance to all pathogens. These results both illustrate the potential power of these approaches to illuminate the genetics of pathogen resistance in cattle and …,True,xHN3mVcAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194374,18151334558214893085,/scholar?cites=18151334558214893085,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194374,0,0,0

The comparison between GEBVs obtained from BayesC and GBLUP showed that GEBVs and true breeding values were largely correlated (r> 0.80) in training population for all traits. Comparing accuracies of GEBVs showed that both BayesC and GBLUP methods performed similarly. except in traits with 5 QTLs BayesC performed significantly better (P< 0.05). The accuracies of estimations using BayesC indicated that this method performed better under scenarios with low number of QTL and gamma variance distribution in trait of interest. However. GBLUP presented accurate estimations in all traits; and number of QTL and QTL variance distributions had no impact on accuracies of GBLUP estimations.

1154502,Novel statistical methods for genome-wide association summary statistics,2020,Zheng Ning,,,,,Inst för medicinsk epidemiologi och biostatistik/Dept of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics,A general objective of genetic studies is to understand the genetic basis of complex traits such as height. body mass index (BMI). disease endpoints. etc. Such researches have been facilitated due to the completion of the human genome project and developments of high-throughput technologies. With the help of high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies. the information on millions of genetic markers can be measured for each individual.    The most widely used strategy to detect the associations between genetic variants and a complex trait is genome-wide association study (GWAS). Because the genetic architecture of most complex traits is highly polygenic. the signal to noise ratio is usually tiny. Thus. especially in human populations. GWAS often requires large samples to obtain sufficient power. Unfortunately. given the restrictions on sharing individual-level data. it is often not feasible to pool data from different cohorts. Despite that. in each cohort. it is possible to report and share GWAS summary statistics. such as sample sizes. allele frequencies. estimates of genetic effect sizes. and their standard errors for the genetic markers across the genome. Therefore one recent focus in statistical methodology development for genetic studies has been on meta-analysis techniques using summary-level data. The objective of this thesis is to develop novel statistical genetics methods based on GWAS summary statistics and to apply these methods to better understand the genetic architecture underlying complex traits.

Low birth weight (BW.< 2.5 kg) is associated with alterations in cortical brain structure. reduced cognitive ability and psychiatric problems; suggesting that somatic fetal growth may be an important determinant of brain structure and function in later life. However. the relationship between BW within the normal range and adult brain structure in the general population is little understood. including whether a causal relationship exists. We therefore sought to test if there is a causal relationship between BW and brain cortical morphology in a general adult population using Mendelian Randomization (MR). Methods: The current sample included 1.680 individuals from the first release of brain imaging data from UK Biobank. Linear mixed effects models were first used to test for associations between BW and global and localized regions of brain cortical volume. surface area and thickness. Secondly. to test for causal relationships between BW and cortical metric phenotypes we used a Two-sample MR framework. applying the inverse-variance weighted method. Results: BW was significantly and positively associated with global cortical volume (β=. 104. p= 2.86×− 07) and surface area (β=. 100. p= 3.58×− 07). but not thickness (β=−. 054. p=. 097).

1154506,Architecture of human complex trait variation,2018,Xiachi Xin and Charley Xia,,,,,The University of Edinburgh,A complex trait is a trait or disease that is controlled by both genetic and environmental factors. along with their interactions. Trait architecture encompasses the genetic variants and environmental causes of variation in the trait or disease. their effects on the trait or disease and the mechanism by which these factors interact at molecular and organism levels. It is important to understand trait architecture both from a biological viewpoint and a health perspective. In this thesis. I laid emphasis on exploring the influence of familial environmental factors on complex trait architecture alongside the genetic components. I performed a variety of studies to explore the architecture of anthropometric and cardio-metabolic traits. such as height. body mass index. high density lipoprotein content of blood and blood pressure. using a cohort of 20.000 individuals of recent Scottish descent and their phenotype measurements. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data and genealogical information. I extended a method of variance component analysis that could simultaneously estimate SNP-associated heritability and total heritability whilst considering familial environmental effects shared among siblings. couples and nuclear family members. I found that most missing heritability could be explained by including closely related individuals in the analysis and accounting for these close relationships; and that. on top of genetics. couple and sibling environmental effects are additional significant contributors to the complex trait variation investigated.

By a genome-wide association study (320 patients and 1.500 controls) and subsequent replication altogether involving a total of 3.300 Asian SLE patients from Hong Kong. Mainland China. and Thailand. as well as 4.200 ethnically and geographically matched controls. genetic variants in ETS1 and WDFY4 were found to be associated with SLE (ETS1: rs1128334. P = 2.33×10−11. OR = 1.29; WDFY4: rs7097397. P = 8.15×10−12. OR = 1.30). ETS1 encodes for a transcription factor known to be involved in a wide range of immune functions. including Th17 cell development and terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes. SNP rs1128334 is located in the 3′-UTR of ETS1. and allelic expression analysis from peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed significantly lower expression level from the risk allele. WDFY4 is a conserved protein with unknown function. but is predominantly expressed in primary and secondary immune tissues. and rs7097397 in WDFY4 changes an arginine residue to glutamine (R1816Q) in this protein. Our study also confirmed association of the HLA locus. STAT4. TNFSF4. BLK. BANK1. IRF5. and TNFAIP3 with SLE in Asians.

Our objective was to produce cross-sectional centile values for grip strength across the life course. A secondary objective was to examine the impact of different aspects of measurement protocol.  Methods We combined 60.803 observations from 49.964 participants (26.687 female) of 12 general population studies in Great Britain. We produced centile curves for ages 4 to 90 and investigated the prevalence of weak grip. defined as strength at least 2.5 SDs below the gender-specific peak mean. We carried out a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of dynamometer type and measurement position (seated or standing).  Results Our results suggested three overall periods: an increase to peak in early adult life. maintenance through to midlife. and decline from midlife onwards. Males were on average stronger than females from adolescence onwards: males’ peak median grip was 51 kg between ages 29 and 39. compared to 31 kg in females between ages 26 and 42. Weak grip strength. defined as strength at least 2.5 SDs below the gender-specific peak mean. increased sharply with age. reaching a prevalence of 23% in males and 27% in females by age 80. Sensitivity analyses suggested our findings were robust to differences in dynamometer type and measurement position.  Conclusion This is the first study to provide normative data for grip strength …,True,Xp7Vh48AAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC,501,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113637,2311656913785152028,/scholar?cites=2311656913785152028,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113637,0,0,0
1154538,Objective measures of physical capability and subsequent health: a systematic review,2011,Rachel Cooper and Diana Kuh and Cyrus Cooper and Catharine R Gale and Debbie A Lawlor and Fiona Matthews and Rebecca Hardy and FALCon and HALCyon Study Teams,40,,1,14-23,Oxford University Press, Background: measures of physical capability may be predictive of subsequent health. but existing published studies have not been systematically reviewed. We hypothesised that weaker grip strength. slower walking speed and chair rising and shorter standing balance time. in community-dwelling populations. would be associated with higher subsequent risk of fracture. cognitive outcomes. cardiovascular disease. hospitalisation and institutionalisation. Methods: studies were identified through systematic searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE (to May 2009). Reference lists of eligible papers were also manually searched. Results: twenty-four papers had examined the associations between at least one physical capability measure and one of the outcomes. As the physical capability measures and outcomes had been assessed and categorised in different ways …,True,Xp7Vh48AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,433,https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/40/1/14/11243,2666911684140220032,/scholar?cites=2666911684140220032,,https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/40/1/14/11243,0,0,0
1154539,Migrant studies in multiple sclerosis,1995,Catharine R Gale and Christopher N Martyn,47,,4-5,425-448,Pergamon,To re-evaluate how migrant studies contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology and aetiology of multiple sclerosis. we undertook a systematic review of all relevant studies published in English language journals. comparing rates of multiple sclerosis in migrant populations with those in the host country and in the country of origin.Interpretation of migrant studies is difficult. Migrants are seldom representative of the country of origin. tending to be younger. healthier and of higher socioeconomic status. Data quality may be poor. and lack of age-standardisation can mislead when rates are compared. Nevertheless. two consistent patterns can be discerned in these studies of the effect of migration on risk of multiple sclerosis. Migrants who move from an area where the disease is common to an area where it is rarer show a decrease in rate of disease. By contrast. people who migrate in the opposite direction tend to …,True,Xp7Vh48AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,429,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030100829580008V,13890621478472370887,/scholar?cites=13890621478472370887,,,0,0,0
