Unfortunately. the reaction suffers from slow kinetics 7. 8 owing to the low local concentration of CO 2 surrounding typical CO 2 reduction reaction catalysts. Alkali metal cations are known to overcome this limitation through non-covalent interactions with adsorbed reagent species 9. 10. but the effect is restricted by the solubility of relevant salts. Large applied electrode potentials can also enhance CO 2 adsorption 11. but this comes at the cost of increased hydrogen (H 2) evolution.

Here we report that a copper electrocatalyst at an abrupt reaction interface in an alkaline electrolyte reduces CO2 to ethylene with 70% faradaic efficiency at a potential of −0.55 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Hydroxide ions on or near the copper surface lower the CO2 reduction and carbon monoxide (CO)–CO coupling activation energy barriers; as a result. onset of ethylene evolution at −0.165 volts versus an RHE in 10 molar potassium hydroxide occurs almost simultaneously with CO production.

In this work. a combined experimental (using a microscale thermometry technique) and numerical (using a 3D “whole-chip” finite element model) approach is used to examine Joule heating and heat transfer at a microchannel intersection in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). and hybrid PDMS/Glass microfluidic systems.

1181404,Effect of compression on liquid water transport and microstructure of PEMFC gas diffusion layers,2007,A Bazylak and D Sinton and Z-S Liu and N Djilali,163,Journal of Power Sources,2,784-792,Elsevier,This work explores how the degradation of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) under compression contributes to the formation of preferential pathways for water transport. Fluorescence microscopy is used to provide ex situ visualization of liquid water transport through the GDL placed beneath an optically transparent clamping plate. Transient image data obtained with a CCD camera indicates that areas of compression in the GDL coincide with preferential pathways for water transport and break-through. Preferential flow of water through the smaller pores resulting from GDL compression is contrary to the expected behaviour in a hydrophobic medium. and this suggests a loss of hydrophobicity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to investigate the effect of compression on the morphology of the GDL. These SEM images show that compressing the GDL causes the breakup of fibers and. indeed. deterioration of the …,True,Dgdo64MAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,332,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775306019252,5439860369919168140,/scholar?cites=5439860369919168140,,,0,0,0

Arrays of periodic nanoholes milled through thin layers of SiOx and gold were used to detect the binding of organic and biological molecules inside the nanoholes. while blocking the gold surfaces outside the holes. This new approach is more efficient than the previous nanohole array method. where the response was related to binding events taking place inside of the holes and on the top gold surface. The improved sensitivity to binding events and lower detection limit are related to resonant surface plasmon enhanced transmission through the arrays of nanoholes. The sensitivity was found to be 650nm/RIU and the detection of three attomoles of proteins was estimated from this scheme.,True,Dgdo64MAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,152,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja807704v,6641996604645724997,/scholar?cites=6641996604645724997,,https://www.academia.edu/download/55747819/ja807704v20180208-2373-11q42so.pdf,0,0,0

The goals of this study are to report a steady-state. far from equilibrium chrysotile dissolution rate law and to better define what role serpentine dissolution kinetics will have in constraining rates of carbon sequestration via serpentine carbonation.

Dissolution experiments were performed in a continuously stirred flow-through reactor with the input solutions pre-equilibrated with atmospheric CO 2.

Although passive carbonation is occurring at the abandoned Clinton Creek asbestos mine. and the active Diavik diamond and Mount Keith nickel mines. there remains untapped potential for sequestering CO 2 within these mine wastes. There is the potential to accelerate carbonation to create economically viable. large-scale CO 2 fixation technologies that can operate at near-surface temperature and atmospheric pressure. We review several relevant acceleration strategies including: bioleaching of magnesium silicates; increasing the supply of CO 2 via heterotrophic oxidation of waste organics; and biologically induced carbonate precipitation. as well as enhancing passive carbonation through tailings management practices and use of CO 2 point sources. Scenarios for pilot scale projects are proposed with the aim of moving towards carbon-neutral mines. A financial incentive is necessary to encourage the development of these strategies. We recommend the use of a dynamic real options pricing approach. instead of traditional discounted cash-flow approaches. because it reflects the inherent value in managerial flexibility to adapt and capitalize on favorable future opportunities in the highly volatile carbon market.

Mineralization of carbon in solid. stable carbonate minerals through reaction of CO₂ with Mg-rich mining wastes is a promising CO₂ sequestration strategy that offers the potential to render certain mines GHG neutral. Here. the physical and chemical controls on rates of and capacity for CO₂ sequestration in systems representative of mine tailings are examined from the mineral-fluid interface to field scale using a combination of experimental techniques.

The rate-limiting step during carbonation varied from CO₂ supply to mineral dissolution depending on the experimental variables.

1181468,Evaluation of steady and pulsating flow performance of a double-entry turbocharger turbine,2010,Colin D Copeland,,,,,Imperial College London,The turbocharger remains one of the best means available to the engine developer to satisfy the power density demands on a modern internal combustion engine. This simple device uses the otherwise waste exhaust gas energy to provide significant improvements in the volumetric efficiency or ‘breathing capacity’ of an engine. In order to maximize the energy of the exhaust driving the turbine. most applications utilize pulse turbocharging where a compact exhaust manifold feeds the highly pulsating exhaust flow directly into the turbine wheel. This thesis considers the influence that this pulse-charging has on a double-entry turbocharger turbine. The design of this turbine plays an important role in much of the research presented in this thesis. The turbine is equipped with a mixed-flow rotor with 12 blades that are fed by a 24 blade nozzle ring. The circumferentially divided volute is designed with two gas inlet passages that each feed a separate 180° section of the nozzle ring. Thus. there is no communication between the entries from the volute inlet to the exit of the nozzles. At the exit to the nozzle. the fluid from both inlets expands into an interspace that spans the circumference of the rotor inlet. This small volume that is formed between the nozzle and the mixed flow rotor is the first area where interaction between the flows can occur. The core of this report contains three main divisions: Steady flow experimental results. CFD modelling. and unsteady flow experimental results.

However. despite the efficiency increase. turbochargers often lack fast transient response due to the nature of the energy exchange with the engine. which deteriorates the vehicle’s drivability. An electrically-assisted turbocharger can be used for improving the transient response without any parasitic losses to the engine while providing energy recovery for increasing overall system efficiency. The present study provides a detailed numerical investigation on the potential of e-turbocharging to control load and if possible replace the wastegate valve. A parametric study of the optimum compressor/turbine sizing and wastegate area was performed for maximum torque. fast response time and energy regeneration across the real driving conditions speed/load area of the engine. The results showed that the implementation of a motor-generator could contribute to reducing the response time of the engine by up to 90% while improving its thermal efficiency and generating up to 6.6 kWh of energy. Suppressing the wastegate can only be achieved when a larger turbine is implemented. which as a result deteriorates the engine’s response and leads to energy provision demands at low engine speeds.

1181476,Investigation into the assumptions for lumped capacitance modelling of turbocharger heat transfer,2014,RD Burke and CD Copeland and Tomasz Duda,,"6th International conference on simulation and testing, Berlin",,,,Heat transfer in turbochargers is often ignored for one-dimensional engine modelling. however this omission limits the usefulness of these models in the development for part load and transient operating conditions. Advanced heat transfer models have been proposed to account for these thermal effects based on the assumption that the compressor housing can be represented as a single lumped mass with heat and work transfer occurring separately. In this paper. both one-and three-dimensional modelling have been undertaken to assess the validity of these assumptions. One dimensional modelling showed that at low load conditions the magnitude of heat flowing to the compressor is the dominant effect causing errors in temperature predictions. In contrast at higher powers it is the distribution of heat transfer pre and post compression that have larger effects. Three-dimensional modelling subsequently showed that at low load the compressor housing remains warmer than the gases throughout the device. In contrast at high powers the compressed gas temperature can exceed the temperature of the housing on the front face of the compressor creating significantly more complex heat flows that may not be captured by the simple model structures.,True,ceVJ6LwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,19,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237450725.pdf,2417672110458652595,/scholar?cites=2417672110458652595,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237450725.pdf,0,0,0

It is conventionally achieved by reducing the swept volume of the engine and by employing some means of increasing the specific output to achieve the desired installed engine power. usually in the form of an exhaust-driven turbocharger. However. because of the perceptible time needed for the turbocharger system to generate the required boost pressure. a characteristic of turbocharged engines is their degraded driveability in comparison with those of their naturally aspirated counterparts. Mechanical supercharging refers to the technology that compresses the intake air using the energy taken directly from the engine crankshaft. It is anticipated that engine downsizing which is realised either solely by a supercharger or by a combination of a supercharger and a turbocharger will enhance a vehicle’s driveability without significantly …,True,ceVJ6LwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,18,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0954407016636971,708545843055222441,/scholar?cites=708545843055222441,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0954407016636971,0,0,0

Although there is a small connecting interspace formed between the nozzle and the mixed flow rotor inlet. this design does well to preserve the exhaust gas energy in a pulsed-charged application by largely isolating the two streams entering the turbine.

Meanwhile. turbocharged engines when operating at high engine speeds and loads cannot fully utilize the exhaust energy as the wastegate is opened to prevent overboost. The turboexpansion concept thus is conceived to reduce the intake temperature by utilizing some otherwise unexploited exhaust energy. This concept can be applied to any turbocharged engines equipped with both a compressor and a turbine-like expander on the intake loop. The turbocharging system is designed to achieve maximum utilization of the exhaust energy. from which the intake charge is over-boosted.

We first propose a novel yet simple unknown input observer based on the crankshaft rotation dynamics only. For this purpose. an invariant manifold is derived by defining auxiliary variables in terms of first-order low-pass filters. where only one constant (filter coefficient) needs to be tuned. These filtered variables are used to calculate the estimated torque. Robustness of this UIO against sensor noise is studied and compared to two other estimators. On the other hand. since the engine torque dynamics can be formulated as a parameterized form with unknown time-varying parameters. we further present several adaptive laws for time-varying parameter estimation.

1181495,Electric turbocharging for energy regeneration and increased efficiency at real driving conditions,2017,Pavlos Dimitriou and Richard Burke and Qingning Zhang and Colin Copeland and Harald Stoffels,7,Applied Sciences,4,350,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Modern downsized internal combustion engines benefit from high-efficiency turbocharging systems for increasing their volumetric efficiency. However. despite the efficiency increase. turbochargers often lack fast transient response due to the nature of the energy exchange with the engine. which deteriorates the vehicle’s drivability. An electrically-assisted turbocharger can be used for improving the transient response without any parasitic losses to the engine while providing energy recovery for increasing overall system efficiency. The present study provides a detailed numerical investigation on the potential of e-turbocharging to control load and if possible replace the wastegate valve. A parametric study of the optimum compressor/turbine sizing and wastegate area was performed for maximum torque. fast response time and energy regeneration across the real driving conditions speed/load area of the engine. The results showed that the implementation of a motor-generator could contribute to reducing the response time of the engine by up to 90% while improving its thermal efficiency and generating up to 6.6 kWh of energy. Suppressing the wastegate can only be achieved when a larger turbine is implemented. which as a result deteriorates the engine’s response and leads to energy provision demands at low engine speeds.

1181497,Investigation into the assumptions for lumped capacitance modelling of turbocharger heat transfer,2014,RD Burke and CD Copeland and Tomasz Duda,,"6th International conference on simulation and testing, Berlin",,,,Heat transfer in turbochargers is often ignored for one-dimensional engine modelling. however this omission limits the usefulness of these models in the development for part load and transient operating conditions. Advanced heat transfer models have been proposed to account for these thermal effects based on the assumption that the compressor housing can be represented as a single lumped mass with heat and work transfer occurring separately. In this paper. both one-and three-dimensional modelling have been undertaken to assess the validity of these assumptions. One dimensional modelling showed that at low load conditions the magnitude of heat flowing to the compressor is the dominant effect causing errors in temperature predictions. In contrast at higher powers it is the distribution of heat transfer pre and post compression that have larger effects. Three-dimensional modelling subsequently showed that at low load the compressor housing remains warmer than the gases throughout the device. In contrast at high powers the compressed gas temperature can exceed the temperature of the housing on the front face of the compressor creating significantly more complex heat flows that may not be captured by the simple model structures.,True,z_0sU4QAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,19,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237450725.pdf,2417672110458652595,/scholar?cites=2417672110458652595,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237450725.pdf,0,0,0

Typically these are in the form of tables or statistical regression models based on data obtained from stabilised experiments. However. as the complexity of engine systems increases. the number of experiments required to obtain the effects of each actuator becomes large. In addition. the models are only valid under stable operating conditions and do not give any information as to dynamic behaviour. In this paper. the use of the Volterra series (dynamic polynomial models) calculated from dynamic measurements is presented as an alternative to the steady-state models.

Specifically. in turbochargers with a variable geometry turbine (VGT). energy losses can be induced by the aerodynamic profile of both the nozzle vanes and the turbine blades. Although appropriate considerations on material limits and structural performance of the turbine wheel are monitored in the design and aero-mechanical optimization phases. in these stages. fatigue phenomena might be ignored. Fatigue occurrence in VGT wheels can be categorized into low and high cycle behaviors. The former would be induced by the change in turbine rotational speed in time. while the latter would be caused by the interaction between the aerodynamic excitation and blades resonating modes.,True,k-OaXLoAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-abstract/GT2020/V008T20A002/1095127,,,,,0,0,0

High pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) turbochargers are placed in sequence. with exhaust gasses expanding through LP and HP turbines; while. air is compressed by LP and HP compressors. respectively. before being forced into the engine intake. In order to maximise performance and flexibility of the internal combustion engine. regulating valves are implemented into the turbocharging system. In order to investigate the interaction between the boosting system and the internal combustion engines. one-dimensional (1D) model simulations are considered a fundamental tool. In this scenario. turbomachinery performances are imposed into the model through compressor and turbine maps. to analyse the complete power unit. The adoption of standard gas-stand maps would be omitting the flow non-uniformity effects on a turbomachine due to bends and the presence of heat transfer in turbochargers could influence enthalpy level at boundaries. In addition. specific to two-stage turbocharging systems. the high degree of swirling flows and temperatures at the inlet of the HP compressor induced by the upstream turbomachine can influence significantly the performance of the two-stage system. Therefore. it has been fundamental to perform this study on the advanced characterisation of turbochargers. focussing on the modelling two-stage turbocharging systems.In order to perform the research study. a new engine gas-stand facility has been developed. mapping …,True,k-OaXLoAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/files/187924514/PhDthesis_final.pdf,,,,https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/files/187924514/PhDthesis_final.pdf,0,0,0

1181532,Design an intelligent controller for full vehicle nonlinear active suspension systems,2011,AA Aldair and WJ Wang,4,International journal on smart sensing and intelligent systems,2,224-243,Massey University,The main objective of designed the controller for a vehicle suspension system is to reduce the discomfort sensed by passengers which arises from road roughness and to increase the ride handling associated with the pitching and rolling movements. This necessitates a very fast and accurate controller to meet as much control objectives. as possible. Therefore. this paper deals with an artificial intelligence Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) technique to design a robust controller to meet the control objectives. The advantage of this controller is that it can handle the nonlinearities faster than other conventional controllers. The approach of the proposed controller is to minimize the vibrations on each corner of vehicle by supplying control forces to suspension system when travelling on rough road. The other purpose for using the NF controller for vehicle model is to reduce the body inclinations that are made during intensive manoeuvres including braking and cornering. A full vehicle nonlinear active suspension system is introduced and tested.

The system consists of four ANFIS controllers; two of which are used for regulating both the left and right angular velocities of the AGV in order to reach the target position; and other two ANFIS controllers are used for optimal heading adjustment in order to avoid obstacles. The two velocity controllers receive three sensor inputs: front distance (FD); right distance (RD) and left distance (LD) for the low-level motion control. Two heading controllers deploy the angle difference (AD) between the heading of AGV and the angle to the target to choose the optimal direction. The simulation experiments have been carried out under two different scenarios to investigate the feasibility of the proposed ANFIS technique.

1181543,A neurofuzzy controller for full vehicle active suspension systems,2012,AA Aldair and WJ Wang,18,Journal of Vibration and Control,12,1837-1854,Sage Publications,The main objectives of designing the controller for vehicle suspension systems are to reduce the discomfort sensed by passengers that arises from road roughness and to increase the road handling associated with the pitching and rolling movements. This necessitates a very fast and accurate controller to meet as many control objectives as possible. This paper deals with an artificial intelligent neurofuzzy (NF) technique to design a robust controller. The advantage of this controller is that it can handle the nonlinearities faster than other conventional controllers. The approach of the proposed controller is to minimize the vibration on each corner of the vehicle by supplying control forces to the suspension system when travelling on a rough road. The other purpose of using the NF controller for the vehicle model is to reduce the body inclinations that are made during intensive maneuvers. including braking and cornering …,True,nCQxTUUAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,35,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077546311428631,12048650600516968028,/scholar?cites=12048650600516968028,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.847.6752&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This technique utilizes a Fractional Order Proportional Integral Derivative (FOPID) controller to control a non-holonomic autonomous ground vehicle to track the behaviour of the predefined reference path. Two FOPID controllers are designed to control the vehicle's inputs. These inputs represent the torques that are used in order to manipulate the implemented model of the vehicle to obtain the actual path. The implemented model of the non-holonomic autonomous ground vehicle takes into consideration both of the kinematic and dynamic models. In additional. a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the FOPID controllers' parameters.

The effects of fuel splitting proportion. injection timing. spray angles. and injection velocity were examined. The mixing process and formation of soot and nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions were investigated as the focus of the research. The results show that the fuel splitting proportion and the injection timing impacted the combustion and emissions significantly due to the considerable changes of the mixing process and fuel distribution in the cylinder. While the spray. inclusion angle and injection velocity at the injector exit. can be adjusted to improve mixing. combustion and emissions. appropriate injection timing and fuel splitting proportion must be jointly considered for optimum combustion performance.

However. the inherent characteristics of the turbocharged SI engine such as negative PMEP. knock sensitivity and poor transient performance significantly limit its maximum potential. Conventional ways of improving the problems above normally concentrate solely on the engine side or turbocharger side leaving the exhaust manifold in between ignored. This paper investigates this neglected area by highlighting a novel means of gas exchange process.Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) is an alternative way of accomplishing the gas exchange process in turbocharged engines.

NOx emissions from Diesel engines have been shown to be sensitive to engine operating temperature. which is directly related to the level of cooling applied to the engine. in addition to the main engine operating parameters such as injection timing and EGR ratio. Experimental engine characterization of the main engine parameters against coolant temperature set point shows that engine cooling settings can extend the feasible lower limits of fuel consumption and emissions output from Diesel engine.

The approach is based on the diffusion combustion process which is specific to diesel engines operating under very high injection pressures. The combustion is subsequently controlled mainly by two items. the instantaneous fuel mass present in the cylinder charge and the local density of turbulent kinetic energy. Analytical solutions are developed for each. An extensive test series was undertaken. covering the limiting torque curve (LTC) between 1250 and 4000 r/min and utilizing a high-pressure common rail diesel engine to generate the necessary validation data.

1181606,Extending the role of alcohols as transport fuels using iso-stoichiometric ternary blends of gasoline. ethanol and methanol,2013,JWG Turner and RJ Pearson and E Dekker and B Iosefa and K Johansson and K Ac Bergström,102,Applied Energy,,72-86,Elsevier,Ethanol has become widely used in low concentration blends with gasoline in many parts of the world and has more limited use in high concentration blends. In the long term the supply of biomass for transport fuels will be severely limited. perhaps to as little as 20% of transport energy demand. The inability to satisfy the total transport demand means that biofuels are in danger of being regarded as a technological and strategic dead end. Methanol can be made from a wide variety of fossil and biomass feed stocks and can also be synthesized by reducing carbon dioxide and water using renewable energy. Methanol therefore has the potential to extend significantly the availability of alcohols for transport fuel.Ternary blends of gasoline. ethanol. and methanol (GEM) are proposed which can be formulated to have identical stoichiometric air–fuel ratios to any binary blend of gasoline and ethanol.

To illustrate this it reports modifications to a supercharged high-speed sports car engine to run on an ethanol-based fuel (ethanol containing 15% gasoline by volume. or 85'). The ability for engines to be able to run on alcohol fuels may become very important in the future from both a global warming viewpoint and that of security of energy supply. Additionally. low-carbon-number alcohol fuels such as ethanol and methanol are attractive alternative fuels because. unlike gaseous fuels. they can be stored relatively easily and the amount of energy that can be contained in the vehicle fuel tank is relatively high (although still less than when using gasoline).

Using internal exhaust gas recirculation (IEGR) as an indirect control method. CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically. this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next.

Test data was gathered from a single cylinder research engine equipped with Lotus' Research Active Valve Train (AVT) System. and the modelling study was based on detailed chemical kinetics.

The closed-carbon cycles which are possible using such fuels offer the prospect of maintaining current levels of mobility with affordable transport whilst neutralizing the threat posed by the high predicted growth of greenhouse gas emissions from this sector. Approaches to de-carbonizing transport include electrification and the adoption of molecular hydrogen as an energy carrier. These two solutions result in very expensive vehicles for personal transport which mostly lie idle for 95% of their life time and are purchased with high-cost capital. The total cost of ownership of such vehicles is high and the impact of such vehicles in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport is therefore likely to be low due to their unaffordability for a large number of customers. Conversely. powertrains and fuel systems capable of using renewable alcohols in high concentrations have minimal additional cost over existing models as they are made from abundant materials with low embedded energy levels. The use of ethanol and methanol in internal combustion engines is reviewed and it is found that the efficiency and performance of engines using these fuels exceeds that of their fossil fuel counterparts.

Inc.,One of the most expedient routes to improving in-vehicle fuel economy is to reduce the swept volume of an engine and run it at a higher BMEP for any given output. This can be achieved through pressure charging. However. for maximum fuel economy. particularly at partload. the compression ratio (CR) should be kept as high as possible. This is at odds with the requirement in pressure charged engines to reduce the CR at higher loads due to the knock limit. Lotus has studied a pressure charging system which will allow a high compression ratio to be maintained at all times. This is achieved by deliberately over compressing the charge air. intercooling it at the resulting elevated pressure. and then expanding it. via a turbine. to the desired plenum boost pressure. ensuring a plenum temperature which can potentially become sub-ambient at full-load.

1181625,GEM ternary blends: Removing the biomass limit by using iso-stoichiometric mixtures of gasoline. ethanol and methanol,2011,James Turner and Richard Pearson and Ralph Purvis and Eelco Dekker and Kenth Johansson and Kjell ac Bergström,,,2011-24-0113,,SAE Technical Paper,The paper presents the concept of ternary blends of gasoline. ethanol and methanol in which the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (AFR) is controlled to be 9.7: 1. the same as that of conventional ‘E85’alcohol-based fuel. This makes them iso-stoichiometric. Such blends are termed ‘GEM’after the first initial of the three components. Calculated data is presented showing how the volumetric energy density relationship between the three components in these blends changes as the stoichiometric AFR is held constant but ethanol content is varied. From this data it is contended that such GEM blends can be ‘drop-in’alternatives to E85. because when an engine is operated on any of these blends the pulse widths of the fuel injectors would not change significantly. and so there will be no impact on the on-board diagnostics from the use of such blends in existing E85/gasoline flex-fuel vehicles.

This paper deals with the design of sensor networks such that the observability of the variables. which are necessary for the process control. remains satisfied in the presence of sensor failures. Pseudo-minimal and minimal sensor sets are organized into an oriented graph which contains all the possible reconfiguration paths for which those variables remain observable. A bottom-up analysis of this graph allows one to compute reliability functions which evaluate the robustness of the observability property with respect to sensor failures.

Fault tolerance is defined with respect to a given estimation objective. namely a given functional of the system state should remain observable when sensor failures occur. Redundant and minimal sensor sets are defined and organized into an automaton which contains all the subsets of sensors such that the estimation objective can be achieved. Three criteria. which evaluate the system fault tolerance with respect to sensor failures when a reconfiguration strategy is used. are introduced: (strong and weak) redundancy degrees (RD). sensor network reliability (R). and mean time to non‐observability (MTTNO). Sensor networks are designed by finding redundant sensor sets whose RD and/or R and/or MTTNO are larger than some specified values. A ship boiler example is developed for illustration.

The detection. the location. the different error characterizations and the estimation of true values are steps in the data reconciliation problem.Process measurements are subject to two types of errors: (1) random errors generally taken to be independent and gaussian with zero mean. and (2) gross errors which are caused by non-random events such as malfunctioning sensors. instrument biases and inexact process models.Various methods for detection and location of gross errors in process data have been proposed in recent years including the parity space …,True,7WRRP14AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030175169190031D,3230351689848667526,/scholar?cites=3230351689848667526,,,0,0,0

Since the disturbance and actuator fault is mixed together in the physical system. it is difficult to isolate the fault from the disturbance. Using the state transforation. the estimation of the original state becomes to associate with the transform state. By solving the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)and linear matrix equalities (LMEs). the parameters of the UIO can be obtained. The convergence of the UIO is also analysed by the Layapunov theory.

The Fuel Cell System (FCS) is a nonlinear system which is characterized by multiple variables and a strong coupling with profound dynamics. Therefore. it is difficult to apply control theory methods.

In this method the distribution of the circumferentially averaged swirl velocity rVθ on the meridional geometry of the impeller is prescribed and the corresponding blade shape is computed iteratively. Two approaches are presented for solving the compressible flow problem. In the approximate approach the pitchwise variation in density is neglected and as a result the algorithm is simple and efficient. In the exact approach the velocities and density are computed throughout the three‐dimensional flow field by employing a fast fourier transform in the tangential direction.

It is essentially a particle technique in which molecules are clustered into the said particles. and this coarse graining is a very important aspect of the DPD as it allows significant computational speed-up.

The runner geometry is parameterized by means of a 3D inverse design method. while CFD analyses were performed to assess the hydrodymanic and suction performance of different design configurations that were investigated. An initial runner design was first generated and used as baseline for parametric study. The effects of several design parameter. namely stacking condition and blade loading was then investigated in order to determine their effect on the suction performance. The use of blade parameterization using the inverse method lead to a major advantage for design of Francis turbine runners. as the three-dimensional blade shape is describe by parameters that closely related to the flow field namely blade loading and stacking condition that have a direct impact on the hydrodynamics of the flow field.

Flap motion forces the outer shear layer to roll up into large-scale ring vortices. When the momenum flux of the annular jet is much larger than that of the central jet. the inner shear layer also rolls up into large-scale vortices. which pinch off the central jet significantly. Near-field mixing process is dominated by the ring vortices. while streamwise vortices generated through the breakdown of the ring vortices are responsible for the mixing at the downstream. The near-field mixing is characterized by the length scale of ring vortices and the Strouhal number. which is defined as the ratio between the dimension and shedding interval of the vortices.

Great efforts have been devoted to understand their dynamics that is essential to the breakup. especially. in this near-nozzle region. However. conventional optical techniques are not effective to probe the dynamics in the first several millimeters of the optically dense region. where liquid is fast and in a complex morphology. By taking advantage of highintensity and high-brilliance x-ray beams available at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). the morphology of the sprays can be imaged with ultrafast x-ray micro-imaging techniques and with sub-ns temporal resolution. Furthermore. two short x-ray pulses (sub-nanosecond to a few nanoseconds) with a variety of intervals can be used to visualize the high-speed sprays. By tracking the movement of features in the double-exposure images without the need of seed particles. it becomes well possible to derive velocity fields of the sprays in the nearnozzle region. To understand near-field flow dynamics of diesel and biodiesel sprays injected at 200 MPa and travelling at a velocity exceeding 600 m/s. double-exposed images were taken using x-ray pulses with time interval of 68 ns. By using auto-correlation analysis. the near-field spray velocity can be obtained quantitatively. We recorded the double-exposed x-ray images and derived auto-correlation functions of diesel and biodiesel sprays under various injection pressures up to 200 MPa.

The spatio-temporal structure of the flame was studied by using a laser-induced fluorescence method and a particle image velocimeter. while the exhaust gas was examined with an FT-IR gas analyzer. Near-field vortical structures in the coaxial jet are manipulated by introducing disturbances directly to the initial shear layer. They were generated by the flap actuators driven with square-or saw-wave signals. The lifted flame modified by the square-wave signal disturbances are stabilized at the downstream of the inner potential core. because the early breakdown of the coherent structures into turbulence is promoted. Mixing enhancement upstream of the flame base shortens the flame length and the emission of nitrogen oxides is decreased. On the other hand. the lifted flame controlled by the saw-wave signal disturbances can be anchored near the nozzle exit by the effect of shedding of large-scale vortices synchronized with the flapping motion.

In order to measure temperature of an unsteady flame using a single excitation laser and a single ICCD camera. a new conditional image processing method has been introduced. In this method. ensemble-averaged OH fluorescence intensities at the flame front. which are taken by two excitation lines. are used. and the mean temperature at each streamwise position is calculated. The present thermometry is applied to a methane/air coaxial jet flame. which is actively controlled by periodically driven magnetic flap actuators. The uncertainty interval at 95% coverage is estimated as+ 130 K and-120 K at the mean flame temperature of 2000 K. The measured mean temperatures of controlled flames coincide with the theoretical adiabatic flame temperatures within the uncertainty intervals. When the stoichiometric mixture is supplied. the mean flame temperature is the highest (-2200K). and thus CO emission is drastically reduced. On the other hand. when a lean flammable limit mixture is supplied. the mean temperature is decreased to 1 600 K. and this results in the increased CO emission.,True,HL-A7roAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,5,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kikaib1979/73/732/73_732_1678/_article/-char/ja/,1685276475395068616,/scholar?cites=1685276475395068616,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kikaib1979/73/732/73_732_1678/_pdf,0,0,0
1181694,Coaxial jet control for lifted flame stabilization with arrayed miniature actuators,2004,N Kurimoto and Y Suzuki and N Kasagi,,"12th International symposium on applications of laser techniques, Lisbon, Portugal",,,,Active control of a lifted flame is investigated using a coaxial nozzle with magnetic flap actuators arranged on the inner periphery of the annular nozzle. Near-field vortical structures of the methane/air coaxial jet are manipulated by introducing disturbances directly to the initial shear layer. Through the manipulation. we can improve flame stability and flexibly control the liftoff height. It is found that the large-scale vortical structures play a dominant role in the flame stabilization. and its spatio-temporal evolution is examined with the aid of PIV and LIF to elucidate the control mechanism. By introducing flap motion driven with a saw-wave signal. we can force the outer shear layer to roll up into strong vortices in synchronization with the flaps. When the flapping Strouhal number is unity. the lifted flame is anchored at x/Do~ 1.5. The strong vortices induced by the flaps produce a blob of flammable mixture. which has velocity smaller than the flame speed. The possible stabilization mechanism is that the time period of the premixture supply is balanced with the consumption time of the premixture at the flame base. On the other hand. when the jet is manipulated by a square-wave signal. the lifted flame is located stably at x/Do~ 4. which is downstream of the inner potential core. It is found that vortical structures in the shear layers break into turbulence close to the nozzle exit. The possible mechanism of the flame stabilization is that the flame propagating upstream is undisturbed due to the absence of intermittent passage of large-scale vortices.,True,HL-A7roAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,5,http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/lxlaser/lxlaser2004/pdf/paper_30_2.pdf,9933781213124767659,/scholar?cites=9933781213124767659,,http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/lxlaser/lxlaser2004/pdf/paper_30_2.pdf,0,0,0

The discharge of dyes. specifically synthetic dyes. in wastewater represents a serious environmental problem and causes public health concerns. The implementation of regulations for wastewater discharge has forced research towards either the development of new processes or the improvement of available techniques to attain efficient degradation of dyes. Catalytic oxidation is one of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). based on the active radicals produced during the reaction in the presence of a catalyst. This paper reviews the problems of dyes and hydroxyl radical-based oxidation processes. including Fenton’s process. non-iron metal catalysts. and the application of thin metal catalyst-coated tubular reactors in detail. In addition. the sulfate radical-based catalytic oxidation technique has also been described. This study also includes the effects of various operating parameters such as pH. temperature. the concentration of the oxidant. the initial concentration of dyes. and reaction time on the catalytic decomposition of dyes. Moreover. this paper analyzes the recent studies on catalytic oxidation processes.

Simultaneous plating of Pd and silver (Ag) from their electroless-plating solution produced a mixed distributed bimetallic layer. Preferential acid leaching of Ag from the Pd–Ag layer produced a porous Pd surface. Hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol was examined in the presence of formic acid simply by passing the reaction solution through the catalytic tubular reactors. p-Aminophenol was the sole product of hydrogenation. No side reaction occurred. Reaction conversion with respect to p-nitrophenol was dependent on the catalyst layer type. the temperature. pH. amount of formic acid. and the residence time. A porous and oxidized Pd (PdO) surface gave the best reaction conversion among the catalytic reactors examined. p-Nitrophenol was converted quantitatively to p-aminophenol within 15 s of residence time in the porous PdO reactor at 40 C. Evolution of carbon dioxide (CO 2) was observed during the reaction. although hydrogen (H 2) was not found in the gas phase. Dehydrogenation of formic acid did not occur to any practical degree in the absence of p-nitrophenol.

Herein. the fabrication of a chemiresistor-type gas sensor is reported for the detection of NO 2 gas at 600 C. The sensing element consists of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles prepared via a high-energy ball milling and annealed at different temperatures (600–1000 C). The effects of annealing temperature on the crystal structure. morphology. and gas sensing properties of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles are studied. A mixed spinel structure of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles with a lattice parameter of 8.445 Å is revealed by X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystallite size and X-ray density of ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles increase with the annealing temperature. whereas the lattice parameter and volume are considerably reduced indicating lattice distortion and defects such as oxygen vacancies. ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles annealed at 1000 C exhibit the highest sensitivity (0.13% ppm–1). sharp response (τ res= 195 s). recovery (τ rec= 17 s). and linear response to 100–400 ppm NO 2 gas. The annealing temperature and oxygen vacancies play a major role in determining the sensitivity of devices. The plausible sensing mechanism is discussed.

The basic idea of the LMI method in control is to interpret a given control problem as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. i.e.. an optimization problem with linear objective and positive semidefinite constraints involving symmetric matrices that are affine in the decision variables.The LMI formalism is relevant for many reasons.

The method applies to either state or output feedback problems where the performance objective (eg. stabilization. H 2 or H∞ control) can be stated in terms of the search for a suitable Lyapunov matrix over spatial frequency. By restricting this matrix to be constant across frequency. controller localization can be naturally imposed. Thus. we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of a controller with the desired localization and performance. which take the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) over spatial frequency. For one-dimensional arrays. we further show how to convert these conditions exactly to finite-dimensional LMIs by means of the Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov Lemma; extensions to the multi-dimensional case are also discussed.,True,uF7svsoAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,82,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000510980100245X,12587076734438363335,/scholar?cites=12587076734438363335,,,0,0,0
1181749,Sets and constraints in the analysis of uncertain systems,1995,Fernando Paganini,,,,,,This thesis is concerned with the analysis of dynamical systems in the presence of model uncertainty. The approach of robust control theory has been to describe uncertainty in terms of a structured set of models. and has proven successful for questions. like stability. which call for a worst-case evaluation over this set. In this respect. a first contribution of this thesis is to provide robust stability tests for the situation of combined time varying. time invariant and parametric uncertainties.    The worst-case setting has not been so attractive for questions of disturbance rejection. since the resulting performance criteria (e.g.. ℋ∞.) treat the disturbance as an adversary and ignore important spectral structure. usually better characterized by the theory of stochastic processes. The main contribution of this thesis is to show that the set-based methodology can indeed be extended to the modeling of white noise. by employing standard statistical tests in order to identify a typical set. and performing subsequent analysis in a worst-case setting. Particularly attractive sets are those described by quadratic signal constraints. which have proven to be very powerful for the characterization of unmodeled dynamics. The combination of white noise and unmodeled dynamics constitutes the Robust ℋ2 performance problem. which is rooted in the origins of robust control theory. By extending the scope of the quadratic constraint methodology we obtain a solution to this problem in terms of a convex condition for robustness analysis. which for the first time places it on an equal footing with the ℋ∞ performance measure.

Specifically. we consider the situation where the reduction must be consistent with a partition of the system states. This is motivated. for instance. in situations where state variables are associated with the topology of a networked system. and the reduction should preserve this. We build on the observation that imposing block structure to generalized controllability and observability gramians automatically yields such state-partitioned model reduction. The difficulty lies in ensuring feasibility of the resulting Lyapunov inequalities. which is in general very restrictive. To overcome this. we consider coprime factor model reduction.

The main generalization with respect to standard IP is to allow routers to split their traffic in a controlled way between the outgoing links. We formulate global optimization criteria. combining those used in the congestion control and traffic engineering. and propose decentralized controllers at sources and routers to reach these optimal points. based on congestion price feedback. We first consider adapting the traffic splits at routers to follow the negative price gradient; we prove this is globally stabilizing when combined with primal congestion control. but can exhibit oscillations in the case of dual congestion control.

The system aims at balancing the load by using an inner control loop with an admission threshold to assign incoming tasks to server pools; as an outer control loop. a learning scheme adjusts this threshold over time in steps of  units. to keep it aligned with the time-varying overall load. If the fluctuations in the normalized load are smaller than . then we prove that the threshold settles for all large enough  and balances the load when . Our model captures a tradeoff between optimality and stability. since for higher  the degree of balance decreases. but the threshold remains constant under larger load fluctuations.

This requires the automatic generation of assembly sequence plans from product specifications. as manual engineering of plans is slow and labor intensive. The main challenge in assembly planning is that the search for a valid plan must take the capabilities of the robotic system that will execute the plan into account. But checking the feasibility of executing a plan requires a simulation of the system. which slows down the search for a valid and executable plan. We therefore propose and implement two ideas to reduce search times. First. we iteratively refine the feasibility check of an assembly plan from levels taking only parts into account (which is fast) to high-fidelity levels including motion planning and full robotic simulations (which is high fidelity. but slow).

The complexity of a reachability analysis increases when the setup is reconfigurable or consists of multiple robots sharing the same workspace. In this work we show an approach to decouple task-specifications from system-wide configurations to compute task-specific workspace maps. These maps are a powerful tool for designing and planning robotic tasks. since they allow to visualize and suggest feasible poses for task execution. Furthermore. the maps can be queried during runtime to select appropriate poses automatically.

However. we also exhibit an algorithm that. for the important special case of one dimensional decision spaces. provides sublinear regret while maintaining a competitive ratio that grows arbitrarily slowly.,True,LvFKbc8AAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C,64,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Andrew13.html,9551669003994107192,/scholar?cites=9551669003994107192,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v30/Andrew13.pdf,0,0,0

This resource allocation problem is formulated as a power minimization problem. subject to meeting the target rates of all users in the network. We develop a distributed solution to find the globally optimal allocation which determines the subcarrier and power allocation dynamically. In addition. we investigate the impact of reducing the complexity by reducing the number of degrees of freedom available in the optimization. In particular. we consider a static bandwidth allocation scheme. and a static power allocation scheme.

For this reason. approximation jobs. which have deadline or error bounds and require only a subset of their tasks to complete. are projected to dominate big data workloads. Straggler tasks are an important hurdle when designing approximate data analytic frameworks. and the widely adopted approach to deal with them is speculative execution. In this paper. we present GRASS. which carefully uses speculation to mitigate the impact of stragglers in approximation jobs. GRASS’s design is based on first principles analysis of the impact of speculation.

Another important. but sometimes opposing. performance metric is a scheduling policy's fairness. For example. a policy that biases towards small job sizes so as to minimize mean response time may end up being unfair to large job sizes. In this paper we define three types of unfairness and demonstrate large classes of scheduling policies that fall into each type.

In this paper. we focus on a particularly promising industry for demand response: data centers. We use simulations to show that. not only are data centers large loads. but they can provide as much (or possibly more) flexibility as large-scale storage if given the proper incentives. However. due to the market power most data centers maintain. it is difficult to design programs that are efficient for data center demand response. To that end. we propose that prediction-based pricing is an appealing market design. and show that it outperforms more traditional supply function bidding mechanisms in situations where market power is an issue. However. prediction-based pricing may be inefficient when predictions are inaccurate. and so we provide analytic. worst-case bounds on the impact of prediction error on the efficiency of prediction-based …,True,4OvOdSgAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,182,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2637364.2592004,4919964254018565732,/scholar?cites=4919964254018565732,,https://authors.library.caltech.edu/47912/7/DCDRpricing.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Many-to-one matching markets exist in numerous different forms. such as college admissions. matching medical interns to hospitals for residencies. assigning housing to college students. and the classic firms and workers market. In all these markets. externalities such as complementarities and peer effects severely complicate the preference ordering of each agent. Further. research has shown that externalities lead to serious problems for market stability and for developing efficient algorithms to find stable matchings. In this paper we make the observation that peer effects are often the result of underlying social connections. and we explore a formulation of the many-to-one matching market where peer effects are derived from an underlying social network.

A convenient way to achieve scheduling is to limit the number of transactions within the database. maintaining most of the transactions in an external queue. which can be ordered as desired by the application. While external scheduling has many advantages in that it doesn’t require changes to internal resources. it is also difficult to get right in that its performance depends critically on the particular multiprogramming limit used (the MPL). i.e. the number of transactions allowed into the database. If the MPL is too low. throughput will suffer. since not all DBMS resources will be utilized. On the other hand. if the MPL is too high. there is insufficient control on scheduling.

A crucial roadblock to achieving predictable performance is stragglers. ie. tasks that take significantly longer than expected to run. At this point. speculative execution has been widely adopted to mitigate the impact of stragglers. However. speculation mechanisms are designed and operated independently of job scheduling when. in fact. scheduling a speculative copy of a task has a direct impact on the resources available for other jobs. In this work. we present Hopper. a job scheduler that is speculation-aware. ie. that integrates the tradeoffs associated with speculation into job scheduling decisions.

Traditionally. demand response has been focused on large industrial and commercial loads. however it is expected that a large number of small residential loads such as air conditioners. dish washers. and electric vehicles will also participate in the coming years. The electricity consumption of these smaller loads. which we call deferrable loads. can be shifted over time. and thus be used (in aggregate) to compensate for the random fluctuations in renewable generation. In this paper. we propose a real-time distributed deferrable load control algorithm to reduce the variance of aggregate load (load minus renewable generation) by shifting the power consumption of deferrable loads to periods with high renewable generation.

The performance of channel-aware scheduling algorithms has mainly been examined at the packet level for a static user population. often assuming infinite backlogs. Recently. some studies have also explored the flow-level performance in a scenario with user dynamics governed by the arrival and completion of random service demands over time. Although in certain cases the performance may be evaluated by means of a Processor-Sharing model. in general the flow-level behavior has remained largely intractable. even basic stability properties. In the present paper we derive simple necessary stability conditions. and show that these are also sufficient for a wide class of utility-based scheduling policies.

This effect is attributed to the Rydberg blockade that occurs due to the strong interatomic interactions between highly excited atoms. Because of this blockade effect. the system can end up in a state in which all particles are either excited or blocked: a jamming limit. We analyze appropriately constructed random-graph models that capture the blockade effect. and derive formulae for the mean and variance of the number of Rydberg excitations in jamming limits. This yields an explicit relationship between the Mandel Q parameter and the blockade effect. and comparison to measurement data shows strong agreement between theory and experiment.,True,qC8d5_kAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,28,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.043002,7744933285633067437,/scholar?cites=7744933285633067437,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02624,0,0,0

Each server has its own queue and implements popular scheduling disciplines such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS). Processor Sharing (PS). and Random Order of Service (ROS). New jobs arrive according to a Poisson process and copies of each job are sent to  servers chosen uniformly at random. The service times of jobs are assumed to be exponentially distributed. A job departs as soon as one of its copies finishes service. Under the assumption that all  copies are iid. we show that for PS and ROS (for FCFS it is already known) sending redundant copies does not reduce the stability region. Under the assumption that the  copies are identical. we show that (i) ROS does not reduce the stability region.(ii) FCFS reduces the stability region. which can be characterized through an associated saturated system. and (iii) PS severely reduces the stability region. which coincides with the system where all copies have to be\emph {fully} served.

1181898,Almost global synchronization of symmetric Kuramoto coupled oscillators,2008,Eduardo Canale and Pablo Monzón,8,Systems Structure and Control,,167-190,InTech,A few decades ago. Y. Kuramoto introduced a mathematical model of weakly coupled oscillators that gave a formal framework to some of the works of AT Winfree on biological clocks [Kuramoto (1975). Kuramoto (1984). Winfree (1980)]. The model proposes the idea that several oscillators can interact in a way such that the individual oscillation properties change in order to achieve a global behavior for the interconnected system. The Kuramoto model serves as a good representation of many systems in several contexts: biology. engineering. physics. mechanics. etc.[Ermentrout (1985). York (1993). Strogatz (1994). Dussopt et al.(1999). Strogatz (2000). Jadbabaie et a.(2003). Rogge et al.(2004). Marshall et al.(2004). Moshtagh et al.(2005)].Recently. many works on the control community have focused on the analysis of the Kuramoto model. specially the one with sinusoidal coupling. The consensus or collective synchronization of the individuals is particularly important in many applications representing coordination. cooperation. emerging behavior. etc. Local stability properties of the consensus have been initially explored in [Jadbabaie et al.(2004)]. It must be noted that little attention has been devoted to the influence of the underlying interconnection graph on the stability properties of the system. The reason could be the fact that the local stability does not depend on the interconnection [van Hemmen et al.(1993)]. Global or almost global dynamical properties were studied in [Monzón et al.(2005). Monzón (2006). Monzón et al.(2006)]. In these works. the relevance of the interconnection graph of the system was hinted.

Almost global synchronization means that the desire objective is reached for every initial conditions. with the possible exception of a zero Lebesgue measure set.

There are several scenarios where completing exploration of a zone is a main part of the mission. Due to the efficiency and robustness brought by multi-robot systems. exploration is usually done cooperatively. Wireless communication plays an important role in collaborative multi-robot strategies. Unfortunately. the assumption of stable communication and end-to-end connectivity may be easily compromised in real scenarios. In this paper. a novel auto-adaptive multi-objective strategy is followed to support the selection of tasks regarding both exploration performance and connectivity level. Compared with others. the proposed approach shows effectiveness and flexibility to tackle the multi-robot exploration problem. being capable of decreasing the last of disconnection periods without noticeable degradation of the completion exploration time.

We define value and action-value functions that satisfy a barrier-based decomposition which allows for the identification of feasible policies independently of the reward process. We prove that. given a policy {\pi}. certifying whether certain state-action pairs lead to feasible trajectories under {\pi} is equivalent to solving an auxiliary problem aimed at finding the probability of performing an unfeasible transition. Using this interpretation. we develop a Barrier-learning algorithm. based on Q-Learning. that identifies such unsafe state-action pairs.

We focus on the canonical multi-armed bandit problem and seek to study the exploration-preservation trade-off intrinsic within safe learning. More precisely. by defining a handicap metric that counts the number of unsafe actions. we provide an algorithm for discarding unsafe machines (or actions). with probability one. that achieves constant handicap. Our algorithm is rooted in the classical sequential probability ratio test. redefined here for continuing tasks. Under standard assumptions on sufficient exploration. our rule provably detects all unsafe machines in an (expected) finite number of rounds. The analysis also unveils a trade-off between the number of rounds needed to secure the environment and the probability of discarding safe machines. Our decision rule can wrap around any other algorithm to optimize a specific auxiliary goal since it provides a safe environment to search for (approximately) optimal policies.

Although a number of methods have been developed to integrate both types of data. the desiderata of efficient and powerful algorithms still remains. In this paper. sparse structural equation models (SEMs) are employed to integrate both gene expression data and cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL). for modeling gene regulatory networks in accordance with biological evidence about genes regulating or being regulated by a small number of genes. A systematic inference method named sparsity-aware maximum likelihood (SML) is developed for SEM estimation. Using simulated directed acyclic or cyclic networks. the SML performance is compared with that of two state-of-the-art algorithms: the adaptive Lasso (AL) based scheme. and the QTL-directed dependency graph (QDG) method.

To learn the optimal policy we introduce a stochastic policy gradient ascent algorithm with three unique novel features: (i) The stochastic estimates of policy gradients are unbiased. (ii) The variance of stochastic gradients is reduced by drawing on ideas from numerical differentiation. (iii) Policy complexity is controlled using sparse RKHS representations. Novel feature (i) is instrumental in proving convergence to a stationary point of the expected cumulative reward. Novel feature (ii) facilitates reasonable convergence times.

The novel regularized imputation approach induces sparsity in the factors of the tensor's PARAFAC decomposition. thus reducing its rank. The focus is on count processes which emerge in diverse applications ranging from genomics to computer and social networking. Based on Poisson count data. a maximum aposteriori (MAP) estimator is developed using the Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion. This probabilistic approach also facilitates incorporation of correlated priors regularizing the rank. while endowing the tensor imputation method with extra smoothing and prediction capabilities.

Both rely on a novel online coordinate descent algorithm which minimizes a time-weighted least-squares cost penalized with the scaled lscr 1  norm of the unknown parameters. In addition to computational savings offered when processing time-invariant sparse parameter vectors. both schemes can be used for tracking slowly varying sparse signals.

Time becomes critical however. since offsets in the internal clocks of PMUs render their data unreliable. In this context. the present work describes grid-wide implementation of a Precision Time Protocol system to deliver an accurate time reference to PMUs at different power stations.

If available. prior information about the data at hand should be incorporated to enhance performance of the imputation method adopted. This is the motivation behind the proposed low-rank tensor estimator which leverages the correlation across slices of the data cube in the form of reproducing kernels. The rank of the tensor estimate is controlled by a novel regularization on the factors of its PARAFAC decomposition. Such a regularization is inspired by a reformulation of the nuclear norm for matrices. which allows to bypass the challenge that rank and singular values of tensors are unrelated quantities.

1181990,Nonlinear fuzzy control of human heart rate during aerobic endurance training with respect to significant model variations,2014,Adrian Pătrașcu and Monica Patrascu and Iacob Hanțiu,,,,,,In the field of physical activity a significant importance is held by aerobic endurance training. which is a relatively low intensity exercise that depends primarily on aerobic energy generating processes. This type of training is used for the overall endurance and fitness of the body by engaging all the major systems of the body and pushing the limits of their functions with the ultimate goal of adapting these structures to the stress of the physical effort and thus improving the performance output. However. using classic training methods. it is often impossible to ensure the necessary operating points in order to obtain the desired results.

In recent years. along with the increase in computational power. evolutionary optimization techniques have been increasingly used for the design of controllers. Some methods of design perform parameter tuning of controllers with a chosen structure. PID controllers. widely used in industry and practical applications. have mainly benefited from the use of genetic algorithms for their tuning. especially for systems that are not linear time invariant. In this study we consider the tuning of PID controllers for time delay systems by introducing a specially designed performance index and a self-adaptation mechanism that makes use of this index.

We obtained a complete (non-simplified) analytic solution of the entropy generation along of the HEX that allows exact evaluation of the irreversible processes in smooth or augmented tubes. By using this analytic solution. we proposed an adapted augmentation entropy generation number and compared it with Bejan’s original formulation. We evaluated the difference between the two at more than 7%. For a heat exchanger with corrugated tubes we have found that the recommended augmented solution e4p4a45# 9 in Bejan’s adapted formulation is different from the e2p4a45# 3 recommended by Bejan’s original formulation; thus. we found a change of the hierarchy of the recommended solutions. We developed a thermoeconomic model of a HEX for periods of operation of 1 to 10 years. for which specific optimum points of cost have been obtained. Furthermore. representing the cost versus entropy generation opens the path for future advanced comparisons of complementary objectives that may conduct to balanced designs: thermal process optimum vs economical optimum. We outlined. through matrix formulation. a new methodology of analysis of the constructal tree networks based on the network laws and thermohydro-electric analogy.

Teodosiu,36,Energy and Buildings,11,1107-1115,Elsevier,It is not obvious to accurately determine the heat loss under dynamic conditions for building envelopes made of hollow blocks using classical one-dimensional heat flow computations. Consequently. complex three-dimensional heat transfers analyses are necessary to correctly assess their thermal behaviour. This latter approach is characterised by linear state models with high-order matrixes. Therefore. this method is not very practical since it requires cautious numerical implementation and intensive computation time. One way to obtain important decrease of the computation time with no significant losses of precision is to use model size reduction techniques.

Ainsi. notre travail se propose de contribuer à l'amélioration des modèles CFD tridimensionnels concernant l'écoulement de l'air dans les pièces ventilées ou chauffées. La première partie de notre étude est consacrée à une représentation du principe de la méthode et à ses éléments fondamentaux (modélisation d'un écoulement turbulent. discrétisation du domaine de calcul. résolution numérique. etc.). Cette synthèse nous permet de sélectionner les approches les plus appropriées pour les écoulements habituellement rencontrés à l'intérieur des bâtiments. Ensuite. nous appliquons les méthodes retenues (à l'aide du code Fluent) au sein des modèle qui traitent la simulation des systèmes techniques dans le domaine des équipements des bâtiments. Un premier modèle est réservé à l'étude d'un système de ventilation par mélange tandis que les deux autres concernent des locaux chauffés soit par des radiateurs (à eau chaude). soit par des sources de chaleur linéaires électriques.

1182041,Appropriate CFD turbulence model for improving indoor air quality of ventilated spaces,2014,Cătălin Teodosiu and Viorel Ilie and Raluca Teodosiu,10,Mathematical Modelling in Civil Engineering,4,28-42,Sciendo,Accurate assessment of air-flow in ventilated spaces is of major importance for achieving healthy and comfortable indoor environment conditions. The CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) technique is nowadays one of the most used approaches in order to improve the indoor air quality in ventilated environments. Nevertheless. CFD has still two main challenges: turbulence modeling and experimental validation. As a result. the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of different turbulence models potentially appropriate for the prediction of indoor airflow. Accordingly. results obtained with 6 turbulence models (standard k-ε model. RNG k-ε model. realizable k-ε model. LRN SST k-ω model. transition SST k-ω model and low Reynolds Stress-ω model) are thoroughly validated based on detailed experimental data. The configuration taken into account in this work corresponds to isothermal and anisothermal airflows produced by mixing ventilation systems in small enclosures at low room air changes per hour. In general. the transition SST k-ω model shows the better overall behavior in comparison with measurement values. Consequently. the application of this turbulence model is appropriate for air flows in ventilated spaces. being an interesting option to more sophisticated LES (Large Eddy Simulation) models as it requires less computational resources.,True,Y7tl--MAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,10,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/mmce/10/4/article-p28.xml,15717741881337730257,/scholar?cites=15717741881337730257,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/mmce/10/4/article-p28.pdf,0,0,0
1182042,Experimental and numerical prediction of indoor air quality,2000,C Theodosiu and S Laporthe and G Rusouaen and J Virgone,,"Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Air Distribution in Rooms, Roomvent 2000",,95-100,,This paper is based on a dual approach (experimental and numerical) in order to predict the indoor air quality for small ventilated enclosures. The experimental part employs a ventilated test room and a tracer gas technique (constant method as gas injection) to estimate the diffusion of a pollutant. The gas used is the sulphur hexafluoride (F6S). The numerical approach is a CFD simulation. adding a convection–diffusion equation (to determine the local mass fraction of the pollutant) to the equations normally used to solve a turbulent flow. As the injected quantity of the gas is extremely low. the convergence of the pollutant transport equation can be only reached after an important CPU. Therefore we propose a strategy for the initialization of the problem in terms of tracer gas concentrations using the experimental data. This allows us to obtain important savings in time simulation. The experimental and numerical concentration tracer gas fields are compared for isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. Further. in order to characterise in a more general manner the ventilation efficiency and the indoor air quality of the two cases studied. we evaluate the ventilation efficiency index based on the experimental and CFD values. Moreover. we add to these results the values obtained by an improved zonal model. The results achieved reveal a good agreement between the experiment and CFD calculation. On the contrary. there are important discrepancies between the ventilation efficiency index values predicted by the zonal model and the values based on the experimentation.,True,Y7tl--MAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,10,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=opwC8_OzVycC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=info:eux62yrEshoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=S2lfUu6RHk&sig=kqBlBodWztWJXwJsIb_7Uw7MlFM,1923815679190559866,/scholar?cites=1923815679190559866,,https://www.aivc.org/sites/default/files/airbase_13276.pdf,0,0,0

According to grid code requirements. tripping of wind generators under grid faults is not allowed. The sensitivity of DFIGs to grid faults requires the use of crowbar protection for not damaging the electronic equipment.

The control system based on PI controller enables the low voltage ride through capability of the wind turbines. The reactive power control of doubly fed induction generators is mostly achieved by controlling its rotor side converter. The proposed control system allows regulating the reactive power using the rotor side converter as well as the grid side converter. During crowbar activation. the rotor side converter can no more control the reactive power. The proposed system controls the voltage at the point of common coupling to be above the imposed low voltage ride through curve. until the grid side converter returns to normal operation.

Preventive tests and on-line monitoring are used to predict incipient fault conditions. and to schedule outage maintenance and retirement of the transformers. This paper presents a survey on various approaches on monitoring and fault detection of electrical power transformers used to optimize maintenance techniques. This optimization is not possible without a correct fault diagnosis besides critical components and common failure modes knowledge.,True,l8B4JzgAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sorina_Costinas/publication/265298100_Monitoring_and_diagnosis_methods_for_high_voltage_power_transformers/links/540825ba0cf23d9765ae4888.pdf,1786468320024125015,/scholar?cites=1786468320024125015,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sorina_Costinas/publication/265298100_Monitoring_and_diagnosis_methods_for_high_voltage_power_transformers/links/540825ba0cf23d9765ae4888.pdf,0,0,0

Starting from the assumption of some characteristic parameters of load profiles: maximum power. minimum power and the energy consumption in a time period. characteristic coefficients of different types of algebraic polynomials such as: linear. parabolic and third-order are obtained. The modelling of real load profile has been tested on a small industrial consumer.

1182083,Optimal temperature control of intermittently heated buildings using Model Predictive Control: Part I–Building modeling,2012,Ion Hazyuk and Christian Ghiaus and David Penhouet,51,Building and Environment,,379-387,Pergamon,An important performance in building thermal control is to ensure thermal comfort with minimal energy consumption. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is considered to be one of the most suited solutions for this due to its ability to use occupancy schedule and weather forecasts for optimal temperature control. MPC relies on a dynamical model of the building. which is the main difficulty of applying it. Therefore. this paper treats the problems related to building modeling and model parameters identification. A robust model of the building is obtained in two stages: firstly physical knowledge is used to determine the structure of a low-order model. then least squares identification method is applied to find the numerical values of the model parameters. In order to perform the identification usually there are required input/output data records having variations which generally are not accepted in inhabited buildings because of …,True,1XJG8goAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,238,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132311003933,10101955556425626560,/scholar?cites=10101955556425626560,,,0,0,0

Buildings became. as Le Corbusier portended during the 1930s. of the same type: hermetically closed and controlled at a constant temperature in all climates (Mahdavi and Kumar. 1996). This energy-intensive solution is supported by the belief that maintaining constant conditions ensures comfort and satisfaction. By applying this approach. however. the building industry failed in many cases to satisfy the comfort needs of occupants. Different studies claim that as many as 43 per cent of occupants are dissatisfied with heating. ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC). and 56 to 89 per cent of government workers regard HVAC as a problem in Europe and the US (Lomonaco and Miller. 1996; DiLouie. 2002). The tendency for the HVAC industry is. then. to keep indoor temperature at a constant value that will dissatisfy the least number of people without affecting productivity since the cost of salaries is 8 to 13 times the cost of building operation. The trend towards a greater control of the indoor environment is accentuated by the development of building management systems (BMS). BMS control the indoor temperature within narrow limits in the hope that occupants’ complaints will be reduced. To test this hypothesis. let us assume that a female wearing a skirt because of the corporate dress code or current fashion sits at her desk with bare legs. She shares the same thermal comfort zone with a male colleague in a business suit.

In intermittently occupied buildings. this presumes the ability of the controller to recover in due time the building from setback. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is considered among the best candidates for this task due to its ability to use occupancy schedule and weather forecasts for optimal temperature control. However. the use of the classical cost function within MPC does not allow to achieve the objectives of minimal energy consumption and optimal restart of the heating system. Therefore. a new cost function is introduced. which minimizes the energy consumption while maintaining the thermal comfort in the building.

Currently. building thermal dynamic simulation is used to check design solutions but it gives little information on what and how much may be improved. Iterative parameter optimization is a solution but the methods used may stick in local minima and do not allow the designer to evaluate different solutions. An alternative evaluation method is to obtain simple polynomial functions which estimate the annual energy demand as a function of building envelope parameters. The coefficients of these functions may be obtained by regression from dynamic simulation results. The number of dynamic simulations needed is reduced if the numerical simulations are optimally designed.

The solution proposed in this paper is to use the range between the 1st and the 3rd quartile of the quantile–quantile (q–q) plot to check if the heating losses and the outdoor temperature have the same distribution and. if yes. to perform the regression in this range of the q–q plot. The result is a model that conserves its prediction performance for data sets of the outdoor temperature different of those used for parameter identification.

Its potential for cooling may be assessed by using a method based on the indoor–outdoor temperature difference of the free-running building. the adaptive comfort criteria and the outdoor temperature. It is demonstrated that the free-running temperature may be used instead of the balance temperature in energy estimation methods. The indoor–outdoor temperature difference of the free-running building becomes a characteristic of the thermal behavior of the building which is decoupled from comfort range and outdoor temperature. A measure related to the energy saved and the applicability of free-cooling is given by the probabilistic distribution of the degree-hours as a function of the outdoor temperature and time.

The qualitative rules result in a quantitative non-linear controller well-suited for non-linear systems that controls thermal comfort with vague defined objectives. The fuzzy models are achieved through experimental identification by varying the inputs so that the fan-coil reaches the states encountered in normal operation.

To solve this problem. a cellular approach is proposed in which the spray is considered as a pile of rigid spheres of equal size; each sphere has multiple layers and contains a drop in its center. The evaporation takes place gradually from the superficial layer towards the internal layers. Parametric studies show the influence of each variable on the evaporation time of the droplets. The model may be used for sizing passive evaporative cooling systems and towers for buildings using the passive evaporative down draught effect.

However. the model acts as a low-pass filter and needs to respond only to the frequency spectrum present in the measured inputs. Then. the order of the transfer function can be determined by using the frequency spectrum of the measured inputs and the accuracy of the sensors. The main idea is that from two models of different orders. the one with a lower order can be used in building parameter identification. when the difference between the outputs is negligible or lower than the output measurement error.

A passive cooling potential (PCP) can also be defined. as the possibility to ensure an acceptable indoor thermal comfort using natural ventilation. Ensuring an acceptable indoor air quality. or cooling down the building structure by natural ventilation hangs on many conditions depending on the site (outdoor air quality. outdoor air temperature and moisture. outdoor noise. local winds or global wind and urban structure. etc.) or on the building (indoor pollutant sources. indoor heat sources and stored heat. indoor air quality requirements. position and size of ventilation openings. indoor temperature. orientation of building. internal air path distribution. etc.) The NVP cannot therefore be expressed as a single number. It is a multiple attribute variable. ie a list of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the site or the building. based on available input data. It is nevertheless possible to decide. on the basis of these characteristics combined with the requirements. if a given building–or a room in a building–is likely to be well enough ventilated or not using natural ventilation.

We propose a hydraulic schematic for a multifunction multi-source solar system (MFMSYS) and we consider the area of the solar collector and the volume of the thermal storage tank as the parameters to be optimally sized for minimizing the total cost. An additional cost. which increases exponentially with the lack of thermal comfort. is introduced in the total cost function. The sizing is then an optimization without constraints problem. The running costs are estimated by dynamic simulation of the building and its associated solar system. The total cost function has a valley-like shape oriented almost along the volume of the storage tank.

We attribute this unexplained secondary organic-aerosol production to the oxidation of low-volatility gas-phase species.

In every experiment. we observed levoglucosan decay in particles exposed to OH. The extent of decay ranged from ∼20% to ∼90% and was strongly correlated to the integrated OH exposure. Increased relative humidity did not enhance or impede reaction. Relative kinetics indicate that levoglucosan has an atmospheric lifetime of 0.7–2.2 days when biomass burning particles are exposed to 1 × 106 molecules cm−3 of OH (typical average summertime conditions).

This was done by exposing the dilute emissions from a small wood stove to UV light in a smog chamber and measuring the gas- and particle-phase pollutant concentrations with a suite of instruments including a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS). an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) and a thermodenuder. The measurements highlight how atmospheric processing can lead to considerable evolution of the mass and volatility of biomass-burning OA. Photochemical oxidation produced substantial new OA. increasing concentrations by a factor of 1.5 to 2.8 after several hours of exposure to typical summertime hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. Less than 20% of this new OA could be explained using a state-of-the-art secondary organic aerosol model and the measured decay of traditional SOA precursors. The thermodenuder data indicate that the primary OA is semivolatile; at 50°C between 50 and 80% of the fresh primary OA evaporated. Aging reduced the volatility of the OA; at 50°C only 20 to 40% of aged OA evaporated. The predictions of a volatility basis-set model that explicitly tracks the partitioning and aging of low-volatility organics was compared to the chamber data.

The experiments were carried out at the US Forest Service Fire Science Laboratory as part of the third Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME III). We investigated emissions from 12 different fuels commonly burned in North American wildfires. The experiments feature atmospheric and plume aerosol and oxidant concentrations; aging times ranged from 3 to 4.5 h. OA production. expressed as a mass enhancement ratio (ratio of OA to primary OA (POA) mass). was highly variable. OA mass enhancement ratios ranged from 2.9 in experiments where secondary OA (SOA) production nearly tripled the POA concentration to 0.7 in experiments where photo-oxidation resulted in a 30 % loss of the OA mass. The campaign-average OA mass enhancement ratio was 1.7 ± 0.7 (mean ± 1σ); therefore. on average. there was substantial SOA production. In every experiment. the OA was chemically transformed. Even in experiments with net loss of OA mass. the OA became increasingly oxygenated and less volatile with aging. indicating that photo-oxidation transformed the POA emissions. Levoglucosan concentrations were also substantially reduced with photo-oxidation. The transformations of POA were extensive; using levoglucosan as a tracer for POA. unreacted POA only contributed 17 % of the campaign-average OA mass after 3.5 h of exposure to typical atmospheric hydroxyl radical (OH) levels.

Food cooking emissions,2006,Allen L Robinson and R Subramanian and Neil M Donahue and Anna Bernardo-Bricker and Wolfgang F Rogge,40,Environmental science & technology,24,7820-7827,American Chemical Society,The chemical mass balance model is applied to a large dataset of organic molecular marker concentrations to apportion ambient organic aerosol to food cooking emissions in Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania. Ambient concentrations of key cooking markers such as palmitoleic acid. oleic acid. and cholesterol are well correlated. which implies the existence of well-defined source profiles. However. significant inconsistencies exist between the ambient data and published source profiles. Most notably. the ambient ratio of palmitoleic-acid-to-oleic-acid is more than a factor of 10 greater than essentially all published source profiles. This problem is not unique to Pittsburgh. The reason for this discrepancy is not known but it means that both acids cannot be fit simultaneously by CMB.

One challenge in measuring toxicant content of the smoke in the laboratory is the large number of simplifying assumptions that must be made to model a “typical” smoking session using a smoking machine. resulting in uncertainty over the obtained toxicant yields. In this study. we develop an alternative approach in which smoke generated by a human water pipe user is sampled directly during the smoking session.

We investigated SOA formation by oxidizing dilute. ambient-level exhaust concentrations from a fleet of on-road gasoline vehicles in a smog chamber. We measured less SOA formation from newer vehicles meeting more stringent emissions standards. This suggests that the natural replacement of older vehicles with newer ones that meet more stringent emissions standards should reduce SOA levels in urban environments. However. SOA production depends on both precursor concentrations (emissions) and atmospheric chemistry (SOA yields). We found a strongly nonlinear relationship between SOA formation and the ratio of nonmethane organic gas to oxides of nitrogen (NOx) (NMOG:NOx). which affects the fate of peroxy radicals.

We describe a plug flow model for transport phenomena in a TD. which can be used to simulate the rate of vapor build-up in the gas phase and the corresponding change in particle size distribution. Model simulations were found to have excellent agreement with experiments performed with pure and mixed dicarboxylic acid aerosols. Both simulations and experiments showed that the aerosols approached equilibrium within reasonable residence times (15 s–30 s) for aerosol concentrations and size distributions typical for laboratory measurements. and that volatility studies at sufficiently high aerosol loadings. therefore. need not resort to kinetic models for inference of thermodynamic properties. However. for size distributions relevant for ambient aerosols. equilibration time scales were much larger than residence times available with current TD designs. We have also performed dimensional analysis on the problem of equilibration in TDs. and derived a dimensionless equilibration parameter which can be used to determine the residence time needed for an aerosol of given size distribution and kinetic properties to approach equilibrium. It is also shown theoretically and empirically that aerosol volatility has no effect on the equilibration time scales.

The chemical and physical processes associated with SOA formation are complex and varied. and. despite considerable progress in recent years. a quantitative and predictive understanding of SOA formation does not exist and therefore represents a major research challenge in atmospheric science. This review begins with an update on the current state of knowledge on the global SOA budget and is followed by an overview of the atmospheric degradation mechanisms for SOA precursors. gas-particle partitioning theory and the analytical techniques used to determine the chemical composition of SOA.

Laboratory experiments show that photo-oxidation of diesel emissions rapidly generates organic aerosol. greatly exceeding the contribution from known secondary organic-aerosol precursors. We attribute this unexplained secondary organic-aerosol production to the oxidation of low-volatility gas-phase species. Accounting for partitioning and photochemical processing of primary emissions creates a more regionally distributed aerosol and brings model predictions into better agreement with observations.

This framework also reveals critical deficiencies in current emissions and SOA formation measurements. The key feature of this treatment is a uniform basis set of saturation vapor pressures spanning the range of ambient organic saturation concentrations. from effectively nonvolatile material at 0.01 μg m-3 to vapor-phase effluents at 100 mg m-3.

The components from all sites. when taken together. provide a holistic overview of Northern Hemisphere organic aerosol (OA) and its evolution in the atmosphere. At most sites. the OA can be separated into oxygenated OA (OOA). hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA). and sometimes other components such as biomass burning OA (BBOA). We focus on the OOA components in this work. In many analyses. the OOA can be further deconvolved into low-volatility OOA (LV-OOA) and semi-volatile OOA (SV-OOA). Differences in the mass spectra of these components are characterized in terms of the two main ions m/z 44 (CO2+) and m/z 43 (mostly C2H3O+). which are used to develop a new mass spectral diagnostic for following the aging of OA components in the atmosphere. The LV-OOA component spectra have higher f44 (ratio of m/z 44 to total signal in the component mass spectrum) and lower f43 (ratio of m/z 43 to total signal in the component mass spectrum) than SV-OOA. A wide range of f44 and O:C ratios are observed for both LV-OOA (0.17±0.04. 0.73±0.14) and SV-OOA (0.07±0.04. 0.35±0.14) components. reflecting the fact that there is a continuum of OOA properties in ambient aerosol. The OOA components (OOA.

This was done by exposing the dilute emissions from a small wood stove to UV light in a smog chamber and measuring the gas- and particle-phase pollutant concentrations with a suite of instruments including a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS). an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) and a thermodenuder. The measurements highlight how atmospheric processing can lead to considerable evolution of the mass and volatility of biomass-burning OA. Photochemical oxidation produced substantial new OA. increasing concentrations by a factor of 1.5 to 2.8 after several hours of exposure to typical summertime hydroxyl radical (OH) concentrations. Less than 20% of this new OA could be explained using a state-of-the-art secondary organic aerosol model and the measured decay of traditional SOA precursors. The thermodenuder data indicate that the primary OA is semivolatile; at 50°C between 50 and 80% of the fresh primary OA evaporated. Aging reduced the volatility of the OA; at 50°C only 20 to 40% of aged OA evaporated. The predictions of a volatility basis-set model that explicitly tracks the partitioning and aging of low-volatility organics was compared to the chamber data.

Ultrafine (<100 nm) particles often dominate aerosol numbers. and nucleation of atmospheric vapors is an important source of these particles. To have climatic relevance. however. the freshly nucleated particles need to grow in size. We combine observations from two continental sites (Egbert. Canada and Hyytiälä. Finland) to show that condensation of organic vapors is a crucial factor governing the lifetimes and climatic importance of the smallest atmospheric particles. We model the observed ultrafine aerosol growth with a simplified scheme approximating the condensing species as a mixture of effectively non-volatile and semi-volatile species. demonstrate that state-of-the-art organic gas-particle partitioning models fail to reproduce the observations. and propose a modeling approach that is consistent with the measurements. We find that roughly half of the mass of the condensing mass needs to be distributed proportional to the aerosol surface area (thus implying that the condensation is governed by gas-phase concentration rather than the equilibrium vapour pressure) to explain the observed aerosol growth. We demonstrate the large sensitivity of predicted number concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to these interactions between organic vapors and the smallest atmospheric nanoparticles – highlighting the need for representing this process in global climate models.,True,ILambBMAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,338,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/3865/2011/,1145483828609864444,/scholar?cites=1145483828609864444,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/11/3865/2011/acp-11-3865-2011.pdf,0,0,0

The growth of the smallest atmospheric particles from diameters in the nanometre range to sizes at which they may act as seeds for cloud droplets is a key step linking aerosols to clouds and climate. In many environments. atmospheric nanoparticles grow by taking up organic compounds that are derived from biogenic hydrocarbon emissions. Several mechanisms may control this uptake. Condensation of low-volatility vapours and formation of organic salts probably dominate the very first steps of growth in particles close to 1 nm in diameter. As the particles grow further. formation of organic polymers and effects related to the phase of the particle probably become increasingly important.

Effect of NO x concentration,2005,Albert A Presto and Kara E Huff Hartz and Neil M Donahue,39,Environmental Science & Technology,18,7046-7054,American Chemical Society,We report secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields from the ozonolysis of α-pinene in the presence of NO and NO2. Experimental conditions are characterized by the [VOC]0/[NOx]0 ratio (ppbC/ppb). which varies from ∼1 to ∼300. SOA yield is constant for [VOC]0/[NOx]0 > ∼15 and decreases dramatically (by more than a factor of 4) as [VOC]0/[NOx]0 decreases. Aerosol production is completely suppressed in the presence of NO for [VOC]0/[NOx]0 ≤ 4.5. Fourier transform IR analysis of filter samples reveals that nitrate-containing species contribute significantly to the total aerosol mass at low [VOC]0/[NOx]0.

Experiments conducted in the Carnegie Mellon University environmental chamber to study SOA formation from the photo-oxidation of toluene show significantly larger SOA production than parameterizations employed in current air-quality models. Aerosol mass yields depend on experimental conditions: yields are higher under higher UV intensity. under low-NOx conditions and at lower temperatures. The extent of oxidation of the aerosol also varies with experimental conditions. consistent with ongoing. progressive photochemical aging of the toluene SOA. Measurements using a thermodenuder system suggest that the aerosol formed under high- and low-NOx conditions is semi-volatile. These results suggest that SOA formation from toluene depends strongly on ambient conditions.

AVs could facilitate unprecedented levels of efficiency and radically reduce transportation sector energy and environmental impacts; on the other hand. consumer choices could result in a net increase in energy consumption and environmental impacts.  As the technology matures and approaches market penetration. improved models of AV usage. especially consumer preferences. will facilitate the development of policies …,True,pR5kLz0AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,27,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-05990-7_12,744786578106089979,/scholar?cites=744786578106089979,,,0,0,0

1182207,Increasing backup generation capacity and system reliability by selling electricity during periods of peak demand,2007,Elisabeth A Gilmore and Lester Lave,,,,,International Association for Energy Economics,Meeting electricity demand during the 200 hours of greatest use each year is costly and challenging. especially in transmission constrained urban centers. Allowing installed backup and emergency generators to sell electricity for profit during peak demand and participate in the installed capacity (ICAP) market could lower the price of electricity and increase the reliability for all customers. not just the owners. The additional revenue could also provide an incentive for more customers to buy backup generators. adding still more reliability to the system.Here. we evaluate the economic potential of using backup generator for meeting peak electricity demand and ICAP requirements in the New York City–Long Island (NYC-LONGLI) region in New York (NY) State. First. we calculate the implicit value of unserved electricity as revealed by the investment in backup generator. Second. we evaluate the profit that would be earned by a backup generator available during the 200 peak hours each year. using the NYC and LONGLI zonal prices in 2005 and in 2006 as a case study. The profits from real electricity are calculated as the zonal prices minus the marginal cost of the generator. The profits from the ICAP market are equal to the clearing price minus the opportunity cost of being ready to operate. We then subtract the available profits from the costs of ownership (fixed costs) to estimate the ‘reduced’implicit value of reliability. or the adjusted reservation price for purchasing a generator. We then estimate the increase in backup capacity.

Most crop production systems in the United States are characterized by low species and management diversity. high use of fossil energy and agrichemicals. and large negative impacts on the environment. We hypothesized that cropping system diversification would promote ecosystem services that would supplement. and eventually displace. synthetic external inputs used to maintain crop productivity. To test this. we conducted a field study from 2003–2011 in Iowa that included three contrasting systems varying in length of crop sequence and inputs. We compared a conventionally managed 2-yr rotation (maize-soybean) that received fertilizers and herbicides at rates comparable to those used on nearby farms with two more diverse cropping systems: a 3-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small grain + red clover) and a 4-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small grain + alfalfa-alfalfa) managed with lower synthetic N fertilizer and herbicide inputs and periodic applications of cattle manure. Grain yields. mass of harvested products. and profit in the more diverse systems were similar to. or greater than. those in the conventional system. despite reductions of agrichemical inputs. Weeds were suppressed effectively in all systems. but freshwater toxicity of the more diverse systems was two orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional system.

Here we calculate greenhouse gas emissions associated with the invasion of an agricultural pest from Asia to North America. The soybean aphid. Aphis glycines. was first discovered in North America in 2000. and has led to a substantial increase in insecticide use in soybeans. We estimate that the manufacture. transport. and application of insecticides against soybean aphid results in approximately 10.6 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent greenhouse gasses being emitted per hectare of soybeans treated. Given the acreage sprayed. this has led to annual emissions of between 6 and 40 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses in the United States since the invasion of soybean aphid. depending on pest population size. Emissions would be higher were it not for the development of a threshold aphid density below which farmers are advised not to spray. Without a threshold. farmers tend to spray preemptively and the threshold allows farmers to take advantage of naturally occurring biological control of the soybean aphid. which can be substantial. We find that adoption of the soybean aphid economic threshold can lead to emission reductions of approximately 300 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year in the United States. Previous studies have documented that biological control agents such as lady beetles are capable of suppressing aphid densities below this threshold in over half of the soybean acreage in the U.S. Given the …,True,BLZMrAUAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072293,9427815288689700853,/scholar?cites=9427815288689700853,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072293,0,0,0

Existing policies do not reflect this variation. Market-based policies can be designed to accommodate nonuniformly mixed pollution by using emissions penalties that vary with damages. With perfect information and heterogeneous damages. damage-based policy differentiation is unambiguously welfare improving. In contrast. when damages and abatement costs are uncertain. differentiated policies need not welfare-dominate undifferentiated designs. Using a large-scale US emissions trading program as a case in point. we show how undifferentiated emissions trading can dominate the differentiated alternative when ex post abatement costs exceeded expectations.

This paper examines the impact that these actions had on emissions and expected health effects through reduced personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption. Using daily cell phone mobility data for each US county. we find that vehicle travel dropped about 40% by mid-April across the nation. States that imposed stay-at-home policies before March 28 decreased travel slightly more than other states. but travel in all states decreased significantly. Using data on hourly electricity consumption by electricity region (eg. balancing authority). we find that electricity consumption fell about six percent on average by mid-April with substantial heterogeneity. Given these decreases in travel and electricity use. we estimate the county-level expected improvements in air quality. and therefore expected declines in mortality. Overall. we estimate that. for a month of social distancing. the expected premature deaths due to air pollution from personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption declined by approximately 360 deaths. or about 25% of the baseline 1500 deaths.

Annual local and global air pollution damages fell from $245 to $133 billion over 2010–2017. Decomposition shows changes in emission rates and generation shares among coal and gas plants account for more of this decline than changes in renewable generation. electricity consumption. and damage valuations. Econometrically estimated marginal damages declined in the East from 8.6 to 6 cents per kWh. Marginal damages increased slightly in the West and Texas.

Our approach employs Census demographic data and a recently published high-resolution dataset of outdoor NO2 concentrations. Nationally. population-weighted mean NO2 concentrations are 4.6 ppb (38%. p<0.01) higher for nonwhites than for whites. The environmental health implications of that concentration disparity are compelling. For example. we estimate that reducing nonwhites’ NO2 concentrations to levels experienced by whites would reduce Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) mortality by ∼7.000 deaths per year. which is equivalent to 16 million people increasing their physical activity level from inactive (0 hours/week of physical activity) to sufficiently active (>2.5 hours/week of physical activity). Inequality for NO2 concentration is greater than inequality for income (Atkinson Index: 0.11 versus 0.08). Low-income nonwhite young children and elderly people are disproportionately exposed to residential outdoor NO2. Our findings establish a national context for previous work that has documented air pollution environmental injustice and inequality within individual US metropolitan areas and regions. Results given here can aid policy-makers in identifying locations with high environmental injustice and inequality.

In turn. changes in transportation demand influence total passenger vehicle emissions to which populations are exposed. Population density can also influence the fraction of total emissions that are inhaled by the exposed urban population. Equations are presented that describe these relationships for an idealized representation of an urban area. Using analytic solutions to these equations. we investigate the effect of three changes in urban population and urban land area (infill. sprawl. and constant-density growth) on per capita inhalation intake of primary pollutants from passenger vehicles.

1182318,The Economics of CO2. Transport by Pipeline and Storage in Saline Aquifers and Oil Reservoirs,2008,Sean T McCoy,,,,,,Large reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change. One method of achieving such reductions is CO2 capture and storage (CCS). CCS requires the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) at a large industrial facility. such as a power plant. and its transport to a geological storage site where CO2 is sequestered. If implemented. CCS could allow fossil fuels to be used with little or no CO2 emissions until alternative energy sources are more widely deployed. Large volumes of CO2 are most efficiently transported by pipeline and stored either in deep saline aquifers or in oil reservoirs. where CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This thesis describes a suite of models developed to estimate the project-specific cost of CO2 transport and storage. Engineering-economic models of pipeline CO2 transport. CO2-flood EOR. and aquifer storage were developed for this purpose. The models incorporate a probabilistic analysis capability that is used to quantify the sensitivity of transport and storage cost to variability and uncertainty in the model input parameters. The cost of CO2 pipeline transport is shown to be sensitive to the region of construction. in addition to factors such as the length and design capacity of the pipeline. The cost of CO2 storage in saline aquifers is shown to be most sensitive to factors affecting site characterization cost. For EOR projects. CO2 storage has traditionally been a secondary effect of oil recovery; thus. a levelized cost of CO2 storage cannot be defined. Instead EOR projects were evaluated based on the breakeven price of CO2 (ie. the price of CO2 at which the project net …,True,puoY4D8AAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,169,https://www.cmu.edu/ceic/assets/docs/publications/phd-dissertations/2008/sean-mccoy-phd-thesis-2008.pdf,14510887193777206094,/scholar?cites=14510887193777206094,,https://www.cmu.edu/ceic/assets/docs/publications/phd-dissertations/2008/sean-mccoy-phd-thesis-2008.pdf,0,0,0

In CO2-flood EOR. CO2 is injected into an oil reservoir to reduce oil viscosity. reduce interfacial tension. and cause oil swelling which improves oil recovery. Previous studies suggest that substantial amounts of CO2 from power plants could be sequestered in EOR projects. thus reducing the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. This claim. however. ignores the fact that oil. a carbon rich fuel. is produced and 93% of the carbon in petroleum is refined into combustible products ultimately emitted into the atmosphere.

In particular. the relationship between breakeven CO2 price and oil price is developed for four illustrative cases. all of which are. or were. operating EOR projects in North America.

These ad hoc assumptions ignore the large variability in the storage cost from site-to-site caused by variation in storage reservoir characteristics.

1182334,Methods to assess geologic CO2 storage capacity: status and best practice,2013,Wolf Heidug and S McCoy and T Yoshimura,,"Paris, France: International Energy Agency Workshop Report, September",,,,To understand the emission reduction potential of carbon capture and storage (CCS). decision makers need to understand the amount of CO2 that can be safely stored in the subsurface and the geographical distribution of storage resources. Estimates of storage resources need to be made using reliable and consistent methods. Previous estimates of CO2 storage potential for a range of countries and regions have been based on a variety of methodologies resulting in a correspondingly wide range of estimates. Consequently. there has been uncertainty about which of the methodologies were most appropriate in given settings. and whether the estimates produced by these methods were useful to policy makers trying to determine the appropriate role of CCS. In 2011. the IEA convened two workshops which brought together experts for six national surveys organisations to review CO2 storage assessment methodologies and make recommendations on how to harmonise CO2 storage estimates worldwide. This report presents the findings of these workshops and an internationally shared guideline for quantifying CO2 storage resources.,True,puoY4D8AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,17,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22134453,7104803784407710496,/scholar?cites=7104803784407710496,,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/22134453,0,0,0
1182335,Carbon capture and sequestration: Removing the legal and regulatory barriers,2012,M Granger Morgan and Sean T McCoy,,,,,Routledge,The United States produces over seventy percent of all its electricity from fossil fuels and nearly fifty percent from coal alone. Worldwide. forty-one percent of all electricity is generated from coal. making it the single most important fuel source for electricity generation. followed by natural gas. This means that an essential part of any portfolio for emissions reduction will be technology to capture carbon dioxide and permanently sequester it in suitable geologic formations. While many nations have incentivized development of CCS technology. large regulatory and legal barriers exist that have yet to be addressed. This book identifies current law and regulation that applies to geologic sequestration in the US. the regulatory needs to ensure that geologic sequestration is carried out safely and effectively. and barriers that current law and regulation present to timely deployment of CCS. The authors find the three most significant barriers to be: an ill-defined process to access pore space in deep saline formations; a piecemeal. procedural. and static permitting system; and the lack of a clear. responsible plan to address long-term liability associated with sequestered CO2. The book provides legislative options to remove these barriers and address the regulatory needs. and makes recommendations on the best options to encourage safe. effective deployment of CCS. The authors operationalize their recommendations in legislative language. which is of particular use to policymakers faced with the challenge of addressing climate change and energy.,True,puoY4D8AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,17,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=yKy5Y-A1pNkC&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=info:0YUGS3hQ-hIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Z5c4nU_SeJ&sig=-OA-TEIcmjo3KjrF3QAImROXADQ,1367493914445383121,/scholar?cites=1367493914445383121,,,0,0,0
1182336,The economics of carbon dioxide transport by pipeline and storage in saline aquifers and oil reservoirs,2008,Sean T McCoy,,,,,,Large reductions in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions are needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change. One method of achieving such reductions is CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). CCS requires the capture of carbon dioxide (CO 2) at a large industrial facility. such as a power plant. and its transport to a geological storage site where CO 2 is sequestered. if implemented. CCS could allow fossil fuels to be used with little or no CO 2 emissions until alternative energy sources are more widely deployed. Large volumes of CO 2 are most efficiently transported by pipeline and stored either in deep saline aquifers or in oil reservoirs. where CO 2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This thesis describes a suite of models developed to estimate the project-specific cost of CO 2 transport and storage. Engineering-economic models of pipeline CO 2 transport.

Assessments of carbon sequestration resources that have been made for North America using existing methodologies likely underestimate uncertainty and variability in the reservoir parameters.

The proposed stochastic model accounts for the spatial distribution of reservoir properties and is implemented in a case study of the Oriskany Formation of the Appalachian sedimentary basin.

1182347,The production of antibody by invading B cells is required for the clearance of rabies virus from the central nervous system,2009,D Craig Hooper and Timothy W Phares and Marzena J Fabis and Anirban Roy,3,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,10,e535,Public Library of Science,Background The pathogenesis of rabies is associated with the inability to deliver immune effectors across the blood-brain barrier and to clear virulent rabies virus from CNS tissues. However. the mechanisms that facilitate immune effector entry into CNS tissues are induced by infection with attenuated rabies virus.  Methodology/Principal Findings Infection of normal mice with attenuated rabies virus but not immunization with killed virus can promote the clearance of pathogenic rabies virus from the CNS. T cell activity in B cell–deficient mice can control the replication of attenuated virus in the CNS. but viral mRNA persists. Low levels of passively administered rabies virus–neutralizing antibody reach infected cells in the cerebellum of B cell–deficient mice but are not sufficient to mediate virus clearance. Production of rabies virus-specific antibody by B cells invading CNS tissues is required for this process. and a substantial proportion of the B cells that accumulate in the CNS of mice infected with attenuated rabies virus produce virus-specific antibodies.  Conclusions/Significance The mechanisms required for immune effectors to enter rabies virus-infected tissues are induced by infection with attenuated rabies virus but not by infection with pathogenic rabies viruses or immunization with killed virus. T cell activities can inhibit rabies virus replication. but the production of rabies virus–specific antibodies by infiltrating B cells. as opposed to the leakage of circulating antibody across the BBB. is critical to elimination of the virus. These findings suggest that a pathogenic rabies virus infection may be treatable after the virus has reached the CNS tissues …,True,-Y0UEaMAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,110,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000535,16328654243547956426,/scholar?cites=16328654243547956426,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000535,0,0,0

However. once the nonspecific clinical symptoms of rabies appear conventional postexposure treatment is unsuccessful. Over the last decade. rabies viruses associated with the silver-haired bat (SHBRV) have emerged as the leading cause of human deaths from rabies in the United States and Canada as a consequence of the fact that exposure to these viruses is often unnoticed.

BPA’s increased usage correlates with rising BPA levels in people and a corresponding increase in the incidence of asthma. Due to limited studies. the contribution of maternal BPA exposure to allergic asthma pathogenesis is unclear. Using two established mouse models of allergic asthma. we examined whether developmental exposure to BPA alters hallmarks of allergic lung inflammation in adult offspring. Pregnant C57BL/6 dams were gavaged with 0. 0.5. 5. 50. or 500 μg BPA/kg/day from gestational day 6 until postnatal day 21.

Mice with an SJL background are less susceptible to lethal infection with rabies viruses. In addition. these animals are known to have reduced hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and an elevated capacity to mediate CNS inflammatory responses. We show here that approximately one-half of PLSJL mice survive an SHBRV infection that is invariably lethal for 129/SvEv mice. This difference is associated with the elevated capacity of PLSJL mice to mediate BBB permeability changes in response to the infection.

There is a growing public concern that BPA exposure may pose a significant threat to human health. Moreover. due to the widespread and constant nature of BPA exposure. not only adults but fetuses and neonates are also exposed to BPA. There is mounting evidence that developmental exposures to chemicals from our environment. including BPA. contribute to diseases late in life; yet. studies of how early life exposures specifically alter the immune system are limited. Herein we report an examination of how maternal exposure to a low. environmentally relevant dose of BPA affects the immune response to infection with influenza A virus. We exposed female mice during pregnancy and through lactation to the oral reference dose for BPA listed by the US Environmental Protection Agency. and comprehensively examined immune parameters directly linked to disease outcomes in adult offspring following infection with influenza A virus. We found that developmental exposure to BPA did not compromise disease-specific adaptive immunity against virus infection. or reduce the host’s ability to clear the virus from the infected lung. However. maternal exposure to BPA transiently reduced the extent of infection-associated pulmonary inflammation and anti-viral gene expression in lung tissue. From these observations. we conclude that maternal exposure to BPA slightly modulates innate immunity in adult offspring. but does not impair the anti-viral adaptive immune response. which is critical for virus …,True,-Y0UEaMAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC,61,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038448,7009149581522512587,/scholar?cites=7009149581522512587,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038448,0,0,0

The size distribution and mass concentration of the aerosol in the range of 15-700 nm was measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). Simultaneously. black carbon (BC) measurement was made using an aethalometer. The measurements were recorded for four different seasons. viz. monsoon. post-monsoon. winter and pre-monsoon. The diurnal variation of BC and submicron aerosol mass followed very similar trends in all the seasons. This is evident by the fact that BC had strong positive correlation with the submicron aerosol mass (0.83 ≤ R ≤ 0.96. where R is the Pearson’s correlation coefficient). Both peaked once in the morning [07:00-09:00 local time (LT)]. and once in the night (20:00-22:00 LT). The peak concentrations varied from season to season. which could be attributed to seasonal variation in anthropogenic activity. traffic movement and atmospheric boundary layer conditions. The background aerosol number concentration in winter (~105 #/cm3) was an order of magnitude higher than that observed in other seasons (~104 #/cm3); and on a foggy day in the winter. it was twice as high as that seen on a clear winter day. The fraction (FBC) of the BC mass concentration in the submicron aerosol was observed to be highest in monsoon (0.18 ± 0.13). followed by pre-monsoon (0.08 ± 0.02) and post-monsoon (0.05 ± 0.01). with the lowest in winter (0.03 ± 0.01).,True,-Y0UEaMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,45,https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-09-03-oa-0017,17459517973993436978,/scholar?cites=17459517973993436978,,https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-09-03-oa-0017.pdf,0,0,0

However. the meteorological impact of observation nudging on chemistry has not been well characterized. This study involved two simulations to analyze the impact of observation nudging on simulated meteorology and ozone concentrations during the 2013 Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) Texas campaign period. using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models.

The proposed SF hydrogels presented a viscoelastic nature of injectable hydrogels and spontaneous conformational changes from random coil to β-sheet conformation under physiological conditions. A human neuronal glioblastoma (U251) cell line was used for screening cell encapsulation and in vitro evaluation within the SF hydrogels. The transparent random coil SF hydrogels promoted cell viability and proliferation up to 10 days of culturing. while the crystalline SF hydrogels converted into β-sheet structure induced the formation of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. Therefore. this work provides a powerful tool for the investigation of the microenvironment on the programed tumor cells death. by using rapidly responsive SF hydrogels as 3D in vitro tumor models.,True,-Y0UEaMAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC,28,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194441,8640396118625134068,/scholar?cites=8640396118625134068,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194441,0,0,0

Genebank accessions comprising three species of wheat–Triticum aestivum. T. durum and T. dicoccum were screened sequentially at multiple disease hotspots. during the 2011–14 crop seasons. carrying only resistant accessions to the next step of evaluation. Wheat accessions which were found to be resistant in the field were then assayed for seedling resistance and profiled using molecular markers. In the primary evaluation. 19.460 accessions were screened at Wellington (Tamil Nadu). a hotspot for wheat rusts. We identified 4925 accessions to be resistant and these were further evaluated at Gurdaspur (Punjab). a hotspot for stripe rust and at Cooch Behar (West Bengal). a hotspot for spot blotch. The second round evaluation identified 498 accessions potentially resistant to multiple rusts and 868 accessions potentially resistant to spot blotch. Evaluation of rust resistant accessions for seedling resistance against seven virulent pathotypes of three rusts under artificial epiphytotic conditions identified 137 accessions potentially resistant to multiple rusts.

These models currently assume that molecular markers are chemically stable; however. recent laboratory experiments suggest they may be significantly oxidized on atmospherically relevant time scales. To investigate the effects of photo-oxidation. we extended a 3-D chemical transport model (PMCAMx) to simulate norhopane concentrations over the eastern United States during July 2001. Norhopane is an important molecular marker for motor vehicle exhaust. We examined eight different simulation scenarios. using different combinations of reaction rates and source profiles.

This enables us to address the  and other tensions between low z observations and high z Planck measurement from CMB. From the reconstructed H(z). we compute the energy density for the “dark energy” sector of the Universe as a function of redshift without assuming a specific model for dark energy. We find that the dark energy density has a minimum for certain redshift range and that the value of dark energy at this minimum  is negative.

Emerging evidence suggests that their likelihood of recovery depends mainly on the damage to language centers. Thus previous research for predicting language recovery post-stroke has focused on identifying damaged regions of the brain. In this paper. we introduce a novel method where we only make use of stitched 2-dimensional cross-sections of raw MRI scans in a deep convolutional neural network setup to predict language recovery post-stroke. Our results show: a) the proposed model that only uses MRI scans has comparable performance to models that are dependent on lesion specific information; b) the features learned by our model are complementary to the lesion specific information and the combination of both appear to outperform previously reported results in similar settings.

1182381,Public health impacts of secondary particulate formation from aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline,2013,Katherine von Stackelberg and Jonathan Buonocore and Prakash V Bhave and Joel A Schwartz,12,Environmental Health,1,1-13,BioMed Central,Aromatic hydrocarbons emitted from gasoline-powered vehicles contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). which increases the atmospheric mass concentration of fine particles (PM2.5). Here we estimate the public health burden associated with exposures to the subset of PM2.5 that originates from vehicle emissions of aromatics under business as usual conditions. The PM2.5 contribution from gasoline aromatics is estimated using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system and the results are compared to ambient measurements from the literature. Marginal PM2.5 annualized concentration changes are used to calculate premature mortalities using concentration-response functions. with a value of mortality reduction approach used to monetize the social cost of mortality impacts. Morbidity impacts are qualitatively discussed. Modeled aromatic SOA concentrations from CMAQ fall short of ambient measurements by approximately a factor of two nationwide. with strong regional differences. After accounting for this model bias. the estimated public health impacts from exposure to PM2.5 originating from aromatic hydrocarbons in gasoline lead to a central estimate of approximately 3800 predicted premature mortalities nationwide. with estimates ranging from 1800 to over 4700 depending on the specific concentration-response function used. These impacts are associated with total social costs of $28.2B. and range from $13.6B to $34.9B in 2006$.

Estimates are developed utilizing the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) by ICF International. Emissions are analyzed at a national and State level and scenarios compared include no-policy. at-the-source policy. and a beyond-the-source policy similar to the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The authors estimate that compared to a no-policy scenario. a 4% heat rate improvement for coal-fired power plants would result in a 2.6% decrease in national CO₂ emissions while CO₂ emissions in eight states could potentially increase up to three million additional tons per year in those states.

However. the utility of the increasing spatial resolution of disease mapping and environmental exposures is limited by the lack of receptor population data at similar sub-census block spatial scales. Here we apply an innovative method (Population Allocation by Occupied Domicile Estimation – ABODE) to disaggregate U.S. Census populations by allocating an average person per household to geospatially-identified residential housing units (RHU). We considered two possible sources of RHU location data: address point locations and building footprint centroids. We compared the performance of ABODE with the common proportional population allocation (PPA) method for estimating the nighttime residential populations within 200 m radii and setback areas (100 – 300 ft) around active underground natural gas storage (UGS) wells (n = 9834) in six U.S. states. Address location data generally outperformed building footprint data in predicting total counts of census residential housing units. with correlations ranging from 0.67 to 0.81 at the census block level. Using residentially-sited addresses only. ABODE estimated upwards of 20.000 physical households with between 48.126 and 53.250 people living within 200 m of active UGS wells – likely encompassing the size of a proposed UGS Wellhead Safety Zone. Across the 9834 active wells assessed.

The analysis includes the collection of consistent financial information. the creation of forecasted base-case 1989 revenue-and-expenditure scenarios. and their juxtaposition for the nine jurisdictions against consolidation scenarios that might provide cost savings while maintaining critical service levels.

Because each respondent faces an identical coupon budget constraint. it may be expected that observed expenditure and tax recommendations represent individual maximum utility.

1182441,Children as income-producing assets: the case of teen illegitimacy and government transfers,1998,George RG Clarke and Robert P Strauss,,Southern Economic Journal,,827-856,Southern Economic Association,This paper develops a classical model of the teen fertility decision in the presence of public income transfers. The theoretical model predicts that welfare payments will encourage fertility. holding constant other economic opportunities. and that better economic opportunities will discourage fertility. Considering the possible simultaneity of illegitimacy rates and benefit levels. due to the collective choice process. we confirm the theoretical model's predictions with state-level data from 1980 through 1990. We find that including fixed effects in the regression to control for unobserved differences between states does not sufficiently control for endogeneity. After controlling for endogeneity. real welfare benefits are strongly and robustly related to teen illegitimacy. The point estimates of the elasticity with respect to changes in the illegitimacy rate are around +1.3 for white teens and +2.1 for black teens.

The model allows us to determine the optimal number of districts for a fixed population size in a given geographic area. and to arrive at the extent of cost savings possible in the absence of additional considerations.

Figure ES-1 provides an estimate of total US data center electricity use (servers. storage. network equipment. and infrastructure) from 2000-2020. In 2014. data centers in the US consumed an estimated 70 billion kWh. representing about 1.8% of total US electricity consumption. Current study results show data center electricity consumption increased by about 4% from 2010-2014. a large shift from the 24% percent increase estimated from 2005-2010 and the nearly 90% increase estimated from 2000-2005. Energy use is expected to continue slightly increasing in the near future. increasing 4% from 2014-2020. the same rate as the past five years. Based on current trend estimates.

1182460,Powering the Information Age: Metrics. Social Cost Optimization Strategies. and Indirect Effects Related to Data Center Energy Use,2016,Nathaniel Charles Horner,,,,,,This dissertation contains three studies examining aspects of energy use by data centers and other information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure necessary to support the electronic services that now form such a pervasive aspect of daily life. The energy consumption of ICT in general and data centers in particular has been of growing interest to both industry and the public. with continued calls for increased efficiency and greater focus on environmental impacts. The first study examines the metrics used to assess data center energy performance and finds that power usage effectiveness (PUE). the de facto industry standard. only accounts for one of four critical aspects of data center energy performance. PUE measures the overhead of the facility infrastructure but does not consider the efficiency of the IT equipment. its utilization. or the emissions profile of the power source. As a result. PUE corresponds poorly with energy and carbon efficiency. as demonstrated using a small set of empirical data center energy use measurements.

1182461,Dynamic data center load response to variability in private and public electricity costs,2016,Nathaniel Horner and Inês Azevedo and Doug Sicker and Yuvraj Agarwal,,,,80-85,IEEE,This paper assesses the potential cost-saving incentives for content distribution networks to shift traffic load among geographically distributed data centers in response to hourly variation in electricity prices. Such incentives are likely aligned with benefits to utilities and grid operators. which might take the form of peak-shaving or ancillary services. However. private cost savings are not strictly aligned with public benefits related to the avoidance of health and environmental damages from power plant emissions. so we compare private cost minimization with a strategy that minimizes these externalities. We find that feasible strategies exist to simultaneously realize public and private benefits and that load shifting can result in substantial cost savings and avoided damages in some circumstances. Concerns over increased latency and bandwidth costs can be mitigated with modifications to the model.

We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to assemble a silver atom chain on a nickel-aluminum alloy surface. Photon emission was induced with electrons from the tip of the STM. The emission was spatially resolved with subnanometer resolution by changing the tip position along the chain. The number and positions of the emission maxima in the photon images match those of the nodes in the differential conductance images of particle-in-a-box states. This surprising correlation between the emission maxima and nodes in the density of states is a manifestation of Fermi’s golden rule in real space for radiative transitions and provides an understanding of the mechanism of STM-induced light emission.,True,mLJqRHwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,86,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5943/981.abstract,17950448875383981970,/scholar?cites=17950448875383981970,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Bobisch/publication/26756805_Visualization_of_Fermi's_Golden_Rule_Through_Imaging_of_Light_Emission_from_Atomic_Silver_Chains/links/0046351d28f94ddc44000000.pdf,0,0,0

The inherent strain of 2.3% between the Bi(1 1 1) and Si(0 0 1) lattices is relieved by the formation of a grating like one-dimensional misfit dislocation array at the heterointerface. The lattice distortions around each dislocation give rise to a pronounced height depression Δh = 0.12 nm of the surface. which results in a spot splitting in low-energy electron diffraction and a height contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Using STM surface profiles across these depressions. the Burgers vector of the underlying isolated non-interacting dislocations is estimated to be 0.377 nm.

Combined scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio electronic structure calculations of Cu-phthalocyanines adsorbed on Ag (100) reveal the formation of chiral molecular orbitals in structurally undistorted molecules. This effect shows that chirality can be manifest exclusively at the electronic level due to asymmetric charge transfer between molecules and substrate. Single molecule chirality correlates with attractive van der Waals interactions. leading to the propagation of chirality at the supramolecular level.

The film quality is characterized by in situ spot profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. and ex situ atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The complete process is accomplished in three steps. Firstly. a template of a strained 6 nm Bi(111) film is grown at 150 K. Secondly. during annealing to 450 K the strain is relieved by the formation of an ordered array of misfit dislocations at the interface. Finally. additional Bi is deposited at 450 K up to the desired thicknesses of the Bi film.

Beyond 0.5 BL resistance changes periodically showing an antiphase correlation with roughness-induced LEED (00)-spot intensity oscillations. indicating the scattering of electrons at island edges.[DOI: 10.1380/ejssnt. 2010.27],True,jalc5voAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,2,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ejssnt/8/0/8_0_27/_article/-char/ja/,2736563788677307155,/scholar?cites=2736563788677307155,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ejssnt/8/0/8_0_27/_pdf,0,0,0

A particularly promising aspect seems to be the ability of perovskites to provide bistable switching of the conductance between non-metallic and metallic behaviour by the application of an appropriate electric field. Here we demonstrate that the switching behaviour is an intrinsic feature of naturally occurring dislocations in single crystals of a prototypical ternary oxide. SrTiO 3. The phenomenon is shown to originate from local modulations of the oxygen content and to be related to the self-doping capability of the early transition metal oxides.

Externally induced large spin–orbit coupling opens the possibility of using graphene in active elements of spintronic devices such as the Das-Datta spin field-effect transistor.

The surface states in the L-projected bulk band gap show a Rashba-type spin-orbit splitting which is three times larger than what has been observed on a clean Bi (111) surface. This large enhancement can be explained by the strong distortion of the surface-state wave function which is caused by the substantial outward buckling of the Bi atom. Also. in a similar surface alloy. Pb∕ Ag (111). a strong Rashba-type splitting was found by our calculations. The comparison to the experimental data is more difficult due to the presence of a second. close-by surface state.

The localized 4f states of Gd. which represent a challenge for first-principles theory. are treated in four different models. employing consistently the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method. Our results support previous findings that within the local density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradient approximation (GGA) the itinerancy of the 4f states is overestimated. In particular. the large density of states at the Fermi energy due to the minority 4f electrons is unphysical. and our results show that this is the origin of the incorrect prediction of the antiferromagnetic ground state for hcp Gd by many LDA and GGA calculations.

But besides the real time characterization of the morphology it can provide local spectroscopic information on a sub-μm scale. To this end we have combined a conventional PEEM setup with a He-discharge lamp delivering high energy photons for electron excitation. The setup thus allows probing the electronic structure of individual crystallites of α-sexithiophene on Ag(1 1 0).

The strong intermolecular connection via hydrogen bonds is expected to promote good structural order.

Three-dimensional computer simulations of thermo-magnetic convection have been conducted under an azimuthal magnetic field. when the inner cylinder is kept at a higher temperature than the peripheral one. Simulations have been carried out both in the absence and in the presence of gravity. In the absence of gravity. the problem will be analogous to the classical Rayleigh-Bernard instability in a radial gravitation field. The objective of this study is to investigate the combined effects of magnetic and buoyancy driven convection. In the absence of gravity the simulations revealed the expected flow pattern consisting of counter rotating convection cells with diameter equal to the thickness of the fluid layer. When the gravity is introduced. the case may become unsteady consisting of cells drifting upward.

All derivatives have two 4-cyanophenyl substituents in diagonally opposed meso-positions of the porphyrin core. but differ in the nature of the other two meso-alkoxyphenyl substituents. At coverages below 0.8 monolayers. two derivatives form molecular chains. which evolve into nanoporous networks at higher coverages. The third derivative self-assembles directly into a nanoporous network without showing a one-dimensional phase. The pore-to-pore distances for the three networks depend on the size and shape of the alkoxy substituents. All observed effects are explained by 1) different steric demands of the alkoxy residues. 2) apolar (mainly dispersion) interactions between the alkoxy chains. 3) polar bonding involving both cyanophenyl and alkoxyphenyl substituents. and 4) the entropy/enthalpy balance of the network formation.,True,OOc5PA8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,83,https://www.nanolab.unibas.ch/publications/2008/WintjesCEJ.pdf,15221890952206695172,/scholar?cites=15221890952206695172,,https://www.nanolab.unibas.ch/publications/2008/WintjesCEJ.pdf,0,0,0

The Cu adatoms coordinated in the porous surface network of 1.3.8.10-tetraazaperopyrene (TAPP) molecules on a Cu(111) surface give rise to a characteristic electronic resonance in STM experiments. Using density functional theory calculations. we provide strong evidence that this resonance is a fingerprint of the interaction between the molecules and the Cu adatoms. We also show that the bonding of the Cu adatoms to the organic exodentate ligands is characterised by both the mixing of the nitrogen lone-pair orbitals of TAPP with states on the Cu adatoms and the partial filling of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the TAPP molecule.

Whenever they periodically aggregate into arrays and cooperative interactions arise. novel quantum properties suitable for technological applications show up. Control over the potential barriers existing between neighboring quantum dots is therefore essential to alter their mutual crosstalk. Here we show that precise engineering of the barrier width can be experimentally achieved on surfaces by a single atom substitution in a haloaromatic compound. which in turn tunes the confinement properties through the degree of quantum dot intercoupling. We achieved this by generating self-assembled molecular nanoporous networks that confine the two-dimensional electron gas present at the surface.

Here. we elucidate these aspects by focusing on the adsorption of ferrocene on Cu(111) and Cu(100). Combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. we demonstrate that the two-dimensional molecular arrangement consists of vertical- and horizontal-lying molecules. The noncovalent T-shaped interactions between Cp rings of vertical and horizontal molecules are essential for the stability of the physisorbed molecular layer.

The calculations are performed with density functional theory (DFT). Infinite wires are found to be insulating and Peierls distorted. however finite wires develop localized electronic states that can be of great use for atomic scale devices. The ground state solution of finite wires does not correspond to a geometrical distortion but rather to an antiferromagnetic ordering. For the stability of wires. the presence of abundant H atoms in nearby Si atoms can be a problem. We have evaluated the energy barriers for intradimer and intrarow diffusion. finding all of them about 1 eV or larger. even in the case where a H impurity is already sitting on the wire.

However. most of the studies involving spin transport have disregarded fundamental aspects such as the magnetic anisotropy of the molecule and the excitation of spin-flip processes during electron transport.

The ground state of CrSi 12 is a Cr centered hexagonal biprism of Si atoms in which the Cr spin moment is completely quenched. As two CrSi 12 motifs are brought together. they form different composite units depending on initial direction of approach and. in most cases. the composite cluster is found to have a net spin moment. Cluster assemblies obtained by depositing CrSi 12 motifs on a Si (111) surface exhibit similar finite spin moments for several initial directions of approach.

The well-known simple interconnect formed by removing H-atoms from one of the Si atoms per dimer of a dimer row along the Si(100) surface is poorly conducting. This is because one-dimensional-like instabilities open electronic gaps. Here. we explore two strategies to reduce the instabilities: spacing the dangling bonds with H atoms and changing the geometry by increasing the lateral size of the wires. The resulting wires are evaluated using density functional theory. Surprisingly. zigzag dangling-bond wires attain atomically confined conduction properties comparable with the conduction of free-standing metallic monatomic wires.

It is a real obstacle on the path from existing laboratory-scale prototypes of magnetic refrigerators towards commercialization of this potentially disruptive cooling technology. Indeed. the reversibility of the magnetocaloric effect. being essential for magnetic heat pumps. strongly depends on the width of the thermal hysteresis and. therefore. it is necessary to understand the mechanisms causing hysteresis and to find solutions to minimize losses associated with thermal hysteresis in order to maximize the efficiency of magnetic cooling devices.

The chemistry is tabulated from premixed flamelets with three independent parameters: the equivalence ratio of the mixture. the progress of reaction. and the specific enthalpy. to account for heat losses at walls. Mean quantities are estimated from presumed PDFs. This approach is used to numerically predict a turbulent premixed flame diluted by hot burnt products at an equivalence ratio that differs from the main stream of reactants.

Mild flameless combustion regime is conserved whatever the air temperature varying from 838 K to ambient value. No visible flame is observed. Main aerodynamic features of the flow at the exit of the burner are similar with and without air preheating. Large momentum of methane and air turbulent jets favours the entrainment of recirculating flue gas and then the progressive dilution of reactant by flue gas. Main difference comes from the structures of the reaction zone which are more and more lifted and NOx emissions which decrease progressively with air temperature. down to a very low value (4 ppm@ 3% O2).,True,jpcE-CIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,23,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.559.693&rep=rep1&type=pdf,2649569311212660616,/scholar?cites=2649569311212660616,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.559.693&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Natural gas is today one of the most important primary energy sources in Europe. with utilization ranging from power generation and industry to appliances in the residential and commercial sector as well as mobility. As natural gas is a fossil fuel. gas utilization is thus responsible for significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). a greenhouse gas.

Although natural gas also serves as a feedstock for a wide variety of products in the chemical industry (as well as in some metallurgical applications). the vast majority of the natural gas being distributed today is burned to provide heat. electricity or propulsion across many different sectors. from residential appliances to industrial furnaces. power plants or in natural gas vehicles. While combustion is used in different ways in these sectors. tailored to the specific application. the basic principles are the same.The combustion of any hydrocarbon fuel will release carbon dioxide (CO2). which has been identified as a greenhouse gas. While natural gas will form far less CO2 per energy unit than other fuels such as coal or oil. measures must be taken to reduce the overall impact of gas combustion on the climate. Hydrogen admixture into the natural gas grids is being discussed as one potential way to reduce CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion. across all sectors. Hydrogen admixture into the gas grids can also serve to store surplus renewable energy from wind turbines or PV panels in times of low power demand. Energy storage is one of the major challenges of the energy transition to renewable energies. While storing electricity is strongly limited in terms of storage time and scale. the long-term storage of energy in chemical form. ie as a fuel. is technically feasible on the large scale.

The fabrication of these materials is still very challenging. but their performance inspires research toward nanofabricated membranes.

Different electrostatic potentials of various materials have a significant influence on the measured force/current and therefore a direct influence on the tip–sample distance. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is based on a dynamic compensation of the electrostatic force while performing non-contact atomic force microscopy measurements.

Usage of a high resonance frequency and a smaller amplitude enables us to perform highly sensitive measurements of the atomic-scale adhesion and the tip-instability-related energy dissipation.

When human space exploration started at around 1961. microbial life has been brought along with astronauts across terrestrial borders and to our space stations Mir (Russian Space Station) and ISS (International Space Station). Filamentous fungi are one of the most abundant pathogens on earth. They emit mycotoxins to our environment. causing allergies and various disease patterns. especially in immunosuppressed humans. which lead to up to over 300 Million fungal infections worldwide. The well-known “black mold”. is a filamentous fungus called Aspergillus niger and one of the main contaminants on the ISS. It is able to spread its spores easily under microgravity and can survive under extreme and seemingly sterile conditions. Since one of the main sources of fungal infections is due to the uptake of spores via contaminated food or inhalation. a closed built environment like a space station is a major risk factor for our astronauts. Due to that. basic research on the resistance of fungal spores towards extreme environments needs to be addressed more. Knowledge about how to effectively constrain and prevent fungal growth in closed environments could not only be applied to human spaceflight but lead to improvements of clean rooms and hospital building materials.

Durch Änderungen dieser Parameter kann eine stabile Gemeinschaft. wie die gesunde. menschliche Haut Flora. gestört werden. Für die terrestrische Simulation physiologischer Effekte von Mikrogravitation auf den menschlichen Körper werden Bettruhe-Studien in Kopftieflage durchgeführt. Hier konnte bisher ähnlich wie bei Astronauten auf der ISS eine Flüssigkeitsverschiebung aus den Extremitäten in den Oberkörper beobachtet werden. sodass dabei aufgedunsene Gesichter eine der Folgen ist.,True,QIcaVOEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://elib.dlr.de/130293/,,,,,0,0,0
1182772,Addressing the fungal contamination–testing antifungal materials and radiation-driven decontamination methods,2019,Stella M Koch and Marta Cortesao and Christine E Hellweg and Daniel Müller and Marcel Fiebrandt and Ralf Moeller,,,,,,Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus and Penicillium sp. (also known as “mold”) represent some of the predominant contaminations found onboard the Mir (Russian Space Station) and the International Space Station (ISS). Aspergillus sp. have been found in NASA clean rooms belonging to Johnson Space Center Curation Laboratory as well as in spacecraft assembly facilities. As spores. they can spread and survive under extreme and seemingly sterile conditions.1 With regard to human health. these filamentous fungi are capable to release a wide range of organic volatile compounds and mycotoxins. They are one of the most abundant human associated opportunistic pathogens. causing allergies and various disease patterns to humans with compromised immune system. Their presence in manned spaceflight missions can cause complex risks due to their fast growth. spore forming and dispersal. high tolerance to disinfectants and wide metabolic activity. Aspergillus sp. are also known material degraders and a cause for food spoilage. The resistance of fungal spores towards the spaceflight-relevant conditions needs to be explored and understood. It is and will be crucial to monitor and control fungal dispersal and growth in spaceflight indoor settings and material contamination.     In our research. we aim to find efficient and innovative decontamination methods to either prevent fungal spore distribution. growth or spore inactivation.  In preliminary experiments we tested the resistance of fungal spores to low pressure plasma sterilization. UV-C and copper-containing metal surfaces. Spores of Aspergillus niger with a black pigmentation …,True,QIcaVOEAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,0,https://elib.dlr.de/129880/,,,,,0,0,0
1182773,Promoting Reaction Channels in Dissociative Electron Attachment to Improve the Cross-Linking Efficiency of SAMs for the Production of Carbon Nano-Membranes,2019,M Cipriani and A Terfort and S Koch and A Gölzhäuser and Oddur Ingólfsson,,POSMOL 2019,,131,,In recent years. the Gölzhäuser group (University of Bielefeld) has developed a universal scheme for the fabrication of carbon nano-membranes (CNMs) by electron induced crosslinking of aromatic Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAMs)[1]. a process where the cross-linking is mainly attributed to electron induced CH bond rupture in the monomers through dissociative ionization [2].Considering the different nature of low energy electron induced processes [3] and in particular the bond rupture selectivity and efficacy of dissociative electron attachment (DEA). we hypothesize it is possible to control the cross-linking and functionalization of CNMs. First experiments in this direction were recently conducted on the halogenated biphenyls: 2-iodobiphenyl. 2-bromo-biphenyl and 2-chloro-biphenyl. showing significantly enhanced crosslinking efficiency for 2-iodo-biphenyl-an effect that was attributed to the comparably high …,True,QIcaVOEAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,0,http://www.posmol2019.ipb.ac.rs/_files/Book_POSMOL2019_Online.pdf#page=150,,,,,0,0,0
