1172413,A method to evaluate the Sachs formula,1997,Siqun Huang and Jonathan E Kenny,65,International journal of quantum chemistry,1,19-36,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,A rule‐based method for evaluating the Sachs formula is introduced. For simple molecules. such as linear chains and monocycles. the Sachs formula can be evaluated by directly using the rules. For complex molecular systems. the Sachs formula can be evaluated by first breaking up the molecule into constituent pieces of sufficient simplicity so that data for them are available in the data base and then constructing the molecule from the known data by adding all pieces together. one at a time. via a series of binary rules. The method changes the way of evaluating the Sachs formula from a trial‐and‐error‐type numerical search to a purely algebraic manipulation and thus tremendously reduces the computing times. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons.

The structure of SmtB was solved using multiple isomorphous replacement techniques and refined at 2.2 Å resolution by simulated annealing to an R-factor of 0.218. SmtB displays the classical helix-turn-helix motif found in many DNA-binding proteins. It has a α + β topology. and the arrangement of the three core helices and the beta hairpin is similar to the HNF-3/fork head. CAP and diphtheria toxin repressor proteins. Although there is no zinc in the crystal structure. analysis of a mercuric acetate derivative suggests a total of four Zn2+ binding sites in the dimer. Two of these putative sites are at the opposite ends of the dimer. while the other two are at the dimer interface and are formed by residues contributed from each monomer.

Replacement of fluorocitrate with arsenite increased pyruvate formation stoichiometrically with the previous increase in citrate formation. No enhancement of pyruvate or citrate accumulation was seen when malate was omitted or when KIC was replaced with equimolar leucine. KIC (leucine) did not give rise to acetyl CoA. nor was pyruvate formed by way of oxaloacetate and phosphoenolpyruvate.

The key to our development is the construction of a normal form for describing the dynamics in the neighbourhood of a specific type of saddle point that governs the evolution from reactants to products in high dimensional systems. In the classical case this is the standard Poincaré–Birkhoff normal form. In the quantum case we develop a normal form based on the Weyl calculus and an explicit algorithm for computing this quantum normal form. The classical normal form allows us to discover and compute the phase space structures that govern classical reaction dynamics. From this knowledge we are able to provide a direct construction of an energy dependent dividing surface in phase space having the properties that trajectories do not locally're-cross' the surface and the …,True,WDCcG40AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,169,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0951-7715/21/1/R01/meta,8571753703249085102,/scholar?cites=8571753703249085102,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.0511,0,0,0

In this work we give a short introduction to the formulation of the quantum ergodicity theorem for general observables in terms of pseudodifferential operators and show that it is equivalent to the semiclassical eigenfunction hypothesis for the Wigner function in the case of ergodic systems.

1172516,On the rate of quantum ergodicity for quantised maps,2008,Roman Schubert,9,Annales Henri Poincaré,8,1455-1477,SP Birkhäuser Verlag Basel,We study the distribution of expectation values and transition amplitudes for quantised maps on the torus. If the classical map is ergodic then the variance of the distribution of expectation values will tend to zero in the semiclassical limit by the quantum ergodicity theorem. Similarly the variance of transition amplitude goes to zero if the map is weak mixing. In this paper we derive estimates on the rate by which these variances tend to zero. For a class of hyperbolic maps we derive a rate which is logarithmic in the semiclassical parameter. and then show that this bound is sharp for cat maps. For a parabolic map we get an algebraic rate which again is sharp.,True,WDCcG40AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00023-008-0395-3,7822055052329621473,/scholar?cites=7822055052329621473,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00023-008-0395-3.pdf,0,0,0

1172519,Entropy of eigenfunctions on quantum graphs,2014,Lionel Kameni and Roman Schubert,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.5871,,,,We consider families of finite quantum graphs of increasing size and we are interested in how eigenfunctions are distributed over the graph. As a measure for the distribution of an eigenfunction on a graph we introduce the entropy. it has the property that a large value of the entropy of an eigenfunction implies that it cannot be localised on a small set on the graph. We then derive lower bounds for the entropy of eigenfunctions which depend on the topology of the graph and the boundary conditions at the vertices. The optimal bounds are obtained for expanders with large girth. the bounds are similar to the ones obtained by Anantharaman this http URL. for eigenfunctions on manifolds of negative curvature. and are based on the entropic uncertainty principle. For comparison we compute as well the average behaviour of entropies on Neumann star graphs. where the entropies are much smaller. Finally we compare our lower bounds with numerical results for regular graphs and star graphs with different boundary conditions.,True,WDCcG40AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,7,https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5871,13162865257616626321,/scholar?cites=13162865257616626321,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.5871,0,0,0

It is shown that for heavy-atom systems such as the nitrogen-exchange reaction. the quantum normal form approach gives excellent results and has major computational benefits over full reactive scattering approaches. For light atom systems such as the hydrogen-exchange reaction however. the quantum normal approach is shown to give only poor results. This failure is attributed to the importance of tunneling trajectories in light atom reactions that are not captured by the quantum normal form as indicated by the only very slow convergence of the quantum normal form for such systems.,True,WDCcG40AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,7,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3245402,14886839601822337724,/scholar?cites=14886839601822337724,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0719,0,0,0

Most previous reports are on reducible oxide supports. Here we show that isolated palladium atoms can be catalytically active on industrially relevant γ-alumina supports. The addition of lanthanum oxide to the alumina. long known for its ability to improve alumina stability. is found to also help in the stabilization of isolated palladium atoms. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm the presence of intermingled palladium and lanthanum on the γ-alumina surface.

Ag. Au. Pt. Rh. Pd. Fe. Co. and Ir) doped hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (h-BNNSs) have been systematically investigated. The strong interaction between the metal atoms and defect sites in h-BNNS. such as the boron vacancy and nitrogen edge. suggests that metal doped h-BN nanosheets (M-BNNSs) should be stable under high temperatures. The catalytic activity of Co doped h-BNNS is also investigated by using CO oxidation as a probe. and the calculated low barrier suggests that the Co-BNNS is a viable catalyst for CO oxidation.

The conformation of unstable (E)‐nitrones. which readily isomerize to the more stable (Z)‐nitrones. is deduced from 1H NMR data. The E ⇌ Z isomerization was found to be a bimolecular process.

Various SM extracts concentrations such as 0.05. 0.1. 0.2. 0.3. 0.4. and 0.5 g/l were added and corrosion rate (CR) of mild steel and inhibition efficiency (IE) were determined at various temperatures from 295 to 333 K. The appreciable decrease in CR with increase in SM extract concentration was observed at each temperature. However. the typically accelerated CR at each SM extract with the rise in temperature corresponded to the increased kinetic activities at the metal/electrolyte interface. By the addition of 0.5 g/l SM extract. ∼5 times lower CR of mild steel at high temperature (333 K) than in blank acidic solution confirmed its strong inhibitive efficacy.

To select the best soybean cultivar for making functional CKJ. a comparison was made between the biological activities of four soybean cultivars in their unfermented soybean (UFS) and CKJ states. Changes in 1. 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity. 2. 2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)(ABTS) assays. superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity. total phenolic compounds. total amino acids. and isoflavones were investigated. The levels of DPPH. ABTS. SOD-like activity. and total phenolic compounds increased in CKJ among all cultivars. The isoflavone aglycone and total amino acids showed the highest amount in CKJ prepared from soybean cultivar Aga 3. These results suggest that the improved antioxidant activity of CKJ in all cultivars might occur because of the higher levels of aglycones and total phenolic compounds achieved during fermentation. Moreover. CKJ prepared from soybean cultivar Aga 3 showed higher antioxidant activity than the other cultivars and so can be considered for the commercial production of functional foods in the future.

Study performed by gravimetric and Potentiodynamic polarization techniques. Various concentrations of CP extracts ranging from 0.05. 0.1. 0.2. 0.3. 0.4. and 0.5 (v/v) were used and corrosion rate (CR) on mild steel and inhibition efficiency (IE) were investigated at three temperatures (298K. 308K. and 323K). Corrosion rate increase with the increase in temperature. As inhibitor concentration increases. corrosion rate decreases and IE decreases at elevated temperature. The substantial reduction in CR with the increase in the concentration of CP extract was noted at studied temperatures. However. the increase in the CR at each CP extract along with the increase in the temperature tallied to the increase in kinetic activities at the electrolyte and metal interface. Results show that with the increase of 0.5 g/l CP extract. about 3 times lower CR of mild steel at studied temperatures than in pure 1M HCl solution affirm its robust inhibitive efficiency. Comparatively large change in the anodic Tafel slope and gradual decline in CR with an increase in the CP extract concentration confirmed the restricted dissolution of mild steel. Surface examination suggest that a layer of inhibitor material adsorbed on the surface of mild steel at low temperature is responsible for high IE and this phenomenon is characterized as chemisorption.

Pristine ZAVA hydrogel shows blue luminescence. but the emission can be tuned upon encapsulation of the CdS quantum dots. Time-dependent tunable emission (white to yellow to orange) of the CdS incubated gel (CdS@ZAVA gel) can be attributed to sluggish growth of the quantum dots inside the gel matrix. Once CdS quantum dots are entrapped. their augmentation can be stopped by converting the gel into xerogel. wherein the quantum dots remains embedded in the solid xerogel matrix. Similar size stabilization of CdS quantum dots can be achieved by means of a unique room-temperature conversion of the CdS incubated ZAVA gel to CdS incubated MOF (CdS@ZAVCl) crystals.

Dried peel samples were ground to yield a powder (simplicia). Subsequently. they were extracted with organic solvents of distinct polarity levels. namely n-hexane (non-polar). chloroform (semi-polar) and methanol (polar) by use of the single-maceration method. Inhibitory effects on tyrosinase activity (monophenolase) and DOPA auto-oxidation (diphenolase) were determined in bioassays. Assays with the methanol extract revealed IC50 values of 784.87 μg mL-1 (monophenolase) and of 1176.66 μg mL-1 (diphenolase). respectively. In contrast. n-hexane and chloroform extracts showed no activity. These results indicate that the methanolic fruit peel extract contained tyrosinase-inhibiting compounds. such as flavonoids. tannins and saponins. whereas the nhexane and chloroform extracts yielded alkaloids. steroids and triterpenoids without tyrosinase-inhibiting activity.

Amongst the well‐established chemical modification strategies for increasing the electron mobility of PDI. substitution of the imide oxygen atoms with sulfur. known as thionation. has remained largely unexplored. In this work. it is demonstrated that thionation is a highly effective means of enhancing the electron mobility of a bis‐N‐alkylated PDI derivative. Successive oxygen–sulfur substitution increases the electron mobility such that the fully thionated derivative (S4) has an average mobility of 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is two orders of magnitude larger than the nonthionated parent compound (P). and is achieved by solution deposition and without thermal or solvent vapor annealing.

However. the use of transition-metal-based cathodes precludes them from being low-cost. sustainable. and environmentally benign. even with recycling programs in place. In this study. we report a highly stable organic material that can be used in place of the transition-metal cathodes. By creating a three-dimensional framework based on triptycene and perylene diimide (PDI). a cathode can be constructed that mitigates stability issues that organic electrodes typically suffer from.

Generally. the conditioning of syngas competitively occurs in two different reaction pathways at a moderate temperature range (350–450 °C). such as RWGS (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) and methanation (CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O). In this study. we demonstrate that the interfacial synergy of Ni/Ga2O3 can boost selective CO2 hydrogenation to CO (CO selectivity >95%) in the temperature range of 350–450 °C. Detailed investigations indicate that the interfacial synergy of the Ni/Ga2O3 interface significantly influences the adsorption of H2 and CO2 and thus leads to the formation of different intermediates and products. In particular. *HCOO is preferentially formed on the Ni surface. which is further hydrogenated into CH4 and H2O.

Five phase regions. namely an A-type hexagonal. a B-type monoclinic. a C-type cubic solid solution and two biphasic mixtures of the former three phase fields were detected in this system. The magnetic susceptibility measurements showed the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions in all samples. The Curie–Weiss temperature shows a nonlinear dependence on concentration.

1172762,Crystal chemistry. stability and properties of interlanthanide perovskites: A review,2017,Cristina Artini,37,,2,427-440,Elsevier,In this review structural features. stability issues and physical properties of the eleven interlanthanide perovskites prepared at atmospheric pressure are surveyed and discussed. Due to the reduced size difference between cations. the structure of these oxides is strongly distorted with respect to the ideal cubic case. Therefore. in structure maps they are located close to the boundary of the perovskitic stability field; an interesting correlation between stability and the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t shows that the perovskitic temperature range narrows with decreasing t. Magnetic and optical properties are strictly related to the presence of 4f electrons. that determine the existence of many discrete energy levels.

Wettability tests aimed at elucidating the interfacial interactions and the role of active metal additions (i.e. Ti) in the brazing procedure. performed in a temperature range between 950 and 1150 °C. showed that Cu wets pure ZrB2 quite well (contact angle θ = 70°). while Ag does not. The composite was wetted in a similar way by Cu. while for Ag a θ = 97° was found. The addition of Ti improved the wetting (θ between ~0° and 20°) and segregation at the metal–ceramic interface occurred. As expected. both Cu(Ti) and Ag(Ti) wetted the Ti6Al4V alloy very well.

Sm. or Gd. are well-known to be characterized by high values of ionic conductivity in the intermediate temperature range. which. in principle. makes them ideal solid electrolytes in solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells. Defect chemistry turns out to be a pivotal issue in this framework because ionic conductivity is driven by the ability of oxygen vacancies to move through the lattice. and any form of defect clustering tends to depress the efficiency of oxygen transport.

However. the detailed kinetics and dynamics of GO thermal reduction still need to be revealed. Here. we present a new insight into low-temperature thermal reduction of Hummers' GO. During the low-temperature thermal treatment. the decomposition process of functional groups of Hummers' GO is found to consist of 4 steps (Step 1: below 160 °C. Step 2: between 160 and 210 °C. Step 3: between 210 and 300 °C. Step 4: above 300 °C). We discovered that Step 3 is an endothermic process. This finding differs from the common view that the thermal reduction of Hummers' GO is only an exothermic event. In addition. gaseous aromatic by-products form below 300 °C. implying that the basal carbon network could start to decompose at such low temperatures.

This electrochemical route for the production of hydroxylamine is a greener alternative to the present industrial synthesis. because it allows converting the energy released during the reaction into electricity. The studied electrocatalysts were prepared by pyrolysis of composites of activated carbon and polyaniline (PANI) incorporating Fe sites (Fe-PANI-AC). Characterisation with a combination of techniques (FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. XRD. N2-physisorption.

However. to make MFC technology economically feasible. cost efficient electrode manufacturing processes need to be proposed and demonstrated. In this context. VITO has developed an innovative electrode manufacturing process based on film casting and phase inversion. The screening and selection process of electrode compositions was done based on physicochemical properties of the active layer. which in turn maintained a close relation with their composition A dual hydrophilic-hydrophobic character in the active layer was achieved with values of ε hydrophilic up to 10% while ε TOTAL remained in the range 65 wt% to 75 wt%. Eventually. selected electrodes were tested as air cathodes for MFC in half cell and full cell modes. Reduction currents. up to− 0.14 mA· cm 2− at− 100 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) were reached in long term experiments in the cathode half-cell.

Currently. domestic wastewater is treated in conventional sewage wastewater treatment plants by means of aerobic activated sludge systems. Energy needs to be supplied at about 15 kWh per inhabitant per year. A direct anaerobic treatment with the recovery of energy is not feasible since the wastewater is too low in energy containing compounds and has a low temperature. Therefore. in this research. this low strength wastewater was first up concentrated by mixing it with kitchen waste. In the primary treatment. bioreactors optimized to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were used to treat sewage enriched by the organic fraction of household wastes (kitchen waste). The biogas produced from these matrices. both at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions was continuously monitored. besides hydrolysis of the solids and formation of all fermentation products.

A Wiley Company,Both enantiomers of methyloctalone were oxidized by a biomimetic manganese/porphyrin/imidazole catalytic system in order to obtain sufficient amounts of various model metabolites. The double bond proved to be less sensitive than the ring methylenes. Hydroxylation occurred mainly in the allylic position (position 8) and also at positions 7 and 6. In position 8. two diastereomers were obtained while in positions 7 and 6 the reaction was diastereospecific. In the case of position 8 only the oxidation yielded a keto compound.

The method is based on photoactive self-assembled monolayers and can be used to functionalize localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based biosensors with biorecognition motifs while reducing nonspecific binding via introduction of hydrophilic units. The photoactive linker molecule. 5-bromo-7-nitroindoline. couples nucleophilic molecules such as biotin ethylenediamine to a surface when exposed to UV-light. The specific. noncovalent recognition between biotin and streptavidin is used for demonstration of a simple biorecognition assay based on the LSPR sensing principle.

From the structure of DNA to the activity of enzymes. all are governed by weak interactions to form advanced three-dimensional structures. During recent decades. the use of self-assembly in chemistry and materials science has evolved. Together with an increased understanding on how these weak forces function. scientists have developed ways to use natural or synthetic self-assembling units for new materials and nanoscale structures with advanced shapes and functions.An example of the use of DNA self-assembly in a creative and programmable way is DNA origami [2].

1173018,Building Blocks for the Assembly of Nanostructures,2017,Tina Gschneidtner,,,,,,The natural world and many man made technologies are driven by self-assembly. involving the autonomous organization of individual components as a result of specific local interactions into functional structures. Self-assembly is a platform from which to construct materials with a high complexity. in high precision. with an inbuilt errorcorrection system due to its dynamic nature. For example. in nature this principle allows us to encode our genome by the controlled opening and closing two stands of DNA. In addition. linear protein chains fold into elaborate 3D structures for specific functions. cells assemble and divide for example into embryonic tissue and form the basis of reproduction. In fact. all these biological components have a high degree of organization owing to specific interactions at molecular level. The principle of selfassembly is also used in technology for example for drug delivery through liposomes made out of lipid bilayers to carry the drug through membranes to reach specific tissues. It is also the basis of many type of biosensors. such as glucose sensors used by diabetics to monitor their blood sugar level. But also future computer based technology may need ordered arrays of molecules. such as rotaxanes. Rotaxanes for example assemble and switch between two states. which is a promising step towards future molecular-based computers. Indeed. society is in a demand for more powerful computers and therefore its working components ideally need further miniaturization.This thesis is focusing on different aspects of the self-assembly.

These new fluorophores in solution exhibited an absorption maximum at around ~419 nm (visible region). as expected for electronic transitions of the π-π* type (ε ~ 2.7 ×107 L mol-1 cm-1). and strong solvent-dependent fluorescence emission (FL ~ 0.5) located in the bluish-green region. The Stokes' shift of these compounds is ca. 3779 cm-1. which was attributed to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state. In CHCl3 solution. the compounds exhibited longer and shorter lifetimes. which was attributed to the emission of monomeric and aggregated molecules. respectively. Density functional theory was used to model the electronic structure of the compounds 9a-d in their excited and ground electronic states. The simulated emission spectra are consistent with the experimental results. with different solvents leading to a shift in the emission peak and the attribution of a π-π* state with the characteristics of a charge transfer excitation.

Addition of phenyl substituents increases the opportunities for π···π interaction. and consequently. diquinoline 3 was. as expected. a nonhost. However. the further introduction of nitro sensor groups induced selectivity toward the inclusion of polar guest molecules for the first time.

The viability of excited-state organometallic catalysis via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry. it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind.

In this arena. copper catalysis has long been considered a privileged platform due to the propensity of high-valent copper to undergo reductive elimination with a wide variety of coupling fragments. However. the sluggish nature of oxidative addition has limited copper’s capacity to broadly facilitate haloarene coupling protocols. Here. we demonstrate that this copper oxidative addition problem can be overcome with an aryl radical–capture mechanism. wherein the aryl radical is generated through a silyl radical halogen abstraction.

The two carbon supports are introducing different characteristics in the absorption spectra of the investigated nanocomposites. Raman spectroscopy shows that the absorption of iron-tetrapyridylporphyrin is more efficient on GO than TRGO. suggesting that oxygen functionalities are involved in the non-covalent interaction between the iron-porphyrin and graphene.

This paper describes how improved wear resistant silver coatings can be obtained from the electrolytic deposition of silver from a solution of AgCl in an ethylene glycol/choline chloride based Deep Eutectic Solvent.

The work also addresses the fundamental aspect of speciation of silver chloride in solution using EXAFS to probe solution structure. The size but not the nature of the composite particles is seen to change the morphology and grain size of the silver deposit. Grain sizes are shown to be consistent with previous nucleation studies.

However. the sensitivity of this multicomponent hydride system to partial pressures of H2 has not been investigated previously. A combination of in situ powder neutron and X-ray diffraction (deuterides were used for the neutron experiments) have shed light on the effect of low partial pressures of hydrogen on the decomposition of these materials.

1173202,Coating removal from an industrial polypropylene blend by cryogenic blasting: The development of substrate damage,2005,DP Weston and PH Shipway and SJ Harris,258,Wear,1-4,392-401,Elsevier,Cryogenic blasting is a pneumatic jet based process in which solid carbon dioxide (CO2) particles impinge upon a surface. It may be employed to remove paint layers from a variety of substrate materials. During this process. the substrate material may be damaged due to the carbon dioxide particles striking the substrate surface. For applications where the component is to be recoated. such damage is undesirable. This work describes the damage sustained by an industrial polymer blend when exposed to cryogenic blasting with solid carbon dioxide particles of ∼0.5 mm diameter impacting at mean particle velocities in the range 155–241 m s−1. The damage is recorded by profilometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies. Roughness (Ra) values are reported for blasted surfaces as a function of particle impact velocity and exposure time.

There have been no reports of the thixoforming of nanocomposites in the literature. The incorporation of ceramic nanoparticles into liquid metals is a challenging task for the fabrication of metal matrix nanocomposites due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and poor wettability.

Experimentally. it has been observed that during particle blasting. substantial temperature rises are observed in the polymer substrates. even when the blast media is solid carbon dioxide at less than −78.5 °C. Such temperature rises are not seen in metallic materials subjected to the same blasting conditions.A model has been developed which allows such observations to be understood. It is shown that temperature rises in polymers are associated with their low thermal conductivities and the relatively deep plastic zones (associated with their low hardnesses) which are associated with the regions in which the energy of impact is dissipated as heat.
