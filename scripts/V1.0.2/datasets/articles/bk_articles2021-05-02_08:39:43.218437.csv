1278190,Bandera: Extracting finite-state models from Java source code,2000,James C Corbett and Matthew B Dwyer and John Hatcliff and Shawn Laubach and Corina S Pasareanu and Hongjun Zheng,,,,439-448,IEEE,Finite-state verification techniques. such as model checking. have shown promise as a cost-effective means for finding defects in hardware designs. To date. the application of these techniques to software has been hindered by several obstacles. Chief among these is the problem of constructing a finite-state model that approximates the executable behavior of the software system of interest. Current best-practice involves hand construction of models which is expensive (prohibitive for all but the smallest systems). prone to errors (which can result in misleading verification results). and difficult to optimize (which is necessary to combat the exponential complexity of verification algorithms). The authors describe an integrated collection of program analysis and transformation components. called Bandera. that enables the automatic extraction of safe. compact finite-state models from program source code. Bandera takes …,True,B56JLs0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1513,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/870434/,6086026751177749156,/scholar?cites=6086026751177749156,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.47.1233&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1278192,Bogor: an extensible and highly-modular software model checking framework,2003,Matthew B Dwyer and John Hatcliff,28,ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes,5,267-276,ACM,Model checking is emerging as a popular technology for reasoning about behavioral properties of a wide variety of software artifacts including: requirements models. architectural descriptions. designs. implementations. and process models. The complexity of model checking is well-known. yet cost-effective analyses have been achieved by exploiting. for example. naturally occurring abstractions and semantic properties of a target software artifact. semantic properties of target software artifacts. Adapting a model checking tool to exploit this kind of domain knowledge often requires in-depth knowledge of the tool's implementation.We believe that with appropriate tool support. domain experts will be able to develop efficient model checking-based analyses for a variety of software-related models.

1278193,Slicing software for model construction,2000,John Hatcliff and Matthew B Dwyer and Hongjun Zheng,13,Higher-order and symbolic computation,4,315-353,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Applying finite-state verification techniques (e.g.. model checking) to software requires that program source code be translated to a finite-state transition system that safely models program behavior. Automatically checking such a transition system for a correctness property is typically very costly. thus it is necessary to reduce the size of the transition system as much as possible. In fact. it is often the case that much of a program's source code is irrelevant for verifying a given correctness property.In this paper. we apply program slicing techniques to remove automatically such irrelevant code and thus reduce the size of the corresponding transition system models. We give a simple extension of the classical slicing definition. and prove its safety with respect to model checking of linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae. We discuss how this slicing strategy fits into a general methodology for deriving effective …,True,B56JLs0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,271,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026599015809,9490639040137149476,/scholar?cites=9490639040137149476,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.43.3170&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1278213,Bunch: A clustering tool for the recovery and maintenance of software system structures,1999,Spiros Mancoridis and Brian S Mitchell and Yihfarn Chen and Emden R Gansner,,,,50-59,IEEE,Software systems are typically modified in order to extend or change their functionality. improve their performance. port them to different platforms. and so on. For developers. it is crucial to understand the structure of a system before attempting to modify it. The structure of a system. however. may not be apparent to new developers. because the design documentation is non-existent or. worse. inconsistent with the implementation. This problem could be alleviated if developers were somehow able to produce high-level system decomposition descriptions from the low-level structures present in the source code. We have developed a clustering tool called Bunch that creates a system decomposition automatically by treating clustering as an optimization problem.

Models can be automatically converted between formalisms thanks to information found in a Formalism Transformation Graph (FTG). proposed by the authors. To aid in the automatic generation of multi-formalism modelling tools. formalisms are modelled in their own right (at a meta-level) within an appropriate formalism. This has been implemented in the interactive tool AToM3.

To tackle problems of ever increasing complexity. modelling and simulation research is shifting from simulation techniques to modelling methodology and technology. In this article. the emerging field of Computer Automated Multi-Paradigm Modelling is presented. Multi-paradigm modelling adresses and integrates three orthogonal directions of research:1. multi-formalism modelling. concerned with the coupling of and transformation between models described in different formalisms. 2. model abstraction. concerned with the relationship between models at different levels of abstraction. and3. meta-modelling. concerned with the description (models of models) of classes of models. which allows formalism specification.The article first introduces the general concepts of Modelling and Simulation theory. and explains how rigourous application thereof provides a sound basis for the meaningful exchange and re-use of knowledge about the behaviour of complex systems.

Borrowing concepts from object oriented systems. the main idea is to enrich the attributed type graph with an inheritance relation and a set of abstract nodes. In this way. a node type inherits the attributes and edges of all its ancestors. Based on these concepts. it is possible to define abstract productions. containing abstract nodes. These productions are equivalent to a number of concrete productions. resulting from the substitution of the abstract node types by the node types in their inheritance clan.

This is an emerging field of research. characterized by a wide variety of techniques. a diversity of geographical contexts. a general absence of intermodel comparisons. and inconsistent reporting of model skill. This article begins by outlining the basic principles of ANN modelling. common network architectures and training algorithms. The discussion then addresses related themes of the division and preprocessing of data for model calibration/validation; data standardization techniques; and methods of evaluating ANN model performance.

1278236,An artificial neural network approach to rainfall-runoff modelling,1998,Christian W Dawson and Robert Wilby,43,Hydrological Sciences Journal,1,47-66,Taylor & Francis Group,This paper provides a discussion of the development and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to flow forecasting in two flood-prone UK catchments using real hydrometric data. Given relatively brief calibration data sets it was possible to construct robust models of 15-min flows with six hour lead times for the Rivers Amber and Mole. Comparisons were made between the performance of the ANN and those of conventional flood forecasting systems. The results obtained for validation forecasts were of comparable quality to those obtained from operational systems for the River Amber. The ability of the ANN to cope with missing data and to “learn” from the event currently being forecast in real time makes it an appealing alternative to conventional lumped or semi-distributed flood forecasting models.

Ltd.,The primary role of component‐based software engineering is to address the development of systems as an assembly of parts (components). the development of parts as reusable entities. and the maintenance and upgrading of systems by customising and replacing such parts. This requires established methodologies and tool support covering the entire component and system lifecycle including technological. organisational. marketing. legal. and other aspects. The traditional disciplines from software engineering need new methodologies to support component‐based development. IVICA CRNKOVIC assesses the challenges of this emerging technology and discusses its implications for the software development process. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons.

System evolution. maintenance. migration and compatibilities are some of the challenges met with when developing a component-based software system. Since most systems evolve over time. components must be maintained or replaced. The evolution of requirements affects not only specific system functions and particular components but also component-based architecture on all levels. Increased complexity is a consequence of different components and systems having different life cycles. In component-based systems it is easier to replace part of system with a commercial component. This process is however not straightforward and different factors such as requirements management. marketing issues. etc.. must be taken into consideration.

Established rules of security engineering can be encapsulated and hence made available even to developers who are not specialists in security. As one example. Jürjens uncovers a flaw in the Common Electronic Purse Specification. and proposes and verifies a correction.

We express those systems in a simple programming language; each of the views yields a semantics for the language. One of the semantics treats cryptographic operations formally (that is. symbolically). The other semantics is more detailed and computational; it treats cryptographic operations as functions on bitstrings. Each semantics leads to a definition of equivalence of systems with respect to eavesdroppers. We establish the soundness of the formal definition with respect to the computational one.

We generalize and quantify these studies with a series of independent experiments. We show that previously reported efficiency is not incidental.

The graphs are drawn side-byside from left to right as a sequence of narrow stripes that are placed perpendicular to the horizontal time line. The hierarchically organized vertices of the graphs are arranged on vertical. parallel lines that bound the stripes; directed edges connect these vertices from left to right. To address massive overplotting of edges in huge graphs. we employ a splatting approach that transforms the edges to a pixel-based scalar field. This field represents the edge densities in a scalable way and is depicted by non-linear color mapping.

Locating the source code files that need to be changed in order to fix the bugs is a challenging task. Once a bug report is received. it is desirable to automatically point out to the files that developers should change in order to fix the bug.

In this framework. Web accessible programs (peers) communicate by asynchronous message passing. and a virtual global watcher silently listens to the network. The global behavior is characterized by a “conversation”. which is the infinite sequence of messages observed by the watcher. We show that given a Büchi automaton specifying the desired set of conversations. called a “conversation protocol”. it is possible to realize the protocol using a set of finite state peers if three realizability conditions are satisfied. In particular. the synthesized peers will conform to the protocol by generating only those conversations specified by the protocol.

Previous works have pointed out that at least some laws seem not to be valid for these new environments and even Lehman has labeled those (up to the moment few) cases as anomalies and has suggested that further research is needed to clarify this issue. In this line. we consider in this paper a large set of libre (free. open source) software systems featuring a large community of users and developers. In particular. we analyze a number of projects found in literature up to now. including the Linux kernel.

MA,A common problem that management faces in software companies is the high instability of their staff. In libre (free. open source) software projects. the permanence of developers is also an open issue. with the potential of causing problems amplified by the self-organizing nature that most of them exhibit. Hence. human resources in libre software projects are even more difficult to manage: developers are in most cases not bound by a contract and. in addition. there is not a real management structure concerned about this problem. This raises some interesting questions with respect to the composition of development teams in libre software projects. and how they evolve over time. There are projects lead by their original founders (some sort of “code gods”). while others are driven by several different developer groups over time (i.e. the project “regenerates” itself).

Some researchers have divided this work into various tasks. including making changes to functionality (perfective). changing the environment (adaptive). correcting errors (corrective). and making improvements to avoid future problems (preventive). However. many have considered maintenance basically uniform over time. Because software development has changed considerably since its early days. the authors believe this approach no longer suffices. They describe a new view of the software life cycle in which maintenance is actually a series of distinct stages. each with different activities. tools. and business consequences.

While it is well accepted that concept location is essential for the maintenance of complex procedural code like code written in C. it is much less obvious whether it is also needed for the maintenance of the object-oriented code. After all. the object-oriented code is structured into classes and well-designed classes already implement concepts. so the issue seems to be reduced to the selection of the appropriate class.

Because change requests are formulated in terms of program concepts - chunks of knowledge about the program and application domain - the resulting IC activities also focus on program concepts. Moreover. most change requests originate from the end user. so the end user's view of the program is the source of most concepts that govern IC. Additional concepts might originate from other programmers and deal with the program architecture or algorithms.

Parallel is a survey of the current state of the parallel processing industry. In the early 1980s. parallel computers were generally regarded as academic curiosities whose natural environment was the research laboratory. Today. parallelism is being used by every major computer manufacturer. although in very different ways. to produce increasingly powerful and cost-effec-tive machines. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts of parallel computing; the subsequent chapters cover different forms of parallelism. including descriptions of vector supercomputers. SIMD computers. shared memory multiprocessors. hypercubes. and transputer-based machines. Each section concentrates on a different manufacturer. detailing its history and company profile. the machines it currently produces. the software environments it supports. the market segment it is targetting. and its future plans. Supplementary chapters describe some of the companies which have been unsuccessful. and discuss a number of the common software systems which have been developed to make parallel computers more usable. The appendices describe the technologies which underpin parallelism. Past. Present.

1278373,Parallel programming using C++,1996,Greg Wilson and Paul Lu and Gregory V Wilson and William Gropp and Ewing Lusk,,,,,MIT press,Foreword by Bjarne Stroustrup Software is generally acknowledged to be the single greatest obstacle preventing mainstream adoption of massively-parallel computing. While sequential applications are routinely ported to platforms ranging from PCs to mainframes. most parallel programs only ever run on one type of machine. One reason for this is that most parallel programming systems have failed to insulate their users from the architectures of the machines on which they have run. Those that have been platform-independent have usually also had poor performance. Many researchers now believe that object-oriented languages may offer a solution. By hiding the architecture-specific constructs required for high performance inside platform-independent abstractions. parallel object-oriented programming systems may be able to combine the speed of massively-parallel computing with the comfort of sequential programming. Parallel Programming Using C++ describes fifteen parallel programming systems based on C++. the most popular object-oriented language of today. These systems cover the whole spectrum of parallel programming paradigms. from data parallelism through dataflow and distributed shared memory to message-passing control parallelism. For the parallel programming community. a common parallel application is discussed in each chapter. as part of the description of the system itself. By comparing the implementations of the polygon overlay problem in each system. the reader can get a better sense of their expressiveness and functionality for a common problem.

1278374,Where's the real bottleneck in scientific computing?,2006,Gregory V Wilson,94,American Scientist,1,5,,When I first started doing computational science in 1986. a new generation of fast. cheap chips had just ushered in the current era of low-cost supercomputers. in which multiple processors work in parallel on a single problem. Suddenly. it seemed as though everyone who took number crunching seriously was rewriting his or her software to take advantage of these new machines. Sure. it hurt—the compilers that translated programs to run on parallel computers were flaky. debugging tools were nonexistent. and thinking about how to solve problems in parallel was often like trying to solve a thousand crossword puzzles at once—but the potential payoff seemed enormous. Many investigators were positive that within a few years. computer modeling would let scientists investigate a whole range of phenomena that were too big. too small. too fast. too slow. too dangerous or too complicated to examine in the lab or to analyze with pencil and paper. But by the mid-1990s. I had a nagging feeling that something was wrong. For every successful simulation of global climate. there were a dozen or more groups struggling just to get their program to run. Their work was never quite ready to showcase at conferences or on the cover of their local supercomputing center’s newsletter. Many struggled on for months or years. tweaking and tinkering until their code did something more interesting than grinding to a halt or dividing by zero. For some reason. getting to computational heaven was taking a lot longer than expected.I therefore started asking scientists how they wrote their programs. The answers were sobering.

1278376,A quick introduction to version control with Git and GitHub,2016,John D Blischak and Emily R Davenport and Greg Wilson,12,PLoS computational biology,1,e1004668,Public Library of Science,Many scientists write code as part of their research. Just as experiments are logged in laboratory notebooks. it is important to document the code you use for analysis. However. a few key problems can arise when iteratively developing code that make it difficult to document and track which code version was used to create each result. First. you often need to experiment with new ideas. such as adding new features to a script or increasing the speed of a slow step. but you do not want to risk breaking the currently working code. One often-utilized solution is to make a copy of the script before making new edits. However. this can quickly become a problem because it clutters your file system with uninformative filenames. eg. analysis. sh. analysis_02. sh. analysis_03. sh. etc. It is difficult to remember the differences between the versions of the files and. more importantly. which version you used to produce specific results. especially if you return to the code months later. Second. you will likely share your code with multiple lab mates or collaborators. and they may have suggestions on how to improve it. If you email the code to multiple people. you will have to manually incorporate all the changes each of them sends.Fortunately. software engineers have already developed software to manage these issues: version control. A version control system (VCS) allows you to track the iterative changes you make to your code. Thus. you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results. Furthermore. you can record messages as you save each successive version so that …,True,8QVMwawAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC,131,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668,11154469807022103800,/scholar?cites=11154469807022103800,,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668,0,0,0

The first step in analyzing words from identifiers requires splitting identifiers into their constituent words. Unlike natural languages. where space and punctuation are used to delineate words. identifiers cannot contain spaces. One common way to split identifiers is to follow programming language naming conventions. For example. Java programmers often use camel case. where words are delineated by uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters. However. programmers also create identifiers by concatenating sequences of words together with no discernible delineation. which poses challenges to automatic identifier splitting.

The study used data collected from one version of a commercial Java application for constructing a prediction model. The model was then validated on a subsequent release of the same application. Our results indicate that the prediction model has a high accuracy. Furthermore. we found that an export coupling (EC) metric had the strongest association with fault-proneness. indicating …,True,-d8iaKMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,476,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121200000868,13343124624493044614,/scholar?cites=13343124624493044614,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.4311&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1278414,How reuse influences productivity in object-oriented systems,1996,Victor R Basili and Lionel C Briand and Walcélio L Melo,39,Communications of the ACM,10,104-116,ACM,THIS article presents the results of a study conduct-ed at the University of Maryland in which we assessed the impact of reuse on quality and pro-ductivity in object-oriented (OO) systems. Reuse is assumed to be an effective strategy for building high-quality software. However. there is currently little empirical information about what to expect from reuse in terms of productivity and quality gains. The study is one step toward a better understanding of the benefits of reuse in an OO framework in light of currently available technology. Data was collected for four months—September through December 1994—on the development of eight small (less than 15.000 source lines of code [KSLOC]) systems with equivalent functional requirements. All eight projects were developed using the Waterfall-style Software Engineering Life Cycle Model. an OO design method. and the C++ programming language.

Melo and Jurgen Wust,28,IEEE transactions on Software Engineering,7,706-720,IEEE,A number of papers have investigated the relationships between design metrics and the detection of faults in object-oriented software. Several of these studies have shown that such models can be accurate in predicting faulty classes within one particular software product. In practice. however. prediction models are built on certain products to be used on subsequent software development projects. How accurate can these models be. considering the inevitable differences that may exist across projects and systems? Organizations typically learn and change. From a more general standpoint. can we obtain any evidence that such models are economically viable tools to focus validation and verification effort? This paper attempts to answer these questions by devising a general but tailorable cost-benefit model and by using fault and design data collected on two mid-size Java systems developed in the same …,True,-d8iaKMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,381,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1019484/,14446239091643763137,/scholar?cites=14446239091643763137,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.83.2223&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In such environments the software processes are explicitly described and interpreted by the PSEE. allowing software activities to be automated. assisted. and enforced. Lehman and Belady (1985) & Osterweil (1987) claim that this capability is a central element in a software development environment for the improvement of software product quality and software developers productivity. We have addressed these problems in the framework of the Adele project. The Adele kernel. initially a configuration management system has been extended with respect to 1) modeling and support of complex product models: the Object Manager 2) modeling and support of software processes: the Activity Manager and 3) modeling and support of software product evolution: the Configuration Manager. For data and product modelling. an ER/OO model has been implemented including SEE specific features; On top of Adele kernel. which is a commercial product. we developed a Process Manager research prototype.

The tryptophan system of yeast,1992,Peter Niederberger and R Prasad and G Miozzari and H Kacser,287,Biochemical Journal,2,473-479,Portland Press Ltd.,Decreases in enzyme activity often have little effect on the flux carried by the pathway. Similarly. up-modulation of single genes. and hence of the dependent enzyme concentrations. is frequently found to be ineffective in increasing the flux in the pathway in which the enzyme occurs. This insensitivity to enzyme variation is demonstrated experimentally for five separate enzymes in the tryptophan synthesis system of yeast. first by down-modulation of the gene dose and secondly by increasing the dose using multi-copy vectors. Such a lack of response is discussed in terms of the concepts of metabolic control analysis. When these five enzymes. however. were simultaneously increased by a multi-copy vector carrying all five genes. a substantial elevation of the flux to tryptophan was observed.

Having a reference architecture available can aid both during maintenance and at design time: it can improve understanding of a given system. it can aid in analyzing tradeoffs between different design options. and it can serve as a template for designing new systems and re-engineering existing ones. In this paper. we examine the history of the Web browser domain and identify several underlying phenomena that have contributed to its evolution.

Symposium on Constructing Software Engineering Tools (CoSET-00),,,,As large systems evolve. their architectural integrity tends to decay. Reverse engineering tools. such as PBS [7. 19]. Rigi [15]. and Acacia [5]. can be used to acquire an understanding of a system’s “as-built” architecture and in so doing regain control over the system. A problem that has impeded the widespread adoption of reverse engineering tools is the tight coupling of their subtools. including source code “fact” extractors. visualization engines. and querying mechanisms; this coupling has made it difficult. for example. for users to employ alternative extractors that might have different strengths or understand different source languages.The TAXFORM project has sought to investigate how different reverse engineering tools can be integrated into a single framework by providing mappings to and from common data schemas for program “facts”[2]. In this paper. we describe how we successfully integrated the Acacia C and C++ fact extractors into the PBS system. and how we were then able to create software architecture models for two large software systems: the Mozilla web browser (over two million lines of C++ and C) and the VIM text editor (over 160.000 lines of C).,True,KnJ6PRwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,132,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.441.3934&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=15,15860403470417509028,/scholar?cites=15860403470417509028,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.441.3934&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=15,0,0,0

1278445,Technological spaces: An initial appraisal,2002,Ivan Kurtev and Jean Bézivin and Mehmet Aksit,2002,"CoopIS, DOA",,,,In this paper. we propose a high level view of technological spaces (TS) and relations among these spaces. A technological space is a working context with a set of associated concepts. body of knowledge. tools. required skills. and possibilities. It is often associated to a given user community with shared know-how. educational support. common literature and even workshop and conference regular meetings. Although it is difficult to give a precise definition. some TSs can be easily identified. eg the XML TS. the DBMS TS. the abstract syntax TS. the meta-model (OMG/MDA) TS. etc. The purpose of our work is not to define an abstract theory of technological spaces. but to figure out how to work more efficiently by using the best possibilities of each technology. To do so. we need a basic understanding of the similarities and differences between various TSs. and also of the possible operational bridges that will allow transferring the results obtained in one TS to other TS. We hope that the presented industrial vision may help us putting forward the idea that there could be more cooperation than competition among alternative technologies. Furthermore. as the spectrum of such available technologies is rapidly broadening. the necessity to offer clear guidelines when choosing practical solutions to engineering problems is becoming a must. not only for teachers but for project leaders as well.,True,oV0KfsMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,407,https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6157082/0363TechnologicalSpaces.pdf,4406905483909490459,/scholar?cites=4406905483909490459,,,https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6157082/0363TechnologicalSpaces.pdf,0,0,0

1278447,TCS: a DSL for the specification of textual concrete syntaxes in model engineering,2006,Frédéric Jouault and Jean Bézivin and Ivan Kurtev,,,,249-254,,Domain modeling promotes the description of various facets of information systems by a coordinated set of domain-specific languages (DSL). Some of them have visual/graphical and other may have textual concrete syntaxes. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) helps defining the concepts and relations of the domain by the way of metamodel elements. For visual languages. it is necessary to establish links between these concepts and relations on one side and visual symbols on the other side. Similarly. with textual languages it is necessary to establish links between metamodel elements and syntactic structures of the textual DSL.

Heidelberg,Much of the current work on model transformations seems essentially operational and executable in nature. Executable descriptions are necessary from the point of view of implementation. But from a conceptual point of view. transformations can also be viewed as descriptive models by stating only the properties a transformation has to fulfill and by omitting execution details. This contribution discusses the view that model transformations can be abstracted as being transformation models. As a simple example for a transformation model. the well-known transformation from the Entity-Relationship model to the Relational model is shown. A transformation model in this contribution is nothing more than an ordinary. simple model. i.e.. a UML/MOF class diagram together with OCL constraints.

1278453,Adaptability of model transformations.,2005,Ivan Kurtev,,,,,,Today’s software systems are complex artifacts. This is mainly due to the inherent complexity of the domains in which software solutions are used. This makes the software development process a difficult task. Moreover. the complexity of the domains is only one factor contributing to the difficulties observed in software development processes. Other difficulties are related to methodological. organizational. economical. cultural and other issues.Competition in the software industry leads to a steady stream of new technologies. During the last decade we witnessed the acceptance of several new programming languages (eg C++. Java. C#). middleware technologies (eg CORBA [73]. Web Services [110]). and data representation standards (eg SGML and XML [103]). This constant shift from one technology to another seems unavoidable and puts an emphasis on adequate coping with technology changes in software development. Current software development practices are in most cases code-centric relying on a set of implementation technologies. Changes in the technologies may require porting of software artifacts to the new technologies. It is difficult to maintain stable and reusable software assets due to constant technology changes. To cope with this problem an approach to software development has been proposed by Object Management Group (OMG) named Model Driven Architecture (MDA)[72]. The core idea of MDA is to use modeling and models as main activity and artifacts in software development. Keeping software assets in the form of models makes these assets more resilient to changes in the implementation technologies.

However there are still some inadequacies that need to be addressed when it comes to achieving alignment between business goals and business processes. The User Requirements Notation (URN). recently standardized by ITU-T. has some unique features and capabilities beyond what is available in other notations that can help address alignment issues. In this paper. a URN-based framework and its supporting toolset are introduced which provide business process monitoring and performance management capabilities integrated across the BPM lifecycle.

Heidelberg,BPMN 2.0 is an OMG standard and one of the leading process modelling notations. Although the current language specification recognises the importance of defining a visual notation carefully. it does so by relying on common sense. intuition and emulation of common practices. rather than by adopting a rigorous scientific approach. This results in a number of suboptimal language design decisions that may impede effective model-mediated communication between stakeholders. We demonstrate and illustrate this by looking at BPMN 2.0 through the lens of the Physics of Notations. a collection of evidence-based principles that together form a theory of notation design.

The framework has two unique features: it distinguishes between goals and means by separating what you are trying to achieve in conceptual modeling from how to achieve it (it has been made so that the goals are more realistic by introducing the notion of feasibility); and it is closely linked to linguistic concepts because modeling is essentially making statements in some language.< >,True,mlcWCCkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1174,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/268955/,3141452328701880812,/scholar?cites=3141452328701880812,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guttorm_Sindre/publication/3246958_Understanding_Quality_in_Conceptual_Modeling_IEEE_Software_11242-49/links/0a85e52e0eb10a9f1b000000/Understanding-Quality-in-Conceptual-Modeling-IEEE-Software-11242-49.pdf,0,0,0

1278480,Defining quality aspects for conceptual models,1995,John Krogstie and Odd Ivar Lindland and Guttorm Sindre,,,,216-231,Springer. Boston. MA,The notion of quality for information system models and other conceptual models is not well understood. and in most literature only lists of useful properties have been provided. However. the recent framework of Lindland et al. has tried to take a more systematic approach. defining the notions of syntactic. semantic. and pragmatic quality of models. and distinguishing between quality goals and the means to achieve them. Here. this framework is extended by discussing the six semiotic layers of communication identified by FRISCO. Definitions are provided for physical. syntactic. semantic. pragmatic. and social quality. respectively. and to the extent possible. metrics are provided for the defined quality goals.

The challenge nowadays is to make such compositions able to dynamically reconfigure themselves in order to address the cases when the component services do not behave as expected and when the execution context changes. We argue that the problem has to be tackled at two levels: on the one side. the runtime platform should be flexible enough to support the selection of alternative services. the negotiation of their service level agreements. and the partial replanning of a composition. On the other side. the language used to develop the composition should support the designer in defining the constraints and conditions that regulate selection. negotiation. and replanning actions at runtime.

Services offered by different providers. are composed to new services by using Web service composition languages such as BPEL. Such process-based composition languages lack the ability to use business rules managed by different business rules engines in the composition process. In this paper. we propose an approach on how to use and integrate business rules in a service-oriented way into BPEL.,True,KK2le2UAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,175,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1524091/,12455873466040145314,/scholar?cites=12455873466040145314,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Schahram_Dustdar/publication/4182275_Business_Rules_Integration_in_BPEL_-_A_Service-Oriented_Approach/links/00b7d522db46b9837a000000/Business-Rules-Integration-in-BPEL-A-Service-Oriented-Approach.pdf,0,0,0

However. if things go wrong. a deeper analysis of process performance becomes necessary. Business analysts want to learn about the factors that influence the performance of business processes and most often contribute to the violation of KPI target values. and how they relate to each other. We provide a framework for performance monitoring and analysis of WS-BPEL processes. which consolidates process events and Quality of Service measurements. The framework uses machine learning techniques in order to construct tree structures. which represent the dependencies of a KPI on process and QoS metrics.

Quality of Service represents an important issue which is often considered when selecting and composing services. For receiving up-to-date information. non-functional properties such as response time or availability can be continuously monitored using server-or clientside approaches. However. both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. In this paper. we present a framework that combines the advantages of client-and server-side QoS monitoring. It builds on event processing to inform interested subscribers of current QoS values and possible violations of Service Level Agreements.

Berlin. Heidelberg,SLAs are contractually binding agreements between service providers and consumers. mandating concrete numerical target values which the service needs to achieve. For service providers. it is essential to prevent SLA violations as much as possible to enhance customer satisfaction and avoid penalty payments. Therefore. it is desirable for providers to predict possible violations before they happen. while it is still possible to set counteractive measures. We propose an approach for predicting SLA violations at runtime. which uses measured and estimated facts (instance data of the composition or QoS of used services) as input for a prediction model. The prediction model is based on machine learning regression techniques. and trained using historical process instances.

Investigations were carried out during August–October. 2009-2010. on 33 species. in the Botanical garden of the Banaras Hindu University at Varanasi. India. Estimates of leaf area were obtained by the equation. leaf area (cm2)= x/y. where x is the weight (g) of the area covered by the leaf outline on a millimeter graph paper. and y is the weight of one cm2 of the same graph paper. These estimates were then compared with destructive measurements obtained through a leaf area meter; the two sets of estimates were significantly and linearly related with each other. and hence the millimeter graph paper method can be used for estimating leaf area in lieu of leaf area meter. The important characteristics of this cost-efficient technique are its easiness and suitability for precise. non-destructive estimates.

We investigated this response with respect to the activity of plasma membrane H+-ATPase using Vicia guard cell protoplasts. ATP hydrolysis by the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. phosphorylation of the H+-ATPase. and the binding of 14-3-3 protein to the H+-ATPase stimulated by BL were inhibited by ABA at 10 μm. All of these responses were similarly inhibited by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 1 mm.

1278529,Multiresolution signal decomposition: A new tool for fault detection in power transformers during impulse tests,1998,S Kumar Pandey and L Satish,13,IEEE Transactions on power delivery,4,1194-1200,IEEE,Detection of major faults in power transformers during impulse tests has never been an issue. but is rather difficult when only a minor fault. say a sparkover between adjacent coils or turns and lasting for a few microseconds. occurs. However. detection of such a type of fault is very important to avoid any catastrophic situation. In this paper. the authors propose a new and powerful method capable of detecting minor incipient faults. The approach is based on wavelet transform analysis. particularly the dyadic-orthonormal wavelet transform. The key idea underlying the approach is to decompose a given faulty neutral current response into other signals which represent a smoothed and detailed version of the original.

Unfortunately. these systems provide only insufficient support for a detailed analysis of software evolution aspects. We address this problem and introduce an approach for populating a release history database that combines version data with bug tracking data and adds missing data not covered by version control systems such as merge points. Then simple queries can be applied to the structured data to obtain meaningful views showing the evolution of a software project. Such views enable more accurate reasoning of evolutionary aspects and facilitate the anticipation of software evolution.

We present change distilling. a tree differencing algorithm for fine-grained source code change extraction. For that. we have improved the existing algorithm by Chawathe et al. for extracting changes in hierarchically structured data. Our algorithm extracts changes by finding both a match between the nodes of the compared two abstract syntax trees and a minimum edit script that can transform one tree into the other given the computed matching. As a result. we can identify fine-grained change types between program versions according to our taxonomy of source code changes. We evaluated our change distilling algorithm with a benchmark that we developed. which consists of 1.064 manually classified changes in 219 revisions of eight methods from three different open source projects …,True,MTZ0l60AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,661,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4339230/,6431063827330352291,/scholar?cites=6431063827330352291,,,,0,0,0

Work fragmentation is bad for efficiency and quality. In this paper we empirically investigate the relationship between the fragmentation of developer contributions and the number of post-release failures. Our approach is to represent developer contributions with a developer-module network that we call contribution network. We use network centrality measures to measure the degree of fragmentation of developer contributions. Fragmentation is determined by the centrality of software modules in the contribution network. Our claim is that central software modules are more likely to be failure-prone than modules located in surrounding areas of the network. We analyze this hypothesis by exploring the network centrality of Microsoft Windows Vista binaries using several network centrality measures as well as linear and logistic regression …,True,MTZ0l60AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,280,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1453101.1453105,8869553086370660857,/scholar?cites=8869553086370660857,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/9108/2/pinzger-fse2008-1.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we analyze the proximity of software features based on modification and problem report data that capture the system’s evolution history. Features are instrumented and tracked. the relationships of modification and problem reports to these features are established. and the tracked features are visualized to illustrate their otherwise hidden dependencies. Our approach uncovers these hidden relationships between features via problem report analysis and presents them in easy-to-evaluate visual form. Particular feature dependencies then can be selected to assess the feature evolution by zooming in into an arbitrary level of detail. Such visualization of interwoven features. therefore. can indicate locations of design erosion in the architectural evolution of a software system.

The Journal's web site is located at http://journals. aps. org/prd/,The large top-quark pair-production cross-section at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) allows detailed studies of the characteristics of the production of top-antitop (tt) quark pairs. providing an opportunity to further test the Standard Model (SM). Focusing on highly boosted final states probes the QCD tt production processes in the TeV scale range. a kinematic region where theoretical calculations based on the SM still present large uncertainties [1–3]. High-precision measurements. especially in kinematic regions that have not been explored extensively. are necessary to better constrain the models currently in use. Furthermore. effects beyond the SM can appear as modifications of tt differential distributions with respect to the SM predictions [4–6] that may not be detected with an inclusive cross-section measurement. In the SM. the top quark decays almost exclusively to a W boson and a b-quark. The signature of a tt final state is therefore determined by the W boson decay modes.

Briand and Erik Arisholm and Steve Counsell and Frank Houdek and Pascale Thévenod-Fosse,4,Empirical Software Engineering,4,387-404,,Object-Oriented technologies are becoming pervasive in many software development organizations. However. many methods. processes. tools. or notations are being used without thorough evaluation. Empirical studies aim at investigating the performance of such technologies and the quality of the resulting object-oriented (OO) software products. In other words. the goal is to provide a scientific foundation to the engineering of OO software.This paper summarizes the results of a working group at the Empirical Studies of Software Development and Evolution (ESSDE) workshop in Los Angeles in May 1999.

1278585,Coupling metrics for object-oriented design,1998,Rachel Harrison and Steve Counsell and Reuben Nithi,,,,150-157,IEEE,We describe and evaluate some recently innovated coupling metrics for object-oriented (OO) design. The Coupling Between Objects (CBO) metric of Chidamber and Kemerer (1991) is evaluated empirically using five OO systems. and compared with an alternative OO design metric called SAS. which measures the number of associations between a class and its peers. The NAS metric is directly collectible from design documents such as the Object Model of OMT. Results from all systems studied indicate a strong relationship between CBO and NAS. suggesting that they are not orthogonal. We hypothesised that coupling would be related to understandability. the number of errors and error density. So relationships were found for any of the systems between class understandability and coupling. Only limited evidence was found to support our hypothesis linking increased coupling to increased error density.

It is a pay-as-you-go model that offers computing resources as a service in an attempt to reduce IT capital and operating expenditures. The problem is that current software architectures lack elements such as those related to address elasticity. virtualization and billing. These elements are needed in the design of cloud applications. Moreover. there is no generic cloud software architecture for designing and building cloud applications. To further complicate the problem. each platform provider has different standards that influence the way applications are written. This ties cloud users to a particular provider. This paper will focus on defining a reference model for cloud computing; more particularly. it presents a meta-model that shows the main cloud vocabulary and design elements. the set of configuration rules. and the semantic interpretation.

However. this is a potentially costly task. To mitigate the costs. the testing effort can be optimized by executing only a selected subset of the test cases that are believed to have a better chance of revealing faults. This paper proposes a novel approach for selecting and ordering a predetermined number of test cases from an existing test suite. Our approach forms an Integer Linear Programming problem using two different coverage-based criteria. and uses constraint relaxation to find many close-to-optimal solution points. These points are then combined to obtain a final solution using a voting mechanism. The selected subset of test cases is then prioritized using a greedy algorithm that maximizes minimum coverage in an iterative manner.

The attention to processes dates back to the early 1970s. when software engineers realized that the desired qualities (such as reliability. efficiency. evolvability. ease of use. etc.) could only be injected in the products by following a disciplined flow of activities. Such a discipline would also make the production process more predictable and economical. Most of the software process work. however. remained in an informal stage until the late 1980s.

Thanks to their ability in enacting process models. they can be used to guide people in performing their daily work and to automate the repetitive tasks that do not require human intervention. Given these potential benefits. it is surprising to observe that PSSs are not widely adopted. This is especially true in case of highly flexible and human-intensive processes. such as design processes in general and software processes in particular. This fact can be explained by observing that currently available PSSs do not fulfil some crucial needs of modern business organizations.

Nevertheless. the available systems exploiting a distributed event dispatcher are unable to rearrange dynamically their behavior to adapt to changes in the topology of the dispatching infrastructure.

We then analyze this solution and achieve a deeper understanding of how the event dispatching information is reconfigured.

Our approach automatically extracts and summarizes emotions expressed in collaboration artifacts by combining probabilistic topic modeling with lexical sentiment analysis techniques. We applied the approach to 1000 collaboration artifacts produced by three development teams in a three month period. Interviews with the teams' project leaders suggest that the proposed emotion summaries have a good correlation with the emotional state of the project. and could be useful for improving emotional awareness.

The high cost has motivated the development of fault localization techniques. which help developers search for fault locations. In this paper. we propose a new statistical method. called SOBER. which automatically localizes software faults without any prior knowledge of the program semantics. Unlike existing statistical approaches that select predicates correlated with program failures. SOBER models the predicate evaluation in both correct and incorrect executions and regards a predicate as fault-relevant if its evaluation pattern in incorrect executions significantly diverges from that in correct ones. Featuring a rationale similar to that of hypothesis testing. SOBER quantifies the fault relevance of each predicate in a principled way.

A key part of an SPL is a model that captures the rules for reconfiguring the software. SPLs commonly use feature models to capture SPL configuration rules. Each SPL configuration is represented as a selection of features from the feature model. Invalid SPL configurations can be created due to feature conflicts introduced via staged or parallel configuration or changes to the constraints in a feature model. When invalid configurations are created. a method is needed to automate the diagnosis of the errors and repair the feature selections.This paper provides two contributions to research on automated configuration of SPLs. First. it shows how configurations and feature models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems to automatically diagnose errors and repair invalid feature …,True,2gPJKDIAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,123,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016412121000049X,14398312945842730417,/scholar?cites=14398312945842730417,,,https://idus.us.es/bitstream/handle/11441/24583/file_1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Data are needed to assess the efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine in African children.Methods: We conducted a randomized. placebo-controlled. multicenter trial in South Africa (3166 infants; 64.1% of the total) and Malawi (1773 infants; 35.9% of the total) to evaluate the efficacy of a live. oral rotavirus vaccine in preventing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy infants were randomly assigned in a 1: 1: 1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine (in addition to one dose of placebo) or three doses of vaccine—the pooled vaccine group—or three doses of placebo at 6. 10. and 14 weeks of age. Episodes of gastroenteritis caused by wild-type rotavirus during the first year of life were assessed through active follow-up surveillance and were graded with the use of the Vesikari scale.Results: A total of 4939 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the three groups; 1647 infants received two doses of the vaccine. 1651 infants received three doses of the vaccine. and 1641 received placebo. Of the 4417 infants included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis. severe rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred in 4.9% of the infants in the placebo group and in 1.9% of those in the pooled vaccine group (vaccine efficacy. 61.2%; 95% confidence interval. 44.0 to 73.2).

1278669,Understanding execution traces using massive sequence and circular bundle views,2007,Bas Cornelissen and Danny Holten and Andy Zaidman and Leon Moonen and Jarke J Van Wijk and Arie Van Deursen,,,,49-58,IEEE,The use of dynamic information to aid in software understanding is a common practice nowadays. One of the many approaches concerns the comprehension of execution traces. A major issue in this context is scalability: due to the vast amounts of information. it is a very difficult task to successfully find your way through such traces without getting lost. In this paper. we propose the use of a novel trace visualization method based on a massive sequence and circular bundle view. constructed with scalability in mind. By means of three usage scenarios that were conducted on three different software systems. we show how our approach. implemented in a tool called EXTRAVIS. is applicable to the areas of trace exploration. feature location. and feature comprehension.,True,CDTfcG4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,171,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4268240/,3286130201154659210,/scholar?cites=3286130201154659210,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leon_Moonen/publication/232639120_Understanding_Execution_Traces_Using_Massive_Sequence_and_Circular_Bundle_Views/links/0c96052b8813a05ee5000000.pdf,0,0,0

Execution trace visualization is a common approach in gaining this understanding. and among our own efforts in this context is Extravis. a tool for the visualization of large traces. While many such tools have been evaluated through case studies. there have been no quantitative evaluations to the present day. This paper reports on the first controlled experiment to quantitatively measure the added value of trace visualization for program comprehension. We designed eight typical tasks aimed at gaining an understanding of a representative subject system. and measured how a control group (using the Eclipse IDE) and an experimental group (using both Eclipse and Extravis) performed these tasks in terms of time spent and solution correctness.

1278671,Evaluating the lifespan of code smells using software repository mining,2012,Ralph Peters and Andy Zaidman,,,,411-416,IEEE,An anti-pattern is a commonly occurring solution to a recurring problem that will typically negatively impact code quality. Code smells are considered to be symptoms of anti-patterns and occur at source code level. The lifespan of code smells in a software system can be determined by mining the software repository on which the system is stored. This provides insight into the behaviour of software developers with regard to resolving code smells and anti-patterns. In a case study. we investigate the lifespan of code smells and the refactoring behaviour of developers in seven open source systems. The results of this study indicate that engineers are aware of code smells. but are not very concerned with their impact. given the low refactoring activity.,True,CDTfcG4AAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,149,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6178888/,2772345636331873070,/scholar?cites=2772345636331873070,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188671129.pdf,0,0,0

To gain insight in the nature of this co-evolution. this paper proposes three views (realized by a tool called TeMo) that combine information from a software project’s versioning system. the size of the various artifacts and the test coverage reports. We validate these views against two open source and one industrial software project and evaluate our results both with the help of log messages. code inspections and the original developers of the software system. With these views we could recognize different co-evolution scenarios (i.e.. synchronous and phased) and make relevant observations for both developers as well as test engineers.,True,CDTfcG4AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,146,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-010-9143-7,17506362125212570583,/scholar?cites=17506362125212570583,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-010-9143-7,0,0,0

Yet. at present. we have a shortfall of insight into the testing practices that are common in CI-based software development. In particular. we seek quantifiable evidence on how central testing is to the CI process. how strongly the project language influences testing. whether different integration environments are valuable and if testing on the CI can serve as a surrogate to local testing in the IDE. In an analysis of 2.640.825 Java and Ruby builds on Travis CI. we find that testing is the single most important reason why builds fail. Moreover. the programming language has a strong influence on both the number of executed tests. their run time. and proneness to fail. The use of multiple integration environments leads to 10% more failures being caught at build time.

Only in the broadest terms has there been consensus: that DSRIS involves. in some way. learning through the act of building. However. what is to be built – the definition of the DSRIS artifact – and how it is to be built – the methodology of DSRIS – has drawn increasing discussion in recent years. The relationship of DSRIS to theory continues to make up a significant part of the discussion: how theory should inform DSRIS and whether or not DSRIS can or should be instrumental in developing and refining theory. In this paper. we present the exegesis of a DSRIS research project in which creating a (prescriptive) design theory through the process of developing and testing an information systems artifact is inextricably bound to the testing and refinement of its kernel theory.,True,2AUiwBoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,651,https://orsociety.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/ejis.2008.40?src=recsys,2590475425994199578,/scholar?cites=2590475425994199578,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vijay_Vaishnavi/publication/220393130_On_theory_development_in_design_science_research_anatomy_of_a_research_project/links/02e7e5149f03e90d73000000/On-theory-development-in-design-science-research-anatomy-of-a-research-project.pdf,0,0,0

The order of nodes visited along the route has a significant impact on the quality and cost of fused data. which. in turn. impacts the main objective of the sensor network. such as target classification or tracking. We present a simplified analytical model for a distributed sensor network and formulate the route computation problem in terms of maximizing an objective function. which is directly proportional to the received signal strength and inversely proportional to the path loss and energy consumption.

1278679,A framework for theory development in design science research: multiple perspectives,2012,William Kuechler and Vijay Vaishnavi,13,Journal of the Association for Information systems,6,3,,One point of convergence in the many recent discussions on design science research in information systems (DSRIS) has been the desirability of a directive design theory (ISDT) as one of the outputs from a DSRIS project. However. the literature on theory development in DSRIS is very sparse. In this paper. we develop a framework to support theory development in DSRIS and explore its potential from multiple perspectives. The framework positions ISDT in a hierarchy of theories in IS design that includes a type of theory for describing how and why the design functions: Design-relevant explanatory/predictive theory (DREPT). DREPT formally captures the translation of general theory constructs from outside IS to the design realm. We introduce the framework from a knowledge representation perspective and then provide typological and epistemological perspectives. We begin by motivating the desirability of both directive-prescriptive theory (ISDT) and explanatory-predictive theory (DREPT) for IS design science research and practice. Since ISDT and DREPT are both. by definition. mid-range theories. we examine the notion of mid-range theory in other fields and then in the specific context of DSRIS. We position both types of theory in Gregor’s (2006) taxonomy of IS theory in our typological view of the framework. We then discuss design theory semantics from an epistemological view of the framework. relating it to an idealized design science research cycle. To demonstrate the potential of the framework for DSRIS. we use it to derive ISDT and DREPT from two published examples of DSRIS.,True,2AUiwBoAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,345,https://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol13/iss6/3/,14430083713172066943,/scholar?cites=14430083713172066943,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.348.7047&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This second edition aims to update the first by focusing on areas of research in data structures that have seen significant progress. While the discipline of data structures has not matured as rapidly as other areas of computer science. the book aims to update those areas that have seen advances. Retaining the seven-part structure of the first edition. the handbook begins with a review of introductory material. followed by a discussion of well-known classes of data structures. Priority Queues. Dictionary Structures. and Multidimensional structures. The editors next analyze miscellaneous data structures. which are well-known structures that elude easy classification. The book then addresses mechanisms and tools that were developed to facilitate the use of data structures in real programs. It concludes with an examination of the applications of data structures. Four new chapters have been added on Bloom Filters. Binary Decision Diagrams. Data Structures for Cheminformatics. and Data Structures for Big Data Stores. and updates have been made to other chapters that appeared in the first edition. The Handbook is invaluable for suggesting new ideas for research in data structures. and for revealing application contexts in which they can be deployed.

Researchers agree that. although maintenance may turn out to be easier for OO systems. it is unlikely that the maintenance burden will completely disappear. One approach to controlling software maintenance costs is the utilization of software metrics during the development phase. to help identify potential problem areas. Many new metrics have been proposed for OO systems. but only a few of them have been validated. The purpose of this research is to empirically explore the validation of three existing OO design complexity metrics and. specifically. to assess their ability to predict maintenance time.

This helps the requirements engineer develop top-level specifications of a system using the formal VDM specification language. SA then guides the stepwise refinement of the VDM specifications. The benefits of the cognitive approach include precision. unambiguity. provability. and error detection.

HIT allows health organizations to streamline many of their processes and provide services in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. The latest technological trends such as Cloud Computing (CC) provide a strong infrastructure and offer a true enabler for HIT services over the Internet. This can be achieved on a pay-as-you-use model of the “e-Health Cloud” to help the healthcare industry cope with current and future demands yet keeping their costs to a minimum. Despite its great potential. HIT as a CC model has not been addressed extensively in the literature. There are no apparent frameworks which clearly encompass all viable schemes and interrelationships between HIT and CC. Therefore. analyzing and comparing the effectiveness of such schemes is important. In this paper we introduce the concept of “e-Health Cloud” highlighting many of its constituents and proposing building an e-health environment and elucidating many of the challenges confronting the success of the e-Health Cloud. We will also discuss different possible solutions to address challenges such as security and privacy.

1279884,The UML as a formal modeling notation,1998,Andy Evans and Robert France and Kevin Lano and Bernhard Rumpe,,,,336-348,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is rapidly emerging as a de-facto standard for modelling OO systems. Given this role. it is imperative that the UML needs a well-defined. fully explored semantics. Such semantics is required in order to ensure that UML concepts are precisely stated and defined. In this paper we motivate an approach to formalizing UML in which formal specification techniques are used to gain insight into the semantics of UML notations and diagrams and describe a roadmap for this approach. The authors initiated the Precise UML (PUML) group in order to develop a precise semantic model for UML diagrams. The semantic model is to be used as the basis for a set of diagrammatical transformation rules. which enable formal deductions to be made about UML diagrams. A small example shows how these rules can be used to verify whether one class diagram is a valid deduction of …,True,JL7C3nMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,348,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-48480-6_26,6939218738268119391,/scholar?cites=6939218738268119391,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6919,0,0,0

1279886,The UML as a formal modeling notation,1998,Robert France and Andy Evans and Kevin Lano and Bernhard Rumpe,19,Computer Standards & Interfaces,7,325-334,North-Holland,The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is an Object Management Group (OMG) object-oriented (OO) modeling notation standard. It consists of a set of notations for modeling systems from a variety of views and at varying levels of abstraction. While the UML reflects some of the best OO modeling experiences available. it suffers from a lack of precise semantics that is necessary if one is to use the notations to precisely model systems and to rigorously reason about the models. In this paper we discuss some of the problems with the current UML semantic document and present the approach that the precise UML group (pUML) group is using to develop a precise semantics for the UML. The approach utilizes mathematical techniques to explore and gain insights into appropriate semantics for UML modeling concepts. The insights and formal expressions will then be used to develop a UML semantics document written in …,True,JL7C3nMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,244,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920548998000208,1026838878779223888,/scholar?cites=1026838878779223888,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.5.4898&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1279893,Meta-modelling semantics of UML,1999,Andy Evans and Robert France and Kevin Lano and Bernhard Rumpe,,,,45-60,Springer. Boston. MA,The Unified Modelling Language is emerging as a de-facto standard for modelling object-oriented systems. However. the semantics document that a part of the standard definition primarily provides a description of the language’s syntax and well-formedness rules. The meaning of the language. which is mainly described in English. is too informal and unstructured to provide a foundation for developing formal analysis and development techniques. This paper outlines a formalisation strategy for making precise the core semantics of UML. This is achieved by strengthening the denotational semantics of the existing UML metamodel. To illustrate the approach. the semantics of generalization/specialization are made precise.,True,JL7C3nMAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,83,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-5229-1_4,4841381607450410748,/scholar?cites=4841381607450410748,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6917,0,0,0

The language has been developed by Grady Booch. James Rumbaugh and Ivar Jacobson as a synthesis of their well known object-oriented methods and also combines a number of ideas from other methods and description techniques such as Harel Statecharts. UML is rapidly becoming an important industry standard for modelling software systems. Recently. UML version 1.1 has been accepted by the the Object Management Group as a standard notation for object-oriented analysis and design.Like other software engineeringmethods' UML provides a set of graphical and textual modelling techniques that aim to be understandable to system developers and customers. Each technique is used to model the system from a number of different perspectives. For example. class diagrams are used to model static (data) properties sequence diagrams are used to model flow of messages between objects.

It typically represents a massive economic investment and is critical to the mission of the organization it serves. As such systems age. they become increasingly complex and brittle. and hence harder to maintain. They also become even more critical to the survival of their organization because the business rules encoded within the system are seldom documented elsewhere.Our research is concerned with developing a suite of tools to aid the maintainers of legacy systems in recovering the knowledge embodied within the system. The activities. known collectively as “program understanding”. are essential preludes for several key processes. including maintenance and design recovery for reengineering.In this paper we present three pattern-matching techniques …,True,gNZOUUAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,370,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00126960,14553777707224731206,/scholar?cites=14553777707224731206,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48187195/Pattern_Matching_for_Clone_and_Concept_D20160819-14858-gkk3b4.pdf,0,0,0

Nevertheless. these systems are mature. heavily used. and constitute massive corporate assets. Migrating such systems to modern platforms is a significant challenge due to the loss of information over time.

Nevertheless. such practice produces duplicated pieces of code or clones whose consistent maintenance might be difficult to achieve. It also creates implicit links between classes sharing a functionality. Clones are therefore good candidates for system redesign. This paper presents a novel approach for computer-aided clone-based object-oriented system refactoring. The approach is based on an advanced clone analysis which focuses on the extraction of clone differences and their interpretation in terms of programming language entities. It also focuses on the study of contextual dependencies of cloned methods.

1279900,Towards portable source code representations using XML,2000,Evan Mamas and Kostas Kontogiannis,,,,172-182,IEEE,One of the most important issues in source code analysis and software re-engineering is the representation of software code text at an abstraction level and form suitable for algorithmic processing. However. source code representation schemes must be compact. accessible by well defined application programming interfaces (APIs) and above all portable to different operating platforms and various CASE tools. This paper proposes a program representation technique that is based on language domain modes and the XML markup language. In this context. source code is represented as XML DOM trees that offer a higher level of openness and portability than custom-made tool specific abstract syntax trees. The DOM trees can be exchanged between tools in textual or binary form. Similarly the domain model allows for language entities to be associated with analysis services offered by various CASE tools. leading to …,True,gNZOUUAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,143,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/891464/,7607901895786860519,/scholar?cites=7607901895786860519,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.6173&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1279911,Dependability modeling and evaluation of software fault-tolerant systems,1990,Jean Arlat and Karama Kanoun and J-C Laprie,39,IEEE Transactions on Computers,4,504-513,IEEE,Dependability modeling and evaluation (encompassing reliability and safety issues) of the two major fault tolerance software approaches-recovery blocks (RBs) and N version programming (NVP)-are presented. The study is based on the detailed analysis of software fault-tolerance architectures able to tolerate a single fault (RB: two alternates and an acceptance test; NVP: three versions and a decider). For each approach a detailed model based on the software production process is established and then simplified by assuming that only a single fault type may manifest during execution of the fault-tolerant software and that no error compensation may take place within the software. The analytical results obtained make it possible to identify the improvement. compared to a non-fault-tolerant software. that could result from the use of RB (the acceptance test has to be more reliable from the alternates) and NVP (related …,True,mYGSq2EAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,139,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/54843/,11333992250423774592,/scholar?cites=11333992250423774592,,,https://hal.laas.fr/hal-01978863/document,0,0,0

The SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) has proved to be efficient for architectural modeling. We present a modeling framework allowing the generation of dependability-oriented analytical models from AADL models. to facilitate the evaluation of dependability measures. such as reliability or availability. We propose a stepwise approach for system dependability modeling using AADL.

A method is presented that allows existing models to provide better predictions since they are applied to data displaying trends in accordance with their assumptions. The method is based largely on the analysis of the trend exhibited by the data collected on the program. which is determined by reliability growth tests. Reliability data then are partitioned according to the trend. Two types of reliability growth models can be applied: 1. When the data exhibit reliability decrease followed by reliability growth. an S-shaped model can be applied. 2. In case of reliability growth. most other reliability growth models can be applied.

In a first experiment. a set of real software faults has been compared with faults injected by a SWIFI tool (Xception) to evaluate the accuracy of the injected faults. Results revealed the limitations of Xception (and other SWIFI tools) in the emulation of different classes of software faults (about 44% of the software faults cannot be emulated). The use of field data about real faults was discussed and software metrics were suggested as an alternative to guide the injection process when field data is nor available. In a second experiment. a set of rules for the injection of errors meant to emulate classes of software faults was evaluated.

If until a year ago. the concern revolved around migrating legacy systems to Web-based settings. today we have a new challenge of migrating Web applications to single-page Ajax applications. Gaining an understanding of the navigational model and user interface structure of the source application is the first step in the migration process. In this paper. we explore how reverse engineering techniques can help analyze classic Web applications for this purpose. Our approach. using a schema-based clustering technique. extracts a navigational model of Web applications. and identifies candidate user interface components to be migrated to a single-page Ajax interface …,True,6CdatVEAAAAJ:ndLnGcHYRF0C,175,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4145036/,13545371966314644218,/scholar?cites=13545371966314644218,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610094,0,0,0

This not only makes them fundamentally different from traditional web applications. but also more error-prone and harder to test. We propose a method for testing Ajax applications automatically. based on a crawler to infer a state-flow graph for all (client-side) user interface states. We identify Ajax-specific faults that can occur in such states (related to. e.g.. DOM validity. error messages. discoverability. back-button compatibility) as well as DOM-tree invariants that can serve as oracles to detect such faults. Our approach. called Atusa. is implemented in a tool offering generic invariant checking components. a plugin-mechanism to add application-specific state validators. and generation of a test suite covering the paths obtained during crawling.

1279935,A comparison of push and pull techniques for ajax,2007,Engin Bozdag and Ali Mesbah and Arie Van Deursen,,,,15-22,IEEE,AJAX applications are designed to have high user interactivity and low user-perceived latency. Real-time dynamic Web data such as news headlines. stock tickers. and auction updates need to be propagated to the users as soon as possible. However. AJAX still suffers from the limitations of the Web's request/response architecture which prevents servers from pushing real-time dynamic web data. Such applications usually use a pull style to obtain the latest updates. where the client actively requests the changes based on a predefined interval. It is possible to overcome this limitation by adopting a push style of interaction where the server broadcasts data when a change occurs on the server side. Both these options have their own trade-offs. This paper explores the fundamental limits of browser-based applications and analyzes push solutions for AJAX technology. It also shows the results of an empirical study …,True,6CdatVEAAAAJ:_tF6a-HnqWAC,157,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4380239/,13659284641966660387,/scholar?cites=13659284641966660387,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.3984,0,0,0

These techniques exploit the correlations between program failures and the coverage of program entities as the clue in locating faults. Experimental evidence shows that the effectiveness of these techniques can be affected adversely by coincidental correctness. which occurs when a fault is executed but no failure is detected. In this paper. we propose an approach to address this problem. We refine code coverage of test runs using control- and data-flow patterns prescribed by different fault types. We conjecture that this extra information. which we call context patterns. can strengthen the correlations between program failures and the coverage of faulty program entities. making it easier for fault localization techniques to locate the faults.

This gives rise to the problem of context inconsistency. which must be timely detected in order to prevent applications from behaving anomalously.

Tools such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) can be used to extract a set of independent topics from a corpus of commit-log comments. Previous work in the area has created a single set of topics by analyzing comments from the entire lifetime of the project. In this paper. we propose windowing the topic analysis to give a more nuanced view of the system's evolution. By using a defined time-window of. for example. one month …,True,vuT1ZlUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,125,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5306310/,16877244848865599593,/scholar?cites=16877244848865599593,,,http://maveric0.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/papers/2009/icsm09-abram.pdf,0,0,0

In this work. we seek to automatically classify large changes into various categories of maintenance tasks - corrective. adaptive. perfective. feature addition. and non-functional improvement - using machine learning techniques. In a previous paper. we found that many commits could be classified easily and reliably based solely on the manual analysis of the commit metadata and commit messages (i.e.. without reference to the source code). Our extension is the automation of classification by training machine learners on features extracted from the commit metadata. such as the word distribution of a commit message. commit author. and modules modified. We validated the results of the learners via 10-fold cross validation. which achieved accuracies consistently above 50%. indicating …,True,vuT1ZlUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,122,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5090025/,5812502699677202024,/scholar?cites=5812502699677202024,,,https://cormack.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/papers/2009/icpc09-abram.pdf,0,0,0

Although the semantics and subset of statecharts used in each approach varies considerably. along with the model checkers and their specification languages. most approaches rely on translating the hierarchical structure into the flat representation of the input language of the model checker. This makes model checking difficult to scale to industrial models. as the state space grows exponentially with flattening. We look at current approaches to model checking hierarchical structures and find that their semantics is significantly different from statecharts.

It provides a clean API for communicating an event stream to back-end analyses. where each event describes some operation of interest performed by the target program. such as accessing memory. synchronizing on a lock. forking a new thread. and so on.

1280023,A type system for object initialization in the Java bytecode language,1998,Stephen N Freund and John C Mitchell,33,ACM SIGPLAN Notices,10,310-327,ACM,In the standard Java implementation. a Java language program is compiled to Java bytecode. This bytecode may be sent across the network to another site. where it is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine. Since bytecode may be written by hand. or corrupted during network transmission. the Java Virtual Machine contains a bytecode verifier that performs a number of consistency checks before code is interpreted. As illustrated by previous attacks on the Java Virtual Machine. these tests. which include type correctness. are critical for system security. In order to analyze existing bytecode verifiers and to understand the properties that should be verified. we develop a precise specification of statically-correct Java bytecode. in the form of a type system. Our focus in this paper is a subset of the bytecode language dealing with object creation and initialization.

Heidelberg,Ensuring the reliability of multithreaded software systems is difficult due to the interaction between threads. This paper describes the design and implementation of a static checker for such systems. To avoid considering all possible thread interleavings. the checker uses assumeguarantee reasoning. and relies on the programmer to specify an environment assumption that constrains the interaction between threads. Using this environment assumption. the checker reduces the verification of the original multithreaded program to the verification of several sequential programs. one for each thread. These sequential programs are subsequently analyzed using extended static checking techniques (based on verification conditions and automatic theorem proving). Experience indicates that the checker is capable of handling a range of synchronization disciplines.

Moreover. even after the root cause of a bug is identified. fixing the bug is non-trivial. Given this situation. automated program repair methods are of value. In this paper. we present an automated repair method based on symbolic execution. constraint solving and program synthesis. In our approach. the requirement on the repaired code to pass a given set of tests is formulated as a constraint. Such a constraint is then solved by iterating over a layered space of repair expressions. layered by the complexity of the repair code.

To reduce the cost of bug identification. we locate expressions that are likely causes of bugs and thus candidates for repair. Our symbolic method approximates an ideal approach to fixing bugs mechanically. which is to search the space of all edits to the program for one that repairs the failing test without breaking any passing test. We approximate the expensive ideal of exploring syntactic edits by instead computing the set of values whose substitution for the expression corrects the execution. We observe that an expression is a repair candidate if it can be replaced with a value that fixes a failing test and in each passing test. its value can be changed to another value without breaking the test. The latter condition makes the expression flexible in that it permits multiple values.

Versioning systems such as CVS or subversion store only snapshots of text files. leading to a loss of information: The exact sequence of changes between two versions is hard to recover. In this paper we present an alternative information repository which stores incremental changes to the system under study. retrieved from the IDE used to build the software.

Clarke and Alex Groce and Somesh Jha and Helmut Veith,30,"Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",6,388-402,IEEE,We present a new methodology for automatic verification of C programs against finite state machine specifications. Our approach is compositional. naturally enabling us to decompose the verification of large software systems into subproblems of manageable complexity. The decomposition reflects the modularity in the software design. We use weak simulation as the notion of conformance between the program and its specification. Following the counterexample guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) paradigm. our tool MAGIC first extracts a finite model from C source code using predicate abstraction and theorem proving.

Such inconsistencies can be the result of modeling errors or recent modifications of the system. Despite such discrepancies we can still attempt to perform automatic verification. In fact. as we show. we can sometimes exploit the verification results to assist in automatically learning the required updates to the model. In a related previous work. we have suggested the idea of black box checking. where verification starts without any model. and the model is obtained while repeated verification attempts are performed.

1280054,Code coverage for suite evaluation by developers,2014,Rahul Gopinath and Carlos Jensen and Alex Groce,,,,72-82,,One of the key challenges of developers testing code is determining a test suite's quality--its ability to find faults. The most common approach is to use code coverage as a measure for test suite quality. and diminishing returns in coverage or high absolute coverage as a stopping rule. In testing research. suite quality is often evaluated by a suite's ability to kill mutants (artificially seeded potential faults). Determining which criteria best predict mutation kills is critical to practical estimation of test suite quality. Previous work has only used small sets of programs. and usually compares multiple suites for a single program. Practitioners. however. seldom compare suites---they evaluate one suite. Using suites (both manual and automatically generated) from a large set of real-world open-source projects shows that evaluation results differ from those for suite-comparison: statement (not block. branch. or path) coverage predicts …,True,ewrrvq8AAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,136,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2568225.2568278,12662680685619111355,/scholar?cites=12662680685619111355,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1065.7165&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In this paper we present an array of heuristic model checking techniques for combating the state space explosion when searching for errors.

Specifically. we investigate the applicability of cross-company (CC) data for building localized defect predictors using static code features.

Then we apply principles of analogy-based learning (i.e. nearest neighbor (NN) filtering) to CC data. in order to fine tune these models for localization. We compare the performance of these models with that of defect predictors learned from within-company (WC) data.

1280069,Software effort estimation using machine learning methods,2007,Bilge Baskeles and Burak Turhan and Ayse Bener,,,,1-6,IEEE,In software engineering. the main aim is to develop projects that produce the desired results within limited schedule and budget. The most important factor affecting the budget of a project is the effort. Therefore. estimating effort is crucial because hiring people more than needed leads to a loss of income and hiring people less than needed leads to an extension of schedule. The main objective of this research is making an analysis of software effort estimation to overcome problems related to it: budget and schedule extension. To accomplish this. we propose a model that uses machine learning methods. We evaluate these models on public datasets and data gathered from software organizations in Turkey. It is found out in the experiments that the best method for a dataset may change and this proves the point that the usage of one model cannot always produce the best results.,True,I17PkbUAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,83,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4456863/,14722970572644262883,/scholar?cites=14722970572644262883,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Burak_Turhan/publication/4321088_Software_effort_estimation_using_machine_learning_methods/links/54e79cfa0cf25ba91c799120.pdf,0,0,0

Software testing is the most time-consuming and costly project phase. specifically in the embedded software domain. Misclassifying a safe code as defective increases the cost of projects. and hence leads to low margins. In this research. we present a defect prediction model based on an ensemble of classifiers. We have collaborated with an industrial partner from the embedded systems domain. We use our generic defect prediction models with data coming from embedded projects. The embedded systems domain is similar to mission critical software so that the goal is to catch as many defects as possible. Therefore. the expectation from a predictor is to get very high probability of detection (pd). On the other hand. most embedded systems in practice are commercial products …,True,I17PkbUAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,79,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-010-9128-1,4008520389205302111,/scholar?cites=4008520389205302111,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayse_Bener/publication/220635847_An_industrial_case_study_of_classifier_ensembles_for_locating_software_defects/links/02bfe5141f46abfdbf000000/An-industrial-case-study-of-classifier-ensembles-for-locating-software-defects.pdf,0,0,0

MA,A common problem that management faces in software companies is the high instability of their staff. In libre (free. open source) software projects. the permanence of developers is also an open issue. with the potential of causing problems amplified by the self-organizing nature that most of them exhibit. Hence. human resources in libre software projects are even more difficult to manage: developers are in most cases not bound by a contract and. in addition. there is not a real management structure concerned about this problem. This raises some interesting questions with respect to the composition of development teams in libre software projects. and how they evolve over time.

However. few efforts have been devoted to perform studies by integrating data from various repositories. with different kinds of information. which would. for instance. track the different activities of developers. One of the main problems of these multi-repository studies is the different identities that developers use when they interact with different tools in different contexts. This makes them appear as different entities when data is mined from different repositories (and in some cases. even from a single one).

1280091,Reconciling manual and automatic refactoring,2012,Xi Ge and Quinton L DuBose and Emerson Murphy-Hill,,,,211-221,IEEE,Although useful and widely available. refactoring tools are underused. One cause of this underuse is that a developer sometimes fails to recognize that she is going to refactor before she begins manually refactoring. To address this issue. we conducted a formative study of developers' manual refactoring process. suggesting that developers' reliance on “chasing error messages” when manually refactoring is an error-prone manual refactoring strategy. Additionally. our study distilled a set of manual refactoring workflow patterns. Using these patterns. we designed a novel refactoring tool called BeneFactor. BeneFactor detects a developer's manual refactoring. reminds her that automatic refactoring is available. and can complete her refactoring automatically. By alleviating the burden of recognizing manual refactoring. BeneFactor is designed to help solve the refactoring tool underuse problem.,True,9Kk7PNQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,124,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6227192/,168695022318484250,/scholar?cites=168695022318484250,,,,0,0,0

1280098,Analyzing security requirements as relationships among strategic actors,2002,Eric Yu Lin Liu and John Mylopoulos,,,,,,Security issues for software systems ultimately concern relationships among social actors–stakeholders. users. potential attackers. etc.--and software acting on their behalf. In assessing vulnerabilities and mitigation measures. actors make strategic decisions to achieve desired levels of security while trading off competing requirements such as costs. performance. usability and so on. This paper explores the explicit modeling of relationships among strategic actors in order to elicit. identify and analyze security requirements. In particular. actor dependency analysis helps in the identification of attackers and their potential threats. while actor goal analysis helps to elicit the dynamic decision making process of system players for security issues. Patterns of relationships at various levels of abstraction (eg intentional dependencies among abstract roles) can be studied separately. These patterns can be selectively applied and combined for analyzing specific system configurations. The approach is particularly suitable for new Internet applications where layers of software entities and human roles interact to create complex security challenges.

Syntax errors constitute one of the largest classes of errors (34%) in our dataset of student submissions obtained from a MOOC course on edX. The previous techniques for generating automated feed-back on programming assignments have focused on functional correctness and style considerations of student programs. These techniques analyze the program AST of the program and then perform some dynamic and symbolic analyses to compute repair feedback. Unfortunately. it is not possible to generate ASTs for student pro-grams with syntax errors and therefore the previous feedback techniques are not applicable in repairing syntax errors.We present a technique for providing feedback on syntax errors that uses Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model syntactically valid token sequences. Our approach is inspired from the recent work on learning language models from Big Code (large code corpus). For a given programming assignment. we first learn an RNN to model all valid token sequences using the set of syntactically correct student submissions. Then. for a student submission with syntax errors. we query the learnt RNN model with the prefix to-ken sequence to predict token sequences that can fix the error by either replacing or inserting the predicted token sequence at the error location. We evaluate our technique on over 14. 000 student submissions with syntax errors. Our technique can completely re-pair 31.69%(4501/14203) of submissions with syntax errors and in addition partially correct 6.39%(908/14203 …,True,5kVcNS4AAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC,283,https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06129,1487192425465168052,/scholar?cites=1487192425465168052,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06129,0,0,0

Recently. two competing approaches forautomatic program learning’have received significant attention:(1)neural program synthesis’. where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program. and (2)neural program induction’. where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation. Here. for the first time. we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale. real-world learning task and we additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis. which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs. which achieve 92\% accuracy on a real-world test set. compared to the 34\% accuracy of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a comparable induction model on this task. but we more importantly demonstrate that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user application. Finally. we show that we can train our neural models to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (eg. typos). while a highly-engineered rule-based system fails entirely.,True,5kVcNS4AAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC,230,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/devlin17a,3655548984351937652,/scholar?cites=3655548984351937652,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/devlin17a/devlin17a.pdf,0,0,0

While achieving impressive results. these approaches have a number of important limitations:(a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train.(b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately. and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper. we propose a novel technique. Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis. to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained. our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module. called the cross correlation I/O network. given a set of input-output examples. produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module. the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN). given the continuous representation of the examples. synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples. but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.,True,5kVcNS4AAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC,211,https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01855,1978557704933459244,/scholar?cites=1978557704933459244,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01855,0,0,0
1280112,Learning semantic string transformations from examples,2012,Rishabh Singh and Sumit Gulwani,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1204.6079,,,,We address the problem of performing semantic transformations on strings. which may represent a variety of data types (or their combination) such as a column in a relational table. time. date. currency. etc. Unlike syntactic transformations. which are based on regular expressions and which interpret a string as a sequence of characters. semantic transformations additionally require exploiting the semantics of the data type represented by the string. which may be encoded as a database of relational tables. Manually performing such transformations on a large collection of strings is error prone and cumbersome. while programmatic solutions are beyond the skill-set of end-users. We present a programming by example technology that allows end-users to automate such repetitive tasks. We describe an expressive transformation language for semantic manipulation that combines table lookup operations and syntactic manipulations. We then present a synthesis algorithm that can learn all transformations in the language that are consistent with the user-provided set of input-output examples. We have implemented this technology as an add-in for the Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet system and have evaluated it successfully over several benchmarks picked from various Excel help-forums.,True,5kVcNS4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,124,https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6079,16780827393360303391,/scholar?cites=16780827393360303391,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6079,0,0,0
1280113,Programmatically interpretable reinforcement learning,2018,Abhinav Verma and Vijayaraghavan Murali and Rishabh Singh and Pushmeet Kohli and Swarat Chaudhuri,,,,5045-5054,PMLR,We present a reinforcement learning framework. called Programmatically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning (PIRL). that is designed to generate interpretable and verifiable agent policies. Unlike the popular Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) paradigm. which represents policies by neural networks. PIRL represents policies using a high-level. domain-specific programming language. Such programmatic policies have the benefits of being more easily interpreted than neural networks. and being amenable to verification by symbolic methods. We propose a new method. called Neurally Directed Program Search (NDPS). for solving the challenging nonsmooth optimization problem of finding a programmatic policy with maximal reward. NDPS works by first learning a neural policy network using DRL. and then performing a local search over programmatic policies that seeks to minimize a distance from this neural “oracle”. We evaluate NDPS on the task of learning to drive a simulated car in the TORCS car-racing environment. We demonstrate that NDPS is able to discover human-readable policies that pass some significant performance bars. We also show that PIRL policies can have smoother trajectories. and can be more easily transferred to environments not encountered during training. than corresponding policies discovered by DRL.,True,5kVcNS4AAAAJ:-6RzNnnwWf8C,114,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/verma18a.html,13646255682604631153,/scholar?cites=13646255682604631153,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/verma18a/verma18a.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,As the UMLattempts to make the transition from a single. albeit extensible. language to a framework for a family of languages. the nature and form of the underlying meta-modeling architecture will assume growing importance. It is generally recognized that without a simple. clean and intuitive theory of how metamodel levels are created and related to one another. the UML2.0 vision of a coherent family of languages with a common core set of concepts will remain elusive. However. no entirely satisfactory metamodeling approach has yet been found. Current (meta-)modeling theories used or proposed for the UML all have at least one fundamental problem that makes them unsuitable in their present form.

As model-driven development moves to the center stage of software engineering. it is particularly important that this principle be applied to the technologies used to create and manipulate models. especially models that are intended to be free of solution decisions.

The techniques are based on the KAOS goal-oriented method for requirements engineering. This method consists in identifying goals and refining them into subgoals until the latter can be assigned as responsibilities of single agents such as humans. devices and software. Domain properties and assumptions about the software environment are also used during the goal refinement process. The method supports the exploration of alternative goal refinements and alternative responsibility assignments of goals to agents. It also supports the identification and resolution of conflicts between goals. and the identification and resolution of exceptional agent behaviors. called obstacles. that violate goals and assumptions produced during the goal refinement process. The thesis enriches the KAOS framework through three kinds of techniques:(a) techniques for identifying agents. goal refinements. and alternative responsibility assignments. and for deriving agent interfaces from such responsibility assignments;(b) techniques for deriving operational requirements from goal specifications;(c) techniques for generating obstacles to the satisfaction of idealized goals and assumptions. and for generating alternative obstacle resolutions.

1280155,Enabling Efficient and Scalable Hybrid Memories Using Fine-Granularity DRAM Cache Management,2012,Justin Meza and Jichuan Chang and HanBin Yoon and Onur Mutlu and Parthasarathy Ranganathan,,IEEE Computer Architecture Letters (CAL),,,,Hybrid main memories composed of DRAM as a cache to scalable non-volatile memories such as phase-change memory (PCM) can provide much larger storage capacity than traditional main memories. A key challenge for enabling high-performance and scalable hybrid memories. though. is efficiently managing the metadata (e.g.. tags) for data cached in DRAM at a fine granularity. Based on the observation that storing metadata off-chip in the same row as their data exploits DRAM row buffer locality. this paper reduces the overhead of fine-granularity DRAM caches by only caching the metadata for recently accessed rows on-chip using a small buffer. Leveraging the flexibility and efficiency of such a fine-granularity DRAM cache. we also develop an adaptive policy to choose the best granularity when migrating data into DRAM. On a hybrid memory with a 512MB DRAM cache. our proposal using an 8KB on-chip …,True,V0cByTkAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC,173,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6172197/,6427868529024390210,/scholar?cites=6427868529024390210,,,https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/journal_contribution/Enabling_Efficient_and_Scalable_Hybrid_Memories_Using_Fine-Granularity_DRAM_Cache_Management/6468734/files/11897288.pdf,0,0,0
1280156,Using gauges for architecture-based monitoring and adaptation,2001,David Garlan and Bradley Schmerl and Jichuan Chang,34,Working Conference on Complex and Dynamic Systems Architecture,,,,{An increasingly important requirement for complex systems is the capability to adapt at runtime in order to accommodate variable resources. system errors. and changing requirements. An essential aspect of adaptation is the ability to observe a system's runtime behavior and interpret those observations in terms that permit a high-level understanding of the system's status. In this paper we describe mechanisms for monitoring a running system. interpreting monitored data in terms of the system's architecture. and analyzing the system architecture to ascertain if the system's runtime behavior fits within the envelope of acceptable behavior. We illustrate the use of these mechanisms for the important special case of system performance monitoring.}.,True,V0cByTkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,168,https://acme.able.cs.cmu.edu/pubs/basket.php?fc=dwn&year=2001,2764004081320192242,/scholar?cites=2764004081320192242,,,https://acme.able.cs.cmu.edu/pubs/basket.php?fc=dwn&year=2001,0,0,0
1280157,System-level implications of disaggregated memory,2012,Kevin Lim and Yoshio Turner and Jose Renato Santos and Alvin AuYoung and Jichuan Chang and Parthasarathy Ranganathan and Thomas F Wenisch,,,,1-12,IEEE,Recent research on memory disaggregation introduces a new architectural building block — the memory blade — as a cost-effective approach for memory capacity expansion and sharing for an ensemble of blade servers. Memory blades augment blade servers' local memory capacity with a second-level (remote) memory that can be dynamically apportioned among blades in response to changing capacity demand. albeit at a higher access latency. In this paper. we build on the prior research to explore the software and systems implications of disaggregated memory. We develop a software-based prototype by extending the Xen hypervisor to emulate a disaggregated memory design wherein remote pages are swapped into local memory on-demand upon access. Our prototyping effort reveals that low-latency remote memory calls for a different regime of replacement policies than conventional disk paging. favoring …,True,V0cByTkAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C,151,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6168955/,9629764965855684110,/scholar?cites=9629764965855684110,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Wenisch/publication/254021761_System-level_implications_of_disaggregated_memory/links/5460d02a0cf27487b4525ffe.pdf,0,0,0

To understand how this"" natural product evolution"" happens. we have conducted a case study of four typical OSS projects. Unlike most previous studies on software evolution that focus on the evolution of the system per se. our study takes a broader perspective: It examines not only the evolution of OSS systems. but also the evolution of the associated OSS communities. as well as the relationship between the two types of evolution. Through the case study. we have found that while collaborative development within a community is the essential characteristic of OSS. different collaboration models exist. and that the difference in collaboration model results in different evolution patterns of OSS systems and communities.

1280161,Embedding critics in design environments,1993,GERRY STAHL and G Fischer and K Nakakoji and J Ostwald and T Sumner,8,The knowledge engineering review,4,285-307,,Human understanding in design evolves through a process of critiquing existing knowledge and consequently expanding the store of design knowledge. Critiquing is a dialogue in which the interjection of a reasoned opinion about a product or action triggers further reflection on or changes to the artifact being designed. Our work has focused on applying this successful human critiquing paradigm to human-computer interaction. We argue that computer-based critiquing systems are most effective when they are embedded in domain-oriented design environments. which are knowledge-based computer systems that support designers in specifying a problem and constructing a solution. Embedded critics playa number of important roles in such design environments:(1) they increase the designer's understanding of design situations by pointing out problematic situations early in the design process;(2) they support the integration of problem framing and problem solving by providing a linkage between the design specification and the design construction; and (3) they help designers access relevant information in the large information spaces provided by the design environment. Three embedded critiquing mechanisms-generic. specific. and interpretive critics-are presented. and their complementary roles within the design environment architecture are described.,True,f_o47_0AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,254,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.310.8526&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5146337569776318304,/scholar?cites=5146337569776318304,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.310.8526&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. current user interfaces do not cleanly support creating alternatives at a time when they are likely to be discovered: as users interactively modify data. This paper presents Parallel Paths. a novel model of interaction that facilitates generating. manipulating. and comparing alternative solutions. In contrast to existing approaches such as automated history capture tools. Parallel Paths emphasizes the active. simultaneous development of multiple. alternative solutions. We demonstrate this model of interaction in Parallel Pies. a user interface mechanism developed for image manipulation tasks that allows users to: easily create solution alternatives as they interact with a command; embed the alternatives in the same workspace; manipulate the alternatives independently or simultaneously as if they were the same …,True,f_o47_0AAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,160,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/985692.985782,10297425646950719341,/scholar?cites=10297425646950719341,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.91.9643&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
