1121024,Polymorphism in the pharmaceutical industry,2006,Rolf Hilfiker,308,,,,Wiley-Vch,The way in which the pharmaceutical industry is approaching technical development has evolved very much in the recent years. Fresh concepts coming from other industries have been introduced with the desire to push for a more science and risk-based development approach throughout the product life cycle. Quality by design (QbD) in the pharmaceutical industry is an outcome of the efforts to harmonize development quality concepts and understandings by regulatory agencies and resulted in the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) guidelines Q8 [1]. Q9 [2]. Q10 [3]. Q11 [4]. and Q12 [5]. Although first devised for pharmaceutical development (Q8). the QbD concepts and related tools were rapidly recognized as being very helpful for chemical development. A result of this process was the Q11 guideline that provides guidance for drug substance as defined in the scope of the ICH guideline Q6A [6](this …,True,sGCUZVoAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,881,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527697847,2157438927511538865,/scholar?cites=2157438927511538865,,,0,0,0
1121025,Facts and fictions about polymorphism,2015,Aurora J Cruz-Cabeza and Susan M Reutzel-Edens and Joel Bernstein,44,,23,8619-8635,Royal Society of Chemistry,We present new facts about polymorphism based on (i) crystallographic data from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD. a database built over 50 years of community effort). (ii) 229 solid form screens conducted at Hoffmann-La Roche and Eli Lilly and Company over the course of 8+ and 15+ years respectively and (iii) a dataset of 446 polymorphic crystals with energies and properties computed with modern DFT-d methods. We found that molecular flexibility or size has no correlation with the ability of a compound to be polymorphic. Chiral molecules. however. were found to be less prone to polymorphism than their achiral counterparts and compounds able to hydrogen bond exhibit only a slightly higher propensity to polymorphism than those which do not.

The rates of phase transformation from a mixture of two phases to a pure cocrystal phase vary from minutes to weeks depending on grinding efficiency and vapor pressure of the components. A typical exampleinvolves the formation of cocrystals of 2-aminopyrimidine with carboxylic acids where the acid and pyrimidine molecules form hydrogen bonds to one another. 2 Here we report that 9-methyladenine (A) and 1-methylthymine (T) also form cocrystals in the solid state by grinding pure A and pure T together and that the A and T molecules in the cocrystal are associated as Hoogsteen base pairs.

The preferred molecular conformations observed in several polymorphic systems are correlated with the nature of the forces present in the crystals. The reduction of crystallization tendency for conformationally flexible molecules arises from the presence of multiple conformers in the crystallizing media and the need for certain molecules to crystallize in high-energy conformations. Despite their peculiarities. the control of crystallization of conformationally flexible molecules should begin with traditional approaches applicable to most crystallization situations.

The School was held on June 7–17. 2007. in Erice (an old town. over 3000 years. located on the top of a Sicilian hill that oversees the sea near Trapani). The school developed following two parallel lines. First we established “where we are” in terms of modelling. design. synthesis and applications of crystalline solids with predefined properties. Second. we attempted to define current and possible futuristic lines of development in the quest for novel molecule-based materials with potential applications in magnetism. conductivity and superconductivity. non-lineal optics (NLO). drug delivery. and nanotechnology. In recent years. solid state chemistry and crystal engineering have evolved at the intersection between the top-down and bottom-up approaches towards materials design and fabrication. An ever-increasing number of scientists are learning how to control self-assembly. molecular recognition. and other fundamental processes on the way to achieving ‘tailor-made’materials. such as crystal nucleation. crystal growth. and polymorphism.,True,sGCUZVoAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,39,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xh4YYoKet00C&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=info:Sy3r8_tx--UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=gjJCWpo56m&sig=BJ0XW9cxTfpH1jiIMbntp9eHd0M,16571964580782878027,/scholar?cites=16571964580782878027,,,0,0,0

KGaA Weinheim. Germany,Attempts have been made to classify hygroscopic behaviors based on data obtained from adsorption isotherms. ie. the curves obtained by plotting the weight change of a sample versus the relative humidity (RH) or water vapor pressure. The shape of the isotherm is determined by the specific conditions for adsorption onto a surface. such as pore size and heats of adsorption. The common isotherm classification types (I–V) are relevant to any adsorbate. including water. and are summarized in Fig. 9.1. It has been theorized that the isotherm of a “hygroscopic solid” should resemble a Type II isotherm where multilayer adsorption occurs [6]. Giles [7] proposes class H. L. C. and S curves for adsorption based on the slope of the initial portion of the isotherm. with L curves indicative of Langmuir isotherms. Adsorption isotherms may be classified; however. there remains no universally accepted definition for hygroscopicity …,True,sGCUZVoAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,35,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/3527607889#page=248,6859706451900177433,/scholar?cites=6859706451900177433,,,0,0,0

These crystal forms have been characterized using FTIR and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. single crystal X-ray analysis. and differential scanning calorimetry. The stability relationship of the racemic polymorphs has been established as enantiotropic. with form II being low-temperature stable and form I being high-temperature stable (transition temperature 138 °C). These two forms have similar enthalpies. entropies. and free energies (thermodynamic stability). which may be related to their similar molecular conformations. hydrogen-bonding patterns. and crystal packing efficiencies.

Ltd.,The molecular recognition properties of 18 acyclic imides were studied to evaluate the relative contributions of conformational. hydrogen bonding and crystal packing forces to the stabilization of specific aggregate patterns in the solid state. The crystal structure of diisobutyramide and the aggregate patterns of the 18 imides are presented. The stabilization by hydrogen bonding was found to override the conformational preferences of imides. while packing forces often precluded the formation of the most stable hydrogen bonded aggregate. The aggregate patterns of imides were also found to be a function of the type of substituents present as R groups. Imides with R groups of similar shape and size prefer to pack as bifurcated hydrogen bonded chains. whereas dimers or singly hydrogen‐bonded chains form when the R groups have significantly different spatial requirements.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Although the structure and function of cellulase systems continue to be the subject of intense research.    it is widely acknowledged that the rate and extent of the cellulolytic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates    is influenced not only by the effectiveness of the enzymes but also by the chemical. physical and morphological    characteristics of the heterogeneous lignocellulosic substrates. Although strategies such as site-directed    mutagenesis or directed evolution have been successfully employed to improve cellulase properties such as    binding affinity. catalytic activity and thermostability. complementary goals that we and other groups have    studied have been the determination of which substrate characteristics are responsible for limiting hydrolysis    and the development of pretreatment methods that maximize substrate accessibility to the cellulase complex.

The sugar yields. from both hemicellulose and cellulose are critical parameters for an economically-feasible ethanol production process. This study shows that a near-theoretical glucose yield (96–104%) from acid-catalysed steam pretreated corn stover can be obtained if xylanases are used to supplement cellulases during hydrolysis. Xylanases hydrolyse residual hemicellulose. thereby improving the access of enzymes to cellulose. Under these conditions. xylose yields reached 70–74%. When pre-treatment severity was reduced by using autocatalysis instead of acid-catalysed steam pretreatment. xylose yields were increased to 80–86%. Partial delignification of pretreated material was also evaluated as a way to increase the overall sugar yield.

The enzymatic loading in these experiments was 10 FPU/g WIS and the yeast concentration in SSF was 1 g/L (dry weight) of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain. When the whole slurry from the pretreatment stage was used as it was. diluted to 8% WIS with water and pH adjusted. SSF gave a 13% higher overall ethanol yield than SHF (72.4% versus 59.1% of the theoretical). The impact of the inhibitory compounds in the liquid fraction of the pretreated slurry was shown to affect SSF and SHF in different ways.

One strategy for cost reduction is to improve the specific activities of cellulases by genetic engineering. However. screening for improved activity typically uses “ideal” cellulosic substrates. and results are not necessarily applicable to more realistic substrates such as pretreated hardwoods and softwoods. For lignocellulosic substrates. nonproductive binding and inactivation of enzymes by the lignin component appear to be important factors limiting catalytic efficiency. A better understanding of these factors could allow engineering of cellulases with improved activity based on reduced enzyme-lignin interaction (“weak lignin-binding cellulases”). To prove this concept. we have shown that naturally occurring cellulases with similar catalytic activity on a model …,True,RQDAtbYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,314,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1385/ABAB:121:1-3:0163,8670183680734878505,/scholar?cites=8670183680734878505,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Saddler/publication/278704908_Weak_Lignin-Binding_Enzymes/links/5588363108aeb299444486c5/Weak-Lignin-Binding-Enzymes.pdf,0,0,0

Steam pretreated solids with xylan contents ranging from ∼1 to 19% (w/w) were produced. Higher xylan contents and improved hemicellulose recoveries were obtained with solids pretreated at lower severities or without SO2‐addition prior to pretreatment. The pretreated solids with low xylan content (<4% (w/w)) were characterized by fast and complete cellulose to glucose conversion when utilizing cellulases.

If the inhibitory effect of lignin can be significantly reduced. softwoods may become a more useful feedstock for the bioconversion processes. Moreover. strategies developed to reduce problems with softwood lignin may also provide a means to enhance the processing of other lignocellulosic substrates. The Forest Products Biotechnology Group at the University of British Columbia has been developing softwood-to-ethanol processes with SO2-catalyzed steam explosion and ethanol organosolv pretreatments.

Totowa. NJ,A batch reactor was employed to steam explode corn fiber at various degrees of severity to evaluate the potential of using this feedstock as part of an enzymatically mediated cellulose-to-ethanol process. Severity was controlled by altering temperature (150–230°C). residence time (1–9 min). and SO2 concentration (0–6% [w/w] dry matter). The effects of varying the different parameters were assessed by response surface modeling. The results indicated that maximum sugar yields (hemicellulose-derived water soluble. and cellulose-derived following enzymatic hydrolysis) were recovered from corn fiber pretreated at 190°C for 5 minutes after exposure to 3% SO2. Sequential SO2-catalyzed steam explosion and enzymatic hydrolysis resulted in a conversion efficiency of 81% of the combined original hemicellulose and cellulose in the corn fiber to monomeric sugars.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Current attempts to produce ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass are focused on the optimization of pretreatment to reduce substrate recalcitrance and the improvement of enzymes for hydrolysis of the cellulose and hemicellulose components to produce fermentable sugars. Research aimed at optimizing both aspects of the bioconversion process involves assessment of the effects of multiple variables on enzyme efficiency. resulting in large factorial experiments with intensive assay requirements. A rapid assay for lignocellulose hydrolysis has been developed to address this need. Pretreated lignocellulose is formed into handsheets. which are then used to prepare small disks that are easily dispensed into microtiter plates.

Cradle to grave life cycle analysis is used to investigate the global warming potential and fossil fuel use of converting poplar biomass to drop-in bio-jet fuel via a novel bioconversion platform. Unique to the biorefinery designs in this research is an acetogen fermentation step. Following dilute acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. poplar biomass is fermented to acetic acid and then distilled. hydroprocessed. and oligomerized to jet fuel. Natural gas steam reforming and lignin gasification are proposed to meet hydrogen demands at the biorefineries. Separate well to wake simulations are performed using the hydrogen production processes to obtain life cycle data. Both biorefinery designs are assessed using natural gas and hog fuel to meet excess heat demands. Global warming potential of the natural gas steam reforming and lignin gasification bio-jet fuel scenarios range from CO2 equivalences of 60 to 66 and 32 to 73 g MJ−1. respectively. Fossil fuel usage of the natural gas steam reforming and lignin gasification bio-jet fuel scenarios range from 0.78 to 0.84 and 0.71 to 1.0 MJ MJ−1. respectively.

Current sensors and analytical techniques require lengthy offline analysis or are easily fouled in situ. Raman spectroscopy has the potential to continuously monitor fermentation reactants and products. maximizing efficiency and allowing for improved process control. In this paper we show that glucose and ethanol in a lignocellulosic fermentation can be accurately monitored by a 785 nm Raman spectroscopy instrument and novel immersion probe. even in the presence of an elevated background thought to be caused by lignin-derived compounds. Chemometric techniques were used to reduce the background before generating calibration models for glucose and ethanol concentration.

Bioconversion of 2-year-old poplar grown as short rotation coppice,2017,Chang Dou and Wilian F Marcondes and Jessica E Djaja and Renata Bura and Rick Gustafson,10,Biotechnology for biofuels,1,1-15,BioMed Central,Feedstock cost is a substantial barrier to the commercialization of lignocellulosic biorefineries. Poplar grown using a short rotation coppice (SRC) system has the potential to provide a low-cost feedstock and economically viable sugar yields for fuels and chemicals production. In the coppice management regime. poplars are harvested after 2 years’ growth to develop the root system and establish the trees. The biomass from these 2-year-old trees is very heterogeneous. and includes components of leaf. bark. branch. and wood chip. This material is quite different than the samples that have been used in most poplar bioconversion research. which come from mature trees of short rotation forestry (SRF) plantations. If the coppice management regime is to be used. it is important that feedstock growers maximize their revenue from this initial harvest. but the heterogeneous nature of the biomass may be challenging for bioconversion. This work evaluates bioconversion of 2-year-old poplar coppice and compares its performance to whitewood chips from 12-year-old poplar. The 2-year-old whole tree coppice (WTC) is comprised of 37% leaf. 9% bark. 12% branch. and 42% wood chip. As expected. the chemical compositions of each component were markedly different. The leaf has a low sugar content but is high in phenolics. ash. and extractives. By removing the leaves. the sugar content of the biomass increased significantly. while the phenolic. ash. and extractives contents decreased.

Although many approaches have been attempted to increase the pore size of MOF materials. it is still a challenge to construct MOFs with precisely customized pore apertures for specific applications.

Chem,182327.10,1155,,Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new category of advanced porous materials undergoing study by many researchers for their vast variety of both novel structures and potentially useful properties arising from them. Their high porosities. tunable structures. and convenient process of introducing both customizable functional groups and unsaturated metal centers have afforded excellent gas sorption and separation ability. catalytic activity. luminescent properties. and more. However. the robustness and reactivity of a given framework are largely dependent on its metal-ligand interactions. where the metal-containing clusters are often vulnerable to ligand substitution by water or other nucleophiles. meaning that the frameworks may collapse upon exposure even to moist air. Other frameworks may collapse upon thermal or vacuum treatment or simply over time. This instability limits the practical uses of many MOFs. In order to further enhance the stability of the framework. many different approaches. such as the utilization of high-valence metal ions or nitrogen-donor ligands. were recently investigated.

A scheme of constructing a very efficient basis set is proposed based on theoretical considerations. Such a basis set contains a set of Gaussian functions (usually of low angular momentum) centered at the midbond of the van der Waals molecule. which have been proven very efficient to reproduce the intersystem correlation interaction energy normally to be achieved by use of the nucleus‐centered high angular momentum polarization functions. A nuclear‐centered moderate set [5s4p2d] augmented by a set of midbond functions such as {3s3p2d} produces a value of 10.04 K for the well depth of He2 at the complete fourth‐order (MP4) theory.

The results indicate that in general the electron–vibrational coupling is stronger than the hole–vibrational coupling. In acenedithiophenes. the main contributions to the hole–vibrational coupling arise from medium‐ and high‐frequency vibrations. In thienobisbenzothiophenes. however. the interaction of holes with low‐frequency vibrations becomes significant and is larger than the corresponding electron–vibrational interaction. This finding is in striking contrast with the characteristic pattern in oligoacenes and acenedithiophenes in which the low‐frequency vibrations contribute substantially only to the electron–vibrational coupling.

However. the use of artificial host materials in chemical/biological detections has become increasingly attractive. because the synthetic recognition systems such as molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) usually have lower costs. higher physical/chemical stability. easier preparation and better engineering possibility than biological receptors. Molecular imprinting is one of the most efficient strategies to offer a synthetic route to artificial recognition systems by a template polymerization technique. and has attracted considerable efforts due to its importance in separation. chemo/biosensors. catalysis and biomedicine. Despite the fact that MIPs have molecular recognition ability similar to that of biological receptors. traditional bulky MIP materials usually exhibit a low binding capacity and slow binding kinetics to the target species. Moreover. the MIP materials lack the signal-output response to analyte binding events when used as recognition elements in chemo/biosensors or bioassays.

Fluorescent silica nanoparticles were synthesized through modification of the surface with a nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore and an organic amine to form a hybrid monolayer of fluorophores and amino ligands; the resultant nanoparticles showed different fluorescence responses to the proton target and TNT. Protonation of the amino ligands leads to fluorescence enhancement due to inhibition of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between the amine and fluorophore. By contrast. addition of TNT results in fluorescence quenching because a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) happens between the NBD fluorophore and the formed TNT–amine complex. The fluorescence signal is reversible through washing with the proper solvents and the nanoparticles can be reused after centrifugal separation. Furthermore. these nanoparticles were assembled into chips on an etched silicon wafer for the detection of TNT and the proton target. The assembled chip can be used as a convenient indicator of herbicide (2. 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and TNT residues with the use of only 10 μL of sample.

The primary chemical agents used for controlling mosquitoes are insecticides that target the nervous system. However. the emergence of resistance in mosquito populations is reducing the efficacy of available insecticides. The development of new insecticides is therefore urgent. Here we show that VU573. a small-molecule inhibitor of mammalian inward-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. inhibits a Kir channel cloned from the renal (Malpighian) tubules of Aedes aegypti (AeKir1). Injection of VU573 into the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti) disrupts the production and excretion of urine in a manner consistent with channel block of AeKir1 and renders the mosquitoes incapacitated (flightless or dead) within 24 hours. Moreover. the toxicity of VU573 in mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti) is exacerbated when hemolymph potassium levels are elevated. suggesting that Kir channels are essential for maintenance of whole-animal potassium homeostasis.

We consider that there is plenty of room for the development of fundamental research in the field of DESs because their compositional flexibility makes the number of DESs susceptible of preparation unlimited and so do the range of properties that DESs can attain. Ultimately. these properties can be transferred into the resulting materials in terms of both tailored morphologies and compositions.

The CO2 sorption capacity of these solid sorbents was extraordinary because of their relatively high nitrogen content and their bimodal porous structure where micropores provide high surface areas (ca. 700 m2 g−1) and macropores provide accessibility to such a surface. DESs were composed of resorcinol. 3-hydroxypyridine and choline chloride in 2 : 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 : 1 molar ratios. Polycondensation of resorcinol and 3-hydroxypyridine (with formaldehyde) promoted DES segregation in a spinodal-like decomposition process by the formation of a polymer rich phase and a depleted polymer phase.

Although hard carbon has long been established as one of the best substitutes. its performance remains below that of graphite in LIBs and its sodium storage mechanism is still under debate. Many other carbons have been recently studied. some of which have presented capacities far beyond that of graphite.

Specifically. three facile syntheses are developed to assemble vertical ZnO NWs on CuGaO2 (CGO) nanoplates in mild aqueous solution conditions. The key to the successful 3D mesoscale integration is the preferential nucleation and heteroepitaxial growth of ZnO NWs on the CGO nanoplates. Using transmission electron microscopy. heteroepitaxy was found between the basal planes of CGO nanoplates and ZnO NWs. which are their respective (001) crystallographic planes. by the observation of a hexagonal Moiré fringes pattern resulting from the slight mismatch between the c planes of ZnO and CGO.

Controlling the bottom-up synthesis of high quality nanomaterials with specific dimensions relies on the understanding of crystal growth.

1121325,Peptide tessellation yields micron-scale collagen triple helices,,I Caglar Tanrikulu and Audrey Forticaux and Song Jin and Ronald T Raines,,,,,,Sticky-ended DNA duplexes can associate spontaneously into long double helices; however. such self-assembly is much less developed with proteins. Collagen is the most prevalent component of the extracellular matrix and a common clinical biomaterial. Like natural DNA. the∼ 103-residue triple-helices (∼ 300 nm) of natural collagen are recalcitrant to chemical synthesis. Here we show how the self-assembly of short collagen-mimetic peptides (CMPs) can enable the fabrication of synthetic collagen triple-helices that are nearly a micron in length. Inspired by the mathematics of tessellations. we derive rules for the design of single CMPs that self-assemble into long triple helices with perfect symmetry. Sticky-ends thus created are uniform across the assembly and drive its growth. Enacting this design yields individual triple-helices that match or exceed those in natural collagen in length and are remarkably thermostable. despite the absence of higher-order association. Symmetric assembly of CMPs provides an enabling platform for the development of advanced materials for medicine and nanotechnology.Strict base-pairing rules enable the DNA double helix to store. recall. and replicate biochemical information. The ability of DNA strands to associate in a sequence-specific manner also allows DNA to form duplexes with single-stranded overhangs. These “sticky ends” enable duplexes with complementary overhangs to associate and thereby extend the double helix. The ensuing cohesive assemblies can far exceed the size of constituent strands and underlie the fields of molecular biology1. 2. synthetic biology3. and DNA nanotechnology4 …,True,jK40kIQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismet-Tanrikulu/publication/305272585_Peptide_tessellation_yields_micrometre-scale_collagen_triple_helices/links/5e9de6aa299bf13079ad7fc4/Peptide-tessellation-yields-micrometre-scale-collagen-triple-helices.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismet-Tanrikulu/publication/305272585_Peptide_tessellation_yields_micrometre-scale_collagen_triple_helices/links/5e9de6aa299bf13079ad7fc4/Peptide-tessellation-yields-micrometre-scale-collagen-triple-helices.pdf,0,0,0

Knowledge of lipophilicity is used in a variety of methods that may predict absorption and other transport properties of drug molecules in the human body.

To combat these invaders. bacteria possess an arsenal of defenses. such as CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity. Many bacterial populations coordinate their behavior as cell density increases. using quorum sensing (QS) signaling. In this study. we demonstrate that QS regulation results in increased expression of the type I-E. I-F. and III-A CRISPR-Cas systems in Serratia cells in high-density populations. Strains unable to communicate via QS were less effective at defending against invaders targeted by any of the three CRISPR-Cas systems. Additionally. the acquisition of immunity by the type I-E and I-F systems was impaired in the absence of QS signaling.

Conventionally. a transparent fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass with a thin layer coating of platinum (Pt) is used as counter electrode in DSCs. The widespread use of Pt as counter electrode in DSCs is due to its catalytic capability for I3- reduction in electrolyte. However. Pt is costly and can be affected by the corrosive nature of I-/I3- redox couple. which makes it a less desirable candidate for use in industrial scale manufacturing. In this study. carbon nanofibers with surface-attached Pt nanoparticles were prepared by stabilization and carbonization of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers and subsequent controllable Pt nanoparticle growth on the obtained carbon nanofiber surface through redox reaction.

Department of Occupational and Environment Medicine. Peking University Health Center. China—To investigate the effects of the job demand-control (DC) model and the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model on worker’s wellbeing. self-reports for psychosocial work conditions and well-being were made by a sample of 878 workers at a thermal power plant in China using the main dimensions of DC and ERI questionnaires. Logistic regression analyses were employed controlling for age. gender. and educational level. and negative and positive affection among others. Workers reporting high job demands and low job control or high efforts and low rewards had elevated risks of job dissatisfaction. psychosomatic complaints and depressive symptoms. Odds ratios were generally higher in workers reporting both high efforts and low rewards. Furthermore. low reward proved to be a stronger predictor of poor wellbeing when both job stress models were simultaneously adjusted. To some extent. interaction effects were found for social support. but no interaction effects were found for overcommitment. The findings indicate independent effects of both the DC model and the ERI model on well-being.

M(CO)2. M(CO)3(D3h). M(CO)4(D4h or Td). and M(CO)6(Oh) would each give rise to a characteristic frequency and intensity pattern. These patterns not only reveal the stoicheiometry and symmetry of the species. but also yield the appropriate Cotton–Kraihanzel force constants. The calculations are displayed as line spectra and cover a wide range of force constants.,True,Vrk9_ikAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC,93,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/1972/dt/dt9720002496,14903576085929769874,/scholar?cites=14903576085929769874,,,0,0,0

Though this reaction is experimentally associated with NO generation and vasodilation. kinetic analysis suggests that NO should not be able to escape inactivation in the erythrocyte. We have discovered that products of the nitrite-hemoglobin reaction generate dinitrogen trioxide (N 2 O 3) via a novel reaction of NO and nitrite-bound methemoglobin. The oxygen-bound form of nitrite-methemoglobin shows a degree of ferrous nitrogen dioxide (Fe (II)-NO 2) character. so it may rapidly react with NO to form N 2 O 3. N 2 O 3 partitions in lipid. homolyzes to NO and readily nitrosates thiols. all of which are common pathways for NO escape from the erythrocyte.

All the complexes studied exhibit essentially the same d-orbital energy ordering. which is a1 (dx2-z2) ≤ a2 (dxy) ≤ a1 (dy2) < b2 (dyz) < b1 (dxz). where the metal−imido vector is identified with the z axis and metal−N3 plane is identified with the xz plane. A curious aspect of this orbital ordering is that the metal dx2-z2 orbital. one of whose lobes points directly at the imido nitrogen. is considerably lower in energy than the dπ orbitals. We have determined that the remarkable stability of the dσ-type orbitals owes largely to the way these orbitals hybridize or “shape-shift” as a result of the absence of ligands trans or equatorial with respect to the imido (or oxo) group.

In other words. copper triarylcorroles exhibit so‐called hyper spectra. By contrast. the Soret region in the silver case is largely π→π* in nature.

These oils also have a long tradition of use in the protection of stored products. Recent investigations indicate that some chemical constituents of these oils interfere with the octopaminergic nervous system in insects. As this target site is not shared with mammals. most essential oil chemicals are relatively non-toxic to mammals and fish in toxicological tests. and meet the criteria for “reduced risk” pesticides. Some of these oils and their constituent chemicals are widely used as flavoring agents in foods and beverages and are even exempt from pesticide registration. This special regulatory status combined with the wide availability of essential oils from the flavor and fragrance industries. has made it possible to fasttrack commercialization of essential oil-based pesticides. Though well received by consumers for use against home and garden pests. these “green pesticides” can also prove effective in agricultural situations. particularly for organic food production.

The studies available suggest that plant-based materials do affect arthropod pests. vectors and other pathogens. yet only a handful of botanicals are currently used in agriculture in the industrialized world. and there are few prospects for commercial development of new botanical products. Secondary allelochemicals from plants are usually commercialized as single. concentrated compounds. despite research showing that compound mixtures reduce pest resistance better than single compounds. Several factors appear to limit the success of botanicals. most notably regulatory barriers and the availability of competing products of microbial origin and fermentation products that are costeffective and relatively safe compared with their predecessors. In the context of agricultural pest management. botanical pesticides are best suited for use in organic food production in industrialized countries but can play a much greater role in the production and post-harvest protection of food in developing countries. It is in developing countries that are rich in endemic plant biodiversity where these pesticides may ultimately have their greatest impact in future integrated pest management (IPM) programmes. given their safety to non-target organisms and the environment. However. there is a need to organize natural sources. develop quality control. adopt standardization strategies and modify …,True,5leuMX0AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,141,http://projects.nri.org/adappt/docs/KoulCABI2009.pdf,13646094193199589291,/scholar?cites=13646094193199589291,,http://projects.nri.org/adappt/docs/KoulCABI2009.pdf,0,0,0

Although these nations have limited access to novel therapeutics. they do have access to foods that contain chemopreventive bioactive compounds such as anthocyanins. and as such. consumption of these foods can be encouraged to combat cancer. We and others have previously characterized the anti-colon cancer properties of dietary anthocyanins from different sources. Eugenia jambolana (Java plum) is a tropical medicinal fruit rich in anthocyanins. however. its anti-colon cancer properties are not well characterized. Furthermore. recent evidence suggests that colon cancer stem cells (colon CSCs) promote resistance to chemotherapy. relapse of tumors and contribute to poor prognosis. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize the anthocyanin profile of Java plum using HPLC-MS; and 2) determine the anti-proliferative (cell counting and MTT) and pro-apoptotic (TUNEL and caspase 3/7 glo assay) properties of Java plum fruit extract (JPE) using HCT-116 colon cancer cell line and colon CSCs (positive for CD 44.

Merr.) using polymeric/clay seed coats. Twelve polymers-based and 1 clay-based seed coats were prepared and compared with the commercial formulation of Thiram 75 DS for seed quality enhancement of soybean seed under storage. The carriers employed included acacia. tragacanth. rosin. ethyl cellulose. hydroxy ethyl cellulose. polyethyl methacrylate. methyl cellulose. polyethylene glycol. polyvinyl chloride. polyvinyl acetate. polyvinyl pyrrolidone. and Agrimer VA 6 and the clay bentonite. The polymer-coated seeds in general deteriorated at a slower rate compared with the control and revealed high germination percentage over the control. Apparently the coats acted as barriers to the moisture and checked the deterioration of seed. These also prevented the proliferation of storage fungi over an elevated period. Among all the polymers. polyethyl methacrylate. polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone were found to be significantly superior (P= 0.01) in maintaining the soybean seed quality during storage. On perusal of correlation matrix (germination. vigour and moisture). it was observed that the moisture content of seed revealed significant negative correlation with seed germination (0.8776). seed vigour (0.7240).

Discrepancies between currently used theoretical approaches of 200% exist for numerous elements from 1 to 3 keV x-ray energies. The key discrepancies are due to the smoothing of edge structure. the use of nonrelativistic wave functions. and the lack of appropriate convergence of wave functions. This paper addresses these key discrepancies and derives new theoretical results of substantially higher accuracy in near-edge soft x-ray regions. The high-energy limitations of the current approach are also illustrated. The energy range covered is 0.1 to 10 keV.

This technique includes the use of multiple foil attenuators at each energy investigated. allowing independent tests of detector linearity and of the harmonic contributions to the monochromated synchrotron beam. Measurements over a wide energy range allow the uncertainty of local foil thickness to be minimized by the calibration of thin sample measurements to those of thick samples. The use of an extended criterion for sample thickness selection allows direct determination of dominant systematics. with an improvement of accuracies compared to previous measurements by up to factors of 20. Resulting accuracies for attenuation coefficients of copper (8.84 to 20 keV) are 0.27–0.5%. with reproducibility of 0.02%.

The present study simulates accurate IR spectra for ferrocene using density functional theory (DFT) based on the B3LYP/m6-31G(d) model without any scaling and manipulation. The agreement with an early experiment and other theory is excellent. It is found that in the vacuum. the eclipsed conformer represents the true minimum structure of ferrocene. whereas the staggered conformer represents the saddle point structure. in agreement with a number of other theoretical and experimental studies. The study further reveals that the sandwich complexes are formed by stacking two Cp rings with an Fe atom in the middle and there are no conventionally localised Fe–C bonds in ferrocene.

Novelties of this approach include the use of a synchrotron with detector normalisation. the direct calibration of dominant systematics using multiple thicknesses. and measurement over wide energy ranges with a resulting improvement of accuracies by an order of magnitude. This new technique achieves accuracies of 0.27–0.5% and reproducibility of 0.02% for attenuation of copper from 8.84 to 20 keV. compared to accuracies of 10% using atomic vapours.

Immobilization of NO3-N was very rapid in soil amended with glucose and sucrose followed by a remineralization of organic N and accumulation of mineral N. Cellulose caused a slow but continued immobilization and did not show net accumulation of mineral N during 8 weeks of incubation. At the end of incubation. a significant increase in total N and organic N content of the soil was observed which is perhaps attributable to the activity of free living N2 fixers. Although N losses seemed to have occurred at 100% WHC through denitrification in soil amended with glucose and sucrose. main cause of NO3 elimination was microbial immobilization.,True,L8KJH-UAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,173,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02370542,928006964589659081,/scholar?cites=928006964589659081,,http://58.27.197.146:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/651/1/Publications-KAM%20%20Updated%20%281%29.pdf,0,0,0

Wheat seeds were soaked in 0. 25. 50. 75. 100. 125 and 150 ppm solutions of silver nanoparticles for germination test. To determine the effect on seedling growth silver nanoparticles were applied with MS medium and through soil in small plastic pots in two different experiments in lab. To evaluate yield response silver nanoparticles were applied to soil at the time of transfer of seedlings to clay pots. Application of silver nanoparticles either did not affect or decreased germination and germination index.

Co(II) and Cd(II) sorption onto NiO is studied at different temperatures (303–323 K). The applicability of the various kinetic models is tested to determine the mechanism of the sorption reaction. The kinetics of the metal ion adsorption on NiO is best described by pseudo first order model. The time required to reach the adsorption equilibrium is dependent on the temperature and nature of metal cation. The increase in the extent of the metal cation adsorption with temperature is due to the increase in number of active sites on the surface of adsorbent.

J. Bot,5,3047-3054,,An experiment was conducted to investigate the possible involvement of exogenous salicylic acid in salinity tolerance of two sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) lines. viz.. PARI-S-4 and YSS-9. Three salinity levels ie. 0. 60 and 120 mmol NaCl were developed at the time of seed sowing. Foliar spray of salicylic acid (0. 25 and 50 mg L-1) was applied 14 days after germination. Increasing salinity treatments reduced the fresh and dry mass of both root and shoot. Plants treated with salicylic acid showed no recovery from salt induced reduction in biomass production. Root/shoot fresh and dry mass ratio. however. was not affected by salinity and salicylic acid treatments. Salicylic acid treated plants showed no recovery from excessive accumulation of Na+ in their shoot/root. when under salt stress. Reduction in the accumulation of K+ in salt treated plants not compensated by exogenous application of salicylic acid. Salt stressed plants treated with salicylic acid. however. showed higher shoot Ca2+ than untreated ones. Exogenous application of 25 ppm of salicylic acid proved to be more effective in reducing the salt induced perturbance in shoot Ca2+ as compared to salicylic acid level of 50 mg L-1. Shoot and root Na+/K+ ratio though increased with increase in salinity levels. which was not reversed by exogenous supply of salicylic acid.,True,L8KJH-UAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,50,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Syed_Raza21/publication/228486929_Growth_modulation_and_ion_partitioning_in_salt_stressed_sorghum_Sorghum_bicolor_L_by_exogenous_supply_of_salicylic_acid/links/00b495215c82b54ec4000000.pdf,235862588029419313,/scholar?cites=235862588029419313,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Syed_Raza21/publication/228486929_Growth_modulation_and_ion_partitioning_in_salt_stressed_sorghum_Sorghum_bicolor_L_by_exogenous_supply_of_salicylic_acid/links/00b495215c82b54ec4000000.pdf,0,0,0

Although significant advances to this field have been reported during the past decade. many challenges remain. First. most of the methods are substrate-specific and thus cannot be generalized. Second. conversions of unactivated (i.e.. not benzylic or α to heteroatom) sp3 C−H bonds to C−C bonds are rare. with most examples limited to t-butyl groups. a conversion that is inherently simple because there are no β-hydrogens that can be eliminated. Finally. the palladium. rhodium. and ruthenium catalysts routinely used for the conversion of C−H bonds to C−C bonds are expensive.

The most active congeners among those tested are the urea-based palladacycles. which in conjunction with a tBu3P ligand induce high conversions for a range of aryl halide and boronate coupling partners. Notably. aryl chlorides are viable coupling partners even under relatively mild conditions at short reaction times (e.g.. 1 h at 60 °C).

Even mild-drought conditions are responsible for considerable yield losses. We performed large-scale transcriptome sequencing using Illumina technology on root tissue of three triploid genotypes representing well known cultivars and focused on the identification of genes with an altered expression pattern under mild osmotic stress (3 days after 5% PEG treatment). In total. 18 cDNA libraries were sequenced producing around 568 million high quality reads. of which 70-84% were mapped to the diploid reference genome (D’Hont et al.. 2012). Through uni-/multivariate statistics. 92 genes were commonly identified as differentially expressed in the three genotypes. Using our in house workflow to analyze GO enriched and underlying biochemical pathways. we present a panorama of the general processes affected by mild osmotic stress in the root tip. although we observe a bias towards glycolysis and fermentation. We hypothesize that in this fast growing and oxygen demanding tissue. mild osmotic stress leads to a lower energy level. which induces a metabolic shift towards (i) a higher oxidative respiration. (ii) alternative respiration and (iii) fermentation. To validate the mRNA-seq results. a subset of twenty up-regulated genes were further analyzed at three different time points (6 hours. 3 days and 7 days) in an independent PEG experiment. Overall. the identification and annotation of this set of genes constitutes a step ahead to understand the complex network of root responses to osmotic (drought) stress.,True,E_LV-yIAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/74482,,,,,0,0,0

Embedding boron into the backbone of ladder or 2D poly aromatic hydrocarbons is an underexplored approach to modulate optoelectronic properties. with tricoordinate boron representing a novel acceptor moiety for organic optoelectronic applications. Furthermore. the incorporation of boron into polycyclics containing other heteroatoms (e.g.. chalcogens or pnictogens) leads to more extensive structural diversity and considerable ability to modify the frontier orbital energies and character. often in a controlled manner. to fine tune material properties for specific applications.

We also describe direct observation of the OH‐isoprene adduct based on ion‐molecule reactions by using the CIMS method. The formation of the OH‐isoprene adduct was used to extract the rate constant between OH and isoprene; within the uncertainty of the experiments the results were consistent with those obtained from the observed disappearance of OH.

The method is based on use of the first derivative of the ratios of spectra. The absorption spectrum of the mixture is obtained and the amplitudes at appropriate wavelengths are divided by the corresponding amplitudes in the absorption spectrum of a standard solution of one of the components. and the first derivative of the ratio spectrum is obtained. The concentration of the other component is then determined from a calibration graph. The method has been applied for resolving binary mixtures of salicylic and salicyluric acids. Calibration graphs for 2.6–52 ppm salicylic acid and for 2.1–42 ppm salicyluric acid were established by measuring the analytical signals at the maximum at 241.5 nm (for salicylic acid) and from the peak at 258 nm to the trough at 247 nm (for salicyluric acid) in the first derivative ratio spectra.,True,SCuwZMYAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,404,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003991409080065N,13883355351456234591,/scholar?cites=13883355351456234591,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anunciacion_Espinosa-Mansilla/publication/23432589_A_new_spectrophotometric_method_for_quantitative_multicomponent_analysis_resolution_of_mixtures_of_Salicylic_and_Salicyluric_acids/links/5a8861dd0f7e9b1a95516766/A-new-spectrophotometric-method-for-quantitative-multicomponent-analysis-resolution-of-mixtures-of-Salicylic-and-Salicyluric-acids.pdf,0,0,0

The adsorption isotherms for the various metals were measured at 298 K. using adsorptive solutions at two pH values. The adsorption was much higher for mercury than for cadmium and lead for all adsorbents. The adsorption of mercury greatly increased for the samples of sulphurized carbon and also. though less. for the sample prepared in N2. The decrease of pH in the adsorptive solution to pH 2.0 drastically reduced the adsorption of mercury. The effect of pH change on the adsorption of Cd2+ and Pb2+ occurred with less adsorbents than for mercury. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thus. we aimed to investigate the effects of green coffee (GC). rich in chlorogenic acid. and black coffee (BC) on cardiovascular markers. A randomised pilot crossover study was performed on healthy subjects who consumed both coffees for 2 weeks. We measured anthropometry. blood pressure. and arterial elasticity after each intervention and collected urine samples to monitor antioxidant capacity. Free cortisol and cortisone levels were obtained from urine and analysed by specific ELISA methods. Systolic blood pressure (                ) and arterial elasticity (                ) were significantly reduced after GC. BMI (                 for BC;                  for GC) and abdominal fat (                 for BC;                  for GC) were also significantly reduced with no changes in energy intake. Urinary free cortisol was significantly reduced from                  nmol/day to                  nmol/day following GC and increased to                  nmol/day after BC.

The hollow axes of the tubular crystals are parallel to the 1D channels of the MOFs. which suggests that the hollow crystal is grown by the unidirectional addition of pillar ligands to the 2D network. Among the activated MOFs. only the MOFs with methoxy and ethoxy pendant groups show selective CO2 adsorption over N2 and CH4. whereas those with longer alkoxy pendant groups barely …,True,ZzBa1tUAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,5,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/asia.201500332,6879977689116392734,/scholar?cites=6879977689116392734,,,0,0,0

We report herein that cytochrome P450 (P450)3A4 is inhibited by raloxifene in human liver microsomal incubations. The nature of the inhibition was irreversible and was NADPH- and preincubation time-dependent. with KI and kinact values estimated at 9.9 μM and 0.16 min-1. respectively. The observed loss of P450 3A4 activity was attenuated partially by glutathione (GSH). implying the involvement of a reactive metabolite(s) in the inactivation process. Subsequently. GSH adducts of raloxifene were identified in incubations with human liver microsomes; substitution with GSH occurred at the 5- or 7-position of the benzothiophene moiety or at the 3‘-position of the phenol ring. with the 7-glutathionyl derivative being most abundant based on LC/MS and NMR analyses.

Grenoble. The four spin-dependent. neutron scattering cross-sections were measured in absolute units for the two glasses. The spin-flip cross-sections and were found to be small; they were independent of the scattering vector Q. independent of the temperature and were also of the same magnitude as the nuclear incoherent cross-section. within experimental errors. These observations indicate that the magnetic structure in these glasses must be collinear. The non-spin-flip cross-sections were found to have a hitherto unobserved shift of the first peak between the and channels.

Concurrently. dramatic increases in the three V's (Volume. Velocity. and Variety) of experimental data and the scale of computational tasks produced the demand for new real-time processing systems at experimental facilities. Recently. this demand was addressed by the Spark-MPI approach connecting the Spark data-intensive platform with the MPI high-performance framework. In contrast with existing data management and analytics systems. Spark introduced a new middleware based on resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). which decoupled various data sources from high-level processing algorithms.

1122167,Practicing Open Science,2014,Luis Ibanez and William J Schroeder and Marcus D Hanwell,,,,241-280,CRC Press,Science is a system for gathering knowledge and developing explanations and predictions about the universe in which we live. A central tenet of this system is that something is known only when multiple. independent observers agree on a common experience. That is. experiences (which are more commonly called experiments) are reproducible. As such. the scientific method is by definition open; it is only when independent parties precisely replicate an experience that experimental results are considered valid. Despite this basic and obvious tenet of openness. the pressure to close science is growing. Due to the exceptional innovative power of science. commercial interests. and personal career pursuits. many scientists and research institutions are heading down the path of secrecy and strong protective measures. In addition. publishers that garner financial benefit from controlling the dissemination of scientific knowledge have been reluctant to openly share information and are under increasing financial pressure to protect what they consider their intellectual property. Consequently. one of the tragedies of the current era is that the term “open” must be prepended to science despite the fact that openness is a fundamental requirement of the scientific method. Open science is a redundant. descriptive phrase. yet it has become necessary to remind ourselves that we must maintain openness if we are to effectively practice science.Countering the pressure to close science is of course the emergence of the Internet.

Here. we use a magnetic trap and an atomic force microscope to monitor the activity of a member of this class: the RSC complex. This enzyme caused transient shortenings in DNA length involving translocation of typically 400 bp within 2 s. resulting in the formation of a loop whose size depended on both the force applied to the DNA and the ATP concentration. The majority of loops then decrease in size within a time similar to that with which they are formed. suggesting that the motor has the ability to reverse its direction. Loop formation was also associated with the generation of negative DNA supercoils.

At low DNA concentration dimeric catenanes are the major catenated products; at high DNA concentration or when spermidine is present. catenanes containing more than two rings are formed. There is no requirement of extensive sequence homology between the component rings forming a catenane; dimeric catenanes between Pseudomonas phage PM2 DNA and E. coli plasmid pBR322 are readily formed. The formation of a dimeric catenane by these type I topoisomerases. however. requires the presence of at least one preexisting single-chain scission in one of the two component rings. This is in contrast to the cases with the type II DNA topoisomerases which can form catenanes made of covalently closed rings only.

An in vitro assay determined that the P1 promoter was dependent on the sigma 32 subunit of RNA polymerase. The transcriptional activity of the four topA promoters was examined by nuclease S1 mapping of the transcripts during a heat shock. This sigma 32-dependent promoter was shown to function as a heat shock promoter. although topoisomerase I is not a heat shock protein. A possible method of compensation of transcription activity by the other promoters to maintain the level of topoisomerase I during heat shock is proposed.,True,MEGYE_UAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,50,https://jb.asm.org/content/172/12/6871.short,15769830214993815693,/scholar?cites=15769830214993815693,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/172/12/6871.full.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Limited digestion of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I with trypsin or papain generated a DNA‐binding domain of MW 14.000 corresponding to the carboxyl terminal of the enzyme. This fragment binds to single‐stranded DNA agarose as tightly as the intact enzyme. It required around 400 mM NaCl for elution. A truncated topoisomerase that lacks this C‐terminal domain was purified. It was eluted from the single‐stranded DNA agarose column at around 150 mM NaCl. Although the truncated enzyme could relax negatively supercoiled DNA as efficiently as the intact enzyme at low ionic strength. its processivity was more sensitive to increasing salt concentration. Measurement of binding to fluorescent etheno‐M13 DNA also demonstrated that the presence of the C‐terminal domain confers higher affinity to DNA for the enzyme.,True,MEGYE_UAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,50,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.340060307,17296330544158296847,/scholar?cites=17296330544158296847,,,0,0,0

In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). this focus has prompted practitioners to search for outcome measures that can objectively verify the effectiveness of TCM interventions. especially in the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Commonly used indexes for outcome assessment in RCTs of TCM can be categorized into two types: TCM-specific outcomes such as tongue and pulse characteristics. and Western medicine (WM)-specific outcomes such as blood test and X-ray examination results. Some studies include both types of indicators. During the trial design. it is necessary to consider the rationales of selecting outcome assessments. the purpose and study approach. balance between objective and subjective indexes. standardization of outcome assessment. and standardized outcome indexes.

We found that the gas phase denaturation curves were very similar to the solution phase denaturation curves determined by the traditional UV spectrophotometric method and. by analogy with the melting temperature Tm which characterizes the stability in solution. we define a melting voltage Vm to characterize the stability in the gas phase. A comparison of the Tm and Vm relative values suggests that the structure of the complexes is conserved during the electrospray process which transfers the ions from the solution to …,True,abmrgBkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,96,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(20000331)14:6%3C464::AID-RCM895%3E3.0.CO;2-M,8870103114453643732,/scholar?cites=8870103114453643732,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/320/1/Preprint%20RCM-2000%20V%20Gabelica.pdf,0,0,0

These molecules have been reported to behave like DNA intercalators. In this study. dialysis competition assay and mass spectrometry experiments were used to determine the affinity of ascididemin and meridine for DNA structures among duplexes. triplexes. quadruplexes and single-strands. Our data confirm that ascididemin and meridine interact with DNA but also recognize triplex and quadruplex structures. These molecules exhibit a significant preference for quadruplexes over duplexes or single-strands. Meridine is a stronger quadruplex ligand and therefore a stronger telomerase inhibitor than ascididemin (IC50 = 11 and >80 μM. respectively in a standard TRAP assay).,True,abmrgBkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,90,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304416505001200,9996367836374033152,/scholar?cites=9996367836374033152,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/604/2/2005-BBA-1724-375_postprint.pdf,0,0,0

(ii) The addition of cations promotes the formation of tetramers and pentamers that incorporate ammonium ions and therefore presumably have stacked guanine quartets in their structure.

Electron photodetachment is likely a fast process. given that photodetachment is able to compete with internal conversion or radiative relaxation to the ground state. The DNA [6-mer]3- ions studied here show a marked sequence dependence of electron photodetachment yield. Remarkably. the photodetachment yield (dG6 > dA6 > dC6 > dT6) is inversely correlated with the base ionization potentials (G < A < C < T). Sequences with guanine runs show increased photodetachment yield as the number of guanine increases. in line with the fact that positive holes are the most stable in guanine runs.

In the present study. we synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by using an aqueous solution of Saudi Origanum vulgare L. plant extract as a bioreducing agent. The as-synthesized AgNPs were characterized using various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The results indicated the formation of crystalline face-centered cubic (fcc) AgNPs. Additionally. FT-IR study confirmed that the O. vulgare L. extract not only functioned as a bioreductant but also stabilized the surface of the AgNPs by acting as a capping agent. Moreover. the effect of the amount of the plant extract on the size and the antimicrobial activity of the NPs was also assessed. It was found that with increasing amounts of plant extract. the size of the NPs was decreased. Moreover. as-synthesized AgNPs as well as O. vulgare L. plant extract were separately tested to examine their antimicrobial activities. The activities were tested against various bacterial and fungal microorganisms including Shigella sonnei. Micrococcus luteus. Escherichia coli. Aspergillus flavus. Alternaria alternate.

H3PW12O40. is a novel and efficient catalyst for the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT). Over a 30 wt.% HPA/SiO2 catalyst in a trickle bed flow reactor at industrially relevant gas and liquid space velocities (GHSV 600 h−1 and LHSV 6 h−1) and an H2 pressure of 30 bar. the hydrodesulfurization proceeds with a DBT conversion of 58% at 290°C and 80% at 350°C. These values are comparable to the performance of the industrial Co–Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. No loss of catalytic activity was observed for a period of 56 h. 31P MAS NMR and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data show that the HPA decomposes upon interaction with H2S/H2 to yield the active hydrodesulfurization catalyst.,True,BcwdS5QAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926860X00005305,7462361046284946178,/scholar?cites=7462361046284946178,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33168436/appl_cat3.pdf,0,0,0

These structures represent a class of molecules capable of binding to multiple receptors with high affinity. 1. 2 The exploitation of these molecules should allow the medicinal chemist to rapidly discover biologically active compounds across a broad range of therapeutic areas on a reasonable time scale. The term privileged structure was first coined by Evans et al. in 1988 and was defined as “a single molecular framework able to provide ligands for diverse receptors”. This group noted the ability of 1. 4-benzodiazepin-2-ones to bind to cholecystokinin (CCK)(such as 1). gastrin. and central benzodiazepine receptors (such as 2)(Figure 1). 1 In addition to these. the benzodiazepine scaffold is also found as neurokinin-1 antagonists (3). as enzyme inhibitors such as κ-secretase inhibitors (4) and farnesyl: protein …,True,nmfua-cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2983,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr020033s,16219291623037860582,/scholar?cites=16219291623037860582,,,0,0,0

They are generally synthesized through amide bond-forming reactions of the C- and N- termini under high dilution conditions. Yields of such processes are highly dependent on the size of the ring being formed and on the particular amino acids of the linear precursor. giving rise to the well-known sequence-dependent effect of cyclization. To overcome this problem. we have developed a peptide cyclization strategy that proceeds through a ring closure/ring contraction process. The linear peptide Ala-Phe-Leu-Pro-Ala. which does not generate monocyclic product under conventional cyclization conditions. was used as a model to probe a range of auxiliaries.

The linker allows BOC solid-phase peptide assembly and peptide cleavage using standard HF protocols. This linking strategy provides a versatile on-resin route to cyclic peptides and avoids the diketopiperazine formation that is prominent when using FMOC chemistry on backbone linkers. The linker was prepared by forming the aryl ether from 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and bromovaleric acid. Subsequent reductive amination of the aldehyde with an allyl-protected amino acid ester and acylation of the resulting secondary amine provided the tertiary amide.

Unfortunately. there currently exist no robust solid-phase strategies that allow the synthesis of large arrays of discrete cyclic peptides. Existing strategies are complicated. when synthesizing large libraries. by the extensive workup that is required to extract the cyclic product from the deprotection/cleavage mixture. To overcome this. we have developed a new safety-catch linker. The safety-catch concept described here involves the use of a protected catechol derivative in which one of the hydroxyls is masked with a benzyl group during peptide synthesis. thus making the linker deactivated to aminolysis. This masked derivative of the linker allows BOC solid-phase peptide assembly of the linear precursor.

Importantly. 34 demonstrated a greater selectivity for inhibition of …,True,nmfua-cAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,19,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm100194a,5422356499012204922,/scholar?cites=5422356499012204922,,,0,0,0
1122326,Australia's rising greenhouse gas emissions,2018,Greg Bourne and Andrew Stock and Will Steffen and Petra Stock and Louis Brailsford,,,,,Climate Council,In 2017. Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased for the third consecutive year. approaching all-time highs (excluding the land use–LULUCF–sector). In order to limit global temperature rise and tackle increasing extreme weather fuelled by climate change. the Federal Government has committed to the near-universally agreed Paris Climate Agreement. As part of this agreement. the Federal Government has set in place an initial target to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030.,True,nmfua-cAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,18,https://apo.org.au/node/180621,6198033549095271941,/scholar?cites=6198033549095271941,,,0,0,0
1122327,Synthesis of the phenylpyridal scaffold as a helical peptide mimetic,2010,Gregory T Bourne and Daniel J Kuster and Garland R Marshall,16,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",28,8439,NIH Public Access,Phenylpyridal-and phenyldipyridal-based scaffolds have been designed and synthesised as novel helical peptide mimetics. The synthesis required optimisation and selective alkylation in producing 2. 6 functionalised 3-hydroxypyridine derivatives for a convergent scheme. The pyridine analogs were coupled by a series of Suzuki/Stille types cross-coupling reactions. A series of biaryl and ter-aryl substituted heterocycles were produced. The synthetic approach was concise and high yielding allowing large variability at the wanted side-chain attachment points. A number of compounds were synthesised to show the versatility of the strategy.,True,nmfua-cAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,18,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531917/,11066786909254877481,/scholar?cites=11066786909254877481,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3531917/,0,0,0
1122328,Topological side-chain classification of β-turns: Ideal motifs for peptidomimetic development,2005,Tran Trung Tran and Jim McKie and Wim DF Meutermans and Gregory T Bourne and Peter R Andrews and Mark L Smythe,19,Journal of computer-aided molecular design,8,551-566,Springer Netherlands,β-turns are important topological motifs for biological recognition of proteins and peptides. Organic molecules that sample the side chain positions of β-turns have shown broad binding capacity to multiple different receptors. for example benzodiazepines. β-turns have traditionally been classified into various types based on the backbone dihedral angles (φ2. ψ2. φ3 and ψ3). Indeed. 57–68% of β-turns are currently classified into 8 different backbone families (Type I. Type II. Type I′. Type II′. Type VIII. Type VIa1. Type VIa2 and Type VIb and Type IV which represents unclassified β-turns). Although this classification of β-turns has been useful. the resulting β-turn types are not ideal for the design of β-turn mimetics as they do not reflect topological features of the recognition elements. the side chains. To overcome this. we have extracted β-turns from a data set of non-homologous and high-resolution protein …,True,nmfua-cAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,18,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-005-9006-2,5332412461595065064,/scholar?cites=5332412461595065064,,,0,0,0

In experiment 1. Barbados Black Belly ewes (n = 34) and ewe lambs (n = 35; 37.5 ± 0.9 kg) were assigned to be untreated. control animals (C). or to receive PGF2α on d0 (PG). or receive two injections of progesterone (200 mg. i.m. each) on D −5 and on D −2.5. prior to PGF2α. on D 0 (2PPG). Treatment with 2PPG increased the proportion of animals lambing to the first service (P < 0.05). an effect that was greater in ewe lambs than ewes (treatment × parity; P < 0.05). The interval from ram introduction to lambing and the mean lambing day was less (P = 0.04) in the 2PPG-treated animals compared to control animals. In Experiment 2. lactating ewes from experiment 1 (n = 61) 60–85 days postpartum were assigned within parity and number of lambs reared to remain nursing (S; n …,True,nmfua-cAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,17,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432011001254,212330858871982169,/scholar?cites=212330858871982169,,,0,0,0
