Like the classical Hsp70s. members of the Hsp110 subfamily can bind misfolding polypeptides and hydrolyze ATP. However. they apparently act as a mere subordinate nucleotide exchange factors. regulating the ability of Hsp70 to hydrolyze ATP and convert stable protein aggregates into native proteins. Using stably misfolded and aggregated polypeptides as substrates in optimized in vitro chaperone assays. we show that the human cytosolic Hsp110s (HSPH1 and HSPH2) are bona fide chaperones on their own that collaborate with Hsp40 (DNAJA1 and DNAJB1) to hydrolyze ATP and unfold and thus convert stable misfolded polypeptides into natively refolded proteins.

1121598,Molecular chaperones are nanomachines that catalytically unfold misfolded and alternatively folded proteins,2014,Rayees UH Mattoo and Pierre Goloubinoff,71,,17,3311-3325,Springer Basel, By virtue of their general ability to bind (hold) translocating or unfolding polypeptides otherwise doomed to aggregate. molecular chaperones are commonly dubbed “holdases”. Yet. chaperones also carry physiological functions that do not necessitate prevention of aggregation. such as altering the native states of proteins. as in the disassembly of SNARE complexes and clathrin coats. To carry such physiological functions. major members of the Hsp70. Hsp110. Hsp100. and Hsp60/CCT chaperone families act as catalytic unfolding enzymes or unfoldases that drive iterative cycles of protein binding. unfolding/pulling. and release. One unfoldase chaperone may thus successively convert many misfolded or alternatively folded polypeptide substrates into transiently unfolded intermediates. which. once released. can spontaneously refold into low-affinity native products.

DnaJ. is to co-chaperone the binding of misfolded or alternatively folded proteins to bacterial Hsp70. DnaK. which is an ATP-fuelled unfolding chaperone. In addition to its DnaK targeting activity. DnaJ has a weak thiol-reductase activity. In between the substrate-binding domain and the J-domain anchor to DnaK. DnaJ has a unique domain with four conserved CXXC motives that bind two Zn2+ and partly contribute to polypeptide binding. Here. we deleted in DnaJ this Zn-binding domain. which is characteristic to type I but not of type II or III J-proteins. This caused a loss of the thiol-reductase activity and strongly reduced the ability of DnaJ to mediate the ATP- and DnaK-dependent unfolding/refolding of mildly oxidized misfolded polypeptides. an inhibition that was alleviated in the presence of thioredoxin or DTT. We suggest that in addition to their general ability to target misfolded polypeptide substrates to the Hsp70/Hsp110 chaperone machinery. Type I J-proteins carry an ancillary protein dithiol-isomerase function that can synergize the unfolding action of the chaperone. in the particular case of substrates that are further stabilized by non-native disulfide bonds.

1121608,Mechanistic insights into cytosolic molecular chaperones in protein unfolding and disaggregation,2014,Rayees Ul Hassan Mattoo,,,,,,Under optimal non-physiological conditions of low concentrations and low temperatures. proteins may spontaneously fold to the native state. as all the information for folding lies in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. However. under conditions of stress or high protein crowding as inside cells. a polypeptide may misfold and enter an aggregation pathway resulting in the formation of misfolded conformers and fibrils. which can be toxic and lead to neurodegenerative illnesses. such as Alzheimer’s. Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases and aging in general. To avert and revert protein misfolding and aggregation. cells have evolved a set of proteins called molecular chaperones. Here. I focussed on the human cytosolic chaperones Hsp70 (DnaK) and Hsp110. and co-chaperone Hsp40 (DnaJ). and the chaperonin CCT (GroEL). The cytosolic molecular chaperones Hsp70s/Hsp110s and the chaperonins are highly upregulated in bacterial and human cells under different stresses and are involved both in the prevention and the reversion of protein misfolding and aggregation. Hsp70 works in collaboration with Hsp40 to reactivate misfolded or aggregated proteins in a strict ATP dependent manner. Chaperonins (CCT and GroEL) also unfold and reactivate stably misfolded proteins but we found that it needed to use the energy of ATP hydrolysis in order to evict oversticky misfolded intermediates that inhibited the unfoldase catalytic sites.In this study. we initially characterized a particular type of inactive misfolded monomeric luciferase and rhodanese species that were obtained by repeated cycles of freeze-thawing (FT).

This seminal finding implied that the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide suffices to determine its native biologically active conformation (Anfinsen. 1973). Yet Anfinsen also observed that following artificial unfolding by urea. the yield of recovered native proteins decreased significantly as the temperature and protein concentration increased. suggesting that alternative nonproductive misfolding and aggregation pathways can compete with the physiological native refolding pathway of proteins.

In particular. activation of myosin II–driven contractility by a Rho target known as Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) was shown to be essential for focal contact formation. To dissect the mechanism of Rho-dependent induction of focal contacts and to elucidate the role of cell contractility. we applied mechanical force to vinculin-containing dot-like adhesions at the cell edge using a micropipette. Local centripetal pulling led to local assembly and elongation of these structures and to their development into streak-like focal contacts. as revealed by the dynamics of green fluorescent protein–tagged vinculin or paxillin and interference reflection microscopy.

At these sites. transmembrane integrin receptors are associated via their cytoplasmic domains with the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction with actin is mediated by a submembrane plaque. consisting of numerous cytoskeletal and signaling molecules. Application of intrinsic or external forces to these structures dramatically affects their assembly and triggers adhesion-mediated signaling.

However. unlike resistance. which is commonly measured using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) metric. tolerance is poorly characterized. owing to the lack of a similar quantitative indicator. This may lead to the misclassification of tolerant strains as resistant. or vice versa. and result in ineffective treatments. In this Opinion article. we describe recent studies of tolerance. resistance and persistence. outlining how a clear and distinct definition for each phenotype can be developed from these findings. We propose a framework for classifying the drug response of bacterial strains according to these definitions that is based on the measurement of the MIC together with a recently defined quantitative indicator of tolerance. the minimum duration for killing (MDK).

Recently. intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is. the ability to survive under treatment without developing resistance. However. whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of resistance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases. tolerance preceded resistance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for resistance mutations to spread in the population. Thus. tolerance mutations pave the way for the rapid subsequent evolution of resistance.

Data simulation confirms that the inverse problem is ill-posed in the presence of noise and shows that in general a regularization scheme is needed to arrive at a reliable force estimate. Spatial and force resolution are restricted by the smoothing action of the elastic kernel. depend on the details of the force and displacement patterns. and are estimated by data simulation.

We present a detailed study of the toxin–antitoxin module implicated in antibiotic persistence of Escherichia coli. We find that bacterial cells become dormant if the toxin level is higher than a threshold. and that the amount by which the threshold is exceeded determines the duration of dormancy.

In contrast to genetic variation. which is passed on over many generations. the phenotypic variation generated by nongenetic mechanisms is difficult to study due to the inherently limited life time of states that are not encoded in the DNA sequence. but makes it possible for the ‘memory’ of past environments to influence future organisms.

1121629,Nongenetic individuality in the host–phage interaction,2008,Sivan Pearl and Chana Gabay and Roy Kishony and Amos Oppenheim and Nathalie Q Balaban,6,PLoS biology,5,e120,Public Library of Science,Isogenic bacteria can exhibit a range of phenotypes. even in homogeneous environmental conditions. Such nongenetic individuality has been observed in a wide range of biological processes. including differentiation and stress response. A striking example is the heterogeneous response of bacteria to antibiotics. whereby a small fraction of drug-sensitive bacteria can persist under extensive antibiotic treatments. We have previously shown that persistent bacteria enter a phenotypic state. identified by slow growth or dormancy. which protects them from the lethal action of antibiotics. Here. we studied the effect of persistence on the interaction between Escherichia coli and phage lambda. We used long-term time-lapse microscopy to follow the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the phage lytic promoter. as well as cellular fate. in single infected bacteria. Intriguingly. we found that. whereas persistent bacteria are protected from prophage induction. they are not protected from lytic infection. Quantitative analysis of gene expression reveals that the expression of lytic genes is suppressed in persistent bacteria. However. when persistent bacteria switch to normal growth. the infecting phage resumes the process of gene expression. ultimately causing cell lysis. Using mathematical models for these two host–phage interactions. we found that the bacteria's nongenetic individuality can significantly affect the population dynamics. and might be relevant for understanding the coevolution of bacterial hosts and phages.,True,NcV19fEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,121,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060120,5832979837058541988,/scholar?cites=5832979837058541988,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060120,0,0,0

These systems exhibit bistability. namely two stable states such that spontaneous transitions between them are rare. Induced transitions may take place as a result of an external stimulus. We study several variants of the genetic switch and examine the effects of cooperative binding. exclusive binding. protein-protein interactions. and degradation of bound repressors. We identify the range of parameters in which bistability takes place. enabling the system to function as a switch. Numerous studies have concluded that cooperative binding is a necessary condition for the emergence of bistability in these systems.

However. unlike resistance. which is commonly measured using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) metric. tolerance is poorly characterized. owing to the lack of a similar quantitative indicator.

In this Opinion article. we describe recent studies of tolerance. resistance and persistence. outlining how a clear and distinct definition for each phenotype can be developed from these findings.

Recently. intermittent antibiotic exposures have been shown to lead rapidly to the evolution of tolerance—that is. the ability to survive under treatment without developing resistance. However. whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of resistance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases. tolerance preceded resistance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for resistance mutations to spread in the population.

In contrast to genetic variation. which is passed on over many generations. the phenotypic variation generated by nongenetic mechanisms is difficult to study due to the inherently limited life time of states that are not encoded in the DNA sequence. but makes it possible for the ‘memory’ of past environments to influence future organisms. One striking example of phenotypic variation is the phenomenon of bacterial persistence. whereby genetically identical bacterial populations respond heterogeneously to antibiotic treatment.

A remarkable example of the importance of cell-to-cell variability is found in bacterial persistence. where subpopulations of dormant bacteria. termed persisters. were shown to be responsible for the persistence of the population to antibiotic treatments. Here. we use microfluidic devices to monitor the induction of fluorescent proteins under synthetic promoters and characterize the dormant state of single persister bacteria. Surprisingly. we observe that protein production does take place in supposedly dormant bacteria. over a narrow time window after the exit from stationary phase. Only thereafter does protein production stop. suggesting that differentiation into persisters fully develops over this time window and not during starvation. as previously believed.

Despite this general prevalence of stationary-phase bacteria. they are as yet poorly characterized. Our goal was to quantitatively study this phase by direct observation of single bacteria as they enter into stationary phase and by monitoring their activity over several days during growth arrest. For this purpose. we devised an experimental procedure for starving single Escherichia coli bacteria in microfluidic devices and measured their activity by monitoring the production rate of fluorescent proteins.

Recent in vitro experiments show that high tolerance can evolve under intermittent antibiotic treatments in as little as eight exposures to high doses of antibiotics. suggesting that tolerance may evolve also in patients.

High tolerance strains will not be detected using these tests. We present a simple modification of the standard disk-diffusion assay that allows the semi-quantitative evaluation of tolerance levels.

This is the reason why physics has a lot to offer other areas that might seem unrelated to it. like biology. In this article. we will talk about bacteria. and specifically about the battle with disease-causing bacteria and one interesting strategy that bacteria have developed in order to survive this battle. as understood through physics.,True,dJYuUcsAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2019.00045,,,,https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2019.00045,0,0,0

1121651,Distinguishing between resistance. tolerance and persistence to antibiotic treatment,2016,Asher Brauner and Ofer Fridman and Orit Gefen and Nathalie Q Balaban,14,,5,320,Nature Publishing Group,Antibiotic tolerance is associated with the failure of antibiotic treatment and the relapse of many bacterial infections. However. unlike resistance. which is commonly measured using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) metric. tolerance is poorly characterized. owing to the lack of a similar quantitative indicator.

In this Opinion article. we describe recent studies of tolerance. resistance and persistence. outlining how a clear and distinct definition for each phenotype can be developed from these findings. We propose a framework for classifying the drug response of bacterial strains according to these definitions that is based on the measurement of the MIC together with a recently defined quantitative indicator of tolerance. the minimum duration for killing (MDK).

However. whether tolerance delays or promotes the eventual emergence of resistance is unclear. Here we used in vitro evolution experiments to explore this question. We found that in all cases. tolerance preceded resistance. A mathematical population-genetics model showed how tolerance boosts the chances for resistance mutations to spread in the population.

We show that the spatial distribution. size. and species composition of farms all influence the observed pattern and regional variability of outbreaks. The other key dynamical component is long-tailed stochastic dispersal of infection. combining frequent local movements with occasional long jumps. We assess the history and possible duration of the epidemic. the performance of control strategies. and general implications for disease dynamics in space and time.,True,FEBziZ0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,891,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5543/813.abstract,11366889209293423405,/scholar?cites=11366889209293423405,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.883.8060&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Here. we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model. with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow.

The parasites are intimately linked with their host in a trophic interaction that has fascinating implications for both parasite and host. Most of the more traditional parasite species interact with their hosts at a range of organizational scales that stretches from the minisculethe molecular battle between the host's immune response and the evading action of the parasitethrough to the extensivethe struc-turing of communities and a driving force in the evolution of biodiversity and sex. These inter-actions also range over many orders of temporal scale. ranging from short time-scales of the history of an individual infection and an epidemic out-break to time-scales of endemic co-exisitence and co-evolution. Few disciplines cover such breadth and few disciplines have developed so rapidly over the past 30 years.Research areas evolve at different rates. at times needing periods of intense empirical work to set a foundation of understanding so that at other times. novel approaches and new theories can be for-mulated. and the discipline can expand rapidly.

For childhood infectious diseases such as measles. the major transitions are between regular cycles and irregular. possibly chaotic epidemics. and from regionally synchronized oscillations to complex. spatially incoherent epidemics. A simple model can explain both kinds of transitions as the consequences of changes in birth and vaccination rates.

This frequently leads to roughly equal importance of deterministic and stochastic forces. The resulting tension between noise and determinism makes ecological dynamics unique. with conceptual and methodological challenges distinctive from those in other dynamical systems. The theory for stochastic. nonlinear ecological dynamics has been developed alongside methods to test models. A range of dynamical components has been considered—density dependence. environmental and demographic stochasticity. and climatic forcing—as well as their often complex interactions.

Many epidemiological models make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of disease-causing interactions among hosts. In particular. homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts. In recent years. several network-based approaches have been developed to explicitly model heterogeneity in host contact patterns. Here. we use a network perspective to quantify the extent to which real populations depart from the homogeneous-mixing assumption. in terms of both the underlying network structure and the resulting epidemiological dynamics. We find that human contact patterns are indeed more heterogeneous than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models. but are not as variable as some have speculated.

Strikingly. phylogenies inferred for individual gene segments revealed that multiple reassortment events had occurred among these clades. such that one clade of H3N2 viruses present at least since 2000 had provided the hemagglutinin gene for all those H3N2 viruses sampled after the 2002–2003 influenza season.

We develop a model. the TSIR (Time‐series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model. that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration.

However. its potential to control major epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock is contentious. Using an individual farm-based model. we consider either national prophylactic vaccination campaigns in advance of an outbreak. or combinations of reactive vaccination and culling strategies during an epidemic.

By introducing an epidemiological model that allows for differences between the genetic and antigenic properties of the virus9s hemagglutinin. we show that these patterns can arise from cluster-specific immunity alone. Central to the formulation is a genotype-to-phenotype mapping. based on neutral networks. with antigenic phenotypes. not genotypes. determining the degree of strain cross-immunity.

The nature of the cartographic record enabled global and regional patterns in the spatial limits of malaria to be investigated at six intervals between 1900 and 2002. Contemporaneous population surfaces also allowed changes in the numbers of people living in areas of malaria risk to be quantified. These data showed that during the past century. despite human activities reducing by half the land area supporting malaria. demographic changes resulted in a 2 billion increase in the total population exposed to malaria risk.

Maps of transmission intensity are necessary to identify populations at different levels of risk and to evaluate objectively options for disease control. To remain relevant operationally. such maps must be updated frequently. Following the first global effort to map Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity in 2007. this paper describes the generation of a new world map for the year 2010. This analysis is extended to provide the first global estimates of two other metrics of transmission intensity for P. falciparum that underpin contemporary questions in malaria control: the entomological inoculation rate (Pf EIR) and the basic reproductive number (PfR). Annual parasite incidence data for 13.449 administrative units in 43 endemic countries were sourced to define the spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission in 2010 and 22.212 P. falciparum parasite rate (Pf PR) surveys were used in a model-based geostatistical (MBG) prediction to create a continuous contemporary surface of malaria endemicity within these limits. A suite of transmission models were developed that link Pf PR to Pf EIR and PfR and these were fitted to field data. These models were combined with the Pf PR map to create new global predictions of Pf EIR and PfR. All output maps included measured uncertainty. An estimated 1.13 and 1.44 billion people worldwide were at risk of unstable and stable P. falciparum malaria. respectively. The majority of the endemic world was predicted with a median Pf EIR of less than one and a median PfRc of less than two.

It is exactly 40 y since the last global map of malaria endemicity was published. This paper describes the generation of a new world map of Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity for the year 2007.   Methods and Findings A total of 8.938 P. falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) surveys were identified using a variety of exhaustive search strategies. Of these. 7.953 passed strict data fidelity tests for inclusion into a global database of PfPR data. age-standardized to 2–10 y for endemicity mapping. A model-based geostatistical procedure was used to create a continuous surface of malaria endemicity within previously defined stable spatial limits of P. falciparum transmission. These procedures were implemented within a Bayesian statistical framework so that the uncertainty of these predictions could be evaluated robustly. The uncertainty was expressed as the probability of predicting correctly one of three endemicity classes; previously stratified to be an informative guide for malaria control. Population at risk estimates. adjusted for the transmission modifying effects of urbanization in Africa. were then derived with reference to human population surfaces in 2007. Of the 1.38 billion people at risk of stable P. falciparum malaria. 0.69 billion were found in Central and South East Asia (CSE Asia). 0.66 billion in Africa.

An evidence-based description of the global range of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and its endemicity has not been assembled in almost 40 y. This paper aims to define the global geographic distribution of P. falciparum malaria in 2007 and to provide a preliminary description of its transmission intensity within this range.   Methods and Findings The global spatial distribution of P. falciparum malaria was generated using nationally reported case-incidence data. medical intelligence. and biological rules of transmission exclusion. using temperature and aridity limits informed by the bionomics of dominant Anopheles vector species. A total of 4.278 spatially unique cross-sectional survey estimates of P. falciparum parasite rates were assembled. Extractions from a population surface showed that 2.37 billion people lived in areas at any risk of P. falciparum transmission in 2007. Globally. almost 1 billion people lived under unstable. or extremely low. malaria risk. Almost all P. falciparum parasite rates above 50% were reported in Africa in a latitude band consistent with the distribution of Anopheles gambiae s.s. Conditions of low parasite prevalence were also common in Africa. however. Outside of Africa.

Here we present the first systematic effort to map the global endemicity of this hitherto neglected parasite.   Methodology and Findings We first updated to the year 2010 our earlier estimate of the geographical limits of P. vivax transmission. Within areas of stable transmission. an assembly of 9.970 geopositioned P. vivax parasite rate (PvPR) surveys collected from 1985 to 2010 were used with a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach to estimate endemicity age-standardised to the 1–99 year age range (PvPR1–99) within every 5×5 km resolution grid square. The model incorporated data on Duffy negative phenotype frequency to suppress endemicity predictions. particularly in Africa. Endemicity was predicted within a relatively narrow range throughout the endemic world. with the point estimate rarely exceeding 7% PvPR1–99. The Americas contributed 22% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission. but high endemic areas were generally sparsely populated and the region contributed only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk (PAR) globally. In Africa. Duffy negativity meant stable transmission was constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn. contributing 3.5% of global PAR. Central Asia was home to 82% of global PAR with important high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations particularly in India and Myanmar.

The aim of the research outlined in this article is to provide a contemporary evidence-based map of the global spatial extent of P. vivax malaria. together with estimates of the human population at risk (PAR) of any level of transmission in 2009.  Methodology The most recent P. vivax case-reporting data that could be obtained for all malaria endemic countries were used to classify risk into three classes: malaria free. unstable (<0.1 case per 1.000 people per annum (p.a.)) and stable (≥0.1 case per 1.000 p.a.) P. vivax malaria transmission. Risk areas were further constrained using temperature and aridity data based upon their relationship with parasite and vector bionomics. Medical intelligence was used to refine the spatial extent of risk in specific areas where transmission was reported to be absent (e.g.. large urban areas and malaria-free islands). The PAR under each level of transmission was then derived by combining the categorical risk map with a high resolution population surface adjusted to 2009. The exclusion of large Duffy negative populations in Africa from the PAR totals was achieved using independent modelling of the gene frequency of this genetic trait. It was estimated that 2.85 billion people were exposed to some risk of P. vivax transmission in 2009. with 57.1% of them living in areas of unstable transmission.

Settlement Patterns and Accessibility across Africa in 2010,2012,Catherine Linard and Marius Gilbert and Robert W Snow and Abdisalan M Noor and Andrew J Tatem,7,PloS one,2,e31743,Public Library of Science,The spatial distribution of populations and settlements across a country and their interconnectivity and accessibility from urban areas are important for delivering healthcare. distributing resources and economic development. However. existing spatially explicit population data across Africa are generally based on outdated. low resolution input demographic data. and provide insufficient detail to quantify rural settlement patterns and. thus. accurately measure population concentration and accessibility. Here we outline approaches to developing a new high resolution population distribution dataset for Africa and analyse rural accessibility to population centers. Contemporary population count data were combined with detailed satellite-derived settlement extents to map population distributions across Africa at a finer spatial resolution than ever before. Substantial heterogeneity in settlement patterns. population concentration and spatial accessibility to major population centres is exhibited across the continent. In Africa. 90% of the population is concentrated in less than 21% of the land surface and the average per-person travel time to settlements of more than 50.000 inhabitants is around 3.5 hours. with Central and East Africa displaying the longest average travel times. The analyses highlight large inequities in access. the isolation of many rural populations and the challenges that exist between countries and regions in providing access to services.

Pathogens and their vectors can now move further. faster and in greater numbers than ever before. Three important consequences of global transport network expansion are infectious disease pandemics. vector invasion events and vector-borne pathogen importation. This review briefly examines some of the important historical examples of these disease and vector movements. such as the global influenza pandemics. the devastating Anopheles gambiae invasion of Brazil and the recent increases in imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases. We then outline potential approaches for future studies of disease movement. focussing on vector invasion and vector-borne disease importation.

Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale. gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible. “Random Forest” estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available. remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at ~100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam. Cambodia. and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches.

The largest recorded outbreak of EVD is ongoing in West Africa. outside of its previously reported and predicted niche. We assembled location data on all recorded zoonotic transmission to humans and Ebola virus infection in bats and primates (1976–2014). Using species distribution models. these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa. Vegetation. elevation. temperature. evapotranspiration. and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship. At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people; however. the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans. Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of EVD in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04395.001,True,wt8NpZgAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC,337,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04395,5161037937372898195,/scholar?cites=5161037937372898195,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04395.pdf,0,0,0

By measuring the uncertainties of movements using entropy. considering both the frequencies and temporal correlations of individual trajectories. we find that the theoretical maximum predictability is as high as 88%. To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached. we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87% for stationary trajectories and 95% for non-stationary trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is highly dependent on historical behaviors and that the maximum predictability is not only a fundamental theoretical limit for potential predictive power. but also an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.,True,wt8NpZgAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC,310,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02923?v=1362363401000%5C'A=0,11929746805167044001,/scholar?cites=11929746805167044001,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02923?v=1362363401000%5C'A=0,0,0,0

Synchrony may arise from three primary mechanisms:(a) dispersal among populations. reducing the size of relatively large populations and increasing relatively small ones; (b) congruent dependence of population dynamics on a synchronous exogenous random factor such as temperature or rainfall. a phenomenon known as the “Moran effect”; and (c) trophic interactions with populations of other species that are themselves spatially synchronous or mobile. Identification of the causes of synchrony is often difficult. In addition to intraspecific synchrony. there are many examples of synchrony among populations of different species. the causes of …,True,X1sH8R0AAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C,754,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132516,10723553064510333444,/scholar?cites=10723553064510333444,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Liebhold/publication/216769888_Spatial_Synchrony_in_Population_Dynamics/links/00b7d5260345748815000000/Spatial-Synchrony-in-Population-Dynamics.pdf,0,0,0

Theoretical studies highlight how synchronizing mechanisms such as dispersal. regionally correlated climatic variables and mobile enemies might interact with local dynamics to produce different patterns of spatial covariance. Specialized statistical methods. applied to large-scale survey data. aid in testing the theoretical predictions with empirical estimates. Observational studies and experiments on the demography of local populations are paramount to identify the true ecological mechanisms.

This frequently leads to roughly equal importance of deterministic and stochastic forces. The resulting tension between noise and determinism makes ecological dynamics unique. with conceptual and methodological challenges distinctive from those in other dynamical systems. The theory for stochastic. nonlinear ecological dynamics has been developed alongside methods to test models. A range of dynamical components has been considered—density dependence. environmental and demographic stochasticity. and climatic forcing—as well as their often complex interactions. We discuss recent advances in understanding ecological dynamics and testing theory using long-term data and review how dynamical forces interact to generate some central field and laboratory time series.,True,X1sH8R0AAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC,595,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/293/5530/638.abstract,12524628567584823543,/scholar?cites=12524628567584823543,,https://projects.au.dk/fileadmin/projects/circe/Bjornstad_Grenfell_2001_Science.pdf,0,0,0

Heterogeneities such as these are generated by variation between individuals in their exposure to parasite infective stages and by differences in their susceptibility once an infectious agent has been encountered. Experimental studies have shown that the extent of spatial aggregation in the infective stage distribution is reflected in the level of parasite aggregation across hosts (Keymer and Anderson 1979). Moreover. in the absence of any heterogeneity in exposure. even small differences in susceptibility between hosts can rapidly produce non-random. aggregated distributions of parasites (Anderson and May 1978). What is unclear at present. is the relative significance of these different mechanisms. and the importance of interactions between mechanisms in accentuating individual differences in parasite loads. Mathematical models that examine these problems rapidly become intractable (Grenfell et al. 1995). while experimental studies and computer simulations also become rather complex.Some of the variation in parasite loads we observe is predictable. For example. in mammals and some other taxa. males tend to be more heavily infected than females. perhaps due to differences in immune function (Poulin 1996a. Schalk and Forbes 1997. McCurdy et al. 1998).

The critical community size separating the two regimes was ∼300 000–500 000. We develop a model. the TSIR (Time‐series Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model. that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the transmission rates.

To improve statistical inference about spatial covariance. we propose a continuous nonparametric estimator of the covariance function in place of the spatial correlogram. The spline correlogram is an adaptation of a recent development in spatial statistics and is a generalization of the commonly used correlogram. We propose a bootstrap algorithm to erect a confidence envelope around the entire covariance function. The meaning of this envelope is discussed. Not all functions that can be drawn inside the envelope are candidate covariance functions. as they may not be positive semidefinite. However. covariance functions that do not fit. are not supported by the data.

Failure to account for spatial autocorrelation can lead to incorrect conclusions regarding both the absolute and relative importance of environmental variables as determinants of abundance. We consider several classes of statistical models that are appropriate for modeling environment‐abundance relationships in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. and apply these to three case studies: 1) abundance of voles in relation to habitat characteristics; 2) a plant competition experiment; and 3) abundance of Orbatid mites along environmental gradients.

Moreover. censuses may occur sporadically. and observation errors change with sample methods and effort. The state variable (usually density or abundance) may be hidden from view and known only through highly indirect observational schemes (such as public health records. hunting reports. or fossil/archeological surveys).

Development and survival rates of both the Anopheles mosquitoes and the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria depend on temperature. making this a potential driver of mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission. We developed a temperature-dependent. stage-structured delayed differential equation model to better understand how climate determines risk. Including the full mosquito life cycle in the model reveals that the mosquito population abundance is more sensitive to temperature than previously thought because it is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the juvenile mosquito stages whose vital rates are also temperature-dependent. Additionally. the model predicts a peak in abundance of mosquitoes old enough to vector malaria at more accurate temperatures than previous models.

Based on time series data for hare and lynx. we show that the dominant dimensional structure of the hare series appears to be three whereas that of the lynx is two. The three-dimensional structure of the hare time series is hypothesized to be due to a three-trophic level model in which the hare may be seen as simultaneously regulated from below and above. The plant species in the hare diet appear compensatory to one another. and the predator species may. likewise. be seen as an internally compensatory guild. The lynx time series are. in contrast. consistent with a model of donor control in which their populations are regulated from below by prey availability.

How are they distributed among taxa? Are there differences between different regions of the world. or along latitudinal gradients? Using the new Global Population Dynamics Database we analysed nearly 700 long (25+ years) time series of animal field populations. looking for large-scale patterns in cycles. Nearly 30% of the time series were cyclic. Cycle incidence varied among taxonomic classes. being most common in mammal and fish populations. but only in fish did cycle incidence vary among orders. Cycles were equally common in European and North American populations. but were more common in Atlantic fish than Pacific fish. The incidence of cycles increased with latitude in mammals only. There was no latitudinal gradient in cycle period. but cycle amplitude declined with latitude in some groups of fish. Even after considering the biases in the data source and expected type I error. population cycles seem common enough to warrant ecological attention.,True,X1sH8R0AAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC,211,https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-macroecology-of-population-dynamics-taxonomic-and-biogeograph,480459200319668061,/scholar?cites=480459200319668061,,,0,0,0

However. examples of such patterns in ecological systems are scarce. We develop a quantitative technique to demonstrate the existence of waves in Central European larch budmoth (Zeiraphera diniana Gn.) outbreaks. We show that these waves travel toward the northeast-east at 210 kilometers per year. A theoretical model involving a moth-enemy interaction predicts directional waves. but only if dispersal is directionally biased or habitat productivity varies across the landscape.

Ltd.,Community variability has a dual nature. On the one hand. there is compositional variability. changes in the relative abundance of component species. On the other hand. there is aggregate variability. changes in summary properties such as total abundance. biomass. or production. Although these two aspects of variability have received much individual attention. few studies have explicitly related the compositional and aggregate variability of natural communities. In this paper. we show how simultaneous consideration of both aspects of community variability might advance our understanding of ecological communities. We use the distinction between compositional and aggregate variability to develop an organizational framework for describing patterns of community variability.

Similarly. the spread of established invaders into new habitats can be influenced by the degree to which small founder populations ahead of the invasion front are suppressed through Allee effects. We develop an approach to use empirical data on the gypsy moth. a non‐indigenous invader in North America. to quantify the Allee threshold across geographical regions. and we report that the strength of the Allee effect is subject to spatial and temporal variability.

Analysis of 21 time series from 1821 to the present demonstrates that these fluctuations are generated by nonlinear processes with regulatory delays. Trophic interactions between lynx and hares cause delayed density-dependent regulation of lynx population growth. The nonlinearity. in contrast. appears to arise from phase dependencies in hunting success by lynx through the cycle. Using a combined approach of empirical. statistical. and mathematical modeling. we highlight how shifts in trophic interactions between the lynx and the hare generate the nonlinear process primarily by shifting functional response curves during the increase and the decrease phases.,True,X1sH8R0AAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C,180,https://www.pnas.org/content/95/26/15430.short,10146123055205054280,/scholar?cites=10146123055205054280,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/95/26/15430.full.pdf,0,0,0

Trends in abundance. in contrast. are usually ascribed to human exploitation and large-scale environmental changes. In this study. we demonstrate. through statistical modeling of survey data (1921–1994) of cod from the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. that both short- and long-term variability may arise from the same set of age-structured interactions. Asymmetric competition and cannibalism between cohorts generate alternating years of high and low abundance. Intercohort interactions also resonate the recruitment variability so that long-term trends are induced. The coupling of age-structure and variable recruitment should. therefore. be considered when explaining both the short- and long-term fluctuations displayed by the coastal cod populations.

By measuring the uncertainties of movements using entropy. considering both the frequencies and temporal correlations of individual trajectories. we find that the theoretical maximum predictability is as high as 88%. To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached. we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87% for stationary trajectories and 95% for non-stationary trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is highly dependent on historical behaviors and that the maximum predictability is not only a fundamental theoretical limit for potential predictive power. but also an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.,True,1M5hoE4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,310,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02923?v=1362363401000%5C'A=0,11929746805167044001,/scholar?cites=11929746805167044001,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02923?v=1362363401000%5C'A=0,0,0,0

Developing measures for human and social capital grounded in previous research. we find that either of these variables have considerably higher predictive power than the standard financial model in predicting which firms stay in business and which firms that default. With regards to new firms in high-technology and service industries. the traditional financial model does not beat the predictive accuracy of simply flipping a coin.,True,1M5hoE4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,41,https://jpe.pm-research.com/content/12/2/30.abstract,13898129842092948407,/scholar?cites=13898129842092948407,,,0,0,0

1121889,Tissue-specific expression and regulatory networks of pig microRNAome,2014,Paolo Martini and Gabriele Sales and Mattia Brugiolo and Alessandro Gandaglia and Filippo Naso and Cristiano De Pitta and Michele Spina and Gino Gerosa and Francesco Chemello and Chiara Romualdi and Stefano Cagnin and Gerolamo Lanfranchi,9,PloS one,4,e89755,Public Library of Science,Background Despite the economic and medical importance of the pig. knowledge about its genome organization. gene expression regulation. and molecular mechanisms involved in physiological processes is far from that achieved for mouse and rat. the two most used model organisms in biomedical research. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a wide class of molecules that exert a recognized role in gene expression modulation. but only 280 miRNAs in pig have been characterized to date.  Results We applied a novel computational approach to predict species-specific and conserved miRNAs in the pig genome. which were then subjected to experimental validation. We experimentally identified candidate miRNAs sequences grouped in high-confidence (424) and medium-confidence (353) miRNAs according to RNA-seq results. A group of miRNAs was also validated by PCR experiments. We established the subtle variability in expression of isomiRs and miRNA-miRNA star couples supporting a biological function for these molecules. Finally. miRNA and mRNA expression profiles produced from the same sample of 20 different tissue of the animal were combined. using a correlation threshold to filter miRNA-target predictions. to identify tissue-specific regulatory networks.  Conclusions Our data represent a significant progress in the current understanding of miRNAome in pig. The identification of miRNAs. their target mRNAs. and the construction of regulatory circuits will provide new insights into the complex biological networks in several tissues of this important animal model.,True,x2XdrH8AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,23,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089755,16127252697894336018,/scholar?cites=16127252697894336018,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089755,0,0,0

1121890,MicroRNA-27a contributes to rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation by suppressing RARA and RXRA,2015,Lucia Tombolan and Matteo Zampini and Silvia Casara and Elena Boldrin and Angelica Zin and Gianni Bisogno and Angelo Rosolen and Cristiano De Pittà and Gerolamo Lanfranchi,10,PLoS One,4,e0125171,Public Library of Science,Background Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are rare but very aggressive childhood tumors that arise as a consequence of a regulatory disruption in the growth and differentiation pathways of myogenic precursor cells. According to morphological criteria. there are two major RMS subtypes: embryonal RMS (ERMS) and alveolar RMS (ARMS) with the latter showing greater aggressiveness and metastatic potential with respect to the former. Efforts to unravel the complex molecular mechanisms underlying RMS pathogenesis and progression have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in tumorigenesis.   Methodology/Principal Findings The expression profiles of 8 different RMS cell lines were analyzed to investigate the involvement of miRNAs in RMS. The miRNA population from each cell line was compared to a reference sample consisting of a balanced pool of total RNA extracted from those 8 cell lines. Sixteen miRNAs whose expression discriminates between translocation-positive ARMS and negative RMS were identified. Attention was focused on the role of miR-27a that is up-regulated in the more aggressive RMS cell lines (translocation-positive ARMS) in which it probably acts as an oncogene. MiR-27a overexpressing cells showed a significant increase in their proliferation rate that was paralleled by a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. It was possible to demonstrate that miR-27a is implicated in cell cycle control by targeting the retinoic acid alpha receptor (RARA) and retinoic X receptor alpha (RXRA).

1121891,Systematic sequencing of mRNA from the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and first tissue specific transcriptional signature,2008,Cristiano De Pittà and Cristiano Bertolucci and Gabriella M Mazzotta and Filippo Bernante and Giorgia Rizzo and Barbara De Nardi and Alberto Pallavicini and Gerolamo Lanfranchi and Rodolfo Costa,9,BMC genomics,1,1-14,BioMed Central,Little is known about the genome sequences of Euphausiacea (krill) although these crustaceans are abundant components of the pelagic ecosystems in all oceans and used for aquaculture and pharmaceutical industry. This study reports the results of an expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing project from different tissues of Euphausia superba (the Antarctic krill). We have constructed and sequenced five cDNA libraries from different Antarctic krill tissues: head. abdomen. thoracopods and photophores. We have identified 1.770 high-quality ESTs which were assembled into 216 overlapping clusters and 801 singletons resulting in a total of 1.017 non-redundant sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify and validate the expression levels of ten genes presenting different EST countings in krill tissues. In addition. bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant E. superba sequences identified 69 microsatellite containing ESTs. Clusters. consensuses and related similarity and gene ontology searches were organized in a dedicated E. superba database                      http://krill.cribi.unipd.it                                        . We defined the first tissue transcriptional signatures of E. superba based on functional categorization among the examined tissues. The analyses of annotated transcripts showed a higher similarity with genes from insects with respect to Malacostraca possibly as an effect of the limited number of Malacostraca sequences in the public databases.

Antarctic krill eggs hatch in the aphotic zone up to 1000 m depth and larvae develop on their way to the ocean surface (development ascent) and are exposed to different quality (wavelength) and quantity (irradiance) of light. Adults show a daily vertical migration pattern. moving downward during the day and upward during the night within the top 200 m of the water column. Seawater acts as a potent chromatic filter and animals have evolved different opsin photopigments to perceive photons of specific wavelengths. We have investigated the transcriptome of E. superba and. using a candidate gene approach. we identified six novel opsins. Five are r-type visual opsins: four middle-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh2. EsRh3. EsRh4 and EsRh5) and one long-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh6).

In approximately 75% of cases. ARMSs are characterized by specific chromosomal translocations that involve PAX and FKHR genes. ARMS gene expression signatures vary. depending on the presence or absence of the translocations. Insulin-like growth factor–binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) is strongly overexpressed in translocation-negative RMS. Because IGFBP2 is associated with tumorigenesis. we investigated its functional role in RMS. An analysis of IGFBP2 distribution in RMS cell lines revealed a strong accumulation in the Golgi complex. in which morphological characteristics appeared peculiarly modified. After silencing IGFBP2 expression. our microarray analysis revealed mostly cell cycle and actin cytoskeleton gene modulations. In parallel.

Our method consists of a two-step subtraction of the most abundant mRNAs: the first step involves a novel use of oligo-directed RNase H digestion to lower the concentration of tissue-specific. super-prevalent RNAs. In the second step. a highly specific subtraction is achieved through hybridization with probes from a 3′-end ESTs collection. By applying this technique in skeletal muscle. we have constructed subtracted cDNA libraries that are effectively enriched for genes expressed at low levels. We further report on frequent premature termination of transcription in human muscle mitochondria and discuss the importance of this phenomenon in designing …,True,x2XdrH8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,20,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/30/9/e38/1089019,11169369170885176272,/scholar?cites=11169369170885176272,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/30/9/e38/1089019,0,0,0

The precise composition of propolis varies with the source. and over 300 chemical components belonging to the flavonoids. terpenes. and phenolic acids have been identified in propolis. Moreover. its chemical composition is subjected to the geographical location. botanical origin. and bee species. Propolis and its compounds have been the focus of many works due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity; however. it is now recognized that propolis also possesses regenerative properties. There is an increasing interest in the healing potential of natural products. considering the availability and low cost of these products. Propolis contains a huge number of compounds that explicate some biological effects that speeds up the healing process and is widely used in folk remedies.

First identified in 1973. as one of a group of chromatin-associated proteins with high acidic and basic amino acid content. it was so named for its characteristic rapid mobility in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. HMGB1 was later discovered to have another function. It is released from a variety of cells into the extracellular milieu to act on specific cell-surface receptors. In this latter role. HMGB1 is a proinflammatory cytokine that may contribute to many inflammatory diseases. including sepsis. Therefore.

Neutral red uptake showed that ascorbate. but not dehydroascorbate. was highly toxic in the MMe cell lines REN and MM98. and less toxic in immortalized (human mesothelial cells-htert) and primary mesothelial cells. Ascorbate transport inhibitors phloretin. sodium azide. and ouabain did not reduce ascorbate toxicity.

Light energy is captured by a variety of pigments. usually bound to proteins. which vary with different types of organisms. We report here the 1.45 Å resolution three-dimensional structure of one such pigment protein. C-phycocyanin. from Synechococcus elongatus. The structure is at the highest resolution achieved for any such phycobiliprotein. This level of resolution was made possible by implementing a novel crystallization method whereby nucleation is decoupled from subsequent growth. by incubating crystallizing drops for 7 h under nucleation conditions and then transferring them to metastable conditions for growth.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1402,1337-1344,The Royal Society,This paper addresses the question of whether the PsbS protein of photosystem two (PS II) is located within the LHC II–PS II supercomplex for which a three–dimensional structure has been obtained by cryoelectron microscopy and single particle analysis. The PsbS protein has recently been implicated as the site for non–photochemical quenching. Based both on immunoblotting analyses and structural considerations of an improved model of the spinach LHC II–PS II supercomplex. we conclude that the PsbS protein is not located within the supercomplex.

To date. the venom has been found to contain five insecticidal toxins. termed α. β. γ. δ and ε-latroinsectotoxins (LITs). There is also a vertebrate-specific neurotoxin. α-latrotoxin (α-LTX). and one toxin affecting crustaceans. α-latrocrustatoxin (α-LCT). These toxins stimulate massive release of neurotransmitters from nerve terminals and act (1) by binding to specific receptors. some of which mediate an exocytotic signal. and (2) by inserting themselves into the membrane and forming ion-permeable pores.

Vibrio cholerae has been reported to be associated with a variety of living organisms. including animals with an exoskeleton of chitin. aquatic plants. protozoa. bivalves. waterbirds. as well as abiotic substrates (e.g. sediments). Most of these are well‐known or putative environmental reservoirs for the bacterium. defined as places where the pathogen lives over time. with the potential to be released and to cause human infection. Environmental reservoirs also serve as V. cholerae disseminators and vectors. They can be responsible for the start of an epidemic. may be critical to cholera endemicity. and affect the evolution of pathogen virulence.

In Europe. higher prevalence of human infections followed regional climatic trends with outbreaks occurring during episodes of unusually warm weather. Similar patterns were also observed in Vibrio-associated diseases affecting marine organisms such as fish. bivalves and corals. Basic knowledge is still lacking on the ecology and evolutionary biology of these bacteria as well as on their virulence mechanisms. Current limitations in experimental systems to study infection and the lack of diagnostic tools still prevent a better understanding of Vibrio emergence. A major challenge is to foster cooperation between fundamental and applied research in order to investigate the consequences of pathogen emergence in natural Vibrio populations and answer federative questions that meet societal needs.

Bivalves possess both humoral and cellular defence mechanisms that operate in a co‐ordinated way to kill and eliminate infecting bacteria. Vibrio species are very abundant in coastal waters and are commonly isolated from edible bivalves tissues where they can persist after depuration processes in controlled waters. Such observations indicate that vibrios are regular components of bivalve microflora and that the molluscs can represent an important ecological niche for these bacteria.

Under fluctuating light conditions. fast reversible phosphorylation of the N-terminal thylakoid protein domains and changes in electrostatic forces induce modifications in thylakoid organization. To gain insight into the role and dynamics of thylakoid protein phosphorylation. we used targeted proteomics to quantify amounts of the structural proteins CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 (CURT1). including the levels of CURT1B N terminus phosphorylation and acetylation. after short-term fluctuating light treatments of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).

The chloroplast NADH-dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) participates in one CEF route transferring electrons from ferredoxin back to the plastoquinone pool with concomitant proton pumping to the lumen. CEF has been proposed to balance the ratio of ATP/NADPH production and to control the redox poise particularly in fluctuating light conditions. but the mechanisms regulating the NDH complex remain unknown. We have investigated the regulation of the CEF pathways by the chloroplast NADPH-thioredoxin reductase (NTRC) in vivo by using an Arabidopsis knockout line of NTRC as well as lines overexpressing NTRC. Here we present biochemical and biophysical evidence showing that NTRC activates the NDH-dependent CEF and regulates the generation of proton motive force. thylakoid conductivity to protons and redox homeostasis between the thylakoid electron transfer chain and the stroma during changes in light conditions.

This protein has also been shown to function as a cytokine and to stimulate keratinocyte scratch wound healing. Due to the importance of finding new wound healing molecules. we have studied the effects of HMGb1 on fibroblasts. another major skin cell type. using the NIH 3T3 line. HMGb1 expression in these cells was assessed by Western blot. while its nuclear localization was pointed out by confocal immunofluorescence. HMGb1-induced cell proliferation with a maximum at a concentration of 10 nM. and such a dose also stimulated cell migration and scratch wound healing. Western blot analysis showed that HMGb1 activates ERK1/2. while the use of an anti-RAGE receptor-blocking antibody and of the selective MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 blocked ERK1/2 activation and wound healing responses to HMGb1.

Our aim was to determine whether HMGB1 affects glutamatergic transmission by monitoring neurotransmitter release from glial (gliosomes) and neuronal (synaptosomes) re‐sealed subcellular particles isolated from cerebellum and hippocampus. HMGB1 induced release of the glutamate analogue [3H]d‐aspartate form gliosomes in a concentration‐dependent manner. whereas nerve terminals were insensitive to the protein. The HMGB1‐evoked release of [3H]d‐aspartate was independent of modifications of cytosolic Ca2+ . but it was blocked by dl‐threo‐β‐benzyloxyaspartate (dl‐TBOA). an inhibitor of glutamate transporters. HMGB1 also stimulated the release of endogenous glutamate in a Ca2+‐independent and dl‐TBOA‐sensitive manner.

Vincristine-resistant cells respond more rapidly to hybrid polar/apolar inducers than the parental cells. These vincristine-resistant MELCs contain elevated levels of the beta isozyme of PKC (PKC-beta).

Neither rat PKC-beta. nor mouse PKC-alpha. nor rat PKC-alpha. incorporated into permeabilized MELCs. is effective in altering the kinetics of induced differentiation.

However. the mechanisms responsible for this effect of HMGB1 are still unknown.   Principal Findings Here we demonstrate that. at concentrations of agonist per se ineffective. HMGB1 potentiates the activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in isolated hippocampal nerve terminals and in a neuroblastoma cell line. This effect was abolished by the NMDA channel blocker MK-801. The HMGB1-facilitated NMDAR opening was followed by activation of the Ca2+-dependent enzymes calpain and nitric oxide synthase in neuroblastoma cells. resulting in an increased production of NO. a consequent enhanced cell motility. and onset of morphological differentiation. We have also identified NMDAR as the mediator of HMGB1-stimulated murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation. induced by hexamethylenebisacetamide. The potentiation of NMDAR activation involved a peptide of HMGB1 located in the B box at the amino acids 130–139. This HMGB1 fragment did not overlap with binding sites for other cell surface receptors of HMGB1. such as the advanced glycation end products or the Toll-like receptor 4. Moreover. in a competition assay. the HMGB1(130–139) peptide displaced the NMDAR/HMGB1 interaction. suggesting that it comprised the molecular and functional site of HMGB1 regulating the NMDA receptor complex.

Low carbon tetrachloride amounts stimulate total protein kinase C activity. while one order of magnitude higher amounts exert strong enzyme inhibition. The latter effect is due to an early inactivation followed with progress of time by a proteolytic degradation of the enzyme. A pathological recruitment of the calcium-dependent protein kinase C regulatory enzymes calpain and calpastatin appears responsible for protein kinase C loss. The prolonged excess of cytosolic calcium which characterizes the single high dose carbon tetrachloride poisoning also leads to inactivation of calpain II and calpastatin in a time-dependent manner.,True,8PDS_z4AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,33,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X83718681,5928096428007362826,/scholar?cites=5928096428007362826,,,0,0,0

It has been suggested that. as a parameter subjected to intense directional selection. the level of additive genetic variance expressed should be reduced; on the other hand. theoretical models of host–parasite coevolution assume that variation in parasite resistance has a genetic basis. Contradictory results have been reported in birds. since the heritability of immune responses varies from nil to high. In this study of Grey Partridge (Perdix perdix (L.. 1758)). we examined the heritability of immune condition (PHA reaction. an index of T-cell-mediated immunocompetence) and of some parameters traditionally considered important for chick survival. such as egg mass and chick growth. Two statistical approaches were used: parent–offspring regression and full-sibling intra-clutch repeatability.

Here we show that adipocyte-specific deletion of Arntl (also known as Bmal1). a gene encoding a core molecular clock component. results in obesity in mice with a shift in the diurnal rhythm of food intake. a result that is not seen when the gene is disrupted in hepatocytes or pancreatic islets. Changes in the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate appetite are consistent with feedback from the adipocyte to the central nervous system to time feeding behavior. Ablation of the adipocyte clock is associated with a reduced number of polyunsaturated fatty acids in adipocyte triglycerides. This difference between mutant and wild-type mice is reflected in the circulating concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids and nonesterified polyunsaturated fatty acids in hypothalamic neurons that regulate food …,True,5UMOZ_cAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC,324,https://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v18/n12/full/nm.2979.html,14658424264532478307,/scholar?cites=14658424264532478307,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782286/,0,0,0

Often overlooked for its metabolic potential. ketosis is poorly understood outside of starvation or diabetic crisis. Thus. we studied the biochemical advantages of ketosis in humans using a ketone ester-based form of nutrition without the unwanted milieu of endogenous ketone body production by caloric or carbohydrate restriction. In five separate studies of 39 high-performance athletes. we show how this unique metabolic state improves physical endurance by altering fuel competition for oxidative respiration. Ketosis decreased muscle glycolysis and plasma lactate concentrations. while providing an alternative substrate for oxidative phosphorylation.

In addition to glucose which most commonly supplies carbon units for DNL. fructose is also a profoundly lipogenic substrate that can drive DNL. important when considering the increasing use of fructose in corn syrup as a sweetener. In the context of disease. DNL is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease. a common condition often associated with the metabolic syndrome and consequent insulin resistance.

1122203,Alterations of cAMP-dependent signaling in dystrophic skeletal muscle,2013,Rüdiger Rudolf and Muzamil Majid Khan and Danilo Lustrino and Siegfried Labeit and Isis do Carmo Kettelhut and Luiz Carlos Carvalho Navegantes,4,,,290,Frontiers,Autonomic regulation processes in striated muscles are largely mediated by cAMP/PKA-signaling. In order to achieve specificity of signaling its spatial-temporal compartmentation plays a critical role. We discuss here how specificity of cAMP/PKA-signaling can be achieved in skeletal muscle by spatio-temporal compartmentation. While a microdomain containing PKA type I in the region of the neuromuscular junction is important for post-synaptic. activity-dependent stabilization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. PKA type I and II microdomains in the sarcomeric part of skeletal muscle are likely to play different roles. including the regulation of muscle homeostasis. These microdomains are due to specific A-kinase anchoring proteins. like rapsyn and myospryn. Importantly. recent evidence indicates that compartmentation of the cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling pathway and pharmacological activation of cAMP production are aberrant in different skeletal muscles disorders. Thus. we discuss here their potential as targets for palliative treatment of certain forms of dystrophy and myasthenia. Under physiological conditions. the neuropeptide. α-calcitonin-related peptide. as well as beta-adrenergic agonists are the most-mentioned natural triggers for activating cAMP/PKA signaling in skeletal muscle. While the precise domains and functions of these first messengers are still under investigation. agonists of β2-adrenoceptors clearly exhibit anabolic activity under normal conditions and reduce protein degradation during atrophic periods. Past and recent studies suggest direct sympathetic innervation of skeletal muscle fibers.

We examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of CGRP on protein breakdown and signaling pathways in control skeletal muscles and muscles following denervation (DEN) in rats. In isolated muscles.

The snails were dissected 1. 2. 3. and 4 weeks after infection to collect the hemolymph and shell. An increase in calcemia was observed in snails infected with both miracidial doses. A significant decrease in the calcium ions in the shell was observed. coinciding with the calcemia peak in the hemolymph. This indicates greater mobilization of calcium between the shell and hemolymph to regulate the calcium content in the body when the snail is exposed to stress conditions. as has also been observed in some other infected snail species.

After 2 and 4 weeks of exposure the snails were dissected. The cholesterol content at the 2nd and 4th weeks post exposure only varied significantly in the groups exposed at 24 hours and 0 hour of photophase. respectively. Probably. such increase may be a result of a rise in cholesterol biosynthesis and/or remodelling of cell membranes. There were no significant differences among the content of triglycerides in the snails exposed to 6. 12. 18 and 24 hours of photophase during two weeks. The snails exposed to intermediate photophase (6 and 12 hours) had the triglycerides content increased. ranging over values near to those observed in the group exposed to 0 hour. Results showed that triglycerides metabolism in A. fulica are more influenced by photoperiod than cholesterol metabolism.

Decreases in this proteolytic system during chronic muscle disuse are thought to prevent the excessive loss of muscle mass. However. the intracellular pathways that elicit this response are elusive. In turn. this study was performed to shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. For this. C57/BL6 male mice (~30g) were anesthetized and submitted to motor denervation (DEN) by unilateral sciatic nerve section. After 3. 7 and 14 days. tibialis anterior muscles were harvested to examine: mRNA and protein levels of atrophy‐related genes (i.e atrogenes; MuRF1 and atrogin‐1) and different components of cAMP‐signaling. including muscle cAMP levels. the PKA activity (estimated by phospho‐PKA substrates) and the phospho‐CREB and …,True,zyhi070AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.28.1_supplement.1162.9,,,,,0,0,0

Indeed. the serotonergic neurons are the earliest to be generated and can modulate neuronal plasticity. Some studies showed that brain 5‐HT depletion in the neonatal period leads to a plastic cytoarchitectonic change of the serotonergic system. which influences several brain systems ontogeny. Therefore. we investigated the effect of systemic pCPA (p‐chloro‐phenylalanine) injection (100mg/kg. sc). from the 8th at 16th post‐natal day. on the behavioral response of adults female and male rats. For this purpose. we use the forced swimming. open field and elevated plus maze tests. Male rats programmed with pCPA had longer time spent in open arms in plus maze test and lower immobility time in forced swimming test than the controls (148.8±8.8 vs. 99.7±21.4s and 109.0±7.8 vs. 158.1±18.2s. respectively …,True,zyhi070AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.26.1_supplement.904.8,,,,,0,0,0

The snails were dissected one. two. three and four weeks after infection to collect the hemolymph and DGG tissue. to measure the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the hemolymph and neutral lipids in the tissue. The results for the hemolymph showed a similar order of variation for both substrates tested in the first week after infection. The reduced levels of these lipids in the infected snails indicate intense use of these substrates both by the intermediate host and the parasite. suggesting its probable participation in the energy metabolism and structural construction of the developing larval stages. Alterations in the profile of neutral lipids in the DGG were also found. The results obtained indicate that in this model. the lipid metabolism depends on the miracidial dose used.,True,zyhi070AAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC,0,https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/16074,,,,,0,0,0

Despite progress. studies on this topic are still under discussion. We analyzed 37 humic fractions with respect to their isotopic composition. structural characteristics. and properties responsible for stimulating plant root parameters. We showed that regardless of the source of origin of the carbon (C 3 or C 4). soil-extracted HSs and humic acids (HAs) are structurally similar to each other. The more labile and functionalized HS fraction is responsible for root emission. whereas the more recalcitrant and less functionalized HA fraction is related to root growth. Labile structures promote root stimulation at lower concentrations. while recalcitrant structures require higher concentrations to promote a similar stimulus.

The rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L. cv. IACUB-30) was grown in nutrient solution and HA were extracted from vermicompost and analysed using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic and chemical methods. Changes in plant anatomy and morphology before and after stress initiation were employed as biomarkers of plant response. The growth rate over time. water content. dry-mass content. leaf carbohydrates. protein content and amino-acid content were among the parameters evaluated. Peroxidases (POX) activity. proline content. H 2 O 2 content and membrane permeability were also studied. The results show that HA induced POX activity leading to a reduction in H 2 O 2 content and greater conservation of membrane permeability. These results indicate that the HA play an important role as ecological and safety alternative to prevent oxidative stress in plant caused by drought stress.

In many cases the contamination is due to anthropogenic activities. and. sometimes. it comes from illegal waste disposal due to uncontrolled industrial development. One of the ways of solving metal soil contamination is by soil washing using a chelating biodegradable agent (EDDS). However. the resulting liquid wastes that contain the extracted metals and chelating agents have to be submitted to further treatments for a complete detoxification before being discharged into the environment. The simultaneous removal of EDDS and three metals (Cu. Fe and Zn) from both synthetic waters (home prepared) and real contaminated soil washing mixtures at neutral pH has been investigated. a lab-scale. considering four artificial solar driven photocatalytic technologies (TiO2/hν/N2.

Despite scientific advances. in South America the principal control method for ticks is the use of chemical acaricides. Indiscriminate use of these products causes environmental pollution. food contamination and development of tick resistance to acaricides. In vitro studies and field trials have demonstrated that pathogenic fungal isolates not only cause mortality of many tick species. but also reduce subsequent generations due to effects on their reproductive efficacy.

In an effort to identify Beauveria spp. isolates with promise for use in biological control settings with high insolation. we examined 53 Beauveria bassiana isolates. 7 isolates of 4 other Beauveria spp. and Engyodontium albus (=Beauveria alba). The origins of these fungi varied widely as to host/substrate and country. but approximately 30% of these isolates were B. bassiana from ticks in Brazil. A preliminary trial with three B. bassiana isolates (Bb 19.

As infecções foram realizadas utilizando amostra de M. anisopliae isolada de carrapatos. A suspensão de conídios do fungo foi preparada utilizando água destilada e espalhante adesivo Tween 80 e foi quantificada na concentração de 10 8 conídios/ml. As fêmeas ingurgitadas foram banhadas nesta suspensão durante cinco minutos e. após este período. foram levadas à câmara climatizada. Três dias após a infecção. as fêmeas foram fixadas utilizando tetróxido de ósmio e glutaraldeído. posteriormente desidratadas em bateria de álcool etílico com acetona. Após a desidratação. esse material foi levado à metalização e ao microscópio eletrônico de varredura. onde se observou a fixação dos conídios na cutícula das fêmeas. havendo germinação e a dilatação da extremidade do tubo germinativo em todas as amostras. Esta dilatação observada foi devido à formação do apressório. apesar de não ser possível observar esta estrutura sobre a cutícula das fêmeas ingurgitadas. O tetróxido de ósmio mostrou ser um excelente fixador para fungos. enquanto o glutaraldeído mostrou ser eficiente na fixação do artrópode. Conclui-se que a forma principal de penetração deste entomopatógeno em B. microplus é através da cutícula.

Rural. sér. ciênc. vida. 19 (1-2): 65-71.-The indiscriminated use of acaricides against Boophilus microplus in Brazil has caused many problems. such as environmental pollution and development of resistance. To minimize these problems. there has been an increased interest in the use of the pathogens (eg M etarhizium anisopliae. Beauveria bassiana and Cedecea lapagei) as an alternative control strategy. Our purpose was to test the efficacy of B. bassiana against B. microplus. The engorged females were exposed to two different isolares of this fungus B. bassiana (ESALQ 747 and 986) by immersion in conidial suspension.

Samples of M. anisopliae isolated from naturally infected ticks were used to prepare a suspension of 108 conidia/ml in a destilled water with 2% of Tween 80.

Three days after the infection. females were fixed in either osmium tetroxide or glutaraldehyde. and dehydrated in alcohol/acetone for SEM. Fixation of conidia in the cuticle. formation of germinative tube and appressoria were seem. It was suggested that the penetration of this entomopathogenic fungus is primarily through the cuticle.

Whereas some species cope successfully with these environmental changes. others may go extinct. In the case of parasite communities. the expansion of urban areas has a critical effect by changing the availability of suitable substrates for the eggs or free-larval stages of those species with direct life cycles or for the range of hosts of those species with complex cycles. In this study we investigated the influence of the degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity on helminth richness. abundance and community structure of rufous-bellied thrushes (Turdus rufiventris) along a rural-urban gradient in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre. State of Rio Grande do Sul. Brazil. This common native bird species of southern Brazil hosts 15 endoparasite species at the study region. A total of 144 thrushes were collected with mist nets at 11 sites. The degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity were estimated by quantifying five landscape elements: buildings. woodlands. fields. bare lands. and water. Landscape analyses were performed at two spatial scales (10 and 100 ha) taking into account home range size and the potential dispersal distance of thrushes and their prey (intermediate hosts). Mean parasite richness showed an inverse relationship with the degree of urbanization. but a positive relationship with environmental heterogeneity. Changes in the structure of component communities along the rural-urban gradient resulted from responses to the availability of particular landscape elements that are compatible with the …,True,bdg2ot4AAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC,47,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103144,7891306884664244525,/scholar?cites=7891306884664244525,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103144,0,0,0

Their impact is therefore expected to be strong in parasites with complex life cycles and multiple. strikingly different. developmental stages. i.e. developmental plasticity. Some studies have already described how the chromatin structure. through histone modifications. varies from a developmental stage to another in a few unicellular parasites. While H3K4me3 profiles remain relatively constant. H3K27 trimethylation and bivalent methylation show strong variation. Inhibitors (A366 and GSK343) of H3K27 histone methyltransferase activity in S. mansoni efficiently blocked miracidium to sporocyst transition indicating that H3K27 trimethylation is required for life cycle progression. As S. mansoni is a multicellular parasite that significantly affects both the health and economy of endemic areas. a better understanding of fluke developmental processes within the definitive host will likely highlight novel disease control strategies. Towards this goal. we also studied H4K20me1 in female cercariae and adults. In particular. we found that bivalent trimethylation of H3K4 and H3K27 at the transcription start site of genes is a landmark of the cercarial stage. In cercariae. H3K27me3 presence and strong enrichment in H4K20me1 over long regions (10–100 kb) is associated with development related genes. Here. we provide a broad overview of the chromatin structure of a metazoan parasite throughout its most important lifecycle stages.

The digenetic parasite Schistosoma mansoni needs fresh water to compete its life cycle. There. it is susceptible to soluble compounds that can affect directly and/or indirectly the parasite’s biology. The cercariae stage is one of the key points in which the parasite is vulnerable to different soluble compounds that can significantly alter the parasite’s life cycle. Molluscicides are recommended by the World Health Organization for the control of schistosomiasis transmission and Euphorbia milii latex is effective against snails intermediate hosts.   Methodology/Principal findings We used parasitological tools and electron microscopy to verify the effects of cercariae exposure to natural molluscicide (Euphorbia milii latex) on morphology. physiology and fitness of adult parasite worms. In order to generate insights into key metabolic pathways that lead to the observed phenotypes we used comparative transcriptomics and proteomics.   Conclusions/Significance We describe here that the effect of latex on the adult is not due to direct toxicity but it triggers an early change in developmental trajectory and perturbs cell memory. mobility. energy metabolism and other key pathways. We conclude that latex has not only an effect on the vector but applies also long lasting schistosomastatic action. We believe that these results are of interest not only to parasitologists since it shows that natural compounds. presumably without side effects. can have an impact that occurred unexpectedly on developmental processes. Such collateral damage is in this case …,True,uB1Vt0IAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,16,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005789,7875167438352765728,/scholar?cites=7875167438352765728,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005789,0,0,0

A peculiar feature of schistosomes is their ability to hybridize. So far. individual hybrid schistosomes are considered as such when they display incongruent genetic signatures at a nuclear (ITS-2) and a mitochondrial [COI] gene. Nevertheless. the introgression levels of any Schistosoma hybrid have never been assessed at the whole genome level. Here we have analysed both the morphological characteristics and the genomic composition of the schistosome that infected over one hundred humans in Corsica during summer 2013. This parasite was determined as a hybrid between the ruminant-infective (Schistosoma bovis] and the human-infective [Schistosoma haematobium] schistosomes. Characterizing precisely the genomic introgression of these hybrids is essential to better understand their life history traits. and the disease dynamics and epidemiology in natura.For this work. we first performed genome assembly improvement and annotation of S. bovis.

To evaluate the influence of the intermediate host in the infectivity of S. mansoni. this allopatric strain was compared to two sympatric strains. from different geographical origins. and with different time of maintenance in the laboratory. Snail–trematode compatibility was accessed for a total of 9 possible combinations (3 snail populations. 3 schistosome strains). using different charges of parasite: 1. 5. 10 and 15 miracidia/snail. Each S. mansoni strain was characterized according to its infectivity phenotype that reflects the efficiency of their infection mechanism and all B. glabrata populations were characterized according to its (in)compatible phenotype that reflects the level of (un)susceptibility they display. For all host-parasite combinations tested the dose-response relation indicated a trend for an increase in the infectivity of S. mansoni when higher miracidial doses were used. SmRES-2 presented the highest overall infectivity rate. especially in the SmRES-2/BgRES interaction with 15 miracidia/snail. However. SmRES was more infective to BgBAR than SmRES-2. indicating that SmRES strain was more infective at the first contact with this new host than after 2 years of interaction (SmRES-2). BgBAR presented the highest susceptibility to infection. SmRES and SmRES-2 are the same parasite strains. It seems that during these 2 years of interaction.

In this context. many soluble substances have been tested and Euphorbia milii latex is one of the most promising Brazilian molluscicides. Phytochemical studies involving simulation of the applicability of this latex on all aquatic forms of the S. mansoni life cycle are rare in the literature. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of E. milii latex on S. mansoni in the egg. miracidium and different developmental stages in Biomphalaria glabrata. Methods: The laboratory study was designed to simulate the different forms of exposure of the life cycle stages of S. mansoni to the LC50 of E. milii latex; we tested the exposition from four situations of S. mansoni contact with the latex and observed the exposure on different snails’ infection stage too. All snails were analyzed weekly for cercarial shedding and reproductive biology. Results: The results showed that contact of S. mansoni eggs and miracidia with the LC50 of E. milii negatively influenced the development of the parasite life cycle in the intermediate host. with consequent reduction of cercarial shedding. The exposure of infected snails affected the reproductive biology and cercarial shedding in all intra-mollusk development stages of S. mansoni. but the reduction was greater in the first. fourth. fifth. sixth. seventh and eighth weeks of infection. The LC50 of E. milii latex had toxic action on eggs and miracidia. and the number of cercariae shed by snails during the study period declined by about 80%.

Schistosomes deal with a multitude of signals from the water environment and cues that come from their host. in particular those that serve to recognize and destroy them. i.e. the immune system. These interactions shape not only directly the parasite’s morphology. metabolism and behavior in short-term but also their infection success and development into different stage specific phenotypes later in their life. and potentially in subsequent generations by modifying the parasites inheritance system. Thus. environmental signals that come from control measures will influence on the life cycle. This is a challenge since it can lead to unexpected and undesired outcomes. It can also be an advantage since once we understand how environmental cues trigger phenotypes we might apply them to push the right environmental button and corner parasites the way we want them to be.,True,uB1Vt0IAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,5,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01475/full,5228031332632411343,/scholar?cites=5228031332632411343,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01475/full,0,0,0

Africa. South America. the Caribbean. and the Middle East are the main transmission regions of Schistosoma mansoni. The fight against transmission through the use of molluscicides is not recent and has been advocated as the only activity with the possibility of interruption of transmission in small. epidemiologically active outbreaks. Euphorbia milii var. hislopii (syn. splendens)(Des Moulins. 1826) is the most promising for use in official schistosomiasis control programs according to the WHO. In this review. we show that an understanding of some how E. milii latex affects the snail vector and their parasites from a molecular level to field conditions is lacking. On the other hand. this type of treatment could also provide a rationale for the control of schistosomiasis and other parasitosis. Several publications contribute to enforcing the use of E. milii latex in endemic countries as a cheap alternative or complement to mass drug treatment with praziquantel. the only available drug to cure the patients (without preventing re-infection).

The results observed in this study indicate that increased population density has a negative effect on the survival and reproductive activity of B. glabrata. In addition. the quantity of lettuce offered to the snails altered the number of eggs laid per snail. There was a significant relation between the amount of lettuce eaten per day and the number of eggs produced per snail. as well as the number of egg masses per snail. and eggs per egg mass. Furthermore. the snail’s survival was directly associated with the amount of calcium carbonate and the cercarial emergence was inversely related to the calcium carbonate amount. This study might help to understand the influence of population density and food intake on the reproductive biology of captive snail populations. In relation to cercarial emergence. calcium supplies must not be provided to Schistosoma mansoni-infected snails while maintaining S. mansoni under laboratory conditions because it decreases cercarial emergence.,True,uB1Vt0IAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,4,https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/16724,5647239144495504993,/scholar?cites=5647239144495504993,,https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/bitstream/icict/16724/2/aline_magalhaes_etal_IOC_2012.pdf,0,0,0

It may allow an organism to produce alternative phenotypes in responses to environmental cues. Modifications in the phenotype can be reversible but are sometimes enduring and can even span over generations. The notion of phenotypic plasticity was conceptualized in the early 20 th century by Richard Woltereck. He introduced the idea that the combined relations of a phenotypic character and all environmental gradients that influence on it can be defined as ""norm of reaction"". Norms of reaction are specific to species and to lineages within species. and they are heritable. He postulated that reaction norms can progressively be shifted over generations depending on the environmental conditions. One of his biological models was the water-flee daphnia. Woltereck proposed that enduring phenotypic modifications and gene mutations could have similar adaptive effects. and he postulated that their molecular bases would be different. Mutations occurred in genes. while enduring modifications were based on something he called the Matrix. He suggested that this matrix (i) was associated with the chromosomes. (ii) that it was heritable.

1122324,Histone Methylome of the Human Parasite Schistosoma Mansoni,2019,Ronaldo de Carvalho Augusto and Céline Cosseau and Christoph Grunau,,,,607-624,Springer. Cham,The trematode Schistosoma mansoni belongs to the group of digenetic parasites which need obligatory multiple hosts to develop. They transit between hosts as free-swimming stages in fresh water ecosystems. They generate phenotypically different developmental stages throughout their lifecycle and receive hugly heterogenous environmental cues. Each developmental stage is characterized by specific posttranslational histone modifications. in particular methylations. The combination of the different marks result in stage specific chromatin structure that is essential for development. sexual biology and pathogenesis. Histone methylation also responds to environmental changes and seems to be involved in an adaptive reponse or adjustment to the environment. Histone methylation thus represent promising source of therapeutic targets. In this chapter we will present the state-of-the-art of how the dynamics of …,True,uB1Vt0IAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-14792-1_24,,,,,0,0,0

Egg production is required for the transmission and immunopathology of schistosomiasis and females of S. mansoni lay 300 eggs daily. A large fraction of the total mRNA in the mature female worm encodes one eggshell protein. Smp14. We report that the nuclear receptors SmRXR1 and SmNR1 regulate Smp14 transcription through the recruitment of two histone acetyltransferases (HATs). SmGCN5 and SmCBP1. The treatment of HEK293 cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (NaB or TSA) produced an 8-fold activation of the SmRXR1/SmNR1-mediated Smp14 promoter activity. Incubation with synthetic HAT inhibitors. including PU139. significantly impaired the Smp14 promoter activity in these cells. Worm pairs cultivated in the presence of PU139 exhibited limited expression of Smp14 mRNA and protein. ChIP analysis demonstrated chromatin condensation at the Smp14 promoter site in worms treated with PU139. ChIP also revealed the presence of H3K27me3 and the absence of RNA Pol II at the Smp14 promoter region in the PU139-treated worms. Most significantly. the PU139-mediated inhibition of Smp14 expression resulted in a significant number of abnormal eggs as well as defective eggs within the ootype. In addition. scanning electron microscopy revealed structural defects and unformed eggshells. and vitelline cell leakage was apparent. The dsRNAi-targeting of SmGCN5 or SmCBP1 significantly decreased Smp14 transcription and protein synthesis. which …,True,z18GmnMAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,39,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004116,3229037430616864121,/scholar?cites=3229037430616864121,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004116,0,0,0

One of the main routes of transmission from animals to humans occurs through the ingestion of raw or insufficiently cooked meat. However. even though the detection of T. gondii in meat constitutes an important short-term measure. control strategies can only be accomplished by a deeper understanding of the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis. The present study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in cattle from Zona da Mata. Minas Gerais. Brazil. and to identify associated risk factors. through an epidemiological investigation. The animals studied (Bos indicus. breed Nelore or Gir) were reared in the Zona da Mata micro-region and killed at a commercial slaughterhouse at Juiz de Fora. Minas Gerais state. The animals came from 53 cattle farms with extensive (predominantly pasture feeding management) or semi-intensive (food management based on grazing. salt mineral and feed supplementation) rearing systems. Blood samples were collected from 1200 animals. and assigned to Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test. When analyzing IgG anti-T.gondii we found an overall seroprevalence of 2.68%. In Brazil prevalences vary from 1.03% to 60%. Although in the present study. the seroprevalence per animal is considered low compared to those observed in other studies. we found out that of the 53 farms analyzed. 17 (34.69%) had one or more positive cattle.

Sweden,1997,Thierry Wirth and Anette Baur and Bruno Baur,126,Hereditas,3,199-209,Munksgaard International Publishers,Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique was used to analyse the mating system of the simultaneously hermaphroditic land snail Balea perversa and to examine the level of genetic variability in eight natural populations of this rock‐dwelling gastropod on the Baltic island of Öland. Sweden. The mode of reproduction was assessed in parent‐offspring comparisons. in which parents (virgin at the beginning of the breeding experiment or wild‐caught individuals with prior reproductive experience) were kept either singly or in pairs. Snails with no prior reproductive experience produced 1–10 offspring exclusively by selfing. no matter whether they were kept singly or in pairs. In contrast. low rates of outcrossing occurred in snails with prior reproductive experience. Minimum estimates of outcrossing were 10 % for snails kept singly and 16 % for snails kept in pairs.

In the present work. the life history strategy of B. similaris was characterized. We determined the growth. reproduction and longevity patterns of this species. and the interrelationships of these traits. Our results show that the life history of B. similaris is characterized by a combination of short life. short juvenile lifespan. early sexual maturity and few reproductive events. with a high reproductive effort in each event and high mortality shortly after the first reproduction. We conclude that there is a relationship between growth. reproduction and longevity patterns of B. similaris.

Male and female individuals were obtained from 27 birds. fixed in alcohol/formalin/acetic acid (AFA) and preserved in 70% ethanol. Nematodes were identified and then counted under a stereoscopic microscope. Baruscapillaria obsignata were much more frequent in the anterior third of the small intestine. and females were more abundant than males in all infra populations. The prevalence was 55.6%. mean intensity was 11.8 (median 11.0; range 1–31) and abundance 6.56. In the present study. we observed an aggregated distribution of parasite infrapopulations. as demonstrated by the value of the exponent of the negative binomial distribution. K ¼ 0.2773; by the discrepancy index. D ¼ 0.656 and by the variance/mean ratio. 12.44. The female/male sex ratios found in all infrapopulations were always greater than 1. showing a bias in favour of female abundance. This tendency was especially marked in infrapopulations containing fewer individuals. The sizes of infrapopulations ranged from 5 to 31 individuals. The mean sex ratio observed was 2.69^ 3.28 (median 1.83; range 0–11). In infrapopulations with 5–15 individuals. the sex ratios observed varied from 2.6 to 11. while in those with 17–31 individuals. the sex ratios were lower. ranging from 1.7 to 2.4.

No presente estudo. foi observado que S. octona ingeria substrato regularmente e que os indivíduos criados em terra vegetal consumiam menos ração. É provável que a terra vegetal forneça condições semelhantes ao habitat preferencial dos moluscos em ambiente natural e seja mais propícia à utilização como recurso alimentar. Dessa forma. os moluscos criados em terra vegetal tenderam a consumir mais substrato e menos ração do que aqueles criados em areia e argila. obtendo quantidade menor de nutrientes. o que pode ter influenciado seu crescimento.,True,ABprG4EAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,20,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-81752005000100025&script=sci_arttext,9496440876093470902,/scholar?cites=9496440876093470902,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-81752005000100025&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Dominance interactions among the females were quantified to verify the dynamics of succession in the social hierarchy of the colonies. Early pre-emergence colonies present more intense aggressive interactions than late pre-emergence ones. because the females are engaged in securing the role of main egg layer in the nest. In post-emergence (pre-male) colonies the dominance hierarchy is more defined and the frequency of dominance and subordination behaviors were lower than in pre-emergence stages: most of the agonistic behaviors are restricted to the first ranked females (potentially queens) and the subordinate individuals play the role of workers in the nests. In the post-emergence. post-male. and decline stages the hierarchy is still maintained by the aggressive behaviors of the 1st-ranked female but because the presence of males and future nest foundresses these interactions are not well defined in a linear way.,True,ABprG4EAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,18,https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/67899,7557504142048355980,/scholar?cites=7557504142048355980,,,0,0,0

Subulinidae),2015,Camilla Medeiros and Roberta Lima Caldeira and Cristiane Lafetá Furtado Mendonça and Omar dos Santos Carvalho and Sthefane D’ávila,4,SpringerPlus,1,1-13,SpringerOpen,Recent studies concerning species of land snails have revealed that the shell morphometrics can provide evidence of the differentiation among populations. In many cases. the morphologic analysis combined with the investigation of molecular variability. can support changes in taxonomy of studied groups. In this sense. the study of shell morphometry during snail development can contribute to the understanding of the structural mechanisms that creates the diversity observed. The morphological and ontogenetic pattern differences were collected among snails from four different populations. kept under the same laboratorial conditions. It was possible to distinguish characteristic shell morphometrics for snails from each population. The snails from Barra Mansa and Floriano. locations with smaller precipitation indexes presented smaller shell aperture values. The results are discussed in terms of the role of the reproductive strategy of this species as a factor determining shell shape. Differences in growth allometry indicated that the whole shell forming process is different among the populations. not only the final form of the adult’s shell. Some allometry relationships indicated that. during the snails’ development. the increase in shell width is not proportional to the increase of the width and height of the shell aperture. Thus. there is possibly an antagonism between the adoption of K-strategy and protection against desiccation. Since the spire indices of L. unilamellata morphotypes cannot be explained by physical functional aspects. the most likely explanation is the reproductive strategy of this species.,True,ABprG4EAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,8,https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-015-0959-x,2013019349107088823,/scholar?cites=2013019349107088823,,https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-015-0959-x,0,0,0

While Zn2+ was able to increase cell proliferation even at 0.1 mM. the minimal CuCl2 concentration tested (0.02 mM) was sufficient to impair cell division. Higher concentrations of these metals not only inhibited cell division in a concentration-dependent manner. but also interfered with the metabolism of E. gracilis. A higher accumulation of proteins and lipids per cell was observed at the DI50 concentration for metal-treated cells. These results suggest that the test concentration of both metals leads to a failure in completing cell division. Ultrastructural analysis indicated a chloroplast disorganization in copper-treated cells. as well as the presence of electron dense granules with different shapes and sizes …,True,1y31rxsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,150,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749102001707,17786929547300177873,/scholar?cites=17786929547300177873,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcelo_Einicker-Lamas/publication/14037907_Effects_of_cadmium_on_Euglena_gracilis_membrane_lipids/links/5491a79e0cf23b7c974c137d/Effects-of-cadmium-on-Euglena-gracilis-membrane-lipids.pdf,0,0,0

We examined whether their relative volumes change during the intracellular cycle. Stereological analysis of random ultrathin sections taken at 5 min of interaction. 7 and 24 h post-infection demonstrated that the relative volume of each type of organelle decreases just after the respective peak of secretion. Micronemes are radially arranged below the polar ring. while rhoptries converge to but only a few reach the inside of the conoid. In contrast to the apical and polarized organelles. dense granules were found scattered throughout the cytoplasm. with no preferential location in the parasite cell body.

Its survival strategies include escape from fusion of the parasitophorous vacuole with host cell lysosomes and rearrangement of host cell organelles in relation to the parasitophorous vacuole. In this article we report the rearrangement of host cell organelles and elements of the cytoskeleton of LLCMK2 cells. a lineage derived from green monkey kidney epithelial cells. in response to infection by T. gondii tachyzoites. Transmission electron microscopy made on flat embedded monolayers cut horizontally to the apical side of the cells or field emission scanning electron microscopy of monolayers scraped with scotch tape before sputtering showed that association of mitochondria to the vacuole is much less frequent than previously described.

This region shows a junctional complex which is formed by a linear series of apposed macular structures that are separated by amorphous material and clusters of intramembranous particles. Two protein groups appear to be important in the FAZ region: a membrane glycoprotein of 72 kDa and several high molecular weight proteins. To gain a better understanding of the FAZ region. we compared wild-type Y strain T. cruzi epimastigotes with a mutant cell in which the 72-kDa surface glycoprotein (Gp72). involved in cell body-flagellum adhesion. had been deleted by target gene replacement.

In the present study. we demonstrate that D2 and TSH are coexpressed in rat pituitary thyrotrophs and that hypothyroidism increases D2 expression in these cells. Studies using two murine-derived thyrotroph cells. TtT-97 and TαT1. demonstrate high expression of D2 in thyrotrophs and confirm its sensitivity to negative regulation by T4-induced proteasomal degradation of this enzyme.

Hexokinase (HK). a key glycolytic enzyme. plays important pro-survival roles. reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and preventing apoptosis in neurons and other cell types. Brain isozyme HKI is mainly associated with mitochondria and HK release from mitochondria causes a significant decrease in enzyme activity and triggers oxidative damage. We here investigated the relationship between Aβ-induced oxidative stress and HK activity. We found that Aβ triggered HKI detachment from mitochondria decreasing HKI activity in cortical neurons. Aβ oligomers further impair energy metabolism by decreasing neuronal ATP levels. Aβ-induced HKI cellular redistribution was accompanied by excessive ROS generation and neuronal death. 2-deoxyglucose blocked Aβ-induced oxidative stress and neuronal death. Results suggest that Aβ-induced cellular redistribution and inactivation of neuronal HKI play important roles in oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in AD.,True,QJIEJXcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,80,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015230,13455450267968220543,/scholar?cites=13455450267968220543,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015230,0,0,0

1122428,Sugar phosphorylation modulates ADP inhibition of maize mitochondrial hexokinase,1999,Antonio Galina and Carlos Logullo and Edmilson Fernandes de Souza and Gustavo Lazzaro Rezende and Wagner Seixas da Silva,105,Physiologia Plantarum,1,17-23,Munksgaard International Publishers,The preference of maize (Zea mays L.) mitochondrial hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1.) for glucose and fructose and the ADP regulation were evaluated. The Michaelis‐Menten constants (Km) varied between 0.02 and 0.09 mM for glucose and from 2 to 6 mM for fructose as substrates. The value of Vmax was five times higher in the presence of glucose as compared with fructose in membrane‐bound enzyme preparations. It was shown that ADP produced from the reaction inhibits the hexokinase activity (Ki=20–50 μM). However. the inhibition was very specific for adenine nucleotide. Only a small inhibition was observed when 1 mM of UDP. CDP or GDP was included in the assay medium. Nevertheless. the ADP inhibition was observed only when glucose was phosphorylated. In assay conditions where fructose serves as substrate. the affinity for ADP decreased by 10‐fold (Ki varied between 500 and 1 000 μM).

In this investigation we assessed movement kinematics in the task of reaching for a toy in 5-month-olds. comparing movements performed with the preferred arm under full vision versus visual occlusion. That comparison was made in consecutive periods of visual occlusion. Analysis of results revealed that visual occlusion led to decreased straightness of arm displacement toward the toy as compared to full vision. Longer periods of occlusion did not augment that effect. These results offer preliminary evidence for use of visual feedback early in infants’ reaching development. Reconciliation of previous and current findings is made by proposing a hybrid mode of feedback processing for manual control reweighting the roles of vision and proprioception as a function of availability of environmental information.,True,8gLYH5gAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,14,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00520/full,5368977950308472944,/scholar?cites=5368977950308472944,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00520/full,0,0,0

Microdissection TESE (microTESE) was proposed as a method to improve sperm retrieval rates in these patients; however. there have been failures. Little is known about whether microTESE leads to spermatogenic alterations in the contralateral testis. We assessed histological outcomes of experimental microTESE in the contralateral testis of adult male rabbits. Nine adult male rabbits were divided into three groups: control (testicular biopsy to observe normal histological and morphometric values). sham (incision of the tunica vaginalis. and a contralateral testicular biopsy to observe histological and morphometric patterns. 45 days later). and study (left testicular microTESE. and a right testicular biopsy to observe histological and morphometric patterns. 45 days later). Sections were assessed by calculating Johnsen-like scores. and measuring total tubule diameter. lumen diameter and epithelial height. The results were compared using ANOVA and Bonferroni's statistical analysis. Morphometric evaluation of the seminiferous tubules did not demonstrate differences between the three groups.

No entanto. não se sabe o quanto essa indução repetidamente pode modificar o comportamento lateral do bebê. mesmo quando. posteriormente. o brinquedo é oferecido na posição central. Essa investigação pode trazer evidências sobre o papel do ambiente no desenvolvimento do comportamento lateral do indivíduo. OBJETIVOS: O objetivo deste estudo foi investigar se experiências lateralizadas com a mão não-preferida levam ao aumento da frequência de uso dessa mão e qual seria o seu efeito sobre o desempenho motor em bebês aos 4 e 7 meses de idade.

Triatominae). com ênfase aos aspectos da espermatogênese,2011,Rosana Silistino de Souza,,,,f.: il. color.,Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP),Um século após a descoberta da Doença de Chagas. essa doença ainda representa uma das mais importantes enfermidades parasitárias que afetam o ser humano. A subfamília dos Triatomíneos tem uma importância médico sanitária. uma vez que estes insetos são vetores do Trypanosoma cruzi. agente etiológico da Doença de Chagas e. também. uma relevância citológica por apresentar características celulares específicas. tais como a “persistência do material nucleolar” na espermatogênese. As células germinativas do reino animal apresentam em seu citoplasma corpos cromatóides. cujo termo em inglês é chromatoid body (CB). que podem se originar de material nucleolar que se fragmenta nas etapas iniciais da espermatogênese e exercem função importante na comunicação celular entre as espermátides durante o processo de espermiogênese. Atualmente. existem poucos estudos sobre o processo de nucleologênese e da formação de CBs. especialmente com ênfase à ultraestrutura das células envolvidas na espermatogênese de triatomíneos. Considerando a importância da Doença de Chagas e do conhecimento da fauna triatomínea. realizamos um levantamento dos pacientes chagásicos e um estudo sobre a biogeografia e as notificações dos triatomíneos da região Noroeste do Estado de São Paulo. Os dados coletados de 1995 a 2009 indicaram 700 indivíduos chagásicos demonstrando a faixa de 0 a 40 anos o que demonstra que a doença pode estar ativa nesta região.

Uma possibilidade em mediar esse tipo de discussão em sala de aula é a utilização da ficção científica. pois esse gênero literário privilegia o diálogo do educando com seu meio social e cultural permeado pelo seu imaginário. Pretendemos com esse trabalho analisar o livro O Robô de Júpiter de Isaac Asimov e buscar elementos que forneçam subsídios para a discussão de aspectos conceituais e epistemológicos inerentes à Física.

The sol–gel parameters were tuned to obtain samples with different average particle sizes. ranging from 12 to 70 nm.

The magnetic moment per particle was calculated for all samples using the susceptibility value at T = 300 K. The number of uncompensated spins per NP was found to be proportional to n1/3S (nS ≡ total number of spins). indicating that they are randomly distributed on the NP surface.

The experimental results evidence a stronger spin-phonon coupling in GdMnO 3 than in EuMnO 3. as well as a clear anomaly in the phonon contribution for the dielectric constant. This anomaly is located at the paramagnetic-incommensurate antiferromagnetic phase-transition temperature of GdMnO 3. corroborating the existence of a magnetoelectric effect in this system. The absence of the magnetoelectric effect in EuMnO 3 is due to the existing disorder revealed in this compound by the striking thermal metastability and the large decrease in the activation energy associated with the dielectric relaxation processes. This kind of behavior has no counterpart in GdMnO 3.

In contrast. for the charge-ordered antiferromagnetic samples (0.30< x< 0.90). an anomalous magnetic entropy change starts around the charge-ordering temperature T CO. persisting for lower values of temperature. This effect is associated to a positive contribution to the magnetic entropy change due to the charge-ordering Δ S CO. which is superimposed to the negative contribution from the spin-ordering Δ S spin; that is described using a mean-field approximation.

1122478,An improved molybdenum blue method for simultaneous determination of inorganic phosphate and arsenate,1998,L Carvalho and T De Koe and P Tavares,1,Restoration,1,,,A spectrophotometric method. based on the determination of the absorbance of arsenomolybdate and phosphomolybdate together at 925 nm. and of phosphomolybdate alone after treatment with L-cysteine and acetone at 875 nm. is presented. L-cysteine quickly reduces arsenate to arsenite and the addition of acetone diminishes the reaction time for color development to less than 15 minutes at room temperature. which makes the method a faster alternative to the existing phosphate and arsenate molybdenum blue methods. The detection limit for determinations of arsenate in the presence of phosphate is 0.2 µM. of phosphate in the presence of arsenate and of phosphate or arsenate alone is 0.04 µM. Recoveries are nearly 100%. The method can be used for analysis of total inorganic arsenic after oxidizing As (III) to As (V) and offers a simple. rapid and inexpensive way to distinguish inorganic arsenic species in solutions containing up to 40 µM As.,True,mSLnUnQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,63,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis_Carvalho12/publication/284670220_An_improved_molybdenum_blue_method_for_simultaneous_determination_of_inorganic_phosphate_and_arsenate/links/570b857008aea660813ae4ac.pdf,15030261298706106431,/scholar?cites=15030261298706106431,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis_Carvalho12/publication/284670220_An_improved_molybdenum_blue_method_for_simultaneous_determination_of_inorganic_phosphate_and_arsenate/links/570b857008aea660813ae4ac.pdf,0,0,0

1122492,Structural vulnerability. reliability and risk,2002,DI Blockley and J Agarwal and JT Pinto and NJ Woodman,4,,2,203-212,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,A system is robust if it can withstand arbitrary damage. There are many practical ways to design in robustness. but there is as yet no accepted theory of robustness. Reliability theory is a useful tool for examining the probability of failure for a pre‐defined type of loading; however low‐probability–high‐consequence events may be missed. One insight into the lack of robustness is gained by identifying how a system is vulnerable. A system that is vulnerable in any one way is not robust. Like robustness. vulnerability has been defined differently in different contexts. The purpose of this paper is not to argue for particular definitions of robustness. vulnerability or risk. but rather to review a ‘theory of structural vulnerability’ developed by the authors and to show how it can be used in practice to improve the robustness of a system.

Therefore. CMU-PCC were prepared in a factory using a typical lightweight concrete mixture for non-structural purposes. Additionally. lightweight concrete masonry units based on a currently applied lightweight aggregate such as expanded clay (CMU-EC) were also manufactured. An experimental work allowed achieving a set of results that suggest that the proposed building product presents interesting material properties within the masonry wall context. Therefore. this unit is promising for both interior and exterior applications.

Rigid and drastic measures have to be taken by all nations in order to reduce the noxious gases emission to the atmosphere. This ambitious goal can be achieved by ruling the energy production. by having a much more sustainable industry and adopting a much more sustainable way of living by all of us. The building industry has also to adapt to these circumstances to make its contribution to achieve the above goal. Focusing on traditional building techniques which require simple technology and use natural and local building materials and. eventually. to adapt them for the present required quality standards may be a step to solve this problem. Half of the worlds population. 3 billion people approximately. on six continents. live or work in buildings constructed by earth based building materials. The fact that earth is natural. abundant and local result in an unexpressive amount of energy spending and noxious gases emission when it is used as a building material and. consequently. makes it undoubtedly much more ecological and economic when compared to the others building materials such as reinforced concrete or steel. In this context. the main objective of this research work is to give a contribution on the earth based building material properties and. in particular. for the development of adequate rehabilitation and strengthening techniques. based upon a biomimetic study focused on the andorinha-dos-beirais nest.

Portugal,2011,Romeu Vicente and Sonia Parodi and Sergio Lagomarsino and Humberto Varum and JAR Mendes Silva,9,Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering,4,1067-1096,Springer Netherlands,Seismic risk evaluation of built-up areas involves analysis of the level of earthquake hazard of the region. building vulnerability and exposure. Within this approach that defines seismic risk. building vulnerability assessment assumes great importance. not only because of the obvious physical consequences in the eventual occurrence of a seismic event. but also because it is the one of the few potential aspects in which engineering research can intervene. In fact. rigorous vulnerability assessment of existing buildings and the implementation of appropriate retrofitting solutions can help to reduce the levels of physical damage. loss of life and the economic impact of future seismic events. Vulnerability studies of urban centres should be developed with the aim of identifying building fragilities and reducing seismic risk.

China Earthquake Administration,This paper discusses the issue of performance requirements and construction criteria for masonry enclosure and infill walls. Vertical building enclosures in European countries are very often constituted by non-load-bearing masonry walls. using horizontally perforated clay bricks. These walls are generally supported and confined by a reinforced concrete frame structure of columns and beams/slabs. Since these walls are commonly considered to be nonstructural elements and their influence on the structural response is ignored. their consideration in the design of structures as well as their connection to the adjacent structural elements is frequently negligent or insufficiently detailed. As a consequence. nonstructural elements. as for wall enclosures. are relatively sensitive to drift and acceleration demands when buildings are subjected to seismic actions.

Well-preserved adobe structures can exhibit a particular architecture with very attractive geometric characteristics while also incorporating natural materials. However. the behavior of these structures is deficient under horizontal loads. such as those induced by an earthquake. which endangers their structural integrity and human lives.

The ventilation openings and the shading device operation decisively influence the temperatures fluctuation along the system and that impact should be discussed.In this context. a test cell with a classical Trombe wall was submitted to real climatic conditions in a Portuguese city. The effect of ventilation openings and shading devices in the temperatures fluctuation was analysed.The temperatures in the air layer and along the massive wall presented a similar oscillation pattern and exceeded 60 °C without ventilation and shading devices. For this configuration. temperature values ​​at the top of the air layer were always higher than those obtained at the base and a differential of 19 °C was …,True,DP5FX8EAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778816320850,7226980068069169509,/scholar?cites=7226980068069169509,,https://repositorio.inesctec.pt/bitstream/123456789/5012/1/P-00M-H6Y.pdf,0,0,0

In general. a tabique building component is formed by a simple timber structure covered by an earth based mortar on both sides. The mortar has an important role in this system because it protects the internal timber structure as well as it is a coating. Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro. is the northeast region of Portugal and it is rich in terms of tabique heritage construction. Meanwhile. previous research works have shown that the existing tabique constructions. in this region. show a generalized advanced stage of deterioration. This aspect associated to the fact that there is still a lack of scientific studies done in this field motivated this research work. which its main objective is to identify and to understand the structural system of tabique dwellings. A two storey tabique dwelling located in Lamego Municipality. near Douro River. in the UNESCO classified heritage area. is used as reference in this study.

1122555,A Framework for the Evaluation of Quality of Dwellings,1995,Correia de Paiva and Anabela Goncalves,,,,,,The house-building industry should evolve towards the production of dwellings of higher quality standards. Minimum standards are required to ensure that all new homes will be structurally sound. comfortable and have a long and reliable life. The notion of quality does not just concern the dwelling itself. but also the immediate and wider environment. namely the proximity of schools. shopping and leisure areas (theatres. cinemas. sport centres. playgrounds). accessibility (roads. railway lines. underground. buses) and views. To achieve higher quality standards better design quality evaluation and inspection schemes are needed In this thesis a new approach for the evaluation of the quality of dwelling designs named QDF (Quality Dwelling Framework) is proposed. In order to develop QDF a parallel between the form of a dwelling and the form of a human body is drawn. This is justified by the fact that the human body is a most sophisticated and highly developed form. The methodology behind QDF is the systems approach. In QDF. a dwelling is organised. in a hierarchical way. into systems. subsystems and components. Each of the elements in the hierarchy is both a system and apart of a larger system. i. e. a holon. Holons are modelled as software objects. in the sense of object-oriented programming. QDF is an important contribution in the direction of raising dwelling quality standards (quality is used here in the sense of fitness for purpose). It provides a comprehensive framework to implement and develop different quality evaluation methods. adapted to different countries and cultures. No specific parameters are imposed for quality evaluation of …,True,DP5FX8EAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,11,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.296400,2686557672133921237,/scholar?cites=2686557672133921237,,,0,0,0

The results for the samples with 0.20< x⩽ 0.30 present the usual behavior expected for ferromagnetic systems. peaking at the Curie temperature T C. In contrast. for the charge-ordered antiferromagnetic samples (0.30< x< 0.90). an anomalous magnetic entropy change starts around the charge-ordering temperature T CO. persisting for lower values of temperature. This effect is associated to a positive contribution to the magnetic entropy change due to the charge-ordering Δ S CO. which is superimposed to the negative contribution from the spin-ordering Δ S spin; that is described using a mean-field approximation. Supposing these contributions. we could also appraise Δ S CO max as a function of Ca content. which vanishes for the limits x∼ 0.30 and 0.90 …,True,4tN5ZPQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,91,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.71.144413,6137779824778228287,/scholar?cites=6137779824778228287,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/MS_Reis/publication/243436778_Magnetic_entropy_change_of_Pr1-xCaxMnO3_manganites_02x095/links/0046351b1fbc9ef8b0000000/Magnetic-entropy-change-of-Pr1-xCaxMnO3-manganites-02x095.pdf,0,0,0

Clearly. distinct EFG behavior for samples outside or inside the charge order (CO) region are observed. The EFG temperature dependence evidences a new phase transition occurring over the broad CO region of the phase diagram. This transition is discontinuous and occurs at temperatures between the charge ordering and the Néel temperatures. The prominent features observed in the EFG are associated with polar atomic vibrations which eventually lead to a spontaneous local electric polarization below CO transition.,True,4tN5ZPQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,89,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.155702,15480151145892762466,/scholar?cites=15480151145892762466,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3935,0,0,0

The star-shaped gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles thus obtained preserve the magnetic properties of the precursor magnetite nanoparticles. e.g. they can be easily separated with a magnet. In addition. the gold coating provides interesting optical properties while simultaneously allowing for biofunctionalization that may be advantageous for biological applications. such as (bio)detection via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

By varying the final anodization voltage to form dendrites at the bottom of the nanoporous structure. we are able to optimize δ b (in the 2–16 nm range). allowing us to obtain a Ni pore filling percentage (f p) of almost 100% for δ b= 10 nm. However. deviations from this optimal δ b-value led to a strong decrease of f p. Moreover. an increase of the electrodeposition efficiency (EE) and NW homogeneity was also verified for δ b up to 10 nm. Such increase in nominal δ b leads to a consistent growth rate in all pores and consequently a complete and uniform nanopore filling. On the other hand. the decrease in electrodeposition efficiency visible for δ b> 10 nm is related with hydrogen evolution and dielectric breakdown of the insulator layer due to the required high deposition …,True,4tN5ZPQAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,69,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/22/31/315602/meta,9845994925768113368,/scholar?cites=9845994925768113368,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43951169/Tunning_pore_filling_of_anodic_alumina_t20160321-13038-8t9ov.pdf,0,0,0

In solid‐state magnetic cooling. reducing magnetic and thermal hysteresis is critical for refrigeration cycle efficiency. From magnetization measurements. it is found that the fast field‐rate dependence of the hysteresis can be attributed to extrinsic heating directly related to the thickness of the sample and the thermal contact with the bath. If the field is paused partway through the transition. the subsequent relaxation is strongly dependent on shape due to both demagnetizing fields and thermal equilibration; magnetic coupling between adjacent sample fragments can also be significant.

This system uses magnetocaloric materials and materials whose thermal conductivity changes with the applied magnetic field (H). Similarly to common AMRRs. H is moved gradually from the hot to the cold reservoirs to produce a cascade of Brayton cycles. This cascade increases the temperature span and can thus be used in bulk applications where the conservation of a cold environment is demanded. Our results show that by using gadolinium as magnetocaloric material (MCM) and H = 1 T. one can increase the temperature span from 2.5 K up to 11.5 K. an enhancement of over 450%.

Results show that there is an optimum value for the activator:solids ratio and the alkali concentration. and that a decrease in the Na2O:ash ratio results in a strength increase. No improvement was observed with the sodium chloride or the superplasticiser. while the calcium produced only a short term increase in strength.

1122645,Experimental and numerical analysis of blocky masonry structures under cyclic loading,2003,Daniel V Oliveira,,,,,,The work presented in this thesis was developed at both the Civil Engineering Department of Universidade do Minho and at the Structural Technology Laboratory of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. Spain. This study is composed of both an experimental part and a numerical pan. aimed at contributing to a better knowledge of the behaviour of blocky masonry structures under cyclic loading. Uniaxial monotonic and cyclic deformation-controlled tests were performed on stone and brick specimens as well as prisms. aiming at a complete characterization of the cyclic behaviour of these materials. Complementary to these tests. seven dry stone masonry walls were constructed and tested under combined compressive and shear loading. The main objective of this experimental work was to provide adequate data concerning the mechanical behaviour of historical masonry components and structures. capable of being used for numerical purposes. both for calibration of constitutive models and for validation of numerical results. The micro- modelling strategy was adopted for the numerical analysis of the cyclic behaviour of masonry structures. Starting from an existing monotonic constitutive model developed for interface elements. fully based on the plasticity theory. a new constitutive model able to describe the cyclic loading of interface elements is proposed. This new model is also entirely founded on the incremental theory of plasticity. Elastic un is assumed only for the shear component. The normal component is described ii a non- linear fashion.

Its theoretical framework is fully based on the plasticity theory. Starting from an existing monotonic model. two new yield surfaces are introduced in order to include non-linear unloading/reloading behaviour in an accurate fashion. The motion of the unloading surfaces is controlled by a mixed hardening law and. by adopting appropriate evolution rules. it is possible to reproduce non-linear behaviour during unloading.

Twelve half-scaled segmental masonry arches subjected to a load applied at the quarter span were tested under displacement control up to failure. The arches were built using handmade low strength bricks and a commercial lime-based mortar. trying to mimic ancient structures.

Departing from a detailed discussion of the geometrical results. eight reference bridges were defined as representative of the sample. Subsequently. the paper deals with a parametric assessment of the load-carrying capacity of the reference bridges and a discussion of results.

1122661,Water degrading effects on the bond behavior in FRP-strengthened masonry,2013,Bahman Ghiassi and Giancarlo Marcari and Daniel V Oliveira and Paulo B Lourenço,54,Composites Part B: Engineering,,11-19,Elsevier,Fiber reinforced polymers are being extensively used for external strengthening of masonry structures. However. durability of this strengthening technique under environmental conditions is still under investigation. Previous studies indicate that moisture plays an important role in the durability of bond between FRP and substrate. Moisture can cause degradation in the bond behavior and also in the mechanical properties of the constituent materials. This paper presents and discusses the results of an experimental investigation on the effects of moisture on the bond behavior in FRP-strengthened masonry bricks. The degradation in the bond performance has been investigated by performing pull-off and pull-out tests on the conditioned specimens. The change in the mechanical properties of the materials has also been investigated.

The material was collected from 180 trees by the extraction of an increment core. in a progeny test at 18 years old. The wood density components were measured using the X-ray densitometry technique. The highest and most stable age heritability values were obtained by the earlywood components (minimum density and earlywood density). followed by the average ring density. The latewood percentage. ring width and heterogeneity revealed middle values. while the latewood components (maximum density and latewood density) always presented the lowest and most unstable heritability values. Thus. it was concluded that. amongst all components. the earlywood density mostly depends on genetic effects. and could be used in future …,True,qU06wyQAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,44,https://www.afs-journal.org/articles/forest/abs/2002/07/08/08.html,16997388243323862781,/scholar?cites=16997388243323862781,,https://www.afs-journal.org/articles/forest/pdf/2002/07/08.pdf,0,0,0
