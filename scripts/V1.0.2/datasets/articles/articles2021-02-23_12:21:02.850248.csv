1092929,The Impact of Instructor Exam Feedback on Student Understanding in a Large-Enrollment Biology Course,2018,Brian K Sato and Duyen Dinh-Dang and Eduardo Cruz-Hinojoza and Kameryn Denaro and Cynthia FC Hill and Adrienne Williams,68,BioScience,8,601-611,Oxford University Press,Encouraging students to reflect on their exam answers in response to expert feedback may result in increased classroom performance and highlights that learning is an ongoing experience rather than one terminated at exam completion. In this study. we assessed the impact of instructor-delivered midterm feedback. employing a system in which students were not only given the opportunity to reflect on their answers. but to then engage in an email discussion about the feedback with the instructor. We found that the students who participated in the feedback process provided higher quality responses to similar final-exam questions. Using surveys and interviews. we identified components of the feedback process that the students perceived to be most valuable. We would encourage instructors to incorporate exam feedback in the assessment process not only because of its potential to enhance learning but also to …,True,JGO3u-IAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/68/8/601/5045462,,,,https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/68/8/601/5045462,0,0,0
1092930,ISOLASI DAN KARAKTERISASI BAKTERI ENDOFIT AKAR TANAMAN TEBU (Saccharum officinarum L.) PENGHASIL HORMON Indole Acetic Acid (IAA),2017,Roni Syaputra and Anggi Maulia Arista,,Cover Design,,143,,Tanaman tebu (Saccharum oficinarum L.) merupakan tanaman asli Indonesia yang sudah berkembang lama sejak pemerintahan kolonial Belanda yang menjadikan tanaman tebu sebagai salah satu komoditas untuk sumber devisa. Saat ini. tebu mengalami penurunan produksi dan rendemen. sehingga kebutuhan gula dalam negeri sering tidak cukup. Pemanfaatan bakteri endofit akar merupakan salah satu solusi alternatif untuk meningkatkan produksi tebu dan rendemen. Bakteri endofit berpotensi memacu pertumbuhan akar tanaman tebu. sehingga jangkauan akar terhadap air dan hara menjadi lebih luas. Kegiatan penelitian telah dilaksanakan di Laboratorium Bioprosesing Balai Penelitian Tanaman Pemanis dan Serat (BALITTAS). Malang. Penelitian ini dilaksanakan pada bulan Juli-Desember 2015. Bahan utama yang digunakan adalah akar tanaman tebu yang diambil secara acak. kemudian dikompositkan. Sampel akar diambil dari 3 varietas. yaitu: PS-881 (tebu masak awal). PSJK-922 (tebu masak tengah). BL (tebu masak akhir) di Kebun Percobaan Karangploso. BALITTAS. Malang. Tahapan kegiatan penelitian adalah: isolasi. pemurnian. uji kemampuan bakteri menghasilkan IAA. karakterisasi; morfologi koloni. morfologi sel. pewarnaan gram. endospora serta uji katalase. Data yang diperoleh berupa kadar hormon Indole Acetic Acid (IAA). morfologi koloni. morfologi sel. susunan sel dan fisiologis biokimia dianalisis secara deskriptif. Dari hasil penelitian didapatkan 29 isolat bakteri endofit penghasil hormon IAA dari akar tanaman tebu varietas PS-881.

1092931,LightGWAS: A Novel Genome-Wide Association Study Procedure,2020,Bruno Ambrozio,,,,,,This dissertation proposes LightGWAS. a novel machine learning procedure for genome-wide association study (GWAS) based on LightGBM and k-fold cross-validation. The conducted literature review identified that the currently available GWAS implementations rely on massive manual quality control steps to address statistical issues. such as controlling for false-positive inflation and power reduction. It also showed they demand a specific GWAS method for each type of genomic dataset morphology. which consequently increases the human dependency and open margins for misleadings. LightGWAS is a potential single. resilient. autonomous and scalable solution to address such concerns. Through this research. LightGWAS was contrasted against the current state-of-the-art for GWAS throughout secondary research method. It has been compared with a GWAS implementation based on general linear model (GLM) with support to Firth regularisation. Quantitative empirical tests and deductive reasoning have been employed to reach and evaluate the results. The models were submitted to balanced (case: control= 1: 1). imbalanced (case: control= 1: 10). and high-imbalanced (case: control= 1: 100) genomic datasets of binary phenotypes. The results from statistical tests denoted that LightGWAS performs equivalently to the compared GLM method for balanced dataset scenarios. and outperforms for imbalanced and high-imbalanced datasets. The assessed metrics were weighted average of the precision and recall (F1). recall. average precision score (APS). receiver operating characteristic (ROC)/area under the curve (AUC). accuracy. and …,True,86kx30QAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://arrow.tudublin.ie/scschcomdis/220/,,,,,0,0,0
1092932,Genetic diversity and population structure of the endangered  Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus (Polemoniaceae) from Northern New Mexico and implications on its …,2015,Joseph R Talboom,,,,,,Ipomopsis sancti-spiritus Wilken & Fletcher is a federally listed endangered species comprised of a single population in the mountains of north-central New Mexico. Since being listed in 1994. extensive management efforts have focused on establishing recovery populations and understanding the biology and ecology of the plant. In order to establish base-line genetic data for this species. we investigated the levels of genetic diversity within and among the primary and recovery populations of I. sancti-spiritus. In addition. a breeding study was conducted to investigate life history traits (eg self-compatibility. seeds produced from autogamous and xenogamous pollen) that might affect the survival of the species. Eight microsatellite loci were used to assess the genetic diversity present in I. sancti-spiritus. Diversity levels within the species were relatively high (observed heterozygosity= 0.625 in the primary population. with …,True,taU4uzQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://search.proquest.com/openview/d9020da334f15585f164962a04d0f639/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,,,,,0,0,0

Minhazur Rahman,6,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS, SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH",3,45-51,,Microbial natural products have a significant role in the medical industry because of their anticancer. antimicrobial and anti-cholesterol activities. Polyketides are one of the important class of biologically active natural products. These polyketides are formed by the polyketide synthases (PKSs). There are three types of PKSs named as a type I. type II and type III. Structure and mechanism properties of all three types are closely related. Because of the diverse bio functionality and commercial application. synthesis of polyketides in a heterologous host system becomes essential for mass-scale production. There are some factors which have a great impact on the production of polyketides in the heterologous system. In recent years. it was found that metabolic engineering. biosynthesis pathways and related system has been used to enhance theproduction of polyketides to the heterologous host system.,True,262g8ZgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/metabolic-engineering-of-type-iii-pks-for-over-production-of-seco,,,,,0,0,0
