Deregulation of miRNA mediated mechanisms is emerging as an important pathological factor in bone degeneration (eg. osteoporosis) and other bone-related diseases. MiRNAs are intriguing regulatory molecules that are networked with cell signaling pathways and intricate transcriptional programs through ingenuous circuits with remarkably simple logic. This overview examines key principles by which miRNAs control differentiation of osteoblasts as they evolve from mesenchymal stromal cells during osteogenesis. or of osteoclasts as they originate from monocytic precursors in the hematopoietic lineage during osteoclastogenesis.

73509,The role of RUNX2 in osteosarcoma oncogenesis,2010,JW Martin and M Zielenska and GS Stein and AJ Van Wijnen and JA Squire,2011,,,,Hindawi,Osteosarcoma is an aggressive but ill-understood cancer of bone that predominantly affects adolescents. Its rarity and biological heterogeneity have limited studies of its molecular basis. In recent years. an important role has emerged for the RUNX2 “platform protein” in osteosarcoma oncogenesis. RUNX proteins are DNA-binding transcription factors that regulate the expression of multiple genes involved in cellular differentiation and cell-cycle progression. RUNX2 is genetically essential for developing bone and osteoblast maturation. Studies of osteosarcoma tumours have revealed that the RUNX2 DNA copy number together with RNA and protein levels are highly elevated in osteosarcoma tumors. The protein is also important for metastatic bone disease of prostate and breast cancers. while RUNX2 may have both tumor suppressive and oncogenic roles in bone morphogenesis. This paper provides a synopsis of the current understanding of the functions of RUNX2 and its potential role in osteosarcoma and suggests directions for future study.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,128,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sarcoma/2011/282745/abs/,5416450851077835314,/scholar?cites=5416450851077835314,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sarcoma/2011/282745/abs/,0,0,0

Runx2. the master regulator of osteoblastogenesis. directs a transcriptional program essential for bone formation through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. While individual Runx2 gene targets have been identified. further insights into the broad spectrum of Runx2 functions required for osteogenesis are needed. By performing genome-wide characterization of Runx2 binding at the three major stages of osteoblast differentiation - proliferation. matrix deposition and mineralization - we identify Runx2-dependent regulatory networks driving bone formation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing over the course of these stages. we identify approximately 80.000 significantly enriched regions of Runx2 binding throughout the mouse genome.

In addition. cell surface expression may distinguish between MSCs from different sources. including bone marrow-derived MSCs and clinical-grade adipose-derived MSCs (AMSCs) grown in human platelet lysate (hPL). In this work we utilized quantitative PCR. flow cytometry. and RNA-sequencing to characterize AMSCs grown in hPL and validated non-classical markers in 15 clinical-grade donors. We characterized the surface marker transcriptome of AMSCs. validated the expression of classical markers. and identified nine non-classical markers (i.e.. CD36. CD163. CD271. CD200. CD273. CD274. CD146. CD248. and CD140B) that may potentially discriminate AMSCs from other cell types. More importantly. these markers exhibit variability in cell surface expression among different cell isolates from a diverse cohort of donors. including freshly prepared. previously frozen. or proliferative state AMSCs and may be informative when manufacturing cells. Our study establishes that clinical-grade AMSCs expanded in hPL represent a homogeneous cell culture population according to classical markers..

RUNX proteins are targeted to gene regulatory micro‐environments within the nucleus via a specific subnuclear targeting signal. However. the dynamics of RUNX distribution and compartmentalization between the cytoplasm and nucleus is minimally understood. Here we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that RUNX2 relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when microtubules are stabilized by the chemotherapeutic agent taxol. The taxol‐dependent cytoplasmic accumulation of RUNX2 is inhibited by leptomycin B. which blocks CRM‐1 dependent nuclear export. and is not affected by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Human embryonic stem (ES) cells have an expedited cell cycle (∼15 h) due to an abbreviated G1 phase (∼2.5 h) relative to somatic cells. One principal regulatory event during cell cycle progression is the G1/S phase induction of histone biosynthesis to package newly replicated DNA. In somatic cells. histone H4 gene expression is controlled by CDK2 phosphorylation of p220NPAT and localization of HiNF‐P/p220NPAT complexes with histone genes at Cajal body related subnuclear foci. Here we show that this ‘S point’ pathway is operative in situ in human ES cells (H9 cells; NIH‐designated WA09). Immunofluorescence microscopy shows an increase in p220NPAT foci in G1 reflecting the assembly of histone gene regulatory complexes in situ. In contrast to somatic cells where duplication of p220NPAT foci is evident in S phase. the increase in the number of p220NPAT foci in ES cells appears to precede the …,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C,61,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcp.21119,5776438095905030065,/scholar?cites=5776438095905030065,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jcp.21119,0,0,0

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by MSCs act as their paracrine effectors by delivering proteins and genetic material to recipient cells. To assess how their cargo mediates biological processes that drive their therapeutic effects. we integrated miRNA. mRNA. and protein expression data of EVs from porcine adipose tissue-derived MSCs.   Methods Simultaneous expression profiles of miRNAs. mRNAs. and proteins were obtained by high-throughput sequencing and LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis in porcine MSCs and their daughter EVs (n = 3 each). TargetScan and ComiR were used to predict miRNA target genes. Functional annotation analysis was performed using DAVID 6.7 database to rank primary gene ontology categories for the enriched mRNAs. miRNA target genes. and proteins. STRING was used to predict associations between mRNA and miRNA target genes.   Results Differential expression analysis revealed 4 miRNAs. 255 mRNAs. and 277 proteins enriched in EVs versus MSCs (fold change >2. p<0.05).

Currently. the most reliable technique for determining a patients’ prognosis is measurement of histopathologic tumor necrosis following pre-operative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Unfavourable prognosis is indicated by less than 90% estimated necrosis of the tumor. Neither genetic testing nor molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis have been described for osteosarcomas. We used the novel nanoString mRNA digital expression analysis system to analyse gene expression in 32 patients with sporadic paediatric osteosarcoma.

To gain insight into relationships between biological processes. structural alterations and behavioral pain. we created an animal model in rats. Disk degeneration was induced by removal of the nucleus pulposus (NP) from the lumbar disks (L4/L5 and L5/L6) of Sprague Dawley rats using a 0.5-mm-diameter microsurgical drill. The degree of primary hyperalgesia was assessed by using an algometer to measure pain upon external pressure on injured lumbar disks. Biochemical and histological assessments and radiographs of injured disks were used for evaluation. We investigated therapeutic modulation of chronic pain by administering pharmaceutical drugs in this animal model. After removal of the NP. pressure hyperalgesia developed over the lower back. Nine weeks after surgery we observed damaged or degenerated disks with proteoglycan loss and narrowing of disk height. These biological and structural changes in disks were closely related to the sustained pain hyperalgesia. A high dose of morphine (6.7 mg/kg) resulted in effective pain relief. However. high doses of pregabalin (20 mg/kg). a drug that has been used for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. as well as the anti-inflammatory drugs celecoxib (50 mg/kg; a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)) and ketorolac (20 mg/kg; an inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2). did not have significant antihyperalgesic effects in our disk injury animal model.

The principal theme of this prospect will be the contribution of nuclear structure to the regulation of gene expression as functionally related to development and maintenance of the osteoblast phenotype during establishment of bone tissue‐like organization. The contributions of nuclear structure as it regulates and is regulated by the progressive developmental expression of cell growth and bone cell related genes will be examined.

The region involved in the binding of the protein has been localized to an upstream DNA segment using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This DNA segment is devoid of RNA polymerase II consensus sequences and contains both homopurinic and A/T rich tracts. Analogous experiments have identified a similar. and perhaps identical. factor that has affinity for a cell cycle dependent human H3 histone gene promoter.

Recent studies demonstrate that mitotic occupancy of genes. which are determinants of cell fate. growth. and proliferation. by lineage-restricted transcription factors is a key epigenetic mechanism for retention and transmission of cellular expression memory. Evidence is emerging for the presence of distinct transcriptional regulatory microenvironments in mitotic chromosomes in which the genes bookmarked for reactivation postmitotically reside.

Calvarial osteoblasts isolated from TIEG1 knockout (KO) mice display reduced expression levels of multiple bone related genes. including Runx2. and exhibit significant delays in their mineralization rates relative to wildtype controls. These data suggest that TIEG1 plays an important role in regulating Runx2 expression in bone and that decreased Runx2 expression in TIEG1 KO mice is in part responsible for the observed osteopenic phenotype. In this manuscript. data is presented demonstrating that over-expression of TIEG1 results in increased expression of Runx2 while repression of TIEG1 results in suppression of Runx2. Transient transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that TIEG1 directly binds to and activates the Runx2 promoter. The zinc finger containing domain of TIEG1 is necessary for this regulation supporting that activation occurs through direct DNA binding. A role for the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in fine tuning the regulation of Runx2 expression by TIEG1 is also implicated in this study. Additionally. the regulation of Runx2 expression by cytokines such as TGFβ1 and BMP2 is shown to be inhibited in the absence of TIEG1. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization assays indicate that TIEG1 protein associates with Runx2 protein resulting in co-activation of Runx2 transcriptional activity. Lastly.

The t(8;21) chromosomal translocation produces AML1-ETO. an oncogenic fusion protein that compromises the function of AML1. a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell differentiation. Because of the pressing need for new therapies in the treatment of acute myleoid leukemia. we investigated the genome-wide occupancy of AML1-ETO in leukemic cells to discover novel regulatory mechanisms involving AML-ETO bound genes. We report the co-localization of AML1-ETO with the N-CoR co-repressor to be primarily on genomic regions distal to transcriptional start sites (TSSs). These regions exhibit over-representation of the motif for PU.1. a key hematopoietic regulator and member of the ETS family of transcription factors. A significant discovery of our study is that genes co-occupied by AML1-ETO and N-CoR (e.g.. TYROBP and LAPTM5) are associated with the leukemic phenotype. as determined by analyses of gene ontology and by the observation that these genes are predominantly up-regulated upon AML1-ETO depletion. In contrast. the AML1-ETO/p300 gene network is less responsive to AML1-ETO depletion and less associated with the differentiation block characteristic of leukemic cells. Furthermore. a substantial fraction of AML1-ETO/p300 co-localization occurs near TSSs in promoter regions associated with transcriptionally active loci.

In this study. we examined Runx2-P1 transcriptional regulation in a cellular in vivo context during early osteoblastogenesis of MC3T3-E1 cultures and BMSCs induced towards the bone lineage by multi-layered analysis of the Runx2-P1 gene promoter using the following methodologies: 1) sequence homology among several mammalian species. 2) DNaseI hypersensitivity coupled with massively parallel sequencing …,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111914006076,10352676947696921495,/scholar?cites=10352676947696921495,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4149845/,0,0,0

DNA was extracted from visually damaged and normal appearing. non-damaged human knee articular cartilage from the same joint and then subjected to reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. DMRs were identified using a genome-wide systematic bioinformatics approach. A sliding-window of 500 bp was used for screening the genome for regions with clusters of DMSs.

Human histone nuclear factor P (HiNF-P; gene symbol HINFP) bound to its cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) responsive coactivator p220NPAT is a key regulator of multiple human histone H4 genes that encode a major subunit of the nucleosome. Induction of the histone H4 transcription factor (HINFP)/p220NPAT coactivation complex occurs in parallel with the CDK-dependent release of pRB from E2F at the restriction point. Here. we show that the downstream CDK-dependent cell cycle effector HINFP is genetically required and. in contrast to the CDK2/cyclin E complex. cannot be compensated.

In most biological systems the down-regulation of proliferation is necessary for initiation of key steps in the differentiation process. We have examined regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of the cell cycle-dependent histone genes. which are functionally coupled with DNA synthesis. in proliferating cells and during the onset of differentiation in several phenotypes including adipocytes. In proliferating cells transcription of the histone genes is up-regulated at the onset of S phase. We have identified a histone H4 proximal promoter element. designated Site II. that mediates cell cycle transcriptional control. The factor interacting with Site II include cdc2. cyclin A. an RB-related protein and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Mutational analysis indicates that the distal part of Site II is critical for cell cycle regulation. Equally important for the developmental transcriptional control. histone gene expression is repressed when differentiation is initiated.

NJ,The skeleton provides rigid mechanical support to the body. protects vital organs. and serves as a reservoir of ions. especially for calcium and phosphate required for serum homeostasis. The integrity of the skeleton is maintained by continuous remodeling of bone tissues throughout life in response to a broad spectrum of physiologic signals. As described in Chapter 9. the active hormone 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D) plays a key role in the maintenance of calcium and phosphate blood levels. In response to reduced serum calcium levels. calcium transport is stimulated across the gut and from the renal tubular lumen into the bloodstream. At the same time. calcium is mobilized from bone.

To investigate the role of IRF-2 in control of cell proliferation. we have constructed a stable FDC-P1 cell line (F2) in which expression of IRF-2 is doxycycline (DOX)-inducible. and a control cell line (F0). Both the F2 and F0 cell lines were synchronized in the G1 phase by isoleucine deprivation. and IRF-2 was induced by DOX on release of cells from the cell cycle block. Flow cytometric analyses indicated that forced expression of IRF-2 has limited effects on cell cycle progression before the first mitosis.

These experiments make it exceptionally easy to identify a list of candidate genes that are differentially regulated in a biological system of interest.Candidate gene lists are often dominated by genes that are unfamiliar to any single researcher. so interpreting their significance usually requires a time-consuming and laborious search into the primary literature. Review articles can be useful tools to quickly gain a basic understanding of a new field. but the availability of a recent review article on any given gene or protein is currently quite limited. Recently. there has been a growing interest in using “crowdsourcing” to organize biological knowledge.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,1α.25‐dihydroxy vitamin D3 (vitamin D3) has an important role during osteoblast differentiation as it directly modulates the expression of key bone‐related genes. Vitamin D3 binds to the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR). a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors. which in turn interacts with transcriptional activators to target this regulatory complex to specific sequence elements within gene promoters. Increasing evidence demonstrates that the architectural organization of the genome and regulatory proteins within the eukaryotic nucleus support gene expression in a physiological manner.

Inc.,Intra-articular ligamentous injuries are typically unrepairable and have limited outcomes after graft reconstruction. A combination of porous polycaprolactone fumarate (PCLF) scaffolds with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sutures was developed with the goal of regenerating intra-articular ligaments. Scaffolds were fabricated by injecting PCLF over three-dimensional-printed molds containing two strands of PET suture down its central pore followed by cross-linking. Scaffolds were seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from adipose tissue. To demonstrate cell attachment and proliferation in culture. we performed live/dead staining and cell proliferation assays. These experiments showed that MSCs remain viable and continue to proliferate on the scaffolds in culture for at least 2 weeks.

Inc.,Nuclear actin plays a critical role in mediating mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate commitment. In marrow‐derived MSCs. the principal diaphanous‐related formin Diaph3 (mDia2) is present in the nucleus and regulates intranuclear actin polymerization. whereas Diaph1 (mDia1) is localized to the cytoplasm and controls cytoplasmic actin polymerization. We here show that mDia2 can be used as a tool to query actin‐lamin nucleoskeletal structure. Silencing mDia2 affected the nucleoskeletal lamin scaffold. altering nuclear morphology without affecting cytoplasmic actin cytoskeleton. and promoted MSC differentiation. Attempting to target intranuclear actin polymerization by silencing mDia2 led to a profound loss in lamin B1 nuclear envelope structure and integrity. increased nuclear height. and reduced nuclear stiffness without compensatory changes in other actin nucleation factors.

Inc Boca Raton. FL,Over the past 2 decades it has become increasingly apparent that cell proliferation is associated with a complex and interdependent series of biochemical events involving modifications in gene expression mediated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Historically. observations that the cellular content of histone proteins doubles during S phase and that histone protein synthesis occurs concomitantly with DNA synthesis provided the first example of gene expression functionally related to cell growth. 1 Subsequent investigations in our laboratory and in others have provided evidence that expression of the histone genes in mammalian cells is indeed both temporally and functionally coupled with DNA replication. 217 Current efforts are focused on molecular mechanisms. regulatory sequences. and regulatory molecules that mediate the cell cycle-dependent expression of these genes. In this chapter we will first consider the structure and organization of human histone genes. These genes are represented as a multigene family with differences in the structure. organization. and regulation of the different copies. The biological and biochemical parameters of human histone gene expression will then be considered and here results will be presented which are consistent with expression being mediated at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.

Osteoblasts produce extracellular matrix proteins and paracrine factors that together support formation of bone tissue. Osteoblasts survive approximately 2 weeks unless they become bone‐lining cells or osteocytes [1]. Bone‐lining osteoblasts reside on nonmineralized bone surfaces (osteoid). have a single nucleus. and are basophilic. Osteoblasts have abundant endoplastic reticulum to support the production of collagens (predominantly type I collagen) that will eventually become mineralized.

To expand our understanding of cis-regulatory regions critical to the control of gene expression during osteoblastogenesis. we probed the presence of open chromatin states across the osteoblast genome using global DNase hypersensitivity (DHS) mapping. Our profiling of MC3T3 mouse pre-osteoblasts during differentiation has identified more than 224.000 unique DHS sites. Approximately 65% of these sites are dynamic during temporal stages of osteoblastogenesis. and a majority of them are located within non-promoter (intergenic and intronic) regions. Nearly half of all DHS sites (both constitutive and dynamic) overlap binding events of the bone-essential RUNX2 and/or the chromatin-related CTCF transcription factors. This finding reinforces the role of these regulatory proteins as essential components of the bone gene regulome. We observe a reduction in chromatin accessibility throughout the genome between pre-osteoblast and early osteoblasts. Our analysis also defined a class of differentially expressed genes that harbor DHS peaks centered within 1 kb downstream of transcriptional end sites (TES). These DHSs at the 3’-flanks of genes exhibit dynamic changes during differentiation that may impact regulation of the osteoblast genome. Taken together. the distribution of DHS regions within non-promoter locations harboring osteoblast and chromatin related transcription factor binding motifs. reflect novel cis-regulatory requirements to support temporal gene …,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:K4-iKlO5MD4C,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188056,3901779955484801377,/scholar?cites=3901779955484801377,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188056,0,0,0

Exocoetus volitans. a species of two-winged flyingfish. is a good model for understanding large-scale patterns of epipelagic fish population structure because it has a circumtropical geographic range and completes its entire life cycle in the epipelagic zone. Buoyant pelagic eggs should dictate high local dispersal capacity in this species. although a brief larval phase. small body size. and short lifespan may limit the dispersal of individuals over large spatial scales. Based on these biological features. we hypothesized that E. volitans would exhibit statistically and biologically significant population structure defined by recognized oceanographic barriers. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing cytochrome b mtDNA sequence data (1106 bps) from specimens collected in the Pacific. Atlantic and Indian oceans (n = 266). AMOVA. Bayesian. and coalescent analytical approaches were used to assess and interpret population-level genetic variability. A parsimony-based haplotype network did not reveal population subdivision among ocean basins. but AMOVA revealed limited. statistically significant population structure between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (ΦST = 0.035. p<0.001).

The experiment was performed to stuy the effect and mechanism of FSTL1 on chondrocyte apoptosis in osteoarthritis. DESIGN: After the isolation of human normal and osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes. the expression of FSTL1 was detected by Q-PCR and western blot analyses. Chondrocytes were pre-transfected with FSTL1 overexpression plasmids then treated with SNP. and chondrocyte viability and apoptosis levels were detected by MTS and flow cytometry. respectively. Cartilage matrix gene expression was measured by Q-PCR and signal pathway-related proteins were assessed by western blot. RESULTS: The expression of FSTL1 in OA chondrocytes was markedly up-regulated compared with normal human chondrocytes (P< 0.05). The apoptosis rate of chondrocytes in the FSTL1 overexpression groups was highly elevated in the comparison with the negative control groups (P< 0.05). Additionally. FSTL1 potentiated protein abundances of MMP1. MMP3. MMP-9. and Bax as well as reduced Coll2a1 and Aggrecan and Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore. western blot results showed that the SAPK/JNK/Caspase3 signal pathway was significantly activated and the Ac-DEVD-FMK impaired FSTL1 induced chondrocyte apoptosis.

Primary antibodies should be well characterized. We recommend testing antibody specificity by immunoblotting. In general. monoclonal antibodies have a selective advantage of recognizing only a single epitope but may not produce a high titer. In contrast. polyclonal antibodies generally have a high titer but may recognize multiple epitopes that may result in crossreactivity with several proteins because of similar amino acid sequences. The problem of low titer antibody and poor antigenicity can be overcome by marking the proteins with an epitope “tag.” The most widely used tags in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells include glutathione S-transferase . β-galactosidase. 6× histidine. hemagglutinin.

The linear ordering of protein coding sequences in genes. as well as the representation of flanking and intragenic regulatory elements. only partially accounts for transcriptional responsiveness to the broad spectrum of cues from physiological signalling pathways that modulate gene expression under diverse biological circumstances. Equally important. cataloguing protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions at gene regulatory sequences is necessary but insufficient to explain the transcriptional mechanisms that are operative in intact cells and tissues. Rather. there is growing awareness that gene expression must be understood from the perspective of contributions by multiple levels of nuclear organization. The packaging of DNA as chromatin reduces distances between gene promoter elements. supporting the integration of regulatory activities. Regulatory mechanisms mediating remodelling of chromatin organization that render promoter sequences competent to interact with cognate transcription factors and support protein-protein interactions are required for fidelity of gene expression. The spatial distribution of genes and regulatory factors within the nucleus facilitates the formation of sites that support replication. transcription. and processing of gene transcripts. Mechanisms that direct factors to intranuclear domains. where replication and gene expression occur. are the principal parameters of control that interrelate biochemical components of regulation with nuclear morphology.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:eGYfIraVYiQC,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=COxuLOJnF3gC&oi=fnd&pg=PA177&dq=info:523tQ6hMMKAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9TrKkbtfst&sig=ZWKiLKycLplshBoa57t1MfFofBI,11542810130528431591,/scholar?cites=11542810130528431591,,,0,0,0

The modularly organized promoter elements of genes that support the onset and progression of proliferation are presented as blueprints for growth control within the context of responsiveness to mediators of proliferative status. These encompass cytokines. growth factors. steroid hormones. and cell cycle regulatory factors that include but are not restricted to cyclins. cyclin‐dependent kinases. cyclin inhibitors. and tumor suppressor proteins.

The linear representation of promoter elements provides competency for physiological responsiveness within the contexts of developmental as well as cell cycle and phenotype-dependent regulation. Chromatin structure and nucleosome organization reduce distances between independent regulatory elements providing a basis for integrating components of transcriptional control. The nuclear matrix supports gene expression by imposing physical constraints on chromatin related to three dimensional genomic organization.

Inhibition of DNA‐PKcs inhibited cell cycle progression and increased osteogenesis by significantly enhancing the bone morphogenetic protein 2 response in osteoblasts and other mesenchymal cell types. Importantly. in vivo pharmacological inhibition of the kinase enhanced bone biomechanical properties.

New York. NY,Co-culture of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has been shown to be beneficial in engineering cartilage tissue in vitro. In these co-cultures. MSCs increase the proliferation and matrix deposition of chondrocytes. The MSCs accomplish this beneficial effect by so-called trophic actions. Thus. large cartilage constructs can be made with a relatively small number of chondrocytes. In this chapter. we describe different methods for making co-cultures of MSCs and chondrocytes. We also provide detailed protocols for analyzing MSC-chondrocyte co-cultures with cell tracking. proliferation assays. species-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCR). rheological analysis. compression analysis.

They are non-viable. which can result in infection. non-union and stress-fractures. We aimed to revascularize allografts in porcine and rat models using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). combined with platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) administered through an adeno-associated viral vector. We report the development of vascular tumors resulting from this treatment.Methods: In two separate studies. an identical AAV. VEGF. PDGF vector was used to promote angiogenesis in cryopreserved bone allografts. In 8 Yucatan minipigs. a 3.5 cm segmental tibial defect was reconstructed with a matched allograft. revascularized by placement of a transfected arteriovenous (AV) bundle within the medullary canal. In another experiment. cryopreserved femoral bone allografts coated with AAV. VEGF. PDGF were placed across a 10 mm segmental femoral gap in 10 Lewis rats.Results: Vascular tumors developed in skin and subcutaneous tissues in 5 out of 8 pigs and all of the rats. Histology revealed changes essentially identical to those seen in pyogenic granuloma (lobular capillary hemangioma) in humans. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified the sequence of human VEGF-DNA in all of the sampled tumor tissues.Conclusion: Recombinant AAV gene therapy used to promote angiogenesis in avascular bone risks the development of vascular cutaneous lesions.

This approach is part of a broader theoretical restructuring.The application of evolutionary teratology to the forelimbs of non-avian theropod dinosaurs has focused on the drastic forelimbs shortening and manual anomalies of some representatives. both in Ceratosauria and Tetanurae. Evolutionary teratological diagnosis can also be made during post-natal growth. differentiating juvenile and adult stages.The methods of evolutionary teratology and its scales of discussion highlight the need to redefine certain Darwinian notions. leading to consider evo-devo as a connection between disciplines.

Post‐translational modifications in the N‐termini of histone 3 (H3). including tri‐methylated H3 lysine 9 (H3K9Me3) or lysine 27 (H3K27Me3) represent repressive chromatin marks that are recognized by a family of heterochromatin‐associated Chromobox (Cbx) proteins (i.e.. Cbx1 to Cbx8). We show using RNA‐seq analysis that each of these Cbx isoforms is actively expressed in bone and osteoblasts with variable expression of distinct members (between 1 and 100 reads per million). The most prominently expressed Cbx member is Cbx3. which encodes a member of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family that interacts with H3K9me3.

However. the mechanisms that drive integrated musculoskeletal development and coordinated growth and differentiation of each of these tissues are still being uncovered. Epigenetic modifiers have emerged as critical regulators of cell fate differentiation. but so far almost nothing is known about their roles in tendon biology. Previous studies have shown that epigenetic modifications driven by Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). a major histone methyltransferase. have significant roles in vertebrate development including skeletal patterning and bone formation. We now find that targeting  Ezh2  through the limb mesenchyme also has significant effects on tendon and muscle patterning. likely reflecting the essential roles of early mesenchymal cues mediated by  Ezh2  for coordinated patterning and development of all tissues of the musculoskeletal system. Conversely. loss of  Ezh2  in the tendon cells did not disrupt the tendon cell fate suggesting that tenocyte differentiation and tendon maturation are independent of  Ezh2  signaling.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:RJujIP1NYNUC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.361949v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/10/30/2020.10.30.361949.full.pdf,0,0,0

Mechanical signals. including strain and low intensity vibration (LIV). are important regulators of MSC differentiation. Lamin A/C is a vital protein for nuclear architecture that supports chromatin organization. as well as mechanical integrity and mechano-sensitivity of the nucleus in MSCs. Here. we investigated whether Lamin A/C and mechano-responsiveness are functionally coupled during adipogenesis. Lamin depletion in MSCs using siRNA increased nuclear area. height and volume and decreased circularity and stiffness. while phosphorylation of focal adhesions and dynamic substrate strain in response to LIV remained intact. Lamin A/C depletion decelerates adipogenesis as reflected by delayed appearance of key biomarkers (e.g.. adiponectin/ADIPOQ). Based on RNA-seq data. reduced Lamin A/C levels decrease the activation of the adipocyte transcriptome that is normally observed in response to adipogenic cues mediating differentiation of MSCs. Mechanical stimulation via daily LIV application reduced the expression levels of ADIPOQ in both control and Lamin A/C depleted cells. Yet. treatment with LIV did not induce major transcriptome changes in either control or Lamin A/C depleted MSCs. suggesting that the biological effects of LIV on adipogenesis may not occur at the transcriptional level. We conclude that while Lamin A/C activation is essential for normal adipogenesis. it is dispensible for activation of focal adhesions by dynamic vibration induced mechanical signals.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:Oo_WeVVXg5wC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.07.279828v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/07/2020.09.07.279828.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this study we compared RNA sequencing data from cranial tissues of a severe form of Crouzon craniosynostosis syndrome (C57BL/6 FGFR2C342Y/+ mice) with those of a less severe form of Crouzon craniosynostosis (BALB/c FGFR2C342Y/+ mice) to identify genetic modifiers that influence craniosynostosis phenotype severity. Comparison of the mice revealed neonatal onset of coronal suture fusion in the form of suture obliteration in C57BL/6 mice (88% incidence. p<.001 between genotypes). Coronal suture fusion in the form of point fusions across the suture occurred at approximately 4 weeks after birth. with less severe skull shape abnormalities. in BALB/c mice. Substantially fewer genes were differentially expressed in BALB/c FGFR2+/+ vs. FGFR2C342Y/+ mice (87 out of 15.893 expressed genes) than C57BL/6 FGFR2C+/+ vs. FGFR2C342Y/+ mice (2.043 out of 19.097 expressed genes). Further investigation revealed differential expression of coronal suture fusion associated genes. eph/ephrin boundary genes. cell proliferation genes. osteoblast differentiation genes and epigenetic regulators. among others. The most striking pattern in the data was the minimal change in gene expression seen for most genes in  BALB/c FGFR2+/+ vs. FGFR2C342Y/+ mice. Analysis of protein processing and lysosomal components support the hypothesis that the craniosynostosis phenotype is less severe in BALB/c mice because the mutant FGFR2C342Y protein is not expressed to the same extent as that seen in C57BL/6 mice.

Combining the strengths of systems biology and deep learning in a model called DEcode. we are able to predict DE more accurately than traditional sequence-based methods. which do not utilize systems biology data. To determine the biological origins of this accuracy. we identify the most predictive regulators and types of regulatory interactions in DEcode. contrasting their roles across many human tissues. Diverse systems biology. ontological and disease-related assessments all point to the predominant influence of post-translational RNA-binding factors on DE. Through the combinatorial gene regulation that is captured in DEcode. it is even possible to predict relatively subtle person-to-person variation in gene expression. We demonstrate the broad applicability of these clinically-relevant predictions by predicting drivers of aging throughout the human lifespan. gene coexpression relationships on a genome-wide scale. and frequent DE in diverse conditions.

Case Description The specimens were preloaded to 5 N and subsequently biomechanically loaded to failure. at a rate of 0.1 mm/s on a jig that allowed for axial load. The maximum load and mode of failure were recorded. Load to failure in the 360 tenodesis group with internal brace was 283.47±100.25 N. compared with the 360 tenodesis group only. whose yield strength was 143.61±90.54 N. The mode of failure within the internal brace construct was either through knot slippage. graft disruption. or bone separation from strength testing construct. The 360 tenodesis group tended to fail via graft slippage or graft rupture. Literature Review The management of scapholunate instability can be a difficult problem to treat. Traditionally. many of the surgical reconstructions have focused upon dorsal ligament reconstruction with Kirschner (K) wire fixation. This results in prolonged immobilization of the wrist with varied outcomes. in part due to the multiaxial instability that may persist due to concomitant volar ligament disruption. To address this instability. surgical techniques have been devised that address both the volar and dorsal ligament injuries. Clinical Relevance Scapholunate reconstruction with a 360-degree tenodesis and internal brace augmentation (SLITT procedure) provided superior biomechanical stability than tenodesis alone.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:E2bRg1zSkIsC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/med/31192049,,,,http://owens.mit.edu/sfx_local?sid=google&auinit=S&aulast=Kakar&atitle=Scapholunate+Ligament+Internal+Brace+360+Tenodesis+(SLITT)+Procedure:+A+Biomechanical+Study.&id=pmid:31192049,0,0,0

When differentiated cells enter and exit mitosis. chromosomal condensation prevents gene expression. Post‐mitotic re‐activation of transcription is controlled in part by epigenetic marks on DNA and histones that control chromatin accessibility. However. mRNA molecules also appear to be transferred to progeny cells by either symmetrical or asymmetrical transmission. We have shown that the mRNA for the bone‐related transcription factor Runx2 mRNAs is elevated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. but not translated in osteoblasts. This observation suggests that Runx2 protein is translationally rather than transcriptionally controlled after mitosis to maintain the phenotypic identity of osteoblasts.

Cell-cell communication in the many skeletal pericellular micro-niches is critical for bone development and involves paracrine secretion of growth factors and morphogens. This paracrine signaling is in part regulated by “A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase” (ADAM) proteins. These cell membrane-associated metalloproteinases support proteolytic release (“shedding”) of protein ectodomains residing at the cell surface. We analyzed microarray and RNA-sequencing data for Adam genes and show that Adam17. Adam10. and Adam9 are stimulated during BMP2 mediated induction of osteogenic differentiation and are robustly expressed in human osteoblastic cells. ADAM17. which was initially identified as a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) converting enzyme also called (TACE). regulates TNFα-signaling pathway. which inhibits osteoblast differentiation. We demonstrate that Adam17 expression is suppressed by RUNX2 during osteoblast differentiation through the proximal Adam17 promoter region (−0.4 kb) containing two functional RUNX2 binding motifs. Adam17 downregulation during osteoblast differentiation is paralleled by increased RUNX2 expression. cytoplasmicnuclear translocation and enhanced binding to the Adam17 proximal promoter. Forced expression of Adam17 reduces Runx2 and Alpl expression. indicating that Adam17 may negatively modulate osteoblast differentiation.

We performed a GWAS meta-analysis on radiographic dental development (DD) in children of school age to identify genetic determinants of dental maturity.Methods: Discovery GWAS of DD was performed in the Generation R study. a multiethnic pregnancy cohort in Rotterdam. The Netherlands. We included 2.793 children with mean age 9.82 (SD 0.34) years. DD was determined from dental panoramic radiographs using the Demirjian method. Participants were genotyped with the HumanHap 610K platform. imputed to the 1000GP reference panel. The analysis was adjusted for age. sex. BMI. and 20 genomic principal components; genome-wide significance (GWS) was set at P< 5x10-8. Replication of signals associated with DD was pursued using summary level results from the published GWAS meta-analysis of the ALSPAC and NFBC1966 studies (n= 12.012) studying NT and AFTE. Fisher’s combined probability test weighted by sample size was used for the combined meta-analysis. DEPICT is used to identify the most likely causal gene at a given associated locus. reconstituted gene sets enriched for DD associations. and tissues and cell types in which genes from associated loci are highly expressed.

Checkpoint inhibitors demonstrated clinical utilities of targeting tumor-mediated immune suppression. We aim to identify additional immunotherapy targets for myeloid cells and previously reported the presence of a novel phenotype of immunosuppressive monocytes (CD14+ HLA-DR low/neg) in a number of cancers. Increased presence of these cells was associated with decreased treatment response and OS. We have demonstrated that certain tumor cells can convert normal CD14+ HLA-DR+ monocytes to CD14+ HLA-DR low/neg phenotype in an IL10 independent and a tumor specific way.

Yet. effective conservation efforts depend on population-level ecological data. To obtain principal baseline data that will inform management efforts. we characterized the habitat and recorded the behaviour of a Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) population within one of the most well-preserved estuaries off southern Brazil. Monthly surveys were conducted for one year (August 1999-July 2000) within an area of approximately 100 km2. within the Paranaguá Bay Estuary. We employed the group follow protocol. which resulted in 260 h of direct observation. Our results revealed feeding as the most frequent activity in the estuary. totaling nearly two thirds of all records. We also identified two sites of Guiana dolphin habitat preference in our study area. where sightings remarkably totalled> 62% of observation records. These sites (especially Guaraqueçaba Bay) were not only important for feeding. but also for S. guianensis socialization. The detection of these key areas should facilitate both local and broad-scale efforts to preserve critical habitats for this population of dolphins. and by extension may help inform management plans for ecologically vulnerable S. guianensis populations in other parts of their distribution.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:sJK75vZXtG0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paulo_Simes-Lopes/publication/321582805_Habitat_Preference_and_Behaviour_of_the_Guiana_Dolphin_Sotalia_guianensis_in_a_Well-Preserved_Estuary_off_Southern_Brazil/links/5a9021f245851535bcd4ad41/Habitat-Preference-and-Behaviour-of-the-Guiana-Dolphin-Sotalia-guianensis-in-a-Well-Preserved-Estuary-off-Southern-Brazil.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paulo_Simes-Lopes/publication/321582805_Habitat_Preference_and_Behaviour_of_the_Guiana_Dolphin_Sotalia_guianensis_in_a_Well-Preserved_Estuary_off_Southern_Brazil/links/5a9021f245851535bcd4ad41/Habitat-Preference-and-Behaviour-of-the-Guiana-Dolphin-Sotalia-guianensis-in-a-Well-Preserved-Estuary-off-Southern-Brazil.pdf,0,0,0

74224,Improved post thaw function of mesenchymal stromal cells using solutions containing osmolytes,2017,A Hubel and K Pollock and R Samsonraj and D McKenna and A van Wijnen,19,Cytotherapy,5,S159,Elsevier,Current methods for freezing mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) result in poor post-thaw function and concerns over poor post thaw function has led to the use of post thaw culture for the cells. A novel. biologically inspired approach was used to improve the post thaw function of MSCs using combinations of sugars. sugar alcohols and small molecule additives. The composition of the cryoprotective solution was optimized using a Differential Evolution (DE)-based algorithm that enabled rapid optimization of the solution composition. MSCs frozen using these solutions exhibit comparable post thaw recovery to conventional DMSO-based methods but improved post-thaw attachment. In addition. cytoskeletal alignment resembles fresh cells more closely that cells exposed to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)(Figure 1). The cells retain the ability for multi-lineage differentiation. RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR validation demonstrate that transcripts for distinct classes of cytoprotective genes were upregulated in the osmolyte-based solutions compared to cells cryopreserved in DMSO. For example. the osmotic regulator galanin (GAL). the anti-apoptotic marker BCL2. as well as the cell surface adhesion molecules CD106 (VCAM1) and CD54 (ICAM1) are all elevated in DMSO-free solutions. In contrast. cells cryopreserved in DMSO expressed an increase in stress related gene expression. These studies validate the concept that DMSO-free solutions improve post-thaw biological functions and are viable alternatives for freezing MSCs. These novel solutions promote expression of cytoprotective genes. modulate the CpG epigenome and retain the ability of the cells …,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:NtCmTCuxid4C,0,https://www.isct-cytotherapy.org/article/S1465-3249(17)30305-5/pdf,,,,,0,0,0

Because bone marrow adiposity is linked not only to systemic energy metabolism. but also to both bone marrow and musculoskeletal disorders. this biologic compartment has become of major interest to investigators from diverse disciplines. Bone marrow adiposity represents a virtual multi-tissue endocrine organ. which encompasses cells from multiple developmental lineages (eg. mesenchymal. myeloid. lymphoid) and occupies all the nonosseous and non-cartilaginous space within long bones.

Using an in vitro cell culture model of the bone marrow. our lab recently showed that differentiating osteoblasts potently protect AML cells from apoptosis. In addition. we found that differentiating osteoblasts treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) fail to protect AML cells in this model. Since HDACi decreased the expression of genes required for osteoblast differentiation. we hypothesize that blocking specific stage(s) of osteoblast differentiation may make AML cells within the bone marrow more susceptible to chemotherapy.

Here. we characterized a non-genomic mRNA mediated mechanism by which osteoblast precursors retain their phenotype during self-renewal. We show that osteoblasts produce maximal levels of Runx2 mRNA. but not protein. prior to mitotic cell division. Runx2 mRNA partitions symmetrically between daughter cells in a non-chromosomal tubulin-containing compartment. Subsequently. transcription-independent de novo synthesis of Runx2 protein in early G1 phase results in increased functional interactions of Runx2 with a representative osteoblast-specific target gene (osteocalcin/BGLAP2) in chromatin. Somatic transmission of Runx2 mRNAs in osteoblasts and osteosarcoma cells represents a versatile mechanism for translational rather than transcriptional induction of this principal gene regulator to maintain osteoblast phenotype identity after mitosis.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:vofGIMt6cyEC,0,http://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/139397,,,,http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/139397/Mitotic-Inheritance-of-mRNA.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Runx2 transcription factor is the master regulator of mesenchymal cells responsible for intramembranous osteoblast differentiation and formation of the craniofacial bone tissue that surrounds and protects the central nervous system (CNS) in mammalian embryos. The molecular mechanisms that mediate silencing of the Runx2 gene and its downstream target osteogenic-related genes in neuronal cells have not been explored. Here. we assess the epigenetic mechanisms that mediate silencing of osteoblast-specific genes in CNS neurons. In particular. we address the contribution of histone epigenetic marks and histone modifiers on the silencing of the Runx2/p57 bone-related isoform in rat hippocampal tissues at embryonic to adult stages. Our results indicate enrichment of repressive chromatin histone marks and of the Polycomb PRC2 complex at the Runx2/p57 promoter region. Knockdown of PRO H3K27-methyltransferases Ezh2 and Ezh1. or forced expression of the Trithorax/COMPASS subunit Wdr5 activates Runx2/p57 mRNA expression in both immature and mature hippocampal cells. Together these results indicate that complementary epigenetic mechanisms progressively and efficiently silence critical osteoblastic genes during hippocampal neuron differentiation.

Dengue virus (DENV) occurs as four distinct serotypes. called DENV 1. 2. 3. and 4. Symptomatic DENV infection ranges from a self limited febrile ilness. dengue fever (DF). to a more severe disease. dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). DHF is characterized by increased capilary permeability resulting in decreased plasma volume. which may be accompanied by hemorrhagic manifestations. Many factors including T cell cross reactivity. viral burden. antibody dependent enhancement and induction of chemokines and cytokines have been reported in DHF and may playa role in the pathogenesis of DENV infection. Cytokines have been shown to modulate endothelial cell permeability (1-3). Recent studies have shown that DENV-infected endothelial cells secrete the chemokine interleukin (IL)- in vitro(4). In addition. the permeability of an endothelial cell monolayer was found to be increased by interleukin-S (IL-S) in vitro(5). This thesis examines the effects of DEN2V infection on the induction of chemokines. and specifically. which DEN2V viral protein (s) are involved in the induction of IL-The chemokine induction profile following DEN2V infection was initially assessed in various cell lines that may represent potential targets in vivo. including monocytes. liver cells and endothelial cells. We hypothesized that distinct profiles of chemokine secretion can be induced by DEN2V infection of various cell types in vitro.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:oFn-K-OQSCAC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/129345999.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/129345999.pdf,0,0,0

Physiol,,1-10,,Epigenetic mechanisms mediating expression of the Runt-related transcription factor Runx2 are critical for controlling its osteogenic activity during skeletal development. Here. we characterized bona fide regulatory elements within 120 kbp of the endogenous bonerelated Runx2 promoter (P1) in osteoblasts by genomic DNase I footprinting and chromatin immuno-precipitations (ChIPs). We identified a $10 kbp genomic domain spanning the P1 promoter that interacts with acetylated histones H3 and H4 reflecting an open chromatin conformation in MC3T3 osteoblasts. This large chromatin domain contains a single major DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) region that defines a 0.4 kbp ‘‘basal core’’promoter. This region encompasses two endogenous genomic protein/DNA interaction sites (ie. footprints at Activating Protein 1 [AP1]. E-box and Runx motifs). Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH)/E-box occupancy and presence of the DHS region persists in several mesenchymal cell types. but AP1 site occupancy occurs only during S phase when Runx2 expression is minimal. Point-mutation of the HLH/E box dramatically reduces basal promoter activity. Our results indicate that the Runx2 P1 promoter utilizes two stable principal protein/DNA interaction domains associated with AP1 and HLH factors. These sites function together with dynamic and developmentally responsive sites in a major DHS region to support epigenetic control of bone-specific transcription when osteoblasts transition into a quiescent or differentiated state.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/46572363/Two_stable_genomic_proteinDNA_interactio20160617-15775-1siq8q4.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46572363/Two_stable_genomic_proteinDNA_interactio20160617-15775-1siq8q4.pdf,0,0,0

Like many phenotypic transcription factors. endogenous Runx1 localizes to distinct foci within the nucleus through a unique subnuclear targeting signal. Clinically relevant is the observation that many Runx1 translocations that are associated with acute myeloid leukemias (e.g.. AML1/ETO) retain Runx1 DNA binding activity but exhibit modified localization due to the loss of subnuclear targeting signal and transactivation domains.

74289,Abstract# 2650: AML1-ETO activates MAP kinase signaling by targeting a phosphatase via upregulation of miR-24 in myeloid progenitors,2009,Sayyed Zaidi and Andre van Wijnen and Jane Lian and Azra Raza and Janet Stein and Carlo Croce and Gary Stein,69,,9 Supplement,2650-2650,American Association for Cancer Research,Runx1/AML-1 is a runt homology domain transcription factor that is essential for definitive hematopoiesis in mice and is a frequent target of chromosomal translocations in human leukemia. The chimeric AML1-ETO protein that results from the 8;21 translocation modifies normal Runx1 function by binding and suppressing its target genes. as well as through altered subnuclear localization. While AML1-ETO interference with Runx1 function at the transcriptional level is well-documented. post-transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to leukmogenic potential of AML1-ETO remain elusive. Here. we identify micro-RNA 24 (miR-24) as a key mediator of AML1-ETO dependent transformation of myeloid progenitors. We find that samples from human patients with the 8;21 translocation. as well as 32D myeloid cells expressing a variant of Runx1 with altered subnuclear localization. exhibit increased expression of miR-24 …,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:KI9T_ytC6pkC,0,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/69/9_Supplement/2650.short,,,,,0,0,0

Histone proteins are essential for packaging newly replicated DNA during S phase and mediate epigenetic regulation by supporting recruitment of transcription factors to gene promoters. The transcription factor Histone Nuclear Factor-P (HiNF-P) is a unique multi-Zn-finger protein that we discovered as the key cell cycle regulator of histone H4 gene expression. Here. we identified target genes for HiNF-P in selected cancer cell types using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis on micro-arrays (ChIP-on-chip). Arrays (Nimblegen) were used that cover on average 2200 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream of ~25.000 human gene promoters.

Recent evidence shows that Runx2 is ectopically expressed in metastatic breast cancer cells and contributes to the metastasis of breast cancer cells by increasing expression of VEGF and MMPs. To understand the role of Runx2 during early events of mammary gland formation and/or disorganization of the acini resulting in a cancer cell phenotype. we utilized the three-dimensional culture system (20 days) of human MCF10-A normal mammary epithelial cells. These cells cultured on basement membrane (Matrigel) form polarized. growth-arrested acini-like spheroid structures that recapitulate in vitro several aspects of in vivo glandular architecture by day 7.

We carried out a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression during serum stimulation of quiescent human T98G cells. Time course analyses revealed that 4 miRNAs are up-regulated and >100 miRNAs are down-regulated when cells progress beyond the G1/S phase transition. We analyzed the function of two up-regulated miRNAs (miR-221 and miR-222) that are both predicted to target the mRNAs of the cell growth suppressive CDK inhibitors p27 and p57. We show that miR-221 and miR-222 both directly target the 3’UTRs of p27 and p57 mRNAs to reduce reporter gene expression. as well as diminish p27 and p57 protein levels.

Thus Runx2 may function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor or oncogene. Here we show that Runx2 deficient primary osteoblasts fail to undergo senescence as indicated by absence of β-galactosidase activity and p16INK4a tumor suppressor expression. Primary Runx2 null osteoblasts have a growth advantage and exhibit loss of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p19ARFexpression.

C3H10T1/2 and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (MEM)(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)(Atlanta Biologicals. Georgia). C3H10T1/2 cells were induced to osteogenesis by BMP2 (300 ng/ml). MC3T3 cells were maintained in-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Primary rat osteoblast cells were isolated from calvaria according to the procedures described previously (34). The rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8. representing a mature osteoblast phenotype. was maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS (70). Cells were cultured under osteogenic conditions with MEM (GIBCO-BRL) supplemented with 10% FBS. 50 g of ascorbic acid/ml. and 10 mM-glycerol phosphate. Bone marrow stromal cells were isolated from 8-week-old C57BL6 mice and cultured in MEM containing 10% FBS (29).Runx2 null cells were isolated from calvarial tissues of mouse embryos (17.5 days postcoitum) of the Runx2 null mouse and immortalized using mouse telomerase (TERT).

One key event is cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activation at the Restriction point late in G1. CDK2 controls both histone gene expression by the p220NPAT/HiNF-P pathway at Cajal bodies and the initiation of DNA replication through the pRB/E2F pathway. The three CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p21CIP1/WAF1. p27KIP1 and p57KIP2 attenuate CDK2 activity. Here we show that p57KIP2 selectively complexes with p220NPAT and prevents histone gene activation. This complex renders p220NPAT refractory to CDK2/cyclin E through direct substrate inhibition. Our data demonstrate that p57KIP2 specifically regulates the CDK2 responsive p220NPAT/HiNF-P pathway to control histone biosynthesis for nucleosomal assembly.,True,QZYJ4AQAAAAJ:Kqc1aDSOPooC,0,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/67/9_Supplement/5223.short,,,,,0,0,0

This SNP was significant in all three sample sets (odds ratio [OR]common 0.64. combined P [Pcomb]=7.85×10−10). A Monte Carlo simulation to address multiple testing suggests that this association is not a type I error. The coding regions of IL12B were resequenced in 96 individuals with psoriasis. and 30 additional IL12B-region SNPs were genotyped. Haplotypes were estimated. and genotype-conditioned analyses identified a second risk allele (rs6887695) located ∼60 kb upstream of the IL12B coding region that exhibited …,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1251,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707626858,12924900853914967448,/scholar?cites=12924900853914967448,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707626858,0,0,0

The synthesis. transport. and degradation of PAF are tightly regulated. and the biochemical basis for many of these processes has been elucidated in recent years. Many of the actions of PAF can be mimicked by structurally related phospholipids that are derived from nonenzymatic oxidation. because such compounds can bind to the PAF receptor. This process circumvents much of the biochemical control and presumably is regulated primarily by the rate of degradation. which is catalyzed by PAF acetylhydrolase.

A Wiley Company,Cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) is the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase. the enzyme that catalyzes the rate‐limiting step in prostaglandin synthesis from arachidonic acid. Various prostaglandins are produced in a cell type‐specific manner. and they elicit cellular functions via signaling through G‐protein coupled membrane receptors. and in some cases. through the nuclear receptor PPAR. COX‐2 utilization of arachidonic acid also perturbs the level of intracellular free arachidonic acid and subsequently affects cellular functions. In a number of cell and animal models. induction of COX‐2 has been shown to promote cell growth. inhibit apoptosis and enhance cell motility and adhesion. The mechanisms behind these multiple actions of COX‐2 are largely unknown. Compelling evidence from genetic and clinical studies indicates that COX‐2 upregulation is a key step in carcinogenesis.

Its actions are achieved at concentrations as low as IO-‘” M in some systems and almost always by lo-’M as an intercellular messenger. The molecular structure of PAF was discovered through parallel investigations of two different biological activities: a factor in the blood of rabbits undergoing anaphylaxis that activated platelets and a polar lipid from kidneys that lowered blood pressure. The fields merged when the structure of the compound responsible for both responses was shown to be 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (Fig. 1; reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). This compound has many actions in addition to activation of platelets: activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. monocytes. and macrophages. increased vascular permeability. hypotension. decreased cardiac output. stimulation of glycogenolysis in perfused liver. stimulation of uterine contraction. and others. It appears to function both in normal physiological events and to mediate pathological responses. particularly inflammation and allergy (chapter 10 in Ref. 2). Each feature of the structure of PAF is important for optimal biological activity. and the responses are stereospecific. The ether linkage at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone has a marked influence; compounds that are identical except for a fatty acid at sn-1. which are produced by a variety of cells. have less than 1% of the potency of PAF.

Moreover. it seems that the amount of COX-2 is important. since there is a correlation between its level of expression and the size of the tumors and their propensity to invade underlying tissue [40]. Inhibiting COX-2 at an early stage blocks the development of malignant tumors. causes pre-malignant tumors to regress and may improve the outcome once the cancer is completely established. This set of findings seems to link very strongly with the traditional observation that chronic inflammation is a precursor to a variety of types of cancer. By this formulation. inflammatory stimuli increase COX-2 and the downstream events that it induces promote tumor formation. All of these finding suggest that existing NSAIDs will be useful for the prophylaxis of colon cancer and polyps and we eagerly await clinical investigations that will generate guidelines that suggest those individuals that are the most appropriate recipients for such therapy.

However. the platelet-activating factor (PAF. 1 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) acetylhydrolases have the opposite role; they were discovered by investigators who focused on the inactivation of PAF (2). The phospholipid PAF has diverse physiological and pathological functions. and its inactivation was identified as an important step in regulating the overall biological function; indeed PAF acetylhydrolase has been termed a signal terminator (3). However. an immediate problem is apparent; phospholipases A2 are a common component of venoms. and their role in this context is to facilitate the spread of toxins by degrading membrane phospholipids; thus. how could there be such an active enzyme circulating in blood and present in the cytoplasm of cells? The answer came when it was shown that the PAF acetylhydrolases have marked selectivity for phospholipids with short acyl chains at the sn-2 position; with chains longer than nine carbons there was essentially no measurable activity (Fig. 2)(4. 5).

When free fatty acids are incubated with platelets. there is preferential incorporation of arachidonic acid and 8.-11.14-eicosatrienoic acid compared to other fatty acids.

However. a role for 5-LO as a modulator of atherosclerotic plaque instability has not been previously reported in humans. Thus. the aims of this study was to analyze the expression of 5-LO in human carotid plaques and to investigate the mechanism by which this enzyme could lead to plaque instability and rupture.Methods and Results— We obtained atherosclerotic plaques from 60 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. We divided the plaques into symptomatic and symptomatic according to clinical evidence of plaque instability. Clinical evidence of plaque instability was provided by the assessment of recent ischemic symptoms attributable to the stenosis and by the presence of ipsilateral cerebral lesion(s) determined by computed tomography.

Not only is it the largest organelle in eukaryotic cells. it carries most of the genome and transcription of DNA to RNA largely takes place in the nucleus. Because transcription is a major step in gene regulation. the absence of a nucleus is limiting from a biosynthetic standpoint.

DAG kinase (DGK) terminates DAG signaling by converting it to phosphatidic acid. Here. we demonstrate that DGKζ inhibits PKCα activity and that DGK activity is required for this inhibition.

Because PKCα can phosphorylate the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) motif of DGKζ. we tested whether this modification could affect their interaction. Phosphorylation of this motif significantly attenuated coimmunoprecipitation of DGKζ and PKCα and abolished their colocalization in cells. indicating that it negatively regulates binding.

Ltd,Diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important lipid second messenger. DAG signalling is terminated by conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid (PA) by diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs). The neuronal synapse is a major site of DAG production and action; however. how DGKs are targeted to subcellular sites of DAG generation is largely unknown. We report here that postsynaptic density (PSD)‐95 family proteins interact with and promote synaptic localization of DGKι. In addition. we establish that DGKι acts presynaptically. a function that contrasts with the known postsynaptic function of DGKζ. a close relative of DGKι. Deficiency of DGKι in mice does not affect dendritic spines. but leads to a small increase in presynaptic release probability. In addition. DGKι−/− synapses show a reduction in metabotropic glutamate receptor‐dependent long‐term depression (mGluR‐LTD) at neonatal (∼2 weeks) stages that involve suppression of …,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C,50,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/emboj.2010.286,3636789139481535290,/scholar?cites=3636789139481535290,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/emboj.2010.286,0,0,0

The nine mammalian diacylglycerol kinases that have been identified are widely expressed. but each isoform has a unique tissue and subcellular distribution. The activity of DGKs is regulated by mechanisms that can modify their access to diacylglycerol. affect their activity. or alter their ability to bind to other proteins.

The magnitude of this response decreased as the cells became confluent and the change coincided with a decrease in the percentage of cells in growth phases (G2+M); this was not a consequence of time in culture or a factor in the growth medium. Preconfluent cells released approximately 30% of arachidonic acid; confluent cells released only 6%. The decreasing release of arachidonic acid was demonstrated using metabolic labeling. mass measurements of arachidonic acid. and measurement of PGI2. The decrease was not due to a changing pool of arachidonic acid. and mass measurements showed no depletion of arachidonic acid.

Strategies to block inflammatory mediators such as PAF have been investigated as adjuvant therapies for sepsis. PAF-AH. the enzyme responsible for PAF degradation. showed positive results in pre-clinical studies and phase II clinical trials. but the results of a phase III study were disappointing. In this study. we investigated the potential protective mechanism of PAF-AH in sepsis using the murine model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Treatment with rPAF-AH increased peritoneal fluid levels of the anti-inflammatory mediators MCP-1/CCL2 after CLP. The numbers of bacteria (CFU) in the peritoneal cavity were decreased in the rPAF-AH-treated group. indicating more efficient bacterial clearance after rPAF-AH treatment. Interestingly. we observed increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) after PAF-AH administration. and rPAF-AH treatment did not decrease CFU numbers either in iNOS-deficient mice or in CCR2-deficient mice.

Oral (p.o.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of an aqueous crude extract from leaves of N. procerum (LAE) inhibited the writhing reaction induced by acetic acid (ED50 value=0.2 mg/kg body weight. i.p.) in a dose-dependent manner. This analgesic property was confirmed in rats using two different models of bradykinin-induced hyperalgesia; there was 75% inhibition of pain in the modified Hargreaves assay. and 100% inhibition in the classical Hargreaves assay.

74638,Perspectives series: Cell adhesion in vascular biology,1996,Guy A Zimmerman and Thomas M McIntyre and Stephen M Prescott,98,J. Clin. Invest,8,1699-1702,,Cellular interactions are critical events in vascular biology. These include adhesion and the transfer of information between endothelial cells and blood cells. in platelet aggregation and interactions between leukocytes. and in contacts between cells of the vessel wall. Specific molecular mechanisms govern these cell–cell interactions and. by doing so. regulate events in homeostatic inflammation and coagulation. orchestrate wound repair. and influence vasomotor responses. In contrast dysregulated. or unregulated. cell–cell interactions lead to pathologic syndromes: leukocytes that normally protect against invading bacteria go awry in ischemia-reperfusion disorders and acute respiratory distress syndrome. hemostasis becomes occlusive thrombosis. and atherosclerosis occurs where there should be orderly repair of a wounded vessel. Cell–cell interactions in these and other maladies are targets for therapeutic intervention. Whether such strategies can be successfully applied without unacceptably interrupting normal functions is largely unknown.The molecular mechanisms that operate in vascular cell interactions are also relevant to other important processes. including organ development. wound repair. and neoplasia and metastasis. Because the paradigms are fundamental. what has been learned in the vascular system has given useful insights into these processes. One important lesson is that adhesion between cells is required for targeting them to specific sites as well as for anchoring them in place. A second lesson is that adhesion and intercellular signaling are intimately related events (1).

Many of the most precisely-characterized signaling effects of PAF occur in the inflammatory and vascular systems. where it transmits information between endothelial cells. leukocytes. and other cell types in both physiological and pathological conditions [3-6]. In this chapter we focus on signaling of adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs; neutrophils) by PAF when it is synthesized by human endothelial cells or platelets. and on additional functional consequences of this intercellular signaling.,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC,7,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-8743-4_5,7638006557691335528,/scholar?cites=7638006557691335528,,,0,0,0

Biochem,,419-445,,Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid with potent. diverse physiological actions. particularly as a mediator of inflammation. The synthesis. trans-port. and degradation of PAF are tightly regulated. and the biochemical basis for many of these processes has been elucidated in recent years. Many of the actions of PAF can be mimicked by structurally related phospholipids that are derived from nonenzymatic oxidation. because such compounds can bind to the PAF receptor. This process cir-cumvents much of the biochemical control and presumably is regulated primarily by the rate of degradation. which is catalyzed by PAF acetylhydrolase. The isolation of cDNA clones encoding most of the key proteins involved in regulating PAF has allowed substantial recent progress and will facilitate studies to determine the structural basis for substrate specificity and the precise role of PAF in physiological events.,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14110330251746964776&hl=en&oi=scholarr,14110330251746964776,/scholar?cites=14110330251746964776,,,0,0,0

Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,6,1530,,[en] Platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-0-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine is synthesized by a variety of cells. It induces hypotension. and activates platelets. neutrophils. and macrophages at nanomolar concentrations. Removal of the acetate abolishes biological activity. and is catalyzed by a specific PAF acetylhydrolase present in plasma and tissues. The authors developed a rapid assay. based on separation of [3 H] acetate from [3 H-acetyl] PAF by reversed-phase chromatography. In human plasma the enzyme exhibits an apparent Km of 5.7 μM. with a Vmax of 0.027 μmol/h/mg. Ultracentrifugation in density gradients showed that 30% of the activity is associated with high density lipoproteins (HDL) and 70% with low density lipoproteins (LDL). The enzyme was purified from LDL by precipitation with Na phosphotungstate and MgCl 2. solubilization with Tween 20. column chromatography and electrophoresis. This procedure resulted in a preparation that was 21.000-fold purified from plasma (spec. act. 575μmol/h/mg) with a recovery of 10%. The purified enzyme has a molecular weight of about 43.000. a broad pH optimum (peak 7.5-8.0). and a pl of 4.6. It has greater activity when PAF is in a micellar. as compared to monomeric. and exhibits surface dilution kinetics. which may be important in vivo.

The majority of signaling DAG is generated by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4. 5-bisphosphate (PIP 2) by the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. binds to and activates the RasGRP nucleotide exchange factors. and recruits the chimaerins. which are Rac GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). to membrane compartments. Because DAG can modulate a plethora of signaling events. it is crucial that intracellular DAG levels be tightly regulated. Though DAG can be metabolized in various ways. under most circumstances its major route for metabolism is by its phosphorylation (Figure 1). a reaction that is catalyzed by the diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs).,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2432707717399174524&hl=en&oi=scholarr,2432707717399174524,/scholar?cites=2432707717399174524,,,0,0,0

74700,Oxygen metabolites and vascular damage,2000,Thomas M McIntyre and Gopal K Marathe and Guy A Zimmerman and Stephen M Prescott,150,Nosocomial Pneumonia,,83,CRC Press,Free radicals are atoms or molecules with an unpaired electron in the outer shell. and in complex molecules these may be centered on carbon. nitrogen. or oxygen. The definition of free radicals from a biologist's point of view is extended by defining a new category. reactive oxygen species (ROS). to include peroxides that are not radicals. However. peroxides can easily form them and play a central role in metabolism and inflammation. Thus this definition of ROS encompasses peroxides. which are radical precursors. The reason this chemistry is of interest to biologists is that the reactivity of radicals is high as they seek to pair with another atom and complete its own un-filled orbital. The free energy to be gained by this reaction means that many normally stable chemical bonds are susceptible to attack. The result is the facile addition of atoms and molecules to other molecules. or the rearrangement of the molecule that is exploited. for example. in the generation of the many leukotrienes. prostanoids. and thromboxanes that coordinate cellular actions in complex organisms. Radicals and reactive oxygen species are also used by the inflammatory cells of higher organisms to aid in the destruction of invading organisms. a mission that becomes apparent in chronic granulomatous disease where the ability of inflammatory cells to generate re-active oxygen species on demand is lost. Oxidants (in a currently undefined fashion) also regulate gene transcription through modulation of intracellular signal pathways leading to the activa-tion of the transcription factors NF-kB (1) and AP-1 (2).

For example. failure to adequately remove plasma cholesterol in the form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the bloodstream. due to mutations in the LDL receptor. leads to high concentration of plasma LDL that is sufficient to cause the disease.

The central role ofplatelets in atherosclerosis and thrombosis suggested the hypothesis that a fish-enriched diet. and particularly the fatty acids from fish. prevented cardiovascular disease by altering platelet function(I. 3). Other epidemiologic observations regarding intake of saturated vs unsaturated fatty acids also suggested this possibility. One ofthe major components of fish oils is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). and its structural homology to arachidonic acid suggested that the effects of fish oil on platelets might be due to alterations in eicosanoid metab-olism.

We will also discuss a family of compounds that are structurally related to PAF and that have similar biological activities. This family of lipids. collectively known as oxidatively fragmented phospholipids. has received interest in the last few years because their uncontrolled production can lead to toxicity. In fact. disorders in the metabolism of oxidized phospholipids may result in a variety of disease states. such as inflammation and atherosclerosis.In the second part of this chapter we discuss other factors that contribute to the onset and development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) involves oxidation of polyunsaturated phospholipids in the particles. This is of interest in the context of PAF because PAF acetylhydrolase. the enzyme that inactivates PAF. also hydrolyzes oxidatively fragmented phospholipids such as those generated during oxidation of LDL. This enzyme may influence the degree of modification of LDL by hydrolyzing these toxic oxidized phospholipids and. therefore. may play an important role in the modification of LDL and in the development of atherosclerosis.,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4070021974063297085&hl=en&oi=scholarr,4070021974063297085,/scholar?cites=4070021974063297085,,,0,0,0

74719,Factor by Cultured Human,2013,Stephen M Prescott and Guy A Zimmerman,,Platelet-Activating Factor and Related Lipid Mediators,,323,Springer Science & Business Media,Under usual physiological conditions. the vascular endothelium must present a nonthrombogenic surface to the blood to prevent diffuse thrombosis (reviewed by Gingrich and Hoak. 1979). The mechanism (s) for this characteristic of endothelial cells has not been elucidated and is the subject of intense investigation. However. there are other circumstances in which the rapid. specific attraction of blood cells to the endothelium is essential to maintain vascular integrity and to respond to extravascular events. In the first instance. damage to the endothelium must be repaired to prevent hemorrhage and exudation. Clinical observations and studies of organ per-fusion in vitro (Gimbrone et al.. 1969; Kitchens and Weiss. 1975) have provided compelling evidence that platelets are critical in maintaining vascular integrity under basal conditions. These observations suggest that platelets interact with the endothelial cells continuously in vivo.

74720,REGULATES EVENTS AT THE VASCULAR,2013,Stephen M Prescott and Thomas M McIntyre and Guy A Zimmerman,283,Eicosanoids: From Biotechnology to Therapeutic Applications,,105,Springer Science & Business Media,Leukocytes must bind to endothelium and migrate into tissues to defend us (for example. against bacterial infection)—the process of physiological inflammation (Zimmerman et al.. 1992b). On the other hand. if the activation of leukocytes occurs at the wrong time or place. then pathological changes result. For example. the activation of neutrophils within the blood stream underlies various forms of vascular injury such as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and reperfusion injury. Additionally. the accumulation of monocytes. and their conversion to macrophages. in the vascular wall is a key feature of atherosclerosis. We have studied the molecular events that regulate adhesion and activation in an in vitro model of these events.Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is the trivial name for 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine and is a potent pro-inflammatory compound (Zimmerman et al.. 1992a). It was discovered as an activator of platelets found in anaphylaxis. and now is now known to have many effects. Most cells synthesize PAF only when they are stimulated—for example in the case of endothelial cells when they are exposed to thrombin. histamine. bradykinin. or other autacoids. The structure of PAF is crucial to its function and its actions are mediated by a specific receptor. PAF is a mediator of physiological inflammation. may facilitate hemostasis. and likely contributes to several stages of events in reproduction. Further. it may participate in asthma and other allergic responses. reperfusion injury. shock (particularly in response to endotoxin). and inflammation. The threshold for the effects of PAF is usually between 10” to 10” M. and the …,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:bKqednn6t2AC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Vp_lBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA105&dq=info:I8KcP26WHTYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_TyROdx7j7&sig=iIWqA4vDqu2wmLq-7PxN8nrMcwE,,,,,0,0,0

Cell-cell interactions are critical in both physiologic and pathologic processes”. Many of the best-characterized effects of PAF involve cellular signalling in the inflammatory and vascular systems. but it also accomplishes signalling functions in the reproductive system. the brain. and in many other organs’. It has the remarkable property of being able to act as an endocrine. paracrine. autocrine. or juxtacrine signal depending on the cell of origin and the specific conditions under which it interacts with target cells’. The amphipathic proper-ties of PAF and its ability to interact with both lipids and proteins contribute to this versatility.One of the most compelling pieces of evidence that PAF plays a role in physiologic cell-cell interactions is that there is a precise system of checks and balances that governs its biologic activities”. It seems unlikely that this intricate control system would have evolved if PAF does not have specific physiologic roles.

These interactions not only target cells to specific sites but also mediate information transfer that leads to changes in their phenotypes and function (1). Platelet-platelet interactions. which will not be considered in detail in this chapter. have similar consequences. Mechanisms of inflammatory and vascular cell-cell interactions provide important insights into other physiologic processes that include embryogenesis. development. and wound repair and are also relevant to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and syndromes as diverse as neoplasia. metastasis. and fibroproliferative disorders (2). Inflammatory and vascular cell-cell interactions are mediated by adhesion ("" tethering"") and signalling molecules. establishing paradigms relevant to other biologic systems (1-4).In physiologic inflammatory responses that include immune surveillance. defense against bacteria. and wound repair. interactions of leukocytes with endothelial cells are highly regulated (1-4). These regulatory mechanisms govern the onset and duration of leukocyte accumulation. the temporal order of leukocyte subsets that emigrate into tissues. and the magnitude of leukocyte activation. This tight regulation allows the leukocytes to use their potent biochemical armamentarium in defense and repair without injuring the host. Another key feature of regulated inflammation is spatial regulation. a characteristic that is shared with physiologic platelet deposition at sites of vascular injury in hemostasis.

Specific risk factors for this disease exist. and these elucidate general mechanisms underlying this disease. For example. failure to adequately remove plasma cholesterol in the form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the bloodstream. due to mutations in the LDL receptor. leads to high concentration of plasma LDL that is sufficient to cause the disease. Other work (2) demonstrated that LDL underwent oxidative modification to generate particles that were more effective in causing pathological effects. Elevated levels of LDL promoted this pathologic change. Ross proposed a"" response-to-injury"" model of atherosclerosis (3). where damage to the vessel wall initiated the disease. A refined version of this model recognizes that the early steps in atherogenesis need not necessarily be initiated by the cytotoxicity of oxidized LDL. but rather by activation of an inflammatory response in vascular tissue. Oxidation inappropriately stimulates the normal inflammatory response of endothelial cells and leukocytes. Activation of this normally tightly regulated inflammatory response program. by factors which themselves are not well regulated.(ie oxidation of LDL by uncontrolled chemical reactions) leads to chronic. unregulated inflammation of the vascular wall. Such a chronic inflammatory process remodels the vessel wall. drives plaque formation. and destabilizes plaque structures. all key events in …",True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:XvxMoLDsR5gC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1067019969339467368&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

MA,The only known phospholipid with potent biologic activity. Platelet-activating Factor (PAF. PAF-Acether). has been identified as 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC).1 Among the diverse effects of PAF are the activation of platelets. neutrophils and monocytes. and the induction of thrombocytopenia. neutropenia. hypotension and vasopermeability in whole animals. The biologic activity of PAF depends upon the presence of a short chain acyl group at the sn-2 position. and hydrolysis of this ester destroys bioactivity. This reaction is catalyzed by a plasma component that was originally described as “acid-labile factor”2. but now has been identified as PAF-acetylhydrolase. We find that this activity is responsible for nearly all of the initial metabolism of PAF in whole blood. and have partially purified and characterized this activity.,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:6yz0xqPARnAC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-5212-9_25,,,,,0,0,0

The cells were morphologically indistinguishable. but the doubling time of cells from healing myocardium was 39.6+/-3.5 hr whereas that of normals was 24+/-3.7 (n= 5. p<. 025). Fibroblasts incorporated [3 H] arachidonate (AA) into phospholipids. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10 μM) caused release and metabolism of [3 H] AA. A23187 or AA (10μM) induced production of 6-keto PGF1α. PGE2. and a hydroxy metabolite of AA. RIA of 6-keto PGF1α showed that subconfluent cells from healing myocardium produced 1202+/-354 pg/mg protein whereas that of normals was 551+/-222 (n= 7. p<. 025). Histamine and bradykinin also induced AA metabolism but were less potent. They examined the effect of AA released from deteriorating myocytes on AA metabolism by cultured fibroblasts. They confirmed that isolated myocytes labelled with [3 H] AA released but did not metabolize [3 H] AA. In coincubations. fibroblasts incorporated myocyte-derived AA. Subsequent stimulation of the fibroblasts with A23187 induced the synthesis of 6-keto PGF1α. PGE2 and a hydroxy metabolite. The fibroblast content of healing myocardium was 35-1000 times that of normal tissue (n= 7). Thus even a moderate change in AA metabolism. amplified by the AA released from deteriorating myocytes. may be a significant physiologic or pathologic event,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:18036272,,,,,0,0,0

However. because striking variations in colorectal polyp numbers occur among patients carrying identical AAPC mutations. alÃ-elesof another gene may modify the expression of the APC disease phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that loss of function of human cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). known to modify the APC phenotype in the. 1Â»<-A~""'mouse. results in a decreased tumor burden in AAPC patients that develop very few colorectal polyps. Genomic DNA sequence analysis of human COX-2 revealed a silent mutation in exon 3 that was evenly distributed between two classes of patients with AAPC. those with small or large numbers of colorectal polyps. We also found no difference in levels of COX-2 mRNA in transformed blood lymphocytes among AAPC pa tients of either class or patients with classical APC. and no alterations that correlated with a lesser or greater number of colorectal polyps were detectable within approximately the first 1 kb of the promoter sequence. Therefore. mutation of the human COX-2 gene does not appear to be responsible for a low tumor burden among AAPC subjects.",True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1002047997512080798&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

74854,Author M,,Brian T Ragel and Randy L Jensen and David L Gillespie and Stephen M Prescott and William T Couldwell,,,,,,Background: Treatments for recurrent meningiomas are limited. We previously demonstrated universal expression of COX-2 in meningiomas and dose-dependent growth inhibition in vitro with celecoxib. a COX-2 inhibitor. We therefore tested the effects of celecoxib on meningioma growth in a mouse xenograft model.Methods: Meningioma cell lines (lOMM-Lee. CH157-MN. WHO grade I primary cultured tumor) were transplanted into flanks of nude mice fed mouse chow with celecoxib at varying concentrations (0. 500. 1000. 1500ppm) ad libitum. Tumors were measured biweekly and processed for MIB-1. Factor VIII. COX-2. and VEGF. and assayed with TUNEL.Results: Celecoxib reduced growth of mean tumor volume by 66%(P< 0.05). 25%(P> 0.05). and 65%(P< 0.05) compared with untreated controls in lOMM-Lee. CH157-MN. and benign tumors. respectively. lOMM-Lee tumors removed from celecoxib treatment regained a growth rate similar to the control. Blood vessel density decreased and apoptotic cells increased in treated flank tumors. Diminished COX-2 expression and VEGF were observed in treated lOMM-Lee tumors. Mean plasma celecoxib levels were 845. 1540. and 2869ng/mL. for low-. medium-. and high-dose celecoxib. respectively.Conclusions: Celecoxib inhibits meningioma growth in wVoat plasma levels achievable in humans. Celecoxib-treated tumors were less vascular with increased apoptosis.,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:lvd772isFD0C,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276285876.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/276285876.pdf,0,0,0
74855,Activated platelets signal chemokine synthesis by,,KL Moore and JH Morrissey and SM Prescott and GA Zimmerman,,,,,,Monocytes are able to adhere to the extracellular matrix as well as to other cells via the use of adhesion molecules. In particular. P-selectin. which is expressed by activated endothelial cells and by activated platelets. can cause monocytes to tether to these cells through the basal expression of monocyte P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL 1). It has been previously shown that purified P-selectin can induce nuclear translocation of the NF-KB transcription factor in monocytes. with secretion of NF-KB-dependent cytokines when the monocytes are further stimulated with platelet-activating factor (PAF). It has been suggested that the platelets themselves. when activated to express P-selectin. may be sufficient to activate monocytes. but it remains unknown whether binding of PSGL-1 on the monocyte to P-selectin presented on activated platelets influences nuclear signalling or chemokine generation by the leukocyte …,True,fir1_IEAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12426157902796857862&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

In the regulated dogs. the gastric pH was shifted to aroung 2. and the GI transit time was prolonged to approximate that in humans. Pranoprofen. an acidic anti-inflammatory agent. was granulated around sucrose seeds. and then coated with low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose used as a swelling agent to afford plain granules (A-granule). Then. A-granule was coated stepwise with ethyl cellulose used as an outer shell material to afford two kinds of pulsatile release granules (B-ad C-granules). In the dissolution study using pH 1.2 and 6.8 media. A-. B-and C-granules exhibited lag times of 0. 1 and 2 h. respectively. Even in intact beagle dogs. the absorption profiles for A-and B-granules corresponded with those expected from the dissolution profiles. In contrast. the bioavailability of C-granule was only 35% in the intact dogs. but was 55% in the regulated dogs. Thus. the absorption of pranoprofen from pulsatile release granules after a longer lag time should be influenced by the location in the GI tract. Next. a controlled-release (CR) dosage form of pranoprofen was tentatively prepared by combining A-. B-and C-granules at the ratio of 3: 4: 3 (w/w in contents of pranoprofen). The bioavailability of the CR dosage form was significantly diminished in the intact dogs. being about 70% as much as that in the regulated dogs.

FAST protein-deficient pteropine orthoreovirus and demonstrated that FAST protein was not essential for viral replication. but enhanced viral replication in the early phase of infection. Addition of recombinant FAST protein enhanced replication of FAST-deficient virus and other non-fusogenic viruses in a fusion-dependent and FAST-species-independent manner. In a mouse model. replication and pathogenicity of FAST-deficient virus were severely impaired relative to wild-type virus. indicating that FAST protein is a major determinant of the high pathogenicity of fusogenic reovirus.

Especially automotive weight lightening by using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastics (CFRTP). which has advantage of high-specific strength and high-specific modulus. has received much attention. A lot of pipe-shaped materials are used for a car. For CFRTP pipe molding. a low-cost and high-speed molding method is required. Using high-frequency electric resistance heating allows heating the mold surface rapidly. Rapid heating of the mold can reduce production cycle time. The electrical energy of this heating method is less than that of traditional heating methods. and therefore the reduction in production cost is expected. In molding of CFRTP. uniformity of temperature distribution is one of the important issues to be solved. In this study. temperature distribution of CFRTP pipe molding by direct resistance heating was evaluated by FEM analysis. In direct resistance heating. the temperature distribution of the mold depends on the shape of electrodes and electric frequency.

XPS measurements showed two kinds of valence states. namely Ta4 + and Ta5 + in the surface region of the film. The results from the XRD and XPS measurements suggest that the film is composed of epitaxially grown TaO2 with an amorphous Ta2O5 surface layer.

DNA viruses must successfully initiate the expression of viral genes that control subsequent viral gene expression and manipulate the host environment. Viral genes that are immediately expressed upon infection play critical roles in the early infection process. In this study. we investigated the expression and regulation of five canonical regulatory immediate-early (IE) genes of Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus: ie0. ie1. ie2. me53. and pe38. A systematic transient gene-expression analysis revealed that these IE genes are generally transactivators. suggesting the existence of a highly interactive regulatory network. A genetic analysis using gene knockout viruses demonstrated that the expression of these IE genes was tolerant to the single deletions of activator IE genes in the early stage of infection. A network graph analysis on the regulatory relationships observed in the transient expression analysis suggested that the robustness of IE gene expression is due to the organization of the IE gene regulatory network and how each IE gene is activated. However. some regulatory relationships detected by the genetic analysis were contradictory to those observed in the transient expression analysis. especially for IE0-mediated regulation. Statistical modeling. combined with genetic analysis using knockout alleles for ie0 and ie1. showed that the repressor function of ie0 was due to the interaction between ie0 and ie1. not ie0 itself.

Both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic carriers have been reported to contribute to norovirus transmission. but little is known about the magnitude of the contribution of asymptomatic carriers. We carried out a 1-year survey of residents of a district of Bangkok. Thailand to determine the percentage of norovirus transmissions originating from asymptomatic individuals. We screened 38 individuals recruited from 16 families from May 2018 to April 2019 for GI and GII genotypes. Norovirus was detected every month. and 101 of 716 stool samples (14.1%) from individuals with no symptoms of acute gastroenteritis were norovirus-positive. The average infection frequency was 2.4 times per person per year. Fourteen genotypes were identified from the positive samples. with GII.4 being detected most frequently. Notably. 89.1% of the norovirus-positive samples were provided by individuals with no diarrhea episode. Similar to cases of symptomatic infections in Thailand. asymptomatic infections were observed most frequently in December. We detected 4 cases of NV infection caused by household transmission. and 3 of the 4 transmissions originated from asymptomatic individuals. We also identified a case in which norovirus derived from an asymptomatic individual caused diarrhea in a family member. These results suggest that asymptomatic individuals play a substantial role in both the maintenance and spreading of norovirus in a community through household transmission.,True,uhyIeQUAAAAJ:txeM2kYbVNMC,2,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236502,13074408525092882647,/scholar?cites=13074408525092882647,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236502,0,0,0

Toward this end. in this study. the virucidal effect of acetic acid and vinegar. as safe foods. on SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated. Both 4% and 6% acetic acid aqueous solutions effectively inactivated the virus after 5-min incubation with a reduction over 4 log. resulting in a viral titre below the detection limit. In addition. white distilled vinegar (5% and 6% acetic acid concentrations) inactivated SARS-CoV-2 after 1-min incubation with reduction of over 4 log and a viral titre below the detection limit.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary host cell receptor that interacts with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Although pneumonia is the main symptom in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. the expression levels of ACE2 in the lung is low. suggesting the presence of another receptor for the spike protein. In order to identify the additional receptors for the spike protein. we screened a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from the lung cDNA library. We cloned L-SIGN as a specific receptor for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The RBD of the spike protein did not bind to L-SIGN. In addition. not only L-SIGN but also DC-SIGN. a closely related C-type lectin receptor to L-SIGN. bound to the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly. cells expressing L-SIGN and DC-SIGN were both infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore. L-SIGN and DC-SIGN induced membrane fusion by associating with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Serum antibodies from infected patients and a patient-derived monoclonal antibody against NTD inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of L-SIGN or DC-SIGN expressing cells.

While the development of specific treatments and a vaccine is urgently needed. functional analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have been limited by the lack of convenient mutagenesis methods. In this study. we established a PCR-based. bacterium-free method to generate SARS-CoV-2 infectious clones. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 could be rescued at high titer with high accuracy after assembling 10 SARS-CoV-2 cDNA fragments by circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) and transfection of the resulting circular genome into susceptible cells. Notably. the construction of infectious clones for reporter viruses and mutant viruses could be completed in two simple steps: introduction of reporter genes or mutations into the desirable DNA fragments (~5.000 base pairs) by PCR and assembly of the DNA fragments by CPER.

Here. the infectivity of baculoviruses under the physiological stresses of ‘freeze–thaw’ and sonication and the baculoviral contamination of recombinant proteins after protein purification were evaluated. Our findings suggest that Nonidet P‐40 (NP‐40) treatment of baculoviruses completely abolishes their infectivity and that recombinant proteins purified with affinity beads do not include infectious baculoviruses.

Here. we established transgenic mice expressing NS5A protein in the liver and examined innate immune responses against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo. Intrahepatic gene expression levels of cytokines such as interleukin-6. tumor necrosis factor-α. and interferon-γ were significantly suppressed after LPS injection in the transgenic mouse liver. Induction of the C-C motif chemokine ligand 2. 4. and 5 was also suppressed. Phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. which is activated by cytokines. was also reduced. and expression levels of interferon-stimulated genes. 2’-5’ oligoadenylate synthase. interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase. and myxovirus resistance 1 were similarly suppressed. Since LPS binds to toll-like receptor 4 and stimulates the downstream pathway leading to induction of these genes. we examined the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and IκB-α. The phosphorylation levels of these molecules were reduced in transgenic mouse liver. indicating that the pathway upstream of the molecules was disrupted by NS5A. Further analyses revealed that the interaction between interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-6 was dispersed in transgenic mice. suggesting that NS5A may interfere with this interaction via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88. which was shown to interact with NS5A.

Plasmid DNA vaccines are one of the most remarkable vaccines that can be developed in a short term. pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co. which is a plasmid DNA vaccine. was designed to express severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The produced antibodies lead to Immunoreactions against S protein. anti-receptor-binding-domain. and neutralizing action of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co. as confirmed in a previous study. To promote the efficacy of the pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine. a pyro-drive jet injector (PJI) was employed. PJI is an injection device that can adjust the injection pressure depending on various target tissues. Intradermally-adjusted PJI demonstrated that pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co vaccine injection caused a strong production of anti-S protein antibodies. triggered immunoreactions and neutralizing actions against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover. a high dose of pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI did not cause any serious disorders in the rat model. Finally. virus infection challenge in mice. confirmed that intradermally immunized (via PJI) mice were potently protected from COVID-19 infection. Thus. pVAX1-SARS-CoV2-co intradermal injection via PJI is a safe and promising vaccination method to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.,True,uhyIeQUAAAAJ:lK9BDNCuzFgC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.13.426436v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/14/2021.01.13.426436.full.pdf,0,0,0

We examined the effect of HCV infection on HOX gene expression. In this study. HCV infection induced more than half of the HOX genes and reduced the level of histone H2A monoubiquitination on lysine (K) 119 (H2Aub). which represses HOX gene promoter activity. HCV infection also promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of RNF2. which is an E3 ligase mediating H2A monoubiquitination as a component of polycomb repressive complex 1.

Although antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been shown prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here. we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients. and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) dramatically enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2. and thus increased SARS-CoV2 infectivity. Surprisingly. mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the surface of the NTD. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected in all samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study. However. the ratio of infectivity-enhancing antibodies to neutralizing antibodies differed among patients. Furthermore. the antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site were detected in 3 out of 48 uninfected donors. albeit at low levels. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development. especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies.,True,uhyIeQUAAAAJ:MDX3w3dAD3YC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.423358v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/12/18/2020.12.18.423358.full.pdf,0,0,0

Recently. it has been reported that interaction of miR-122 to HCV RNA induces a conformational change of the 5′ UTR internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure to form stem-loop II structure (SLII) and hijack of translating 80S ribosome through the binding of SLIII to 40S subunit. which leads to efficient translation. On the other hand. low levels of HCV-RNA replication have also been detected in some non-hepatic cells; however. the details of extrahepatic replication remain unknown. These observations suggest the possibility that miRNAs other than miR-122 can support efficient replication of HCV-RNA in non-hepatic cells. Here. we identified a number of such miRNAs and show that they could be divided into two groups: those that bind HCV-RNA at two locations (miR-122 binding sites I and II). in a manner similar to miR-122 (miR-122-like). and those that target a single site that bridges sites I and II and masking both G28 and C29 in the 5′ UTR (non-miR-122-like). Although the enhancing activity of these non-hepatic miRNAs were lower than those of miR-122. substantial expression was detected in various normal tissues. Furthermore. structural modeling indicated that both miR-122-like and non-miR-122-like miRNAs not only can facilitate the formation of an HCV IRES SLII but also can stabilize IRES 3D structure in order to facilitate binding of SLIII to the ribosome. Together. these results suggest that HCV facilitates miR-122-independent replication in non-hepatic cells through recruitment of miRNAs other than miR-122.

Here we studied the effects of knocking them down on HBV replication in HepAD38. Our results showed that St6gal1 knockdown (KD) reduced intracellular HBV rcDNA level by 90%. that Mgat2 KD did not change the intracellular HBV rcDNA level. and that Mgat4 KD increased the intracellular HBV rcDNA level by 19 times compared to Tet(−). The changes in intracellular rcDNA level were followed by the alteration of Pol and HBc expression.

75334,Role of Lipid Microdomains in Influenza Virus Multiplication,2008,Makoto Takeda,,,,43-61,,Lipid bilayers of biological membranes have often been considered as two-dimensional solvents of integral membrane proteins. and membrane lipids have been thought to have minor functions for membrane phenomena (fluid-mosaic model). A current concept of lipid rafts refined this classical model. proposing that membrane lipids play key roles for regulation of membrane functions — such as membrane trafficking and signal transduction — by forming functional lipid microdomains termed rafts where specific membrane proteins and lipids become incorporated. Viruses are obligate parasites of living organisms and their replication is absolutely dependent on the host cell machinery. Many viruses have been shown to use membrane rafts during one or more steps of their replication cycles. Influenza virus represents a well-studied example for the interactions of viruses and rafts.

HCV subgenomic RNA was removed from the replicon cell line 9-13 (16) by treatment with alpha interferon. A cell line that was highly permissive for JFH-1 infection was cloned from the resulting crude populations by the limited-dilution method and designated Huh7OK1 (32). The Huh7OK1 cell line retained the ability to produce type I interferons through the RIG-I-dependent signaling pathway upon infection with RNA viruses and exhibited a cell surface expression level of human CD81 comparable to that of the parental cell line. The detailed characteristics of this cell line will be described in a future communication. The HuhOK1 and Huh7. 5.1 cell lines (the latter was kindly provided by F. Chisari) and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids (Sigma. St. Louis.

The plasmid carrying strain JFH-1 cDNA under the control of the polI promoter (19) was transfected into Huh7OK1 or Huh7. 5.1 cells. and propagation of the JFH-1 virus was determined by the production of HCV core protein (as described below) and by the titration of infectious particles (39). The persistently infected Huh7OK1 cells were maintained under normal conditions after 8 passages before use.

However. precise mechanisms including an infection of HCV to target cells or a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma are largely unknown. Study of HCV has been hampered by the lack of a robust and reliable cell culture system and a small animal model that supports replication of HCV. Understanding the mechanisms of HCV infection is essential for the development of new effective therapies for chronic hepatitis C. HCV presumably binds to specific receptor(s) and then enters into cells by endocytosis. as do other members of the Flaviviridae family and several host membrane proteins have been identified as receptor candidates for HCV.

The reaction proved to be quite general as alkyl-and aryl-substituted terminal and internal alkynes are efficiently transformed into syn-hydrophosphinated products. Functionalities such as alcohols and esters are tolerated under the reaction conditions. Moreover. the effectiveness of this methodology was further demonstrated by efficiently transforming activated alkenes into b-phosphinopropionic acid derivatives.Comment: The reaction mechanism first invokes a coordination of the silylphosphine to the cationic Rh (I) followed by oxidative addition to yield a Rh (III) intermediate. Coordination of the alkyne occurs before insertion into the Rh–P bond to give the alkenylrhodium species 1.

Although a strong humoral response is detectable within a few weeks of primary infection and during viral persistence. the role played by antibodies against HCV envelope glycoproteins in controlling viral replication is still unclear. We describe how human monoclonal anti-HCV E2 antibody fragments isolated from a chronically HCV-infected patient differ sharply in their abilities to neutralize infection of HepG2 cells by a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype bearing HCV envelope glycoproteins. Two clones were able to neutralize the pseudotype virus at a concentration of 10 mug/ml. while three other clones completely lacked this activity. These data can explain the lack of protection and the possibility of reinfection that occur even in the presence of a strong antiviral antibody response.

In contrast. the wild-type MV strains isolated in a marmoset B-cell line B95a (the KA and Ichinose strains) replicated and produced CPE in some but not all of the primate lymphoid cell lines. To determine the mechanism underlying this difference in cell tropism. we used a recently developed recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) containing as a reporter the green fluorescent protein gene in lieu of the VSV G protein gene (VSVDELTAG?). MV glycoproteins were efficiently incorporated into VSVDELTAG?. producing the VSV pseudotypes. VSVDELTAG? complemented with VSV G protein efficiently infected all of the cell lines tested.

We previously cloned a cDNA encoding a novel rat PL. PL-I mosaic (PL-Im). which is specifically expressed at mid-pregnancy. In this study. the biological activity of PL-Im was evaluated by producing the recombinant protein (recPL-Im) by means of a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. RecPL-Im demonstrated binding activity for PRL receptor in a radioreceptor assay (RRA) system with rat liver membrane fraction and 125I-ovine PRL (oPRL). In addition. the activity of recPL-Im is comparable to oPRL in the Nb2 cell proliferation assay. Interestingly. recPLIm stimulated progesterone secretion in a concentration-dependent manner in a primary culture of luteal cells from pregnant rat. whereas oPRL had no effect on luteal cells. The luteotropic function of recPL-Im was accompanied by suppression of the secretion of 20α-dihydroprogesterone (20α-OHP) in the culture. PL-Im therefore has ability to bind PRL-receptor and express PRL-like activity. In addition. recPL-Im has luteotropic hormone (LTH) activity and its activity is qualitatively different from that of PRL.,True,uhyIeQUAAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/45/1/45_1_43/_article/-char/ja/,,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jrd/45/1/45_1_43/_pdf,0,0,0

Frabin has one actin filament-binding domain (ABD). one Dbl homology domain (DHD). first pleckstrin homology domains (PHD) adjacent to DHD. one cysteine rich-domain (CRD). and second PHD from the N terminus to the C terminus in this order. Full-length frabin induces microspike formation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. We found here that the fragment of frabin containing DHD and first PHD stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange of Cdc42Hs small G protein. but not that of RhoA or Rac1 small G protein. However. this fragment of frabin did not induce microspike formation. and ABD was additionally necessary for microspike formation.

The acceleration of train vibration was large in the high frequency region which is in the dominant frequency domain. and small in the low frequency region which affects the displacement of soil locking wall. The maximum acceleration was damped and decreased with separating from the railway. The effect on the adjacent soil locking wall was examined by the point excitation of acceleration waveform during running of the train around railway using the equivalent linear programming method (FLUSH). The maximum horizontal displacements at the end of sheet piles and immediately under the roadbed of railway during the vertical excitation were 0.1 mm and 0.0 mm. respectively. which were lower than those from the static analysis. The displacement of the soil locking wall due to running train was measured during the primary digging before the insertion of single strut. The displacement was almost constant in 0.25 to 0.75 mm independent of the speed of train. When the displacement was determined through the elasto-plastic method by assuming the train load as a static uniform load. the displacement showed a large value. When the displacement was determined through the elasto-plastic method. it was significant to introduce the displacement characteristics by considering the strain dependency. 6 refs.. 8 figs.. 2 tabs.,True,uhyIeQUAAAAJ:cBPnxVikjH8C,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/437963,,,,,0,0,0

This study aimed to compare the risk factors for HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an HIV epidemic area of Thailand where HIV is mainly transmitted heterosexually. Design and subjects-Sera from 3053 blood donors were collected and tested for HCV and HIV between January and March 1994. Altogether 1756 (57-5%) ofthe donors were interviewed about demographics and sev-eral risk factors.Results-The prevalence rates of HIV and HCV infections determined by antibody assays were 2-3% and 2-2%. respectively. Sexual risk factors were clearly shown among anti-HIV positive donors. These clear associations were not found. however. among anti-HCV positive donors. In contrast. previous histories of injecting drug use and being tattooed were found in some anti-HCV positive donors but less frequently in anti-HIV positive donors.

75426,Identification of Basal Promoter and,,Mami Matsuda and Tiang-Cheng Li and Yoshiharu Matsuura and Tetsuro Suzuki and Ryosuke Suzuki and Jin Li and Minako Hijikata,,,,,,The regulation of TT virus (TTV) gene expression was characterized. Transient-transfection assays using reporter constructs revealed that a 113-nucleotide (nt) sequence within the untranslated region. proximal to the transcription initiation site and containing a TATA box motif. has a basal promoter activity. This sequence is well conserved among different TTV genotypes. Upstream stimulating factor bound to a consensus binding motif within this region and positively regulates TTV transcription. Furthermore. a 488-nt region upstream of the basal promoter exhibited enhancer activity. presumably in a cell type-specific manner. This study illustrates some of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of TTV.TT virus (TTV). which was discovered in a patient with acute hepatitis. is an unenveloped. single-stranded. circular DNA virus. with a genome of approximately 3.8 kb (6). TTV is thought to be a new member of the Circoviridae family of viruses. and it was recently proposed that the virus be named Torque Teno virus (6). The TTV genome includes an untranslated region (UTR) of approximately 1.2 kb and a coding region of approximately 2.6 kb. including two major open reading frames which are sandwiched by the TATA box and polyadenylation signal motifs (11. 13. 15). Analyses of TTV transcripts have revealed three spliced mRNA species of 3.0. 1.2. and 1.0 kb with common 5 and 3 termini (9. 14).

75427,Diverging Effects of Human Recombinant,,Massimo Clementi and Hideki Tani and Tatsuo Miyamura and Pietro E Varaldo and Roberto Burioni and Yoshiharu Matsuura and Nicasio Mancini,,,,,,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major causative agent of blood-borne non-A. non-B hepatitis. Although a strong humoral response is detectable within a few weeks of primary infection and during viral persistence. the role played by antibodies against HCV envelope glycoproteins in controlling viral replication is still unclear. We describe how human monoclonal anti-HCV E2 antibody fragments isolated from a chronically HCV-infected patient differ sharply in their abilities to neutralize infection of HepG2 cells by a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype bearing HCV envelope glycoproteins. Two clones were able to neutralize the pseudotype virus at a concentration of 10 g/ml. while three other clones completely lacked this activity. These data can explain the lack of protection and the possibility of reinfection that occur even in the presence of a strong antiviral antibody response.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major causative agent of blood-borne non-A. non-B hepatitis (10). infecting more than 200 million people worldwide (3). The tendency of HCV infection toward chronicity (8). with persistent viral replication (3). suggests that the host immune response is unable to tackle and eradicate the infection in the majority of cases. The role of the humoral response against viral envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) in the control of viral replication is still unclear (8). The study and demonstration of neutralizing antibodies have been hampered by the lack of a robust neutralization system. by the paucity of animal models. and by the differences between human and animal antibody responses to HCV antigens (1. 4).

75429,Network based analysis of Hepatitis C Virus infection,,Lokesh Pati Tripathi and Kohji Moriishi and Yoshio Mori and Yoshiharu Matsuura and Yi-An Chen and Kenji Mizuguchi,,,,,,Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in humans infecting about 170 million individuals worldwide. Therefore. there is much interest to understand the biology of HCV infection and develop effective remedies. While. studies have provided some insights into HCV infection such as a critical role for the interactions between the viral component (HCV core protein) and a host regulator PA28γ [1]. a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in HCV infection remains elusive. The increasing availability of Protein-protein interaction (PPI) data for different organisms including humans and host-pathogen associations has facilitated the development of network-based models of human diseases. Construction and analysis of such ‘infection networks’ permits a global overview of pathogenesis with the potential to identify novel regulators of cellular infection [2]. To investigate HCV pathogenesis and replication. different biological datatypes were employed for construction of extended ‘infection networks’ and examined for specific functional associations and their significance to HCV pathogenesis.,True,uhyIeQUAAAAJ:FiytvqdAVhgC,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.800.296&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.800.296&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
