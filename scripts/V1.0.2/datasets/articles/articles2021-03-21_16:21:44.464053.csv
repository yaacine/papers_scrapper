1207488,At home. in public. and in between: gender differences in public. private and transportation pro-environmental behaviors in the US Intermountain West,2019,Michael D Briscoe and Jennifer E Givens and Shawn Olson Hazboun and Richard S Krannich,5,Environmental Sociology,4,374-392,Routledge,Research in environmental sociology finds differences between men and women in the performance of pro-environmental behaviors. but gender effects change over time. and vary by location and type of pro-environmental behavior. Thus. research needs to explore gender differences in various pro-environmental behaviors across different contexts. in order to contribute to better understanding of the connections between sustainability and gender equity. This paper analyzes the gendered differences in pro-environmental behaviors in the Intermountain West region of the United States using survey data collected in 2016 from five states: Colorado. Idaho. Montana. Utah. and Wyoming. Results of ordinary least squares and ordered logistic regression analyses indicate women are more likely than men to engage in pro-environmental behaviors in the private sphere.

This study is part of a larger effort exploring “Innovations in the Food-Energy-Water Nexus (INFEWS)” in the Columbia River Basin (CRB) through coordinated modeling and simulated management scenarios. Here. we focus on a case study and conceptual mapping of the Yakima River Basin (YRB). a sub-basin of the CRB. Previous research on FEW system management and resilience includes some attention to social dynamics (e.g.. economic and governance systems); however. more attention to social drivers and outcomes is needed. Our goals are to identify several underutilized ways to incorporate social science perspectives into FEW nexus research and to explore how this interdisciplinary endeavor alters how we assess innovations and resilience in FEW systems. First. we investigate insights on FEW nexus resilience from the social sciences. Next. we delineate strategies for further incorporation of social considerations into FEW nexus research. including the use of social science perspectives and frameworks such as socio-ecological resilience and community capitals. Then. we examine a case study of the YRB. focusing on the historical development of the FEW nexus and innovations. We find that a resilience focus applied to the FEW nexus can inadvertently emphasize a status quo imposed by those already in power.

However. the environment – and especially climate change – is hyper-polarized amongst the American public. and non-environmental justifications for renewable energy may resonate more broadly. Using a 2016 mail survey of individuals living in five states in the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S.. we examine predictors of public approval of renewable energy usage. approval of a 20% renewable portfolio standard policy. and agreement with seven frames for renewable energy. of which four referenced the environment and three did not.

Prior research finds political-economic factors shape climate change views. perceptions of and policy support for renewable and nonrenewable energy. and pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs). This study contributes to research in these three areas by empirically testing the anti-reflexivity thesis. which posits that forces defending the industrial capitalist system are sources of anti-reflexivity. obstructing critical self-evaluation and societal action to address climate change. Using OLS and logistic regression analysis of survey data from respondents in five states in the US Intermountain West region. we find empirical support for the effect of anti-reflexivity on climate views. energy policy support. and PEBs.

1207492,The Separation of Church and Mate: How Does Church Attendance Impact Marital Satisfaction and Why,2015,Michael Briscoe,14,Undergraduate Research Journal for the Human Sciences,1,,Kappa Omicron Nu,This study seeks to assess the relationship between church attendance and marital satisfaction. This study uses the 2000 wave of the General Social Survey. It was hypothesized by the author that more frequent church attendance would increase levels of marital satisfaction in respondents. This hypothesis can be explained by the theory of symbolic interactionism. the idea that individuals assign different meanings and symbols to different parts of their life and then act according to those beliefs. It is theorized that people who attend church more frequently view marriage with more symbolism and meaning than those who do not. and therefore those who attend church frequently put forth more effort to maintain that commitment. The data showed that there was a highly statistically significant relationship between church attendance and marital satisfaction. and that the more frequently an individual attends church. the more satisfied they will be with their marriage. However. although this relationship was shown to be highly statistically significant. the amount of influence church attendance has on marital satisfaction is minimal. The results of this study show that further research may need to be conducted. particularly between different religions and religious denominations. and the effect that each of these individually may have on marital satisfaction.,True,3i8Y0YQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,https://kon.org/urc/v14/briscoe.html,6638232895006411455,/scholar?cites=6638232895006411455,,https://kon.org/urc/v14/briscoe.html,0,0,0
1207493,Intersectional Indicators: A Race and Sex-Specific Analysis of the Carbon Intensity of Well-Being in the United States. 1998–2009,2021,Michael D Briscoe and Jennifer E Givens and Madeleine Alder,,Social Indicators Research,,1-20,Springer Netherlands,There is an ongoing need for indicators that balance social and environmental sustainability outcomes. The carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB) is a sustainability indicator that captures environmental impact and social well-being in a single measure. One of the benefits of this measure is that it can be applied across different scales and contexts to explore factors that might reduce the CIWB. leading to greater sustainability. We demonstrate the further utility of the indicator by analyzing CIWB in the United States at the state-level and take an intersectional approach. calculating CIWB by race and gender. We find income inequality contributes to larger CIWB for all groups. but the impacts are greater for blacks compared to whites and males compared to females. Economic growth is also associated with larger CIWB for all groups. These results suggest that to achieve more sustainable outcomes may require policies …,True,3i8Y0YQAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-021-02613-x,,,,,0,0,0

We present results from three Q-methodology workshops held in Melbourne (Australia). Norwich (UK) and Boulder (USA) investigating engagement with climate change imagery drawn from mass media sources. Participants were provided with a concourse of climate change images drawn from a newspaper content analysis carried out across all three countries. and asked to carry out two Q-sorts: first. for salience (‘this image makes me feel climate change is important’) and second. for efficacy (‘this image makes me feel I can do something about climate change’). We found results remarkably consistent both across and within country cohorts. This may indicate the presence of a dominant. mainstream discourse around climate imagery.

This is a question we are frequently asked by planners. policy makers and other professionals charged with the task of developing and implementing adaptation strategies. While adaptation is increasingly recognized as an important climate risk management strategy. and on-the-ground adaptation planning activity is becoming more common-place. there is no clear guidance as to what success would look like. what to aim for and how to judge progress. This edited volume makes significant progress toward unpacking the question of successful adaptation. offering both scientifically informed and practice-relevant answers from various sectors and regions of the world. It brings together 18 chapters from leading experts within the field to present careful analyses of different cases and situations. questioning throughout commonly avowed truisms and unspoken assumptions that have pervaded climate adaptation science and practice to date. This book offers not one answer but demonstrates how the question of success in important ways is normative and context specific. It identifies the various dimensions of success. such as economic. political. institutional. ecological. and social. explores the tensions between them. and compiles encouraging evidence that resolutions can be found. The book appraises how climatic and non-climatic stressors play a role. what role science does and can play in adaptation decision making. and how trade-offs and other concerns and priorities shape adaptation planning and implementation on the ground.

Recent years have seen significant reductions in journalistic ecosystem services. Examples abound: CNN slashed their entire science. technology. and environment reporting unit; the Seattle Post-Intelligencer discontinued their print run; the Los Angeles Times had cut their newsroom staff in half in the last dozen years; the Rocky Mountain News shuttered their doors altogether. It has been estimated that approximately 25% of the news industry’s workforce has been cut since 2001 (Pew 2009; Boykoff 2009). Concurrently. the number of newspapers that featured weekly science sections atrophied. losing nearly two-thirds in the past two decades (Pew 2009; Carroll 2006). In many places in the Global South. journalists continue to lack the capacity and training to cover the intricacies of climate science and policy. as well as lack access to clear. timely and understandable climate-related resources and images (Harbison 2006; Shanahan 2009). Journalists. editors. and organizations surviving newsroom cuts and shortfalls have been left to cover the contours of climate change along tighter deadlines. and with increased multi-platform demands (video. audio and text along with blogs.

In particular. we explore how the stabilization-based discourse has become dominant through developments in climate science. environmental economics and policymaking. That this discourse is tethered to contemporary policy proposals is unsurprising; but that it has remained relatively free of critical scrutiny can be associated with fears of unsettling often-tenuous political processes taking place at multiple scales.

Climate change is a high-stakes. high-profile and highly politicized issue that relates—often in messy. non-linear and diffuse ways—to people’s everyday lives. lifestyles and livelihoods. It is no longer thought of merely as scientific issue; rather. the ‘climate question’is considered one that now. more than ever. permeates our individual. as well as shared. economic. political. cultural and social lives. Through a brief accounting of these interactions. we explore some interesting and notable spaces comprising what we see as the emerging cultural politics of climate change at the scale of the everyday discourses. representations and ‘popular’cultures that work to engage society. By cultural politics we mean those oft-contested and politicized processes by which meaning is constructed and negotiated across space. place and at various scales. This involves not only the representations and messages that gain traction in discourses. but also those that are absent from them or silenced (Derrida 1978; Dalby 2007). In these spaces. discourses are tethered to positionalities. material realities and social practices (Hall 1997).

Malone and Klein (2007. p26) go some way to showing a potential shape of this democracy. in their web-based forum thought experiment the ‘Climate Collaboratorium’. describing it as ‘a kind of Wikipedia for controversial topics. a Sims game for the future of the planet. and an electronic democracy on steroids’. Yet others have called for a more critical reading of the use of new media in facilitating democracy (Sunstein. 2007). with Dietz and Stern (2008) stating that there is still some way to go in understanding the dynamics of new media engagement.

Most climate forecast communications assume people process information analytically. Yet people also rely heavily on an experiential processing system. Better understanding of experiential processing may lead to more comprehensible risk communication products.

But as it has done so. its focus has become increasingly narrow and'movement-centric'. When combined with the tendency to select successful struggles for study. the conceptual and methodological conventions of the field conduce to a decidedly Ptolemaic view of social movements: one that exaggerates the frequency and causal significance of movements as a form of politics. This book reports the results of a comparative study. not of movements. but of communities earmarked for environmentally risky energy projects. In stark contrast to the central thrust of the social movement literature. the authors find that the overall level of emergent opposition to the projects has been very low. and they seek to explain that variation and the impact. if any. it had on the ultimate fate of the proposed projects.,True,MHv76OkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,407,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=272258888156498647&hl=en&oi=scholarr,272258888156498647,/scholar?cites=272258888156498647,,,0,0,0

LNG proposals have drawn attention–and sparked protest–from local citizens.The siting of an LNG terminal presents many issues around which a community can mobilize. As a result. attempts to site these facilities create an ideal laboratory for better understanding the factors and processes that drive variations in community mobilization efforts in the context of LULUs.

Although a large fraction of the total energy consumed by the Ngisonyoka of Kenya followed a single pathway from plant to animal to human. they also harvested solar energy from a relatively diverse assemblage of energy flow channels. Energy utilization and conversion efficiencies were generally low. as the system is maintenance-rather than production-oriented. Energy flow to maintenance must be relatively high to support biotic responses that enable tolerance of abiotic variability and to stabilize energy flow under the stress of severe droughts.

Cattle dynamics were quantified using herd histories from interviews of 56 households living in 4 sites. Data were aggregated to portray regional cattle population trends and quantify economic losses. Regression analysis was employed to assess associations of rainfall variation and stocking rate with cattle dynamics using 2 approaches:(1) Regional using aggregate herd data. empirical rainfall records. and calculated estimates for stocking rates; and (2) local using site-specific herd data along with recall of rainfall and stocking rate dynamics. Overall. results confirmed that cattle numbers followed a boom and bust cycle. Average cattle holdings dropped front 92 to 58 head/household between 1980 and 1997. respectively.

Mechanical tests on eight hybrid beams were performed with two types of LC and two types of FRP/LC interface: unbonded (only mechanical interlocking of LC between T-upstands) and bonded with an epoxy adhesive. The ultimate loads of the beams increased by 104% on average due to bonding. However. the beam failure mode changed from ductile to brittle. The beams using a LC of 44% higher density exhibited an 81% increase in the ultimate load. The manufacturing of the beams proved to be economic in that epoxy and concrete layers were rapidly and easily …,True,ToTntRcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,148,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359835X06002314,8702086732725523079,/scholar?cites=8702086732725523079,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359835X06002314,0,0,0

Part I: stress–strain analysis and failure modes,2005,Thomas Keller and Till Vallée,36,Composites Part B: Engineering,4,331-340,Elsevier,Quasi-static axial tension experiments were performed in a laboratory environment on epoxy bonded. balanced double-lap and single-lap joints from pultruded GFRP flat sections. Full-scale specimens were used to avoid size effects. Parameters investigated were the overlap length (from 50 to 200 mm). the adhesive layer thickness (from 1 to 3 mm) and the adherend thickness (from 3 to 12 mm). On nine of the double lap joints 40 strain gages were installed to measure the axial strain profiles along the overlaps. The measured axial strain profiles in the joints correlated well with numerical results obtained from a 2D finite element analysis. Failure initiation and progression were observed with a high-speed camera.

The prediction method is based on the experimentally determined material strength of joint materials and its statistical distribution. It takes into consideration the scale sensitivity of the strength. which is modelled using Weibull statistics. and considers not only the magnitude of the stress fields. but also the volume over which stress peaks act. The method therefore presents a mechanical explanation for the increased resistance of local material zones against high strain or stress peaks. which would normally cause failure of bulk material.

It was found that the joint strength (i) decreases with the adhesive layer thickness. (ii) is almost independent of the fillet radius and (iii) increases with overlap length.

Experimental and numerical investigations were carried out on adhesively bonded full-scale double-lap joints composed of timber adherends (spruce) and adhesive layers. The influence of different geometric parameters and adhesives on the joint strength was studied. The investigated geometric parameters were the thickness of the adhesive layer (0.5–2.0 mm). the overlap length (40–280 mm). and the ductility of the adhesive (using three different adhesives). It was found that the joint strength was independent of the adhesive layer thickness (for the thickness range investigated) that the joint strength increased with the overlap length up to an apparent maximum of approximately 200 mm and that strength was almost independent of the adhesive stiffness …,True,ToTntRcAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,24,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00226-011-0423-1.pdf,7699398634733561149,/scholar?cites=7699398634733561149,,,0,0,0

The sandwich construction consists of three layers: a fiber-reinforced polymer composite (FRP) sheet with T-upstands for the bottom skin. lightweight concrete (LC) for the core and a thin layer of ultra high performance reinforced concrete as a top skin. Specimens with adhesively bonded FRP–LC interfaces showed significantly higher ultimate loads than corresponding unbonded specimens with composite action due to pure mechanical interlocking. The degree of composite action between FRP and LC in the unbonded interfaces depended on the LC compressive strength. A correlation of the specimen ultimate loads and the LC splitting tensile strengths was found. Combining the LC splitting tensile strength and the LC characteristic length led to a good correlation with the specimen cracking loads.,True,ToTntRcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,22,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359835X07002825,12551888226616818880,/scholar?cites=12551888226616818880,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359835X07002825,0,0,0

In the paper the finite-volume numerical tool for calculations of the non-isothermal laminar steady-state flow. with chemical reactions in laminar gas flow as well as within porous media is presented. For the porous regions the momentum and energy equations have appropriate corrections. In the momentum equations for the porous region an additional pressure drop has to be considered. which depends on the properties of the porous medium. For the heat transfer within the porous matrix description a heterogeneous model is considered. It treats the solid and gas phase separately. but the phases are coupled via a convective heat exchange term. For the modeling of the reaction of the methane laminar combustion the chemical reaction scheme with 164 reactions and 20 chemical species was used.

For the most part such areas are under special care of the state (i. e. underdeveloped. devastated by war. depopulated). on islands or in mountainous regions. Since the decentralized energy generation covers a broad range of technologies. including many renewable energy technologies that provide small-scale power at sites close to the users. such concept could be of interest for these locations. This paper identifies the areas in Western Balkans where such systems could be applied. Consideration is given to geographical locations as well as possible applications. Wind. hydro. solar photovoltaic. and biomass conversion systems were taken into consideration. Since the renewable energy sources data for Western Balkans region are rather scarce. the intention was to give a survey of the present situation and an estimate of future potential for decentralized energy generation based on renewable energy sources. The decentralized energy generation based on renewable energy sources in Western Balkans will find its niche easier for the users that will produce electricity for their own needs and for the users located in remote rural areas (off-grid applications).,True,uyZhes0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,29,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0354-98360703007S,10120647669052924927,/scholar?cites=10120647669052924927,,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0354-98360703007S,0,0,0

Proper regulation of coal distribution is deemed essential for achieving an adequate pulverized coal concentration in the zone where thermal plasma is being introduced The said can be efficiently achieved by installation of stationary louver in the coal-air mixing duct ahead of the feed ducts of a burner. The paper addresses numerical simulation of a two-phase flow of air-pulverized coal mixture in the mixing ducts. analysing the effects of particle size distribution on pulverized coal distribution to the burner feed ducts. Numerical simulation was performed rising the FLUENT 63 commercial code and related poly-dispersed flow module. based on the PSI-CELL approach. Numerical experiments have been performed assuming a mono-dispersed solid phase with particle diameter ranging from 45 mu m to 1200 mu m. Distance between the louver blades and the resulting effect on the flow profile was analysed as well. Results obtained indicate that the size of coal particles considerably influence the overall solid phase distribution. While fine particles. with diameters at the louver end of the above specified range. almost fully follow the streamlines of the continuous phase. coarser particles. which hit the louver blades. deflect towards the thermal plasma zone.

Four test conditions were selected to elucidate the short-term effect of the exposure of the composites to an acidic environment which was achieved by simulating an acidic condition of Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) solution with a pH of 2.2 at room temperature (27°C). Exposure periods of 3. 6 and 9 days (3PA. 6PA. 9PA) were considered. while samples not exposed to the acid solution were used as control (NP). In order to measure the possible surface degradation and hardness variation of the CCHPRC due to immersion in the acid solution. scanning electron microscopy in addition to energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). and hardness tests were carried out. As a result. the gradual material degradation and poor adhesion between reinforcement and matrix was observed which was confirmed by SEM/EDS analysis. Prolonged acid immersion time seemed to promote an increase in terms of the composites’ hardness. It is possible to conclude that the hardness characteristics of the composite (NP- 12.98 HV; 3PA- 7.27 HV; 6PA- 14.40 HV; 9PA- 19.07 HV) increased after immersion on exposure for 6 and 9 days. in comparison with the control sample.,True,fOSSIUkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,0,http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/handle/123456789/34136,,,,http://ugspace.ug.edu.gh/bitstream/handle/123456789/34136/Microstructural-evolution-and-hardness-properties-of-coircoconut-husk-powder-reinforced-polymer-composites-subjected-to-an-acidic-environmentProcedia-Manufacturing.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The performance of MTPV is greatly affected by the effectiveness of a micro-combustor. In this study. a numerical simulation was conducted to explore the benefits of annular rectangular rib for enhancing the thermal performance of a nonpremixed micro-combustor. Based on the investigations under various rib heights. rib positions. and inlet mass flow rates. it is found that the addition of annular rectangular ribs in the micro-combustor creates a turbulent zone in the combustion chamber. thereby enhancing the heat transfer efficiency between the inner wall of the combustion chamber and the burned gas. The micro-combustor with annular rectangular rib shows a higher and more uniform wall temperature. When the H2 mass flow is 7.438 × 10−8 kg/s and the air mass flow is 2.576 × 10−6 kg/s. the optimum dimensionless rib position is at l = 6/9 and r = 0.4.

However. with the regulatory demand to reduce air pollution. internal combustion engines are a major focus to reduce the emissions from these engines. Compression ignition or diesel engines are a major contributor to NOx and PM pollution. However. the life of these engines is much longer than that of their spark-ignited counterparts. causing the fleet of diesel engines to consist of a significant number of old. higher polluting engines. Fuel additives are one method of reducing emissions and/or enhancing performance in these older diesel engines without the need for technology upgrades (new engines/aftertreatment). Although diesel fuel additives' ability to reduce harmful emissions is well known in the literature. the mechanism as to how these additives work is not well understood.; To explore the mechanism. three cetane improvers (2-EHN. DTBP. and ODA) were investigated on a 1992 DDC Series 60 engine and 2004 EGR-equipped Cummins ISM370 engine incorporating sensors for in-cylinder pressure measurement and analysis.

PA. 15096. USA.,As emission regulations become increasingly strict. the need for more accurate sampling systems becomes essential. When calculating emissions from a dilution system. a correction is made to remove the effects of contaminants in the dilution air. The dilution air correction was explored to determine why this correction is needed. when this correction is important. and what methods are available for calculating the dilution factor (DF). An experimental and error analysis investigation into the standard and recently proposed methods for calculating the DF was conducted. Five steady state modes were run on a 1992 Detroit Diesel engine series 60 and the DF from eleven different equations were investigated. The effects of an inaccurate dilution air correction on calculated fuel flow from a carbon balance and the mass emissions was analyzed.

1207801,A novel gas divider using nonlinear laminar flow,2016,John Nuszkowski and Jeffrey Schwamb and John Esposito,52,Flow Measurement and Instrumentation,December 2016,255–260,Elsevier,Gas dividers are important in emissions measurement since they continuously and accurately mix two gases to create a known gas concentration that is needed in the multi-point calibration of gas analyzers. A novel gas divider was designed using nonlinear laminar flow induced from the density change along the capillary channels due to the high-pressure drop (relative to the inlet gas pressure). The minor losses from entrance and exit effects can be ignored due to the high pressure loss from Hagen-Poiseuille's law relative to the minor losses. Small diameter wires inside of a tube were used to create capillary channels through which gas could flow. The gas divider. using nonlinear laminar flow. showed lower measurement uncertainty at high (90%) dilution levels than using linear laminar flow due to the higher-pressure drop at the same volumetric flow rates. Experiments showed the expected gas concentration …,True,3QBUO68AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955598616301893,1978675347959455331,/scholar?cites=1978675347959455331,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Nuszkowski/publication/309959264_A_Novel_Gas_Divider_using_Nonlinear_Laminar_Flow/links/59e7ace7aca272bc423d0b8a/A-Novel-Gas-Divider-using-Nonlinear-Laminar-Flow.pdf,0,0,0

This has resulted in increased usage    of hydrogen as fuel for internal combustion engines. Hydrogen resources are    vast and it is considered as one of the most promising fuel for automotive    sector. As the required hydrogen infrastructure and refueling stations are    not meeting the demand. widespread introduction of hydrogen vehicles is not    possible in the near future. One of the solutions for this hurdle is to blend    hydrogen with methane. Such types of blends take benefit of the unique    combustion properties of hydrogen and at the same time reduce the demand for    pure hydrogen. Enriching natural gas with hydrogen could be a potential    alternative to common hydrocarbon fuels for internal combustion engine    applications. Many researchers are working on this for the last few years and    work is now focused on how to use this kind of fuel to its maximum extent.    This technical note is an assessment of HCNG usage in case of internal    combustion engines. Several examples and their salient features have been    discussed.

The results proved that when increased the applied pressure then the frictional heat generated increased too. It was developed a new finite element model based on observed data from real vehicle. It was used ANSYS/WORKBENCH 14.5 software to perform the numerical analysis. module Transient Structural. Parts that are the most disposed to the thermal stress are braking pads. Also. it was found time period from 0 to 0.1 second is the most critical period during the whole braking period. because in this period. temperature rises rapidly. the maximum temperature occurred at 1.338 seconds. and after that it falls.,True,yuIJvuwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,4,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0354-98361900314S,5165679731507348841,/scholar?cites=5165679731507348841,,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0354-98361900314S,0,0,0

During the braking process. a large part of the heat is accumulated by the disc. and therefore. it is essential that it has good cooling. In order to improve cooling and reduce the mass of the disc. nowadays more and more ventilated discs are applied. even on commercial vehicles. Not only does this design improve the cooling of automotive disc brakes. but their use significantly reduces the wear of the brake disc and brake pads. The aim of the paper is to reduce the mass of the disc and increase the mass flow of air through the disc. but not to disturb the mechanical characteristics of the brake disc. Optimization is done in the Ansys software package. By performed analysis. parameters that satisfy the goal of the paper are presented.

One of the best solutions to the problem is the use of alternative fuels. Hydrogen is an alternative fuel that is called a fuel of the future. A disadvantage of hydrogen is its high combustion speed. Experimental results were used for the determination of inputs for numerical analysis. The numerical analysis is performed for a 3D model of the engine in order to determine the working parameters of the engine (pressure and temperature). The main goal of this study is to investigate a possibility of modifying the diesel engine so that it can run on hydrogen. It was found that in such an engine the greatest loads occur in the combustion chamber; thus. the vital parts of the engine are protected. Therefore. a mechanical analysis of the combustion chamber was performed (calculation of stresses and deformations).

During the braking process. the large amount of frictional heat is generated on the contact surfaces of disc brakes. In order to ensure the safety of the drivers and the traffic participants. the optimal performance of brake system of the vehicles under the different working conditions should be ensured. Therefore. it can be considered that the brake system an essential element in the vehicle. Practical experiences showed that the most important factor that affects performance of the brake system is the excessive heat that generated during the braking process. Therefore. it’s necessary to pay high attention on the air cooling of the brake system. This is one of the reasons why the ventilated discs are used. besides that their usage provides the reduction of the inertial masses which meaning less cost.

It was used ANSYS/Workbench 14.5 software. Transient Structural module to achieve the numerical analysis. During the stopping process. the high temperatures appeared on the braking pads. where the temperature exceeded 150 ℃ when applied pressure is 0.9 MPa. While. when the applied pressure is 1.1 MPa the temperature on the contact surface is exceeded 180 ℃. after just 1.3 s. The important conclusion based on the results is the most significant factors on the distribution and magnitude of temperature that appear on the contact surfaces are applied pressure and the penetration.

However. based on the economic and many other aspects. it can be considered that IC engines are the main part of almost all mobile systems. Despite of many effective developments to improve of the IC engines but still there is a serious disadvantage which it’s the negative effect to the environment due to usage of fossil fuels. As the consequence of this condition. European norms specified the limits of the formation of harmful components. which are reduced year by year to ensure the protection of the environment.

1207953,Design of exhaust heat recovery power generation system using thermo-electric generator,2013,P Mohamed Shameer and D Christopher,,International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) ISSN (Online),,2319-7064,,A number of irreversible processes in the engine limit its capability to achieve a highly balanced efficiency. The rapid expansion of gases inside the cylinder produces high temperature differences. turbulent fluid motions and large heat transfers from the fluid to the piston crown and cylinder walls. These rapid successions of events happening in the cylinder create expanding exhaust gases with pressures that exceed the atmospheric level. and they must be released while the gases are still expanding to prepare the cylinder for the following processes. By doing so. the heated gases produced from the combustion process can be easily channeled through the exhaust valve and manifold. The large amount of energy from the stream of exhausted gases could potentially be used for waste heat energy recovery to generate power. Various methods to harness the waste heat to produce power effectively had ended up in vain. This paper proposes and implements a thermoelectric waste heat energy recovery system for internal combustion engine automobiles. including gasoline vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. The key is to directly convert the surface heat energy from automotive waste heat to electrical energy using a thermoelectric generator (TEG). which is then regulated by a DC–DC Cuk converter to charge a battery using maximum power point tracking. Hence. the electrical power stored in the battery can be maximized.

This makes PEMFCs as one of the promising and interesting sources of power for the future because they are fully in compliance with the environmental policies and goal of this generation. However. commercialization and full harnessing of this novel cell has yet to commence despite showing some strong prospects and potentials. This may be largely due to the technical issues surrounding the operation of PEMFC. The two main issues that pose serious concern are water and thermal managements. Concerning the water management. two important critical issues that are inter-related involve cell dehydration and water flooding. both of which have adverse effects on the performances of these cells.

1207979,Thermal Performance Optimization of Flat Plate Solar Collector using MATLAB,2020,Isaac Ajunwa and DS Yawas and DM Kulla and Ibrahim Umar Ibrahim,43,Jurnal Mekanikal,2,,,Solar flat plate collectors are one of the very important solar system components as they serve the purpose of heating up the ambient air/water for domestic and industrial uses like drying. cooking. thermal power generation. etc. It is therefore of significance that such flat plate collectors be appropriately designed for optimum performance and reliability at the point of usage. A solar flat plate collector needs to maximize its solar energy collection ability and have a good heat removal factor ability; which are achievable by properly configuring and sizing of its components. This research work presents the coding system for the parametric optimization study to determine the absorber plate thickness. back insulation thickness and tilt angle of a flat plate collector by using a written computer program in MATLAB R2013b base on appropriate equations and computed system parameters used for the research. From the study carried out. it was found that the heat removal factor does not respond significantly to changes in the absorber plate thickness. In order to maximize the heat removal factor. the absorber plate thickness of 1.5× 10-5 m with a heat removal factor of 0.7454 was determined.

In selective assembly. the mating parts are manufactured with wide tolerances. The mating part population is partitioned to form selective groups. and corresponding selective groups are then assembled interchangeably. If the mating parts are manufactured in different processes and in different machines. their standard deviations will be different. It is impossible that the number of parts in the selective group will be the same. A large number of surplus parts are expected according to the difference in the standard deviations of the mating parts.

Three different orientations of fibers are analyzed with and without the circular cut-outs. Also different dimensions of circular cut-outs are applied on the laminates at different compressive loading conditions. This analysis is carried out using the finite element software ANSYS. From the result. it is identified that cross-ply composite laminates posses the highest strength as compared to other types of angle orientations.

1208003,Selective assembly to minimize clearance variation in complex assemblies using fuzzy evolutionary programming method,2013,AK Jeevanantham and SM Kannan,8,ARPN Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences,4,280-289,,Selective assembly is an economic method to obtain perfect precision assemblies by using the components manufactured with wide tolerance specifications. The mating component’s tolerances are divided into equal number of groups. The manufactured components are segregated according to these groups and the components from the corresponding groups are assembled interchangeably in the conventional method. The required clearance can be achieved at this assembly method that is tighter than those achieved at the normal fabrication method with lowest total cost. Still there are more variations in the clearance range. In this paper. a new optimization method is proposed to find the best combination of the selective groups to minimize assembly variation for the complex assemblies. A case example is analyzed for piston. cylinder and piston ring assembly. Fuzzy evolutionary programming (EP) method is used to obtain the best combination of the selective groups to control the assembly variation. Selective assembly is successfully applied for a piston and cylinder assembly using fuzzy EP method to achieve minimum clearance variation without sacrificing the benefit of wider tolerance in manufacturing.,True,R5vjznYAAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC,14,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3153378092800079391&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3153378092800079391,/scholar?cites=3153378092800079391,,,0,0,0

1208005,Optimal layout of a partially treated laminated composite magnetorheological fluid sandwich plate,2015,R Manoharan and R Vasudevan and AK Jeevanantham,16,Smart Struct Sys,,1023-1047,,In this study. the optimal location of the MR fluid segments in a partially treated laminated composite sandwich plate has been identified to maximize the natural frequencies and the loss factors. The finite element formulation is used to derive the governing differential equations of motion for a partially treated laminated composite sandwich plate embedded with MR fluid and rubber material as the core layer and laminated composite plate as the face layers. An optimization problem is formulated and solved by combining finite element analysis (FEA) and genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the optimal locations to yield maximum natural frequency and loss factor corresponding to first five modes of flexural vibration of the sandwich plate with various combinations of weighting factors under various boundary conditions. The proposed methodology is validated by comparing the natural frequencies evaluated at optimal locations of MR fluid pockets identified through GA coupled with FEA and the experimental measurements. The converged results suggest that the optimal location of MR fluid pockets is strongly influenced not only by the boundary conditions and modes of vibrations but also by the objectives of maximization of natural frequency and loss factors either individually or combined. The optimal layout could be useful to apply the MR fluid pockets at critical components of large structure to realize more efficient and compact vibration control mechanism with variable damping.,True,R5vjznYAAAAJ:yB1At4FlUx8C,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vasudevan_Rajamohan/publication/290497149_Optimal_layout_of_a_partially_treated_laminated_composite_magnetorheological_fluid_sandwich_plate/links/57e255f008ae1f0b4d95bba3/Optimal-layout-of-a-partially-treated-laminated-composite-magnetorheological-fluid-sandwich-plate.pdf,16737424851877974643,/scholar?cites=16737424851877974643,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vasudevan_Rajamohan/publication/290497149_Optimal_layout_of_a_partially_treated_laminated_composite_magnetorheological_fluid_sandwich_plate/links/57e255f008ae1f0b4d95bba3/Optimal-layout-of-a-partially-treated-laminated-composite-magnetorheological-fluid-sandwich-plate.pdf,0,0,0

Though it is an emerging issue due to its toxicity level. it is a great platform for the business people to recycle the e-waste to obtain the valuable materials [3–5]. India produces tonnes of e-waste and it is one the largest electronic waste producers in the world which ranks 5th among them. Nearly 70% of electronic wastes from India are majorly contributed by Computer devices. Out of which. telecom sector holds 8%. electric and electronic equipment holds 7% of the yearly electronic waste generation. Nearly 75% of e-wastes are generated from the Government public sector companies and private sector companies. whereas the 16% of e-wastes are only generated from individual household. E-waste accounts for heavy metals such as,True,JOr186EAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=uM6FDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA397&dq=info:kh3sXqVVpSAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=E3n-R_aPNf&sig=xVs5qEmRGBHKMBM-vhiiYf6O3g0,,,,,0,0,0

Singapore,Biodiesel defined as a monoalkyl ester of vegetable or animal fat is produced by the transesterification of free fatty acids with a monohydric alcohol. usually methanol. employing acid catalyst. alkali catalyst. or enzyme catalyst. These are an environmentally attractive alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Also. biodiesel has many important technical advantages over conventional petrodiesel such as inherent lubricity. low toxicity. derivation from a renewable and domestic feedstock. superior flash point and biodegradability. negligible sulfur content. and lower exhaust emissions. More than 10 million tons of biodiesel are produced around the world; yet. the production rate is still low below expectations. For the future renewable fuel projections to be met. additional sources of feedstock are to be explored. The potential of rice husk as a possible feedstock for lipid production has been analyzed in this paper.
