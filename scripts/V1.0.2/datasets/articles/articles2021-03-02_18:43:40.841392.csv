As the number of sequenced genomes rapidly grows. the overwhelming majority of protein products can only be annotated computationally. If computational predictions are to be relied upon. it is crucial that the accuracy of these methods be high. Here we report the results from the first large-scale community-based critical assessment of protein function annotation (CAFA) experiment. Fifty-four methods representing the state of the art for protein function prediction were evaluated on a target set of 866 proteins from 11 organisms. Two findings stand out:(i) today's best protein function prediction algorithms substantially outperform widely used first-generation methods. with large gains on all types of targets; and (ii) although the top methods perform well enough to guide experiments. there is considerable need for improvement of currently available tools.,True,-yLAUooAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,763,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2340$$$$,10908747248059113636,/scholar?cites=10908747248059113636,,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2340$$$$,0,0,0

Traditional ground measurements are labor and resource intensive and at the same time expensive and time consuming. For most of the Slovenian forests. there is extensive ground-based information on forest properties of selected sample locations.

1111638,Combining bagging and random subspaces to create better ensembles,2007,Panče Panov and Sašo Džeroski,,,,118-129,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Random forests are one of the best performing methods for constructing ensembles. They derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning base-level classifiers (decision trees). The base-level algorithm randomly selects a subset of the features at each step of tree construction and chooses the best among these. We propose to use a combination of concepts used in bagging and random subspaces to achieve a similar effect. The latter randomly select a subset of the features at the start and use a deterministic version of the base-level algorithm (and is thus somewhat similar to the randomized version of the algorithm). The results of our experiments show that the proposed approach has a comparable performance to that of random forests. with the added advantage of being applicable to any base-level algorithm …,True,-yLAUooAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,111,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74825-0_11,8018787412407707771,/scholar?cites=8018787412407707771,,http://kt.ijs.si/panovp/Default_files/Panov08Combining.pdf,0,0,0

To understand the deluge of genomic data we face. computational approaches for gene functional annotation are invaluable. We introduce a novel model for computational annotation that refines two established concepts: annotation based on homology and annotation based on phyletic profiling. The phyletic profiling-based model that includes both inferred orthologs and paralogs—homologs separated by a speciation and a duplication event. respectively—provides more annotations at the same average Precision than the model that includes only inferred orthologs. For experimental validation. we selected 38 poorly annotated Escherichia coli genes for which the model assigned one of three GO terms with high confidence: involvement in DNA repair. protein translation. or cell wall synthesis. Results of antibiotic stress survival assays on E. coli knockout mutants showed high agreement with our model's estimates of accuracy: out of 38 predictions obtained at the reported Precision of 60%. we confirmed 25 predictions. indicating that our confidence estimates can be used to make informed decisions on experimental validation. Our work will contribute to making experimental validation of computational predictions more approachable. both in cost and time.

Multi-target regression is an extension of the single-target regression task. in which multiple continuous targets have to be predicted together. Recent studies in the batch setting have shown that global approaches. predicting all of the targets at once. tend to outperform local approaches. predicting each target separately. In this paper. we explore how different local and global tree-based approaches for multi-target regression compare in the streaming setting.

Therefore. there is a need to propose appropriate measures at the farm and regional levels to minimize adventitious presence of GM crops. Outputs from the previously developed GENESYS model for gene flow between cropped and volunteer oilseed rape were used to make rule-based models that predict the rates of adventitious presence of GM seeds in the central field of a large-risk field pattern. Data aggregation was carried out to investigate if the regional variables improve the prediction quality of the rule-based model.,True,-yLAUooAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,7,http://enviroinfo.eu/sites/default/files/pdfs/vol114/0493.pdf,7851673833572946995,/scholar?cites=7851673833572946995,,http://enviroinfo.eu/sites/default/files/pdfs/vol114/0493.pdf,0,0,0

Benthic communities were surveyed before and after the typhoon using line intercept transect method. Comparison of the benthic assemblages showed highly significant differences in coral coverage at depths of 25–32 m before and after Typhoon 17. A large deep stand of Pachyseris foliosa was apparently less resistant to the storm than the shallower high diversity area of this reef. Contradictory to common perception. this research shows that large foliose corals at deeper depths are just as susceptible to typhoon damage as shallower branching corals.

At the same time. this species is theorized to be expanding its range in the northwestern Pacific. Despite this. the current distribution of this species in Japan is unknown. with no research having been conducted since an initial assessment in 1984-1985. To address this information deficiency. a survey of the Ryukyu Archipelago from Amami Oshima Island south to the Yaeyama Islands was conducted to assess the distribution of T. hoshinota over the period of 2009 to 2011. Field images have been posted as an online image archive for researchers to utilize in future research. Our findings show that the presence of T. hoshinota is not uncommon in this region. with at least 23 of 64 (= 36%) sites with this species. This is a considerable increase from levels reported in 1984-1985 (11 of 182 sites.= 6%). and suggests this species is now a permanent feature in the coral reef ecosystems of this region. However. large outbreaks were at approximately the same levels as reported in 1984-1985. Most T. hoshinota were found in shallow (< 5 m) depths. and abundance does not appear to be greatly influenced by seasons.

1111692,The extended phenotypes of marine symbioses: ecological and evolutionary consequences of intraspecific genetic diversity in coral–algal associations,2014,John E Parkinson and Iliana B Baums,5,Frontiers in microbiology,,445,Frontiers,Reef-building corals owe much of their success to a symbiosis with dinoflagellate microalgae in the genus Symbiodinium. In this association. the performance of each organism is tied to that of its partner. and together the partners form a holobiont that can be subject to selection. Climate change affects coral reefs. which are declining globally as a result. Yet the extent to which coral holobionts will be able to acclimate or evolve to handle climate change and other stressors remains unclear. Selection acts on individuals and evidence from terrestrial systems demonstrates that intraspecific genetic diversity plays a significant role in symbiosis ecology and evolution. However. we have a limited understanding of the effects of such diversity in corals. As molecular methods have advanced. so too has our recognition of the taxonomic and functional diversity of holobiont partners. Resolving the major components of the holobiont to the level of the individual will help us assess the importance of intraspecific diversity and partner interactions in coral-algal symbioses. Here. we hypothesize that unique combinations of coral and algal individuals yield functional diversity that affects not only the ecology and evolution of the coral holobiont. but associated communities as well. Our synthesis is derived from reviewing existing evidence and presenting novel data. By incorporating the effects of holobiont extended phenotypes into predictive models. we may refine our understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of corals and reef communities responding to climate change.,True,RXpMq54AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,73,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00445/full,17999905731345352007,/scholar?cites=17999905731345352007,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00445/full,0,0,0

These symbioses are often re-established every generation with high specificity. but gaps remain in our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that control symbiont recognition and uptake dynamics. Here. we tested whether differences in glycan profiles among different symbiont species account for the different rates at which they initially colonize aposymbiotic polyps of the model sea anemone Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida). First. we used a lectin array to characterize the glycan profiles of colonizing Symbiodinium minutum (ITS2 type B1) and non-colonizing S. pilosum (ITS2 type A2). finding subtle differences in the binding of lectins EEL and UDA that distinguish between high-mannoside and hybrid-type protein linked glycans. Next. we enzymatically cleaved glycans from the surfaces of S. minutum cultures and followed their recovery using flow cytometry. establishing a 48-72 hour glycan turnover rate for this species. Finally. we exposed aposymbiotic host polyps to cultured S. minutum cells masked by EEL or UDA lectins for 48 hours. then measured cell densities the following day. We found no effect of glycan masking on symbiont density. providing further support to the hypothesis that glycan-lectin interactions are more important for post-phagocytic persistence of specific symbionts than they are for initial uptake.

The zoantharian Palythoa tuberculosa bleaches earlier than many scleractinian corals and may serve as an indicator species. Basic monitoring of such species could help to detect and even anticipate bleaching events. especially in areas where more sophisticated approaches that rely on buoy or satellite measurements of sea surface temperature are unavailable or too coarse. One simple and inexpensive monitoring method involves training volunteers to record observations of host color as a proxy for symbiosis quality.

We also measured three traditional metrics of symbiosis quality for comparison: symbiont morphological condition. cell density. and chlorophyll a content. We found that P. tuberculosa color score. although highly correlated among observers. provided little predictive power for the other variables. This was likely due to inherent variation in colony color among generally healthy zoantharians in midwinter. as well as low sample size and brief training owing to the course structure.

The risks and severity of impact from dredging (and other sediment disturbances) on corals are primarily related to the intensity. duration and frequency of exposure to increased turbidity and sedimentation. The sensitivity of a coral reef to dredging impacts and its ability to recover depend on the antecedent ecological conditions of the reef. its resilience and the ambient conditions normally experienced. Effects of sediment stress have so far been investigated in 89 coral species (∼10% of all known reef-building corals).

Because of their endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) corals can grow fast in tropical shallow seas where they form reefs that supply food. substrate and shelter for other organisms. Many coral symbionts are host-specific. depending on particular coral species for their existence. Some of these animals have become popular objects for underwater photographers and aquarists. whereas others are hardly noticed or considered pests. Loss of a single coral host species also leads to the disappearance of some of its associated fauna. In the present study we show which mushroom corals (Scleractinia: Fungiidae) are known to act as hosts for other organisms. such as acoel flatworms. copepods. barnacles. gall crabs. pontoniine shrimps. mytilid bivalves. epitoniid snails. coralliophilid snails. fish and certain types of zooxanthellae. Several of these associated organisms appear to be host-specific whereas other species are generalists and not even necessarily restricted to fungiid hosts. Heliofungia actiniformis is one of the most hospitable coral species known with a recorded associated fauna consisting of at least 23 species. The availability of a phylogeny reconstruction of the Fungiidae enables comparisons of closely related species of mushroom corals regarding their associated fauna. Application of a phylogenetic ecological analysis indicates that the presence or absence ofassociated organisms is evolutionarily derived or habitat-induced. Some associations appear to be restricted to certain evolutionary lineages within the Fungiidae …,True,6LGtQ9cAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,86,https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/431754/,13292742006523583402,/scholar?cites=13292742006523583402,,https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/431754/Hoeksema_et_al._2012_Journal_of_the_Marine_Biological_Association_of_the_United_Kingdom.pdf,0,0,0

Although collecting efforts and sampling methods differed. a comparison of the molluscan fauna of Jakarta Bay between 1937/38 and 2005 reveals a distinct deterioration. From 1937 to 2005. Jakarta Bay received increasing amounts of sewage from the greater Jakarta area. as well as increased sediment input from the deforested West Java hinterland.

After a revision of 19 Singaporean fungiid species either collected or recorded and photographed in the field. the presence of only 15 species could be confirmed during the latest survey (2006). This number includes a species that was discovered as new to science. Species richness estimators indicate that additional species are not to be expected. This local depauperation of the mushroom coral fauna may be a result of deforestation in the hinterland and land reclamation works in the harbour area. both of which have caused increasing siltation and lower visibility in the coastal waters of Singapore.

South Sulawesi,2012,Bert W Hoeksema,60,The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology,1,183-212,,The distribution patterns of 37 mushroom coral species (Scleractinia: Fungiidae) were studied on 13 reefs in the Spermonde Archipelago (Makassar Strait. Indonesia) in 1984–1986. The studied reefs were either cay-crowned or submerged and were divided over four shelf zones varying in distance offshore. The species are compared with regard to their distributions (1) across the shelf in four zones parallel to the coastline.(2) around the reefs with orientation according to wind directions. and (3) along depth gradients over the reef flats. slopes. and bases. Most species showed their highest abundances on wave-exposed mid-shelf reef slopes. Within transects. species showed overlapping depth ranges. visible as multi-species assemblages with average densities in quadrats of up to 25 m–2 composed of a maximum of 26 co-occurring species. Most species were concentrated on reef slopes. some mainly on shallow reef flats. and a few on deeper reef bases. Several species showed a downward shift in depth range with increasing distance offshore. A clustering of the reefs with respect to similarity in species composition appeared to be related to their distance offshore and to the presence or absence of shallow reef substrates important for recruitment.

Making consistent sense of extensive sequence variation in a meaningful ecological and evolutionary context would benefit from the application of additional genetic markers. Sequences of the non-coding region of the plastid psbA minicircle (psbAncr) were used to independently examine symbiont genotypic and species diversity found within and between colonies of Hawaiian reef corals in the genus Montipora.

Using data from the literature and our own studies we elucidate the ecological functions of giant clams. We show how their tissues are food for a wide array of predators and scavengers. while their discharges of live zooxanthellae. faeces. and gametes are eaten by opportunistic feeders. The shells of giant clams provide substrate for colonization by epibionts. while commensal and ectoparasitic organisms live within their mantle cavities. Giant clams increase the topographic heterogeneity of the reef. act as reservoirs of zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium spp.). and also potentially counteract eutrophication via water filtering.

Tridacna lorenzi. T. mbalavuana. T. squamosina. T. rosewateri and Hippopus porcellanus. The larger species. Tridacna gigas and T. derasa are the most endangered. with> 50% of wild populations either locally extinct or severely depleted. The smaller and boring species. such as T. maxima and T. crocea. remain relatively abundant despite ongoing fishing activities. Population density also varies across localities. Areas with the lowest densities generally correspond with evidence of high historical exploitation intensity. while areas with the highest densities tend to be within marine reserves. remote from human populations or have low historical fishing pressures. Exploitation continues to be the main threat and conservation challenge for giant clams.

Increased ocean temperatures are expected to accelerate larval development. potentially leading to reduced pelagic durations and earlier reef-seeking behaviour. Depending on the spatial arrangement of reefs. the expectation would be a reduction in dispersal distances and the spatial scale of connectivity. Small increase in temperature might enhance the number of larvae surviving the pelagic phase. but larger increases are likely to reduce reproductive output and increase larval mortality. Changes to ocean currents could alter the dynamics of larval supply and changes to planktonic productivity could affect how many larvae survive the pelagic stage and their condition at settlement; however. these patterns are likely to vary greatly from …,True,rCoZB0sAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,282,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00338-008-0461-9.pdf,1506672052772827350,/scholar?cites=1506672052772827350,,https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:76582,0,0,0

1111819,Allorecognition in compound ascidians.,2002,Y Saito and E Hirose and H Watanabe,38,,2,237-247,UPV/EHU Press,In botryllids (colonial ascidians). there are two types of allorecognition: colony specificity and colony resorption. Colony specificity is manifested by fusion and rejection between two conspecific colonies. The genetic basis for this colony specificity resides in a single highly polymorphic gene locus (fusibility locus) with codominantly expressed alleles. Two colonies with no alleles in common at this locus reject each other. whereas colonies sharing at least one allele at the fusibility locus fuse and form a chimera. That is. in colony specificity. self components are distinguished from nonself components. and failure to recognize self induces rapid rejection reactions. The process of rejection in colony specificity is not uniform among all botryllid ascidians. Colony resorption can occur after the establishment of fusion between two colonies. Zooids of one partner of a chimera are resorbed more than 1 week after fusion. or. by amputation of fused blood vessels. the chimera becomes separated into the two original colonies. Colony resorption is also controlled mainly by the fusibility locus. It usually occurs in a chimera between two colonies sharing only one allele at this locus. In colony resorption. nonself determinants are recognized and chronic rejection reactions are induced resembling MHC-dependent graft rejection. Based on these findings. the fusibility locus of botryllids seems to be very similar to the MHC of vertebrates.

Gastropoda) retains photosynthetically active chloroplasts from ingested algae (functional kleptoplasts) in the epithelial cells of its digestive gland for up to 10 months. While its feeding behavior has not been observed in natural habitats. two hypotheses have been proposed: 1) adult P. ocellatus uses kleptoplasts to obtain photosynthates and nutritionally behaves as a photoautotroph without replenishing the kleptoplasts; or 2) it behaves as a mixotroph (photoautotroph and herbivorous consumer) and replenishes kleptoplasts continually or periodically. To address the question of which hypothesis is more likely. we examined the source algae for kleptoplasts and temporal changes in kleptoplast composition and nutritional contribution. By characterizing the temporal diversity of P. ocellatus kleptoplasts using rbcL sequences. we found that P. ocellatus harvests kleptoplasts from at least 8 different siphonous green algal species. that kleptoplasts from more than one species are present in each individual sea slug. and that the kleptoplast composition differs temporally. These results suggest that wild P. ocellatus often feed on multiple species of siphonous algae from which they continually obtain fresh chloroplasts. By estimating the trophic position of wild and starved P. ocellatus using the stable nitrogen isotopic composition of amino acids. we showed that despite the abundance of kleptoplasts. their photosynthates do not contribute greatly to the nutrition of wild P. ocellatus. but that kleptoplast photosynthates form a significant source of nutrition for starved sea slugs.

The tunic is transparent and gelatinous. consisting of an electron-dense cuticular layer with a fibrous tunic matrix. The thickness and density of the cuticular layer and of the tunic matrix differ from species to species. In some salps. the cuticular layer has numerous minute protrusions that are structurally identical to those found in several ascidians. Free mesenchymal cells (tunic cells) are distributed in the tunic. Whereas the number of tunic cells in the pyrosomas is similar to that in ascidians. there are many fewer tunic cells in doliolids and salps. These differences may be caused by the different functions of the tunic in each group.

Halocynthia roretzi (Drasche). and often leads to mass mortality. Here. we describe the tunic morphology of intact and diseased ascidians to reveal structural differences between them. Morphologically. diseased tunics are not very different from intact tunics. although the former are thinner and softer than the latter. While several types of cells are distributed in the tunic. the cell types and their cytomorphologies were almost identical in both groups.

This study used cDNA microarrays to investigate transcriptional effects of thermal stress in embryos of the coral Montastraea faveolata. Embryos were exposed to 27.5°C. 29.0°C. and 31.5°C directly after fertilization. Differences in gene expression were measured after 12 and 48 hours. Analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that increased temperatures may lead to oxidative stress. apoptosis. and a structural reconfiguration of the cytoskeletal network. Metabolic processes were downregulated. and the action of histones and zinc finger-containing proteins may have played a role in the long-term regulation upon heat stress. Embryos responded differently depending on exposure time and temperature level. Embryos showed expression of stress-related genes already at a temperature of 29.0°C. but seemed to be able to counteract the initial response over time. By contrast. embryos at 31.5°C displayed continuous expression of stress genes. The genes that played a role in the response to elevated temperatures consisted of both highly conserved and coral-specific genes. These genes might serve as a basis for research into coral-specific adaptations to stress responses and global climate change.,True,wg421oQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,140,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-627?optIn=false,5363155168528490256,/scholar?cites=5363155168528490256,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-627?optIn=false,0,0,0

In part. this may be a consequence of such studies focusing on the reef-building (shallow water and zooxanthellate) Scleractinia. and largely ignoring the large number of deep-sea species. To better understand broad patterns of coral evolution. we generated molecular data for a broad and representative range of deep sea scleractinians collected off New Caledonia and Australia during the last decade. and conducted the most comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis to date of the order Scleractinia.  Methodology Partial (595 bp) sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) gene were determined for 65 deep-sea (azooxanthellate) scleractinians and 11 shallow-water species. These new data were aligned with 158 published sequences. generating a 234 taxon dataset representing 25 of the 27 currently recognized scleractinian families.  Principal Findings/Conclusions There was a striking discrepancy between the taxonomic validity of coral families consisting predominantly of deep-sea or shallow-water species.

This latter scenario. the “naked coral” hypothesis. is strongly supported by analyses based on mitochondrial (mt) protein sequences. whereas the former is equally strongly supported by analyses of mt nucleotide sequences. The “naked coral” hypothesis seeks to link skeleton loss in the putative ancestor of corallimorpharians with a period of elevated oceanic CO2 during the Cretaceous. leading to the idea that these skeleton-less animals may be harbingers …,True,27tk-IoAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,40,https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article-abstract/6/5/1086/603906,7520026614326945786,/scholar?cites=7520026614326945786,,https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/6/5/1086/603906,0,0,0

Orders within Anthozoa distinguished by the presence of an aragonite skeleton in the former. is controversial. Although classically considered distinct groups. some phylogenetic analyses have placed the Corallimorpharia within a larger Scleractinia/Corallimorpharia clade. leading to the suggestion that the Corallimorpharia are “naked corals” that arose via skeleton loss during the Cretaceous from a Scleractinian ancestor. Scleractinian paraphyly is. however. contradicted by a number of recent phylogenetic studies based on mt nucleotide (nt) sequence data. Whereas the “naked coral” hypothesis was based on analysis of the sequences of proteins encoded by a relatively small number of mt genomes. here a much-expanded dataset was used to reinvestigate hexacorallian phylogeny. The initial observation was that. whereas analyses based on nt data support scleractinian monophyly. those based on amino acid (aa) data support the “naked coral” hypothesis. irrespective of the method and with very strong support. To better understand the bases of these contrasting results. the effects of systematic errors were examined. Compared to other hexacorallians. the mt genomes of “Robust” corals have a higher (A+T) content. codon usage is far more constrained. and the proteins that they encode have a markedly higher phenylalanine content. leading us to suggest that mt DNA repair may be impaired in this lineage. Thus the “naked coral” topology could be caused by high levels of saturation in these mitochondrial sequences. long-branch effects or model violations.

Their hard skeletons form the substratum of reef ecosystems and confer on corals their remarkable diversity of shapes. Corallimorpharians are non-calcifying. close relatives of scleractinian corals. and the evolutionary relationship between these two groups is key to understanding the evolution of calcification in the coral lineage. One pivotal question is whether scleractinians are a monophyletic group. paraphyly being an alternative possibility if corallimorpharians are corals that have lost their ability to calcify. as is implied by the “naked-coral” hypothesis. Despite major efforts. relationships between scleractinians and corallimorpharians remain equivocal and controversial. Although the complete mitochondrial genomes of a range of scleractinians and corallimorpharians have been obtained. heterogeneity in composition and evolutionary rates means that mitochondrial sequences are insufficient to understand the relationship between these two groups. To overcome these limitations. transcriptome data were generated for three representative corallimorpharians. These were used in combination with sequences available for a representative range of scleractinians to identify 291 orthologous single copy protein-coding nuclear markers.

As part of the process of resolving taxonomic affinities of ‘caryophylliids’. here a new ‘Robust’ scleractinian family (Deltocyathiidae fam. n.) is proposed on the basis of combined molecular (CO1 and 28S rDNA) and morphological data. accommodating the early‐diverging clade of traditional caryophylliids (represented today by the genus Deltocyathus …,True,27tk-IoAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,15,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1463-6409.2012.00575.x,9714577113322293617,/scholar?cites=9714577113322293617,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19532/iz_2012_Deltocyathiidae.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1,0,0,0

Through statistical analysis of distribution. identification of specimens deposited in scientific collections. and revision of all preterite records of azooxanthellate scleractinians from southern and part of southeastern coast of Brazil. was noted that the coordinates covered by the present study represent an transitional distributional area between the Caribbean and marginal Antarctic fauna. especially for the solitary species. From a vertical distribution analysis. an increase in the number of species in the sector between the external continental shelve and 500 m depth was observed. A grouping analysis was performed. allowing the discrimination of 6 association biotopes of corals.

This is probably due to the low genetic variation found among the molecular markers (primarily mitochondrial) commonly used for Anthozoa. Ceriantharia is an anthozoan group that has not been tested for genetic divergence at the species level. Recently. all three Atlantic species described for the genus Isarachnanthus of Atlantic Ocean. were deemed synonyms based on morphological simmilarities of only one species: Isarachnanthus maderensis. Here. we aimed to verify whether genetic relationships (using COI. 16S. ITS1 and ITS2 molecular markers) confirmed morphological affinities among members of Isarachnanthus from different regions across the Atlantic Ocean. Results from four DNA markers were completely congruent and revealed that two different species exist in the Atlantic Ocean. The low identification success and substantial overlap between intra and interspecific COI distances render the Anthozoa unsuitable for DNA barcoding. which is not true for Ceriantharia. In addition. genetic divergence within and between Ceriantharia species is more similar to that found in Medusozoa (Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa) than Anthozoa and Porifera that have divergence rates similar to typical metazoans. The two genetic species could also be separated based on micromorphological characteristics of their cnidomes. Using a specimen of Isarachnanthus bandanensis from Pacific Ocean as an outgroup. it was possible to estimate the minimum date of divergence between the clades.

Eretmochelys imbricata (Linnaeus 1766). occur throughout the world’s tropical and subtropical oceans. ranging primarily from 30 N to 30 S (Meylan & Redlow 2006). being found mainly in the tropical regions of the Atlantic. Indian and Western Pacific oceans (Lutz & Musick 1997; Meylan & Redlow 2006). In the Western Atlantic Ocean they have been observed from the southern USA to southern Brazil. throughout the Central America. Bahamas and Caribbean Sea (Meylan & Redlow 2006). Young hawksbill turtles are unable to dive into deep waters. being forced to live in masses of floating sea algae. such as Sargassum (Lutz & Musick 1997; Pope 1939). After this early. long pelagic phase. benthic adult individuals typically inhabit coral reefs and other hard-bottom habitats (Carr et al. 1966. 1982). In addition. hawksbill turtles are most frequently observed in reefs where the sponge population is vast (Pritchard 1979). They are also found in mangrove bordered areas. shallow inlets. remote oceanic islands. offshore cays and mainland shores. Usually. they are found in water no deeper than 18m (Ernst 1982; Ernst et al. 1994; Pritchard 1979).

Much of this marine region is deep sea (> 200 m in depth). Economically. the region is among the most productive marine fisheries regions in the world. including not only openwater fisheries but also commercially important crab fisheries (Spiridonov 2005). Despite its obvious importance to the global fishery. research on many marine taxa in the region is lacking. due to the relative remoteness of the region as well as other logistical issues such as severe weather. The lack of data and research in the region thus hampers our knowledge of many marine taxa. making conservation and protection planning difficult.In this chapter. we will examine the state of knowledge in the NW Pacific Ocean for two phyla of marine invertebrates. the Cnidaria and Ctenophora. at depths below 2.000 m. in the lower bathyal (2.000–3.000 m). abyssal (3.000–6.000 m) and hadal (> 6.000 m) zones. These two phyla are among the most ancient of metazoans (Simion et al. 2017). and are often grouped together as “coelenterates”. although the scientific validity of such a group has now been debunked (eg Whelan et al. 2015; Simion et al. 2017; Nielsen 2019).

Although this species had previously been synonymized with Anemonactis mazeli (Jourdan. 1880) due to its smaller size and fewer tentacles. it was under dispute whether this sea anemone was in fact a different species. In this study. the taxon is redescribed from newly collected material and assigned to the genus Anemonactis Andres. 1881 as Anemonactis minuta (Wassilieff. 1908) comb. nov. Its differences from all considered valid species in this genus are discussed. Furthermore. the Atlanto-Mediterranean species Anemonactis mazeli has been considered cosmopolitan by some authors. However. the study of additional material suggests that most of the previous records of this species in Japanese waters belong to a new species.

1111948,ezRAD: a simplified method for genomic genotyping in non-model organisms,2013,Robert J Toonen and Jonathan B Puritz and Zac H Forsman and Jonathan L Whitney and Iria Fernandez-Silva and Kimberly R Andrews and Christopher E Bird,1,PeerJ,,e203,PeerJ Inc.,Here. we introduce ezRAD. a novel strategy for restriction site–associated DNA (RAD) that requires little technical expertise or investment in laboratory equipment. and demonstrate its utility for ten non-model organisms across a wide taxonomic range. ezRAD differs from other RAD methods primarily through its use of standard Illumina TruSeq library preparation kits. which makes it possible for any laboratory to send out to a commercial genomic core facility for library preparation and next-generation sequencing with virtually no additional investment beyond the cost of the service itself. This simplification opens RADseq to any lab with the ability to extract DNA and perform a restriction digest. ezRAD also differs from others in its flexibility to use any restriction enzyme (or combination of enzymes) that cuts frequently enough to generate fragments of the desired size range. without requiring the purchase of separate adapters for each enzyme or a sonication step. which can further decrease the cost involved in choosing optimal enzymes for particular species and research questions. We apply this method across a wide taxonomic diversity of non-model organisms to demonstrate the utility and flexibility of our approach. The simplicity of ezRAD makes it particularly useful for the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms and targeted amplicon sequencing in natural populations of non-model organisms that have been historically understudied because of lack of genomic information.,True,VOZC5McAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,189,https://peerj.com/articles/203/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=web&utm_term=eZRad&utm_content=Article203&utm_campaign=MostCitedBlog,4962847116538665089,/scholar?cites=4962847116538665089,,https://peerj.com/articles/203/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=web&utm_term=eZRad&utm_content=Article203&utm_campaign=MostCitedBlog,0,0,0

Among these tools. genetic maps have been constructed mainly using marker types such as simple sequence repeats (SSR). restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) in different mapping populations. There is a growing need for saturating the genetic map with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). more amenable for high throughput analysis. especially if these markers are located in gene coding regions. to provide functional markers. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from melon are available in public databases. and resequencing ESTs or validating SNPs detected in silico are excellent ways to discover SNPs. EST-based SNPs were discovered after resequencing ESTs between the parental lines of the PI 161375 (SC) × 'Piel de sapo' (PS) genetic map or using in silico SNP information from EST databases. In total 200 EST-based SNPs were mapped in the melon genetic map using a bin-mapping strategy. increasing the map density to 2.35 cM/marker. A subset of 45 SNPs was used to study variation in a panel of 48 melon accessions covering a wide range of the genetic diversity of the species. SNP analysis correctly reflected the genetic relationships compared with other marker systems. being able to distinguish all the accessions and cultivars.

There are a multitude of definitions of speciation alone. and when combined with the biogeographic concept of sympatric range overlap. consensus on what sympatric speciation is. whether it happens. and its importance. is even more difficult to achieve. Providing the basis upon which to define and judge sympatric speciation. the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis (Huxley in Evolution: the modern synthesis. MIT Press.

The recent advent of next-generation pyrosequencing has drastically accelerated microsatellite locus discovery by providing a greater amount of DNA sequencing reads at lower costs compared to other techniques. However. laboratory testing of PCR primers targeting potential microsatellite markers remains time consuming and costly. Here we show how to reduce this workload by screening microsatellite loci via bioinformatic analyses prior to primer design. Our method emphasizes the importance of sequence quality. and we avoid loci associated with repetitive elements by screening with repetitive sequence databases available for a growing number of taxa. Testing with the Yellowstripe Goatfish Mulloidichthys flavolineatus and the marine planktonic copepod Pleuromamma xiphias we show higher success rate of primers selected by our pipeline in comparison to previous in silico microsatellite detection methodologies.

However. by ignoring the irreducible limits imposed by these same random fluctuations. Mora et al. 1 express their emergence dates with too much certainty. Several methodological oversights contribute to the erroneous uncertainty quantification. First.

In recent years. the accumulation of molecular data led to a new evolutionary understanding. in which all eukaryotic diversity has been classified into five or six supergroups. Yet. the composition of these large assemblages and their relationships remain controversial.Methodology/Principle FindingsHere. we report the sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for two species belonging to the supergroup Rhizaria and present the analysis of a unique dataset combining 29908 amino acid positions and an extensive taxa sampling made of 49 mainly unicellular species representative of all supergroups. Our results show a very robust relationship between Rhizaria and two main clades of the supergroup chromalveolates: stramenopiles and alveolates. We confirm the existence of consistent affinities between assemblages that were thought to belong to different supergroups of eukaryotes. thus not sharing a close evolutionary history.ConclusionsThis well supported phylogeny has important consequences for our understanding of the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. In particular. it questions a single red algal origin of the chlorophyll-c containing plastids among the chromalveolates.

The common use of the PCR for gene amplification and sequencing produced rapidly increasing data sets of DNA sequences from various types of organisms. Comparison of these sequences allowed the phylogenetic links to be established be-tween organisms at different taxonomic levels.

Recent environmental DNA surveys based on clone libraries of rRNA genes confirm this observation and reveal a high diversity of eukaryotes present in deep-sea sediment samples. However. environmental clone-library surveys yield only a modest number of sequences with which to evaluate the diversity of abyssal eukaryotes.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here. we examined the richness of eukaryotic DNA in deep Arctic and Southern Ocean samples using massively parallel sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V9 hypervariable region. In very small volumes of sediments. ranging from 0.35 to 0.7 g. we recovered up to 7.499 unique sequences per sample. By clustering sequences having up to 3 differences. we observed from 942 to 1756 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) per sample. Taxonomic analyses of these OTUs showed that DNA of all major groups of eukaryotes is represented at the deep-sea floor. The dinoflagellates. cercozoans. ciliates. and euglenozoans predominate. contributing to 17%. 16%. 10%. and 8% of all assigned OTUs. respectively. Interestingly. many sequences represent photosynthetic taxa or are similar to those reported from the environmental surveys of surface waters. Moreover. each sample contained from 31 to 71 different metazoan OTUs despite the small sample volume collected. This indicates that a significant faction of the eukaryotic DNA sequences likely do not belong to living organisms. but represent either free. extracellular DNA or remains and resting stages of planktonic species.

Using these multiple calibration points in a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock framework. we inferred that the early radiation of eukaryotes occurred near the Mesoproterozoic–Neoproterozoic boundary. about 1100 million years ago.

These conventional indices have some limitations. often related to difficulties in morphological identification of bioindicator taxa. Recent development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding could potentially alleviate some of these limitations. by using DNA sequences instead of morphology to identify organisms and to characterize a given ecosystem.

They develop complex polypoid colonies and exhibit considerable morphological variation among species with respect to growth. defensive structures and mode of development. For instance. several lineages within this order have lost the medusa stage. Depending on the author. traditional taxonomy in hydrozoans may be either polyp-or medusa-oriented. Therefore. the absence of the latter stage in some lineages may lead to very different classification schemes. Molecular data have proved useful in elucidating this taxonomic challenge.

However. the evolutionary rate of Ceriantharia. one of the most enigmatic “orders” within Anthozoa. has never been specifically examined. In this study. the divergence of mitochondrial DNA of Ceriantharia was compared to members of other Anthozoa and Medusozoa groups. In addition. nuclear markers were used to check the relative phylogenetic position of Ceriantharia in relation to other Cnidaria members. The results demonstrated a pattern of divergence of mitochondrial DNA completely different from those estimated for other anthozoans. and phylogenetic analyses indicate that Ceriantharia is not included within hexacorallians in most performed analyses.

This is probably due to the low genetic variation found among the molecular markers (primarily mitochondrial) commonly used for Anthozoa. Ceriantharia is an anthozoan group that has not been tested for genetic divergence at the species level. Recently. all three Atlantic species described for the genus Isarachnanthus of Atlantic Ocean. were deemed synonyms based on morphological simmilarities of only one species: Isarachnanthus maderensis. Here. we aimed to verify whether genetic relationships (using COI. 16S. ITS1 and ITS2 molecular markers) confirmed morphological affinities among members of Isarachnanthus from different regions across the Atlantic Ocean. Results from four DNA markers were completely congruent and revealed that two different species exist in the Atlantic Ocean. The low identification success and substantial overlap between intra and interspecific COI distances render the Anthozoa unsuitable for DNA barcoding. which is not true for Ceriantharia. In addition. genetic divergence within and between Ceriantharia species is more similar to that found in Medusozoa (Hydrozoa and Scyphozoa) than Anthozoa and Porifera that have divergence rates similar to typical metazoans. The two genetic species could also be separated based on micromorphological characteristics of their cnidomes. Using a specimen of Isarachnanthus bandanensis from Pacific Ocean as an outgroup. it was possible to estimate the minimum date of divergence between the clades.

This entails in a scenario of little knowledge of the different larval stages of most species. In the present work we verified by DNA barcoding techniques the phenotypic variation of larvae of"" morphological species"" that for a long time were identified in different genera. but that by the molecular data could be correctly identified as a single species. This study demonstrates that many assumptions made for various stages of life cycle in Cnidaria may be totally wrong and approaches with DNA Barcoding should be prioritized for this verification.Studies on the behavior and life cycle of cnidarian species in the laboratory and in situ are still rare for many groups of cnidarians. especially Ceriantharia (Tiffon. 1987). although such studies are essential to identifying the species and populations (eg. Jarms et al.. 2002). The subclass Ceriantharia (tube anemones; members of Anthozoa). known for the beauty of their polyps. suffer from confusing taxonomy (Stampar et al.. 2014). The life cycle of Ceriantharia (eg Fig. 1) is little known. being described in only half a dozen species. Even so. some ancient studies (between 50-100 years ago) already indicate a considerable variation of forms as a consequence of the environment (Nyholm. 1943).

We found that representatives of many scleractinian species are brightly fluorescent at depths of 50–60 m at the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences (IUI) reef in Eilat. Israel. Some of these fluorescent species have distribution maxima at mesophotic depths (40–100 m). Several individuals from these depths displayed yellow or orange-red fluorescence. the latter being essentially absent in corals from the shallowest parts of this reef. We demonstrate experimentally that in some cases the production of fluorescent pigments is independent of the exposure to light; while in others. the fluorescence signature is altered or lost when the animals are kept in darkness. Furthermore. we show that green-to-red photoconversion of fluorescent pigments mediated by short-wavelength light can occur also at depths where ultraviolet wavelengths are absent from the underwater light field. Intraspecific colour polymorphisms regarding the colour of the tissue fluorescence. common among shallow water corals. were also observed for mesophotic species.

As temperatures increase. coral species and perhaps reefs may move into higher-latitude waters. increasing the chances of coral reef ecosystems surviving despite global warming. However. there is a growing need to understand the structure of these high-latitude coral communities in order to analyze their future dynamics and to detect any potential changes.   Methodology/Principal Findings The high-latitude (32.75°N) community surveyed was located at Tatsukushi. Shikoku Island. Japan. Coral cover was 60±2% and was composed of 73 scleractinian species partitioned into 7 functional groups. Although only 6% of species belonged to the ‘plate-like’ functional group. it was the major contributor to species coverage. This was explained by the dominance of plate-like species such as Acropora hyacinthus and A. solitaryensis. Comparison with historical data suggests a relatively recent colonization/development of A. hyacinthus in this region and a potential increase in coral diversity over the last century. Low coverage of macroalgae (2% of the benthic cover) contrasted with the low abundance of herbivorous fishes. but may be reasonably explained by the high density of sea urchins (12.9±3.3 individuals m−2).   Conclusions/Significance The structure and composition of this benthic community are relatively remarkable for a site where winter temperature can durably fall below the accepted limit for coral reef development.

Growth of these injured nubbins was examined in parallel. and compared to controls. Biochemical compositions of the holobiont and the zooxanthellae density were determined at the onset of the experiment. and the photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) of zooxanthellae was monitored during the experiment. Acropora muricata rapidly regenerated small lesions. but regeneration rates significantly differed between sites. At the sheltered site characterized by high temperatures. temperature variations. and irradiance levels. regeneration took 192 days on average. At the exposed site. characterized by steadier temperatures and lower irradiation. nubbins demonstrated fast lesion repair (81 days). slower growth. lower zooxanthellae density. chlorophyll a concentration and lipid content than at the former site. A trade-off between growth and regeneration rates was evident here. High growth rates seem to impair regeneration capacity. We show that environmental conditions conducive to high zooxanthellae densities in corals are related to fast skeletal growth but also to reduced lesion regeneration rates.

In addition to aerobic endolithic algae and Cyanobacteria. which are usually described in the various corals and form a green layer beneath coral tissues. the anaerobic photoautotrophic green sulfur bacteria (GSB) Prosthecochloris is dominant in the skeleton of Isopora palifera. However. due to inherent challenges in studying anaerobic microbes in coral skeleton. the reason for its niche preference and function are largely unknown. This study characterized a diverse and dynamic community of endolithic microbes shaped by the availability of light and oxygen. In addition. anaerobic bacteria isolated from the coral skeleton were cultured for the first time to experimentally clarify the role of these GSB. This characterization includes GSB’s abundance. genetic and genomic profiles. organelle structure. and specific metabolic functions and activity. Our results explain the advantages endolithic GSB receive from living in coral skeletons. the potential metabolic role of a clade of coral-associated Prosthecochloris (CAP) in the skeleton. and the nitrogen fixation ability of CAP. We suggest that the endolithic microbial community in coral skeletons is diverse and dynamic and that light and oxygen are two crucial factors for shaping it.

Twenty meter long line intercept transects were used to estimate the number of coral colonies infested by coral associates. The number of coral associates found on each coral colony on the transect was recorded and corals were identified to the most precise level. Massive and encrusting coral colonies were also measured in order to estimate the densities of infestation per square meter of coral colonies. To link the assemblages of coral associates observed with the characteristics of the benthic habitats. the coral cover was estimated using a 0.5 m point intercept transect method.Three hundred seventy-six colonies (45%) were infested by a total of 2.815 coral associates.

In this study. we tested whether fluorescent detection of coral recruits used in combinations of different DNA-barcoding markers (cytochrome oxidase I gene [COI]. open reading frame [ORF]. and nuclear Pax-C intron [PaxC]) could be useful for increasing the resolution of coral spat identification in ecological studies. One hundred and fifty settlement plates were emplaced at nine sites on the fringing reefs of Kenting National Park in southern Taiwan between April 2011 and September 2012. A total of 248 living coral spats and juveniles (with basal areas ranging from 0.21 to 134.57 mm2) were detected on the plates with the aid of fluorescent light and collected for molecular analyses. Using the COI DNA barcoding technique. 90.3% (224/248) of coral spats were successfully identified into six genera. including Acropora. Isopora. Montipora. Pocillopora. Porites. and Pavona.

Light and water movement. which covary with depth. are the main environmental drivers of morphological plasticity in this genus; however. assessing environmentally-induced plasticity may be confounded by the extent of interspecific variation in Pocillopora. We examine the morphology of 8 typed P. verrucosa specimens collected along a depth gradient ranging from 7 to 45 meters and comprising 3 sites throughout Ludao. Taiwan. We measured 36 morphological characters. 14 which are novel. in 3 regions on the corallum—the apex. branch and base—in order to quantify their relationship to site and depth. We found significant correlation between depth and 19 morphological characters. notably branch verruca area. branch verruca height. base verruca spacing. base spinule length. and branch corallite area. 60% of microstructural characters and 25% of macrostructural characters showed a correlative relation to depth. suggesting that depth acclimatization is manifested primarily at the microstructural level.

Using cDNA microarrays. we detected the induction of differential expression of genes by BPA. and compared the transcriptional changes caused by chemical exposure at different salinities. There were marked transcriptional changes induced by BPA between treatments. While 533 genes were induced by a factor of more than two when O. javanicus was exposed to BPA in seawater. only 215 genes were induced in freshwater. Among those genes. only 78 were shared and changed significantly their expression in both seawater and freshwater. Those genes were mainly involved in cellular processes and signaling pathway. We then categorized by functional group genes specifically induced by BPA exposure in seawater or freshwater.

However. few studies have described benthic communities along large latitudinal gradients. and patterns of variation are not fully understood. Taiwan. lying between 21.90°N and 25.30°N. is located at the center of the Philippine-Japan arc and lies at the northern margin of coral reef development. A wide range of habitats is distributed along this latitudinal gradient. from extensive fringing coral reefs at the southern coast to non-reefal communities at the north. In this study. we examined the structure of benthic communities around Taiwan. by comparing its assemblages in four regions. analyzing the effects of the latitudinal gradient. and highlighting regional characteristics. A total of 25 sites. 125 transects. and 2.625 photographs were used to analyze the benthic communities. Scleractinian corals present an obvious gradient of increasing diversity from north to south. whereas macro-algae diversity is higher on the north-eastern coast. At the country scale. Taiwanese coral communities were dominated by turf algae (49%). At the regional scale. we observed an important heterogeneity that may be caused by local disturbances and habitat degradation that smooths out regional differences.

A simple method to measure the sub-bleaching level of heat-light stress experienced by corals would greatly inform reef management practices by making it possible to assess the distribution of bleaching risks among individual reef sites. Gene expression analysis based on quantitative PCR (qPCR) can be used as a diagnostic tool to determine coral condition in situ. We evaluated the expression of 13 candidate genes during heat-light stress in a common Caribbean coral Porites astreoides. and observed strong and consistent changes in gene expression in two independent experiments. Furthermore. we found that the apparent return to baseline expression levels during a recovery phase was rapid. despite visible signs of colony bleaching. We show that the response to acute heat-light stress in P. astreoides can be monitored by measuring the difference in expression of only two genes: Hsp16 and actin. We demonstrate that this assay discriminates between corals sampled from two field sites experiencing different temperatures. We also show that the assay is applicable to an Indo-Pacific congener.

Studies have shown that. while some corals can cope with natural and anthropogenic stressors either through resistance mechanisms of coral hosts or through sustainable relationships with Symbiodinium clades or types. many coral species cannot. Here. we show that the corals present in a reef in southern Taiwan. and exposed to long-term elevated seawater temperatures due to the presence of a nuclear power plant outlet (NPP OL). are unique in terms of species and associated Symbiodinium types. At shallow depths (<3 m). eleven coral genera elsewhere in Kenting predominantly found with Symbiodinium types C1 and C3 (stress sensitive) were instead hosting Symbiodinium type D1a (stress tolerant) or a mixture of Symbiodinium type C1/C3/C21a/C15 and Symbiodinium type D1a. Of the 16 coral genera that dominate the local reefs. two that are apparently unable to associate with Symbiodinium type D1a are not present at NPP OL at depths of <3 m. Two other genera present at NPP OL and other locations host a specific type of Symbiodinium type C15. These data imply that coral assemblages may have the capacity to maintain their presence at the generic level against long-term disturbances such as elevated seawater temperatures by acclimatization through successful association with a stress-tolerant Symbiodinium over time. However. at the community level it comes at the cost of some coral genera being lost. suggesting that species unable to associate with a stress-tolerant Symbiodinium are likely to become extinct locally and unfavorable …,True,K2Df8j0AAAAJ:mS4qin7VKjkC,50,https://peerj.com/articles/327/,4683360434620369872,/scholar?cites=4683360434620369872,,https://peerj.com/articles/327/,0,0,0

As temperatures increase. coral species and perhaps reefs may move into higher-latitude waters. increasing the chances of coral reef ecosystems surviving despite global warming. However. there is a growing need to understand the structure of these high-latitude coral communities in order to analyze their future dynamics and to detect any potential changes.   Methodology/Principal Findings The high-latitude (32.75°N) community surveyed was located at Tatsukushi. Shikoku Island. Japan. Coral cover was 60±2% and was composed of 73 scleractinian species partitioned into 7 functional groups. Although only 6% of species belonged to the ‘plate-like’ functional group. it was the major contributor to species coverage. This was explained by the dominance of plate-like species such as Acropora hyacinthus and A. solitaryensis. Comparison with historical data suggests a relatively recent colonization/development of A. hyacinthus in this region and a potential increase in coral diversity over the last century. Low coverage of macroalgae (2% of the benthic cover) contrasted with the low abundance of herbivorous fishes. but may be reasonably explained by the high density of sea urchins (12.9±3.3 individuals m−2).   Conclusions/Significance The structure and composition of this benthic community are relatively remarkable for a site where winter temperature can durably fall below the accepted limit for coral reef development.

We also found 2 novel ITS2 types in S. hystrix and 1 novel ITS2 type of Symbiodinium in A. muricata. Some colonies of A. muricata and I. palifera were also associated with Symbiodinium A1. These results suggest that corals in the Chagos Archipelago host different assemblages of Symbiodinium types then their conspecifics from other locations in the Indian Ocean; and that future research will show whether these patterns in Symbiodinium genotypes may be due to local adaptation to specific …,True,K2Df8j0AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,24,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035836,16360615800759628162,/scholar?cites=16360615800759628162,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035836,0,0,0

In our previous study. the catch bowl coral Isopora palifera in Tantzei Bay (TZB). Nanwan. Kenting National Park (KNP). southern Taiwan was demonstrated to shuffle thermal-tolerant Symbiodinium D1a and thermal-sensitive Symbiodinium C3 in response to seasonal variations in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in 2000 and 2001. In this study. we reexamined the temporal dynamics of the Symbiodinium community of I. palifera in TZB in 2006-2009. In addition. spatial variations in Symbiodinium communities in I. palifera were also examined at 6 other sites of Nanwan. KNP in 2009. including a site located at a nuclear power plant outlet (NPP-OL) in southern Taiwan with a yearly mean SST 0.6-1.5 degrees C higher compared to the other sites. Phylotyping and DNA sequence analyses of Symbiodinium ribosomal 28S and ITS2 markers showed that I. palifera colonies at TZB continued to show seasonal shuffling. but shifted to thermal-sensitive type C3 dominant in 2006-2009. This differed from the symbiont community originally dominated by the thermal-tolerant Symbiodinium D1a in 2000 and 2001 after the 1998 mass-bleaching event. Significant differences in spatial variations of the symbiont community in Nanwan were detected with I. palifera colonies at the NPP-OL dominated by Symbiodinium D1a.

Corals grow across latitudes throughout the tropics and subtropics where environmental factors. including the average annual temperature and seasonal changes in water clarity and temperature. substantially vary. These environmental factors could lead to latitudinal variations in coral skeletal morphology. In this study. morphometric variations of the zebra coral Oulastrea crispata. a small coral species with black and white septa and a colony diameter usually< 10 cm. were investigated. Previous studies reported that O. crispata can survive in extreme environmental conditions. such as low temperatures and turbid water. One hundred colonies of O. crispata were collected from sites spanning Thailand to Japan. across tropical. subtropical. and temperate regions. Five micro-characters of corallites were measured and examined using univariate and multivariate analyses. All micro-characters measured significantly differed among latitudinal regions (nested ANOVA. p< 0.05). A canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) indicated that corallite diameter was the most important character contributing to variations in O. crispata among the 3 latitudinal regions. although a plot of the 1st and 2nd canonical variables showed that O. crispata from different latitudinal regions could not be fully separated.

Galaxea fascicularis populations on the Great Barrier Reef. Australia are composed of female colonies that produce red eggs and hermaphroditic colonies that produce sperm and white eggs. However. white eggs of hermaphroditic colonies are incapable of being fertilized or undergoing embryogenesis. In this study. the reproductive ecology and fertilization of G. fascicularis were examined in Chinwan Inner Bay. Penghu.

The extent of LD and the underlying haplotype structure for most candidate genes are still unavailable. We sampled 193 blacks (African-Americans) and 160 whites (European-Americans) and estimated the intragenic LD and the haplotype structure in four genes of the renin–angiotensin system. We genotyped 25 SNPs. with all but one of the pairs spaced between 1 and 20 kb. thus providing resolution at small scale. The pattern of LD within a gene was very heterogeneous. Using a robust method to define haplotype blocks. blocks of limited haplotype diversity were identified at each locus; between these blocks.

P. chrysospilos gills are the shortest. They are also bent and poorly developed for aquatic respiration. B. boddaerti gills consist of numerous long filaments and have the largest gill area of the three mudskippers.

This stage has been described for many other bivalves (see Bayne. 1965) and has been given the term ‘pediveliger’ by Carriker (1961). The pediveliger of Mytilus edulis is negatively phototactic and positively geotactic during velar swimming (Bayne. 1964b) and is usually confined to water layers close to the substratum. The foot may be protruded during swimming and if it comes into contact with the substratum it adheres and a period of crawling commences. During crawling the larva progresses on the ventral or posterior surface of the foot by means of ciliary and muscular action.

Townsville,This 2004 assessment of coral reefs in Southeast Asia (SEA) continues to show an overall decline in reef condition. but it does offer a glimmer of hope for the future. While the decline is regional. it is not re ected in the reef status in all countries. For example. Indonesia continues to show slight. but de nite improvements in reef condition from 1999. while preliminary data from Myanmar show that the reefs surveyed are relatively healthy. with most of the reefs surveyed having more than 75% live coral cover. The continued decline in reef in the Philippines. Vietnam. Thailand and Singapore is still a major concern. and although threats to reefs remain high and dominated by anthropogenic factors. more active management initiatives are being implemented throughout the region. which provides a sense of optimism for the coral reefs of SEA. Coral reef monitoring in SEA started more than 20 years ago. with the Philippines starting in the late 1970s. Monitoring in a core regional network of Indonesia. Malaysia. Philippines. Singapore and Thailand started in 1986 with funding from the ASEAN-Australia Living Coastal Resources (LCR) project. until 1994.

UK,4,809-818,,Following primary settlement and metamorphosis in Myiilus edulu (L.). the original larval stem glands (S1 and S2) increase enormously in size in the plantigrade. These glands. packed with mature secretion. discharge into a multi-partitioned posterior ducted system which is transitional in form between that of the larva and the adult. The gross enlargement of the stem glands appears to be an adaptation for frequent and copious production of byssus material during the bysso-pelagic and attachment phases of early post-larval life. This interpretation is supported by the fact that the volume ratio of the stem glands to the foot declines during subsequent growth of the young mussel and that other glands take over the function of byssus stem formation in mature mussels. Enhanced dispersal of post-larvae by bysso-pelagic drifting would account for the widespread and heavy fouling of offshore platforms by the almost …,True,8xENWGIAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,34,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-marine-biological-association-of-the-united-kingdom/article/enlarged-stem-glands-in-the-foot-of-the-postlarval-mussel-mytilus-edulis-adaptation-for-byssopelagic-migration/49BF4FFD6BBA98517A94BC7CEBBF9533,4191551399739679815,/scholar?cites=4191551399739679815,,,0,0,0

Until now. however. no equipment has been available that would allow measurement of the aquatic and terrestrial behaviour of an Antarctic penguin while it is commuting between the colony and the foraging grounds. A new motion detector. based on the measurement of acceleration. has been used here in addition to current methods of inferring behaviour using data loggers that monitor depth and speed. We present data on the time allocation of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) according to the different types of behaviours they display during their foraging trips: walking. tobogganing. standing on land. lying on land. resting at the water surface. porpoising and diving.

Recent reports suggesting increased levels of RNA editing in squids thus raise the question of the nature and effects of these events. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods. with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Editing is enriched in the nervous system. affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved. suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage.

The Japanese Association of Benthology,Since marine medusae and ctenophores harbor a wide variety of symbionts. from protists to fish. they constitute a unique community in pelagic ecosystems. Their symbiotic relationships broadly range from simple. facultative phoresy through parasitisim to complex mutualism. although it is sometimes difficult to define these associations strictly. Phoresy and/or commensalism are found in symbionts such as pycnogonids. decapod larvae and fish juveniles. Parasitism and/or parasitoidism are common in the following symbionts: dinoflagellates. ciliates. anthozoan larvae. pedunculate barnacles. anuropid isopods. and hyperiid amphipods. Mutualism is established between ctenophores and gymnamoebae. and between rhizostome medusae and endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. More information on symbiotic apostome ciliates. anthozoan larvae and hyperiid amphipods is definitely needed for further studies in consideration of their high prevalence and serious damage they can inflict on their hosts.

The thickness and density of the cuticular layer and of the tunic matrix differ from species to species. In some salps. the cuticular layer has numerous minute protrusions that are structurally identical to those found in several ascidians. Free mesenchymal cells (tunic cells) are distributed in the tunic. Whereas the number of tunic cells in the pyrosomas is similar to that in ascidians. there are many fewer tunic cells in doliolids and salps. These differences may be caused by the different functions of the tunic in each group.

We measured the body lengths of two gelatinous zooplankton. Thalia democratica and Dolioletta gegenbauri (Tunicata:Thaliacea) in 5% buffered formalin and seawater for up to 1053 days in order to evaluate the degree of shrinkage and establish regression formulae which would enable us to predict the live length of animals from the length data of preserved specimens. The gross pattern of shrinkage was similar in both species: the animal underwent severe shrinkage during the first several days and thereafter the degree of shrinkage gradually decreased. Body length of the 6-mm individuals of T. democratica became almost constant at approx. 93% of live length after 153-days preservation. Shrinkage of D. gegenbauri individuals was greater. and animals of the same body length shrank to 86% of live length during the 1500 days of preservation (estimated by the multiple regression model).

General predictions are that ocean acidification will be detrimental to reef growth and that 40 to more than 80 per cent of present-day reefs will decline during the next 50 years. Cold-water corals (CWCs) are thought to be strongly affected by changes in ocean acidification owing to their distribution in deep and/or cold waters. which naturally exhibit a CaCO3 saturation state lower than in shallow/warm waters. Calcification was measured in three species of Mediterranean cold-water scleractinian corals (Lophelia pertusa.

Radiocarbon ages of the macrofossils. which are interpreted in view of the complexities of the Antarctic marine radiocarbon reservoir and resolution of this dating technique. show a bimodal distribution. The data indicate that marine species inhabited coastal environments from at least 35000 to 20000 yr sp. during Marine Isotope Stage 3 when extensive iceberg calving created a'meltwater lid'over the Southern Ocean. The general absence of these marine species from 20000 to 8500 yr sp coincides with the subsequent advance of the Antarctic ice sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum. Synchronous re-appearance of the Antarctic marine fossils in emerged beaches around the continent. all of wh ich have Holocene marine-limit elevations an order of magnitude lower than those in the Arctic. reflect minimal isostatic rebound as relative sea-level rise decelerated. Antarctic coastal marine habitat changes around the continent also coincided with increasing sea-ice extent and outlet glacial advances during the mid-Holocene. in view of the diverse environmental changes that occurred around the Earth during this period. it is suggested that Antarctic coastal areas were responding to a mid-Holocene climatic shift associated with the hydrological cycle.

Whilst the measurement of mollusk δ18O to develop records of past climate change is a commonly used approach. it has proven challenging to develop reliable independent paleothermometers that can be used to deconvolve the contributions of temperature and fluid composition on molluscan oxygen isotope compositions. Here we investigate the temperature dependence of 13C–18O bond abundance. denoted by the measured parameter Δ47. in shell carbonates of bivalve mollusks and assess its potential to be a useful paleothermometer. We report measurements on cultured specimens spanning a range in water temperatures of 5 to 25 °C. and field collected specimens spanning a range of −1 to 29 °C. In addition we investigate the potential influence of carbonate saturation state on bivalve stable isotope compositions by making measurements on both calcitic and aragonitic specimens that have been cultured in seawater that is either supersaturated or undersaturated with respect to aragonite. We find a robust relationship between Δ47 and growth temperature. We also find that the slope of a linear regression through all the Δ47 data for bivalves plotted against seawater temperature is significantly shallower than previously published inorganic and biogenic carbonate calibration studies produced in our laboratory and go on to discuss the possible sources of this difference. We find that changing seawater saturation state does not have significant effect on the Δ47 of bivalve shell carbonate in two taxa that we examined. and we do not observe …,True,qfolpccAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC,103,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/4591/2013/,17135131555128321081,/scholar?cites=17135131555128321081,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/4591/2013/bg-10-4591-2013.pdf,0,0,0

Experimental evidence has shown that declining carbonate saturation inhibits the ability of marine organisms to build calcium carbonate skeletons. shells. and tests.

The antagonistic process – biologically induced carbonate dissolution via bioerosion – has largely been neglected. Unlike skeletal growth. we expect bioerosion by chemical means to be facilitated in a high-CO2 world. This study focuses on one of the most detrimental bioeroders. the sponge Cliona orientalis. which attacks and kills live corals on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. Experimental exposure to lowered and elevated levels of pCO2 confirms a significant enforcement of the sponges’ bioerosion capacity with increasing pCO2 under more acidic conditions. Considering the substantial contribution of sponges to carbonate bioerosion. this finding implies that tropical reef ecosystems are facing the combined effects of weakened coral calcification and accelerated bioerosion. resulting in critical pressure on the dynamic balance between biogenic carbonate build-up and degradation.,True,80umRfkAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C,198,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045124,10220207939289052514,/scholar?cites=10220207939289052514,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0045124,0,0,0

Underwater surveys of the inner‐shelf off Troms. northern Norway (70°N). reveal extended fixed algal build‐ups which are fringed by rhodolith belts affected by storms. Reefal growth by coralline algae under temperature and light regimes of extreme seasonality is made possible because of a decoupling of carbon fixation during summer and utilization of stored carbon during the period of winter darkness. Although the annual growth of the framework constructing algae is comparatively low. the annual carbonate production rate is similar to subtropical‐tropical counterparts because of a remarkably high standing stock. Early diagenetic alteration is restricted to intraparticle cementation processes which start in vivo.

According to stable isotope data. mainly sediments with an intermediate signal are preserved on the mound. while almost all fully glacial and interglacial sediments have either not been deposited or have been eroded later. The resulting hiatuses reduce the Late Pleistocene sediment accumulation at Propeller Mound to amounts smaller than the background sedimentation.The hiatuses most likely result due to the sweeping of the mound in turn with the re-establishment of vigour interglacial circulation patterns after sluggish current regimes during glacials.

In some cases. such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs. functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities. and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them. evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived. and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions. i.e.. a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences.

The analysis of these data requires highly accurate prediction of ncRNA boundaries and discrimination of promising candidate ncRNAs from weak predictions.

We have applied CLIP‐seq to chart the target landscape of two major bacterial post‐transcriptional regulators. Hfq and CsrA. in the model pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium. By detecting binding sites at single‐nucleotide resolution. we identify RNA preferences and structural constraints of Hfq and CsrA during their interactions with hundreds of cellular transcripts.

Since most splicing regulatory proteins bind to single-stranded RNA. the sequestration of RNA into double strands could prevent their binding. Here. we analyzed the secondary structure context of experimentally determined splicing enhancer and silencer motifs in their natural pre-mRNA context. We found that these splicing motifs are significantly more single-stranded than controls. These findings were validated by transfection experiments. where the effect of enhancer or silencer motifs on exon skipping was much more pronounced in single-stranded conformation. We also found that the structural context of predicted splicing motifs is under selection. suggesting a general importance of secondary structures on splicing and adding another level of evolutionary constraints on pre-mRNAs.

Chromosomes within the spindle established bipolar connections that supported oscillations and normal velocities of kinetochore movement between the poles. but these bipolar connections were defective because they failed to align the chromosomes into a metaphase …,True,XAYitDsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,338,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/139/6/1373/846,16381290176144339160,/scholar?cites=16381290176144339160,,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/139/6/1373/846,0,0,0

To provide a meaningful context for these studies. we took an unbiased approach of correlative electron microscopy of neurons migrating through a three-dimensional matrix. and characterized the cytoskeletal events that occur as migrating neurons initiate saltatory forward movements of the cell nucleus. The formation of a cytoplasmic dilation in the proximal leading process precedes nuclear translocation. Cell nuclei translocate into these dilations in saltatory movements.

Homologies bridging the great divide between deuterostomes and protostomes have served as the basis for current models of animal evolution and development. It is now appreciated that these two clades share a common developmental toolkit consisting of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. These patterning genes sometimes show common expression patterns and genetic interactions. suggesting the existence of similar or even conserved regulatory apparatus. However. previous studies have found no regulatory sequence conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes. Here we describe the first such enhancers. which we call bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores). Bicores show conservation of sequence and gene synteny. Sequence conservation of Bicores reflects conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites. We predict that Bicores act as response elements to signaling pathways. and we show that Bicores are developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. Although the small number of identified Bicores suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the protostome and deuterostome clades. additional Bicores may be revealed as our understanding of cis-regulatory logic and sample of bilaterian genomes continue to grow.,True,XAYitDsAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,63,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002852,18429216312441928782,/scholar?cites=18429216312441928782,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002852,0,0,0

During these movements. young neurons must attach and subsequently detach from their substrate to facilitate migration. but little is known about the mechanisms cells use to release their attachments. We show that the machinery for clathrin-mediated endocytosis is positioned to regulate the distribution of adhesion proteins in a subcellular region just proximal to the neuronal cell body. Inhibiting clathrin or dynamin function impedes the movement of migrating neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibiting dynamin function in vitro shifts the distribution of adhesion proteins to the rear of the cell.

We perform p300 ChIP-seq to identify over 6.600 candidate enhancers active in the dorsal cerebral wall of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mice. Over 95% of the peaks we measure are conserved to human. Eight of ten (80%) candidates tested using mouse transgenesis drive activity in restricted laminar patterns within the neocortex.

Immune cell clusters called milky spots are found throughout the omentum. It is however unknown if these immune cells contribute to ovarian cancer metastasis. Here we report that omental macrophages promote the migration and colonization of ovarian cancer cells to the omentum through the secretion of chemokine ligands that interact with chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1). We found that depletion of macrophages reduces ovarian cancer colonization of the omentum. RNA-sequencing of macrophages isolated from mouse omentum and mesenteric adipose tissue revealed a specific enrichment of chemokine ligand CCL6 in omental macrophages.

Homologies bridging the great divide between deuterostomes and protostomes have served as the basis for current models of animal evolution and development. It is now appreciated that these two clades share a common developmental toolkit consisting of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. These patterning genes sometimes show common expression patterns and genetic interactions. suggesting the existence of similar or even conserved regulatory apparatus. However. previous studies have found no regulatory sequence conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes. Here we describe the first such enhancers. which we call bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores). Bicores show conservation of sequence and gene synteny. Sequence conservation of Bicores reflects conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites. We predict that Bicores act as response elements to signaling pathways. and we show that Bicores are developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. Although the small number of identified Bicores suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the protostome and deuterostome clades. additional Bicores may be revealed as our understanding of cis-regulatory logic and sample of bilaterian genomes continue to grow.,True,W4FPpmsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,63,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002852,18429216312441928782,/scholar?cites=18429216312441928782,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002852,0,0,0

The specific regulatory interactions between these factors. many key upstream and downstream genes. and the enhancers that mediate all these interactions remain mostly uncharacterized. We perform p300 ChIP-seq to identify over 6.600 candidate enhancers active in the dorsal cerebral wall of embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mice. Over 95% of the peaks we measure are conserved to human. Eight of ten (80%) candidates tested using mouse transgenesis drive activity in restricted laminar patterns within the neocortex. GREAT based computational analysis reveals highly significant correlation with genes expressed at E14.5 in key areas for neocortex development. and allows the grouping of enhancers by known biological functions and pathways for further studies. We find that multiple genes are flanked by dozens of candidate enhancers each. including well-known key neocortical genes as well as suspected and novel genes. Nearly a quarter of our candidate enhancers are conserved well beyond mammals. Human and zebrafish regions orthologous to our candidate enhancers are shown to most often function in other aspects of central nervous system development.

To address this question. we collect ancestral transcription factor binding sites disrupted by an individual’s variants and then look for their most significant congregation next to a group of functionally related genes. Strikingly. when the method is applied to five different full human genomes. the top enriched function for each is invariably reflective of their very different medical histories. For example. our method implicates “abnormal cardiac output” for a patient with a longstanding family history of heart disease. “decreased circulating sodium level” for an individual with hypertension. and other biologically appealing links for medical histories spanning narcolepsy to axonal neuropathy. Our results suggest that erosion of gene regulation by mutation load significantly contributes to observed heritable phenotypes that manifest in the medical history.

A portion of this risk is heritable. however current risk stratification tools (CHA2DS2VASc) do not include family history or genetic risk. Objectives To construct and test a PRS to predict ischemic stroke in patients with AF. both independently and integrated with clinical risk factors.  Methods Using data from the largest available GWAS in Europeans. we combined over half a million genetic variants to construct a PRS to predict ischemic stroke in patients with AF. We externally validated this PRS in independent data from the UK Biobank (UK Biobank). both independently and integrated with clinical risk factors. Results The integrated PRS and clinical risk factors risk tool had the greatest predictive ability. Compared with the currently recommended risk tool (CHA2DS2VASc). the integrated tool significantly improved net reclassification (NRI: 2.3% (95%CI: 1.3% to 3.0%)). and fit (χ2 P =0.002). Using this improved tool. >115.000 people with AF would have improved risk classification in the US. Independently. PRS was a significant predictor of ischemic stroke in patients with AF prospectively (Hazard Ratio: 1.13 per 1 SD (95%CI: 1.06 to 1.23))). Lastly. polygenic risk scores were uncorrelated with clinical risk factors (Pearsons correlation coefficient: -0.018).

We identify underspecification as a key reason for these failures. An ML pipeline is underspecified when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines. such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance. but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice. and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines. using examples from computer vision. medical imaging. natural language processing. clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records. and medical genomics.

In the current work we describe and assess a deep learning approach which trains a deep neural network (DNN) to predict database-derived labels directly from query sequences.We demonstrate this DNN performs at state-of-the-art or above levels on a difficult. practically important problem: predicting species-of-origin from short reads of 16S ribosomal DNA. When trained on 16S sequences of over 13.000 distinct species. our DNN achieves read-level species classification accuracy within 2.0% of perfect memorization of training data. and produces more accurate genus-level assignments for reads from held-out species than k-mer. alignment. and taxonomic binning baselines. Moreover. our models exhibit greater robustness than these existing approaches to increasing noise in the query sequences. Finally. we show that these DNNs perform well on experimental 16S mock community dataset. Overall. our results constitute a first step towards our long-term goal of developing a general-purpose deep learning approach to predicting meaningful labels from short biological sequences.TensorFlow training code is available through GitHub (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research).

Methods: We performed the first genome-wide association study of penetrance and age-at-onset of Parkinson9s disease in LRRK2 mutation carriers (776 cases and 1.103 non-cases at their last evaluation). Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models were used to identify modifiers of penetrance and age-at-onset of LRRK2 mutations. respectively. We also investigated whether a polygenic risk score derived from a published genome-wide association study of Parkinson9s disease was able to explain variability in penetrance and age-at-onset in LRRK2 mutation carriers.   Results: A variant located in the intronic region of CORO1C on chromosome 12 (rs77395454; P-value=2.5E-08. beta=1.27. SE=0.23. risk allele: C) met genome-wide significance for the penetrance model. A region on chromosome 3. within a previously reported linkage peak for Parkinson9s disease susceptibility. showed suggestive associations in both models (penetrance top variant: P-value=1.1E-07; age-at-onset top variant: P-value=9.3E-07). A polygenic risk score derived from publicly available Parkinson9s disease summary statistics was a significant predictor of penetrance. but not of age-at-onset.   Interpretation: This study suggests that variants within or near CORO1C may modify the penetrance of LRRK2 mutations.

PD symptoms include resting tremor. muscular rigidity. bradykinesia. and postural instability. The pathology of PD is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and is usually accompanied by Lewy bodies. abnormal protein aggregates comprised mainly of alpha synuclein. ubiquitin. and tau proteins. Over 20 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have been associated with PD susceptibility1. 2. Of particular interest is the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. with a population frequency in PD patients ranging from under 1% in Asians to 20% in Ashkenazi Jews and 40% in North African Arabs3. G2019S is present in both familial autosomal dominant and sporadic PD and has an estimated penetrance of 28% at age 59 and 74% at age 79 (ref. 4). Higher penetrance estimates in familial cases suggest the presence of additional genetic or environmental penetrance modifiers.Here we present the results of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 unrelated European individuals concordant for both the presence of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation and the absence of the PD-associated GBA 84GG.

1112276,Computational analysis of the mammalian cis-regulatory landscape,2011,Cory Yuen Fu McLean,,,,,,Improvements in DNA sequencing technologies have made it possible to determine the genetic makeup of many organisms. Computational analyses of the massive amounts of sequence data available have produced many insights into evolutionary and developmental biology. For example. comparison of the full genome sequences of human and mouse discovered that the majority of functional sequence in the human genome does not code for protein. Much of this functional non-coding sequence appears to act in a regulatory role. dictating the precise tissues and developmental time points in which each protein should be produced. This dissertation describes three major contributions to the computational analysis of regulatory elements. First. I describe the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT). a novel statistical method and associated web-based tool developed to infer the biological functions of regulatory elements based on the functions of their putative target genes. I demonstrate its marked improvement over current methods at interpreting functional enrichment signals for a variety of regulatory element types.Next. I discuss a computational methodology developed to identify medium-to large-scale (10-100.000 nucleotide) genomic deletions from whole genome sequences of multiple mammals. Using this methodology. I quantify the dispensability of highly conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) as their likelihood to be deleted in a subset of species.

1112288,Live imaging at the onset of cortical neurogenesis reveals differential appearance of the neuronal phenotype in apical versus basal progenitor progeny,2008,Alessio Attardo and Federico Calegari and Wulf Haubensak and Michaela Wilsch-Bräuninger and Wieland B Huttner,3,PloS one,6,e2388,Public Library of Science,The neurons of the mammalian brain are generated by progenitors dividing either at the apical surface of the ventricular zone (neuroepithelial and radial glial cells. collectively referred to as apical progenitors) or at its basal side (basal progenitors. also called intermediate progenitors). For apical progenitors. the orientation of the cleavage plane relative to their apical-basal axis is thought to be of critical importance for the fate of the daughter cells. For basal progenitors. the relationship between cell polarity. cleavage plane orientation and the fate of daughter cells is unknown. Here. we have investigated these issues at the very onset of cortical neurogenesis. To directly observe the generation of neurons from apical and basal progenitors. we established a novel transgenic mouse line in which membrane GFP is expressed from the beta-III-tubulin promoter. an early pan-neuronal marker. and crossed this line with a previously described knock-in line in which nuclear GFP is expressed from the Tis21 promoter. a pan-neurogenic progenitor marker. Mitotic Tis21-positive basal progenitors nearly always divided symmetrically. generating two neurons. but. in contrast to symmetrically dividing apical progenitors. lacked apical-basal polarity and showed a nearly randomized cleavage plane orientation. Moreover. the appearance of beta-III-tubulin–driven GFP fluorescence in basal progenitor-derived neurons. in contrast to that in apical progenitor-derived neurons. was so rapid that it suggested the initiation of the neuronal phenotype already in the progenitor.

Here we report the generation and characterization of mice lacking chromogranin B (CgB-ko). which were viable and fertile. Unlike neuroendocrine tissues. pancreatic islets of these animals lacked compensatory changes in other granins and were therefore analyzed in detail. Stimulated secretion of insulin. glucagon and somatostatin was reduced in CgB-ko islets. in parallel with somewhat impaired glucose clearance and reduced insulin release. but normal insulin sensitivity in vivo. CgB-ko islets lacked specifically the rapid initial phase of stimulated secretion. had elevated basal insulin release. and stored and released twice as much proinsulin as wildtype (wt) islets. Stimulated release of glucagon and somatostatin was reduced as well. Surprisingly. biogenesis. morphology and function of insulin granules were normal. and no differences were found with regard to β-cell stimulus-secretion coupling. We conclude that CgB is not required for normal insulin granule biogenesis or maintenance in vivo. but is essential for adequate secretion of islet hormones.

In population-genetic clustering algorithms. such as BAPS. STRUCTURE and TESS. individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters. often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result. replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients. even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) ‘label switching’ of clusters across replicates. caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled. and (2) ‘genuine multimodality.’ truly distinct solutions across replicates.

A serious problem with association mapping is that population structure can lead to spurious associations between a candidate marker and a phenotype. One common solution has been to abandon case-control studies in favor of family-based tests of association. such as the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT). but this comes at a considerable cost in the need to collect DNA from close relatives of affected individuals.

Recent advances in genealogical modeling suggest that resolving close species relationships is not quite as simple as applying more data to the problem.

Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed. the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed. sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly. within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide. although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles. at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions. attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions.

Surprisingly. assuming that genetic lineages follow a coalescent model of within-species evolution. we find that for any species tree topology with five or more species. there exist branch lengths for which gene tree discordance is so common that the most likely gene tree topology to evolve along the branches of a species tree differs from the species phylogeny. This counterintuitive result implies that in combining data on multiple loci. the straightforward procedure of using the most frequently observed gene tree topology as an estimate of the species tree topology can be asymptotically guaranteed to produce an incorrect estimate.

It has been argued. however. that the degree of clustering is diminished by use of samples with greater uniformity in geographic distribution. and that the clusters we identified were a consequence of uneven sampling along genetic clines. Expanding our earlier dataset from 377 to 993 markers. we systematically examine the influence of several study design variables—sample size. number of loci. number of clusters. assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across populations. and the geographic dispersion of the sample—on the “clusteredness” of individuals. With all other variables held constant. geographic dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree of clustering. Examination of the relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the sampling scheme. but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of geographic barriers. in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on the same side. Thus. analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample. individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe. with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the …,True,4ah5oHUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,581,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070,5633506930690034752,/scholar?cites=5633506930690034752,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070,0,0,0

A sense of concordance for gene tree and species tree topologies is clarified. such that if the “collapsed gene tree” produced by a gene tree has the same topology as the species tree. the gene tree is said to be topologically concordant with the species tree. The term speciodendric is introduced to refer to genes whose trees are topologically concordant with species trees. For a given three-species topology. probabilities of each of the three possible collapsed gene tree topologies are given. as are probabilities of monophyletic concordance and concordance in the sense of N. Takahata (1989). Genetics 122. 957–966.

In population-genetic clustering algorithms. such as BAPS. STRUCTURE and TESS. individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a set of clusters. often using unsupervised approaches that involve stochastic simulation. As a result. replicate cluster analyses of the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated cluster membership coefficients. even though the same initial conditions were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two main sources: (1) ‘label switching’ of clusters across replicates. caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised analysis are labeled. and (2) ‘genuine multimodality.’ truly distinct solutions across replicates.

Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed. the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed. sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly. within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide. although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles. at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions. attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions.

The longitudinal gradient appears to result from the plant having spread in Europe from the east ∼10.000 years ago. with a rate of westward spread of ∼0.9 km/year.

It has been suggested that FST depends on the allele frequencies at a locus. as it exhibits a variety of peculiar properties related to genetic diversity: higher values for biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than for multiallelic microsatellites. low values among high-diversity populations viewed as substantially distinct. and low values for populations that differ primarily in their profiles of rare alleles.

Additionally. we find evidence for many novel candidates. the strongest of which is FANK1. an imprinted gene that suppresses apoptosis. is expressed during meiosis in males. and displays marginal signs of segregation distortion.

Previous studies have shown that analysis of concatenated data using maximum likelihood (ML) can produce misleading results when loci have differing gene tree topologies due to incomplete lineage sorting. Here. we develop a polynomial time method that utilizes the modified mincut supertree algorithm to construct an estimated species tree from inferred rooted triples of concatenated alignments. We term this method SuperMatrix Rooted Triple (SMRT) and use the notation SMRT-ML when rooted triples are inferred by ML. We use simulations to investigate the performance of SMRT-ML under Jukes–Cantor and general time-reversible substitution models for four- and five-taxon species trees and also apply the method to an empirical data set of yeast genes.

Species trees represent populations of individuals—each with many genes—splitting into new populations or species. The coalescent process. which models ancestry of gene copies within populations. is often used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed species tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for phylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching process over time. all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this setting.

Recent work on a 2-state symmetric model of character change showed that for 4 taxa. such a mixture model has nonidentifiable parameters. and thus. it is theoretically impossible to determine the two tree topologies from any amount of data under such circumstances. Here. the question of identifiability is investigated for two-tree mixtures of the 4-state group-based models. which are more relevant to DNA sequence data.

UK: Oxford University Press,Under many common models of sequence evolution along trees. frequencies of base patterns in extant taxa satisfy certain polynomial relationships known as ‘phylogenetic invariants’. Though introduced in 1987 for phylogenetic inference. invariants remained difficult to construct. and the inefficiency of simple inference schemes based on known linear ones was discouraging. Recently there has been much progress in producing phylogenetic invariants. and in understanding their structure. Potentially useful connections between specific topological features in a tree (vertices and nodes) and specific invariants have emerged. We introduce some of the mathematical ideas underlying current understanding of invariants. with an emphasis on a geometric viewpoint and rank computations.

Each of the classes in some unknown partition of the characters may evolve by different processes. or even along different trees. Such models are of increasing interest for data analysis. as they can capture the variety of evolutionary processes that may be occurring across long sequences of DNA or proteins. The fundamental question of whether parameters of such a model are identifiable is difficult to address. due to the complexity of the parameterization. Identifiability is. however. essential to their use for statistical inference.We analyze mixture models on large trees. with many mixture components. showing that both numerical and tree parameters are indeed identifiable in these models when all trees are the same.

For statistical use it is important to know if the model is identifiable; can both the tree topology and the numerical parameters be determined from a joint distribution describing sequences only at the leaves of the tree? We establish that for generic parameters both the tree and all numerical parameter values can be recovered. up to clearly understood issues of ‘label swapping’.

For example. factors such as incomplete lineage sorting. horizontal gene transfer. and chromosomal inversion are expected to result in changes in the underlying gene trees along a chromosome. while changes in selective pressure and mutational rates for different genomic regions may lead to shifts in the underlying mutational process. We propose the split score as a general method for quantifying support for a particular phylogenetic relationship within a genomic data set.

Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are long stretches of consecutive homozygous genotypes probably reflecting segments shared identically by descent as the result of processes such as consanguinity. population size reduction. and natural selection. The relationship between ROH and patterns of predicted deleterious variation can provide insight into the way in which these processes contribute to the maintenance of deleterious variants. Here. we use exome sequencing to examine ROH in relation to the distribution of deleterious variation in 27 individuals of varying levels of apparent inbreeding from 6 human populations.

To explain this phenomenon. we have investigated the size distribution of private alleles in a coalescent model of two populations. assuming the symmetric stepwise mutation model as the mode of microsatellite mutation.

Such demographic processes can affect genome-wide levels of genetic diversity. Additionally. genetic variation in functional regions of the genome can be altered by natural selection. which drives adaptive mutations to higher frequencies or purges deleterious ones. Such selective processes affect not only the sites directly under selection but also nearby neutral variation through genetic linkage via processes referred to as genetic hitchhiking in the context of positive selection and background selection (BGS) in the context of purifying selection. While there is extensive literature examining the consequences of selection at linked sites at demographic equilibrium. less is known about how non-equilibrium demographic processes influence the effects of hitchhiking and BGS. Utilizing a global sample of human whole-genome sequences from the Thousand Genomes Project and extensive simulations. we investigate how non-equilibrium demographic processes magnify and dampen the consequences of selection at linked sites across the human genome. When binning the genome by inferred strength of BGS. we observe that. compared to Africans. non-African populations have experienced larger proportional decreases in neutral genetic diversity in strong BGS regions.

Over the past decade. they have gained importance for understanding evolutionary history and the genetic basis of complex diseases and traits. However. methods to infer ROA in dense genotype data have not evolved in step with advances in genome technology that now enable us to rapidly create large high-resolution genotype datasets. limiting our ability to investigate their constituent ROA patterns. We report a weighted likelihood approach for inferring ROA in dense genotype data that accounts for autocorrelation among genotyped positions and the possibilities of unobserved mutation and recombination events. and variability in the confidence of individual genotype calls in whole genome sequence (WGS) data. Forward-time genetic simulations under two demographic scenarios that reflect situations where inbreeding and its effect on fitness are of interest suggest this approach is better powered than existing state-of-the-art methods to infer ROA at marker densities consistent with WGS and popular microarray genotyping platforms used in human and non-human studies.

For aerobic life. the low atmospheric oxygen content of high altitude living presents a special challenge and a strong selection pressure. Searching for evidence of adaptation to high altitude. we compare the whole genomes of 23 wild rhesus macaques captured at high altitude (mean altitude > 4000m above sea level) to 22 wild rhesus macaques captured at low altitude (mean altitude < 500m above sea level). To capture the genomic patterns of a positive selective sweep. we develop XP-nSL. a haplotype-based genomic scan for differential local adaptation with power to detect ongoing and recently completed hard and soft sweeps. We find evidence of local adaptation in the high-altitude population at or near 303 known genes and several unannotated regions. We find the strongest signal for adaptation at EGLN1. a classic target for convergent evolution in several species living in low oxygen environments. Furthermore. many of the 303 genes are involved in processes related to hypoxia. regulation of ROS. DNA damage repair. synaptic signaling. and metabolism. These results suggest that. beyond adapting via a beneficial mutation in one single gene. adaptation to high altitude in rhesus macaques is polygenic and spread across numerous important biological systems.,True,jtdm2-0AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.104380v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/05/22/2020.05.19.104380.full.pdf,0,0,0

1112434,Comparing Evolutionary Rates Using An Exact Test for 2x2 Tables with Continuous Cell Entries,2014,A Morgan Thompson and M Cyrus Maher and Lawrence H Uricchio and Zachary A Szpiech and Ryan D Hernandez,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1404.2992,,,,Assessing the statistical significance of an observed 2x2 contingency table can easily be accomplished using Fisher's exact test (FET). However. if the cell entries are continuous or represent values inferred from a continuous parametric model. then FET cannot be applied. Such tables arise frequently in areas of biostatistical research including population genetics and evolutionary genomics. where cell entries are estimated by computational methods and result in cell entries drawn from the non-negative real line R+. Simply rounding cell entries to conform to the assumptions of FET is an ill-suited approach that we show creates problems related to both type-I and type-II errors. Pearson's chi^ 2 test for independence. while technically applicable. is not often effective for these tables. as the test has several limiting assumptions that make application of this method inadvisable in many common instances (particularly with small cell entries). Here we develop a novel method for tables with continuous entries. which we term continuous Fisher's Exact Test (cFET). Through simulations. we show that cFET has a close-to-uniform distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis of independence. and more power when applied to tables where the null hypothesis is false (compared to FET applied to rounded cell entries). We apply cFET to an example from comparative genomics to confirm an overall increased evolutionary rate among primates compared to rodents. and identify several genes that show particularly elevated evolutionary rates in primates. Some of these genes exhibit signatures of continued positive selection along the human lineage since our …,True,jtdm2-0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2992,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2992,0,0,0

Population Divergence. and the Accumulation of Deleterious Alleles: Insights from Private Genetic Variation and Whole-exome Sequencing.,2012,Zachary A Szpiech,,,,,,Private genetic variants---genetic variants found only in a single population in a sample---have been highly informative for studies of evolutionary history.  This dissertation uses theoretical modeling and empirical analysis of private genetic variation to understand human demography.  I derive theory for analyzing the size distribution of private microsatellite alleles and develop a rarefaction approach to analyze private-allele sharing.  Furthermore. I investigate genome-wide patterns of deleterious variants. which are often private.  Through the analysis of whole-exome sequences. I describe how potentially deleterious coding variants accumulate and concentrate in inbred genomes.  First. I introduce the concept of generalized private alleles and develop a method to count them while correcting for differences in the number of individuals sampled. I use this method to analyze worldwide human populations and observe an excess of alleles shared between Africa and Oceania.  The results support the theory of a coastal migration out of Africa into Oceania separate from the migrations responsible for the majority of the ancestry of the modern populations of Asia.  Next. I explore how population-genetic parameters affect the size distribution of private microsatellite alleles under a two-population coalescent model. assuming the symmetric stepwise mutation model.  Using this framework. I theoretically predict that private microsatellites occur in the tails of the allele size distribution more frequently as genetic differentiation between populations increases.  Empirically observing this phenomenon in human populations.

One of the common approaches to analyzing data from multiple genes is concatenation of the individual gene data to form a single supergene to which traditional phylogenetic inference procedures—e.g.. maximum parsimony (MP) or maximum likelihood (ML)—are applied. Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that concatenation of sequences from multiple genes prior to phylogenetic analysis often results in inference of a single. well-supported phylogeny. Theoretical work. however. has shown that the coalescent can produce substantial variation in single-gene histories.

Although the distinction between gene trees and species trees has come to the fore of phylogenetics. only recently have methods been developed that explicitly estimate species trees. Of the several factors that can cause gene tree heterogeneity and discordance with the species tree. deep coalescence due to random genetic drift in branches of the species tree has been modeled most thoroughly. Bayesian approaches to estimating species trees utilizes two likelihood functions. one of which has been widely used in traditional phylogenetics and involves the model of nucleotide substitution. and the second of which is less familiar to phylogeneticists and involves the probability distribution of gene trees given a species tree.

Methodology/Principal Findings We measured susceptibility to PZQ of isolates of Schistosoma mansoni obtained from patients from Kisumu. Kenya continuously exposed to infection as a consequence of their occupations as car washers or sand harvesters. We used a) an in vitro assay with miracidia. b) an in vivo assay targeting adult worms in mice and c) an in vitro assay targeting adult schistosomes perfused from mice. In the miracidia assay. in which miracidia from human patients were exposed to PZQ in vitro. reduced susceptibility was associated with previous treatment of the patient with PZQ. One isolate (“KCW”) that was less susceptible to PZQ and had been derived from a patient who had never fully cured despite multiple treatments was studied further. In an in vivo assay of adult worms. the KCW isolate was significantly less susceptible to PZQ than two other isolates from natural infections in Kenya and two lab-reared strains of S. mansoni. The in vitro adult assay. based on measuring length changes of adults following exposure to and recovery from PZQ. confirmed that the KCW isolate was less susceptible to PZQ than the other isolates tested. A sub-isolate of KCW maintained separately and tested after three years was susceptible to PZQ. indicative that the trait of reduced sensitivity could be lost if selection was not maintained.

Among the processes known to produce discord between single-gene phylogenies. two of the best studied in a phylogenetic context are hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. Much recent attention has focused on the development of methods for estimating species phylogenies in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. but phylogenetic models that allow for hybridization have been more limited.

Much recent work has centered around the recognition that substantial incongruence in single-gene phylogenies necessitates the development of statistical procedures to estimate species phylogenies that appropriately model the process of evolution at the level of the individual genes. One process that gives rise to variation in the histories of individual genes is incomplete lineage sorting. which is commonly modeled by the coalescent. and thus much current work is focused on proper estimation of species phylogenies under the coalescent model.

Rather than equating a gene tree with the phylogenetic history. the new approaches explicitly consider the relationships between gene trees and the underlying history of species divergence. providing direct estimates of species trees (Fig. 1).

However. phylogenetic relationships among genera are under debate. and recent molecular studies with incomplete taxon-sampling revealed discordant gene trees. To solve the evolutionary history of colobine genera and to determine causes for possible gene tree incongruences. we combined presence/absence analysis of mobile elements with autosomal. X chromosomal. Y chromosomal and mitochondrial sequence data from all recognized colobine genera. Gene tree topologies and divergence age estimates derived from different markers were similar. but differed in placing Piliocolobus/Procolobus and langur genera among colobines. Although insufficient data. homoplasy and incomplete lineage sorting might all have contributed to the discordance among gene trees. hybridization is favored as the main cause of the observed discordance. We propose that African colobines are paraphyletic. but might later have experienced female introgression from Piliocolobus/Procolobus into Colobus. In the late Miocene. colobines invaded Eurasia and diversified into several lineages. Among Asian colobines. Semnopithecus diverged first. indicating langur paraphyly.

To overcome this difficulty. we propose a stochastic search strategy for estimation of the ML tree that is based on a simulated annealing algorithm. The algorithm works by moving through tree space by way of a “local rearrangement” strategy so that topologies that improve the likelihood are always accepted. whereas those that decrease the likelihood are accepted with a probability that is related to the proportionate decrease in likelihood. Besides greatly reducing the time required to estimate the ML tree. the stochastic search strategy is less likely to become trapped in local optima than are existing algorithms for ML tree …,True,NXfqqyMAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,103,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/50/1/7/1611473,15554675746382965279,/scholar?cites=15554675746382965279,,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-pdf/50/1/7/19502565/50-1-7.pdf,0,0,0

1112456,Estimating hybridization in the presence of coalescence using phylogenetic intraspecific sampling,2011,David Gerard and H Lisle Gibbs and Laura Kubatko,11,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,1-12,BioMed Central,A well-known characteristic of multi-locus data is that each locus has its own phylogenetic history which may differ substantially from the overall phylogenetic history of the species. Although the possibility that this arises through incomplete lineage sorting is often incorporated in models for the species-level phylogeny. it is much less common for hybridization to also be formally included in such models. We have modified the evolutionary model of Meng and Kubatko (2009) to incorporate intraspecific sampling of multiple individuals for estimation of speciation times and times of hybridization events for testing for hybridization in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. We have also utilized a more efficient algorithm for obtaining our estimates. Using simulations. we demonstrate that our approach performs well under conditions motivated by an empirical data set for Sistrurus rattlesnakes where putative hybridization has occurred. We further demonstrate that the method is able to accurately detect the signature of hybridization in the data. while this signal may be obscured when other species-tree inference methods that ignore hybridization are used. Our approach is shown to be powerful in detecting hybridization when it is present. When applied to the Sistrurus data. we find no evidence of hybridization; instead. it appears that putative hybrid snakes in Missouri are most likely pure S. catenatus tergeminus in origin. which has significant conservation implications.,True,NXfqqyMAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,58,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-11-291,11015118812510342193,/scholar?cites=11015118812510342193,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-11-291,0,0,0

For multilocus datasets. it is difficult to achieve complete coverage of all sampled loci across all sample specimens. a problem that also arises when combining incompletely overlapping datasets. Here we examine how missing data affects the accuracy of species tree reconstruction. In our study. 10- and 100-locus sequence datasets were simulated under the coalescent model from shallow and deep speciation histories. and species trees were estimated using the maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks (with STEM and *BEAST. respectively).

Production of cassava is significantly hampered by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD). caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). The disease is suppressing cassava yields in eastern Africa at an alarming rate. Previous studies have documented that CBSV is more devastating than UCBSV because it more readily infects both susceptible and tolerant cassava cultivars. resulting in greater yield losses. Using whole genome sequences from NGS data. we produced the first coalescent-based species tree estimate for CBSV and UCBSV. This species framework led to the finding that CBSV has a faster rate of evolution when compared with UCBSV.

Many methods for hybridization detection use simple site pattern frequencies from observed genomic data and compare them to null models that predict an absence of gene flow. The theory underlying the detection of hybridization using these site pattern probabilities exploits the relationship between the coalescent process for gene trees within population trees and the process of mutation along the branches of the gene trees. For certain models. site patterns are predicted to occur in equal frequency (i.e.. their difference is 0). producing a set of functions called phylogenetic invariants.

However. as the central framework in evolutionary (and some ecological) study. the enormous impact of this single endeavor—phylogenetic estimation—is unquestionable. How. and whether. species relationships are accurately inferred are. consequently. issues of broad and far-reaching concern. The goal of this book is to provide an overview of several recently developed methods for phylogenetic estimation that focus explicitly on the challenges and strengths inherent in the analysis of multilocus data while giving practical guidelines on implementing these approaches. Decreased sequencing costs and increased access to primer sets enhance the relative ease of data collection. providing unprecedented amounts of multilocus sequence for molecular phylogenetic analysis across all of bio diversity (eg. Goldman and Yang 2008; Hughes et al. 2006; Wiens et al. 2008). Detailed suggestions and discussion throughout the chapters focus on both conceptual and methodological issues. addressing such topics as how results should be interpreted and how to recognize the signs of a problem with an analysis. The combination of theoretical and empirical studies contained herein serves to identify both the strengths and the limitations of these new methods under not only idealized situations with simulated data but also with empirical sequence data.

Species trees represent populations of individuals—each with many genes—splitting into new populations or species. The coalescent process. which models ancestry of gene copies within populations. is often used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed species tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for phylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching process over time. all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this setting.

The image of such a map---the collection of joint distributions for all parameter choices---forms the model space.  Since the parameterization is polynomial. the Zariski closure of the model space is an algebraic variety which is typically much larger than the model space but amenable to study with algebraic methods.  Of practical interest. however. is not the full variety but the subset formed by the model space.  Here we develop complete semialgebraic descriptions of the model space arising from the -state general Markov model on a tree. with slightly restricted parameters.

While a greedy consensus algorithm. which consecutively accepts the most probable clades compatible with previously accepted clades. can be used for this second stage. this method is known to be statistically inconsistent under the multispecies coalescent model.

Maddison proposed minimizing deep coalescences. or MDC. as an optimization criterion for inferring the species tree from a set of incongruent gene trees. assuming the incongruence is exclusively due to lineage sorting. In a subsequent paper. Maddison and Knowles provided and implemented a search heuristic for optimizing the MDC criterion. given a set of gene trees. However. the heuristic is not guaranteed to compute optimal solutions. and its hill-climbing search makes it slow in practice. In this paper. we provide two exact solutions to the problem of inferring the species tree from a set of gene trees under the MDC criterion. In other words. our solutions are guaranteed to find the tree that minimizes the total number of deep coalescences from a set of gene trees. One solution is based on a novel integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. and another is based on a simple dynamic programming (DP) approach. Powerful ILP solvers. such as CPLEX. make the first solution appealing. particularly for very large-scale instances of the problem. whereas the DP-based solution eliminates dependence on proprietary tools. and its simplicity makes it easy to integrate with other genomic events that may cause gene tree incongruence. Using the exact solutions. we analyze a data set of 106 loci from eight yeast species. a data set of 268 loci from eight Apicomplexan species. and several simulated data sets.

1112496,The probability of a gene tree topology within a phylogenetic network with applications to hybridization detection,2012,Yun Yu and James H Degnan and Luay Nakhleh,8,PLoS Genet,4,e1002660,Public Library of Science,Gene tree topologies have proven a powerful data source for various tasks. including species tree inference and species delimitation. Consequently. methods for computing probabilities of gene trees within species trees have been developed and widely used in probabilistic inference frameworks. All these methods assume an underlying multispecies coalescent model. However. when reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization occur. these methods are inadequate. as they do not account for such events. Methods that account for both hybridization and deep coalescence in computing the probability of a gene tree topology currently exist for very limited cases. However. no such methods exist for general cases. owing primarily to the fact that it is currently unknown how to compute the probability of a gene tree topology within the branches of a phylogenetic network. Here we present a novel method for computing the probability of gene tree topologies on phylogenetic networks and demonstrate its application to the inference of hybridization in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. We reanalyze a Saccharomyces species data set for which multiple analyses had converged on a species tree candidate. Using our method. though. we show that an evolutionary hypothesis involving hybridization in this group has better support than one of strict divergence. A similar reanalysis on a group of three Drosophila species shows that the data is consistent with hybridization.

Recognizing that genes underlie traits. these results imply that many traits follow topologies that are discordant with the species topology.

The scale and complexity of these networks. however. render their analysis using experimental biology approaches alone very challenging. As a result. computational methods have been developed and combined with experimental biology approaches. producing powerful tools for the analysis of these networks. These computational methods mostly fall on either end of a spectrum of model parameterization. On one end is a class of structural network analysis methods; these typically use the network connectivity alone to generate hypotheses about global properties. On the other end is a class of dynamic network analysis methods; these use. in addition to the connectivity. kinetic parameters of the biochemical reactions to predict the network's dynamic behavior. These predictions provide detailed insights into the properties that determine aspects of the network's structure and behavior. However. the difficulty of obtaining numerical values of kinetic parameters is widely recognized to limit the applicability of this latter class of methods.Several researchers have observed that the connectivity of a network alone can provide significant insights into its dynamics. Motivated by this fundamental observation. we present the signaling Petri net. a non-parametric model of cellular signaling networks. and the signaling Petri net-based simulator. a Petri net execution strategy for characterizing the dynamics of signal flow through a signaling network using token distribution and sampling.

This process has great significance for understanding prokaryotic genome diversification and unraveling their complexities.

1112505,A maximum pseudo-likelihood approach for phylogenetic networks,2015,Yun Yu and Luay Nakhleh,16,BMC genomics,10,1-10,BioMed Central,Several phylogenomic analyses have recently demonstrated the need to account simultaneously for incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization when inferring a species phylogeny. A maximum likelihood approach was introduced recently for inferring species phylogenies in the presence of both processes. and showed very good results. However. computing the likelihood of a model in this case is computationally infeasible except for very small data sets. Inspired by recent work on the pseudo-likelihood of species trees based on rooted triples. we introduce the pseudo-likelihood of a phylogenetic network. which. when combined with a search heuristic. provides a statistical method for phylogenetic network inference in the presence of ILS. Unlike trees. networks are not always uniquely encoded by a set of rooted triples. Therefore. even when given sufficient data. the method might converge to a network that is equivalent under rooted triples to the true one. but not the true one itself. The method is computationally efficient and has produced very good results on the data sets we analyzed. The method is implemented in PhyloNet. which is publicly available in open source. Maximum pseudo-likelihood allows for inferring species phylogenies in the presence of hybridization and ILS. while scaling to much larger data sets than is currently feasible under full maximum likelihood. The nonuniqueness of phylogenetic networks encoded by a system of rooted triples notwithstanding. the proposed method infers the correct network under certain scenarios. and provides candidates for further exploration under other criteria and/or data in other scenarios.,True,46HLWf8AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,101,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-16-S10-S10,6978059457892108823,/scholar?cites=6978059457892108823,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-16-S10-S10,0,0,0

It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data. including genome sequences. sampling dates. phenotypic data. radiocarbon dates. fossil occurrences. and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right. and comes with specific challenges. from practical software design. development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges.

Because molecular sequence data are not informative on absolute time. external data—most commonly. fossil age estimates—are required to calibrate estimates of species divergence dates. For Bayesian divergence time methods. the common practice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily chosen parametric distributions on internal nodes. often disregarding most of the information in the fossil record. We introduce the “fossilized birth–death” (FBD) process—a model for calibrating divergence time estimates in a Bayesian framework. explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of the same macroevolutionary process.

A recent analysis of the mammalian phylogeny challenged the view of explosive mammalian evolution after the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K/T) boundary (65 Mya). However. due to lack of appropriate methods. the diversification (speciation minus extinction) rates in the more recent past of mammalian evolution could not be determined. In this paper. I provide a method that reveals that the tempo of mammalian evolution did not change until ∼33 Mya. This constant period was followed by a peak of diversification rates between 33 and 30 Mya.

Here. we generate a robust molecular phylogeny for 70 primate genera and 367 primate species based on a concatenation of 69 nuclear gene segments and ten mitochondrial gene sequences. most of which were extracted from GenBank. Relaxed clock analyses of divergence times with 14 fossil-calibrated nodes suggest that living Primates last shared a common ancestor 71–63 Ma. and that divergences within both Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini are entirely post-Cretaceous. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction of non-avian dinosaurs played an important role in the diversification of placental mammals. Previous queries into primate historical biogeography have suggested Africa. Asia. Europe. or North America as the ancestral area of crown primates. but were based on methods that were coopted from phylogeny reconstruction. By contrast. we analyzed our molecular phylogeny with two methods that were developed explicitly for ancestral area reconstruction. and find support for the hypothesis that the most recent common ancestor of living Primates resided in Asia. Analyses of primate macroevolutionary dynamics provide support for a diversification rate increase in the late Miocene. possibly in response to elevated global mean temperatures. and are consistent with the fossil record.

This density is used for calculating prior distributions in Bayesian inference programs and for efficiently simulating trees. We show that the birth–death-sampling process can be interpreted as a birth–death process with reduced rates and complete sampling.

As previously available phylogenetic inference tools assume that all samples are tips. they do not allow for this possibility. We have developed and implemented a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer what we call sampled ancestor trees. that is. trees in which sampled individuals can be direct ancestors of other sampled individuals. We use a family of birth-death models where individuals may remain in the tree process after sampling. in particular we extend the birth-death skyline model [Stadler et al.. 2013] to sampled ancestor trees. This method allows the detection of sampled ancestors as well as estimation of the probability that an individual will be removed from the process when it is sampled. We show that even if sampled ancestors are not of specific interest in an analysis. failing to account for them leads to significant bias in parameter estimates. We also show that sampled ancestor birth-death models where every sample comes from a different time point are non-identifiable and thus require one parameter to be known in order to infer other parameters.

As for other rapidly evolving pathogens of humans. it is difficult to know if this variance is controlled by the genotype of the host or that of the virus because the transmission chain is usually unknown. We apply the phylogenetic comparative approach (PCA) to estimate the heritability of a trait from one infection to the next. which indicates the control of the virus genotype over this trait. The idea is to use viral RNA sequences obtained from patients infected by HIV-1 subtype B to build a phylogeny. which approximately reflects the transmission chain. Heritability is measured statistically as the propensity for patients close in the phylogeny to exhibit similar infection trait values. The approach reveals that up to half of the variance in set-point viral load. a trait associated with virulence. can be heritable. Our estimate is significant and robust to noise in the phylogeny. We also check for the consistency of our approach by showing that a trait related to drug resistance is almost entirely heritable. Finally. we show the importance of taking into account the transmission chain when estimating correlations between infection traits. The fact that HIV virulence is. at least partially. heritable from one infection to the next has clinical and epidemiological implications. The difference between earlier studies and ours comes from the quality of our dataset and from the power of the PCA. which can be applied to large datasets and accounts for within-host evolution.

Hence. we develop a phylodynamic method that enables the joint estimation of epidemiological parameters and phylogenetic history. Based on a compartmental susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) model. this method provides separate information on incidence and prevalence of infections. Detailed information on the interaction of host population dynamics and evolutionary history can inform decisions on how to contain or entirely avoid disease outbreaks.

However. detailed knowledge of the exact contact structure underlying real epidemics is limited. Here we address the question whether the structure of the contact network leaves a detectable genetic fingerprint in the pathogen population. To this end we compare phylogenies generated by disease outbreaks in simulated populations with different types of contact networks. We find that the shape of these phylogenies strongly depends on contact structure. In particular. measures of tree imbalance allow us to quantify to what extent the contact structure underlying an epidemic deviates from a null model contact network and illustrate this in the case of random mixing. Using a phylogeny from the Swiss HIV epidemic. we show that this epidemic has a significantly more unbalanced tree than would be expected from random mixing.,True,bvN5cz8AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,98,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002413,12030289640196890259,/scholar?cites=12030289640196890259,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002413,0,0,0

However. evidence for such pulses has not been reported so far for liverworts. Here we provide new insight into liverwort evolution by integrating a comprehensive molecular dataset with a set of 20 fossil age constraints. We found evidence for a relative constant diversification rate of generalistic liverworts (Jungermanniales) since the Palaeozoic. whereas epiphytic liverworts (Porellales) show a sudden increase of lineage accumulation in the Cretaceous. This difference is likely caused by the pronounced response of Porellales to the ecological opportunities provided by humid. megathermal forests. which were increasingly available as a result of the rise of the angiosperms.,True,bvN5cz8AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,88,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05974,16648844456942009569,/scholar?cites=16648844456942009569,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05974,0,0,0

These models can be used to test evolutionary hypotheses and provide comparisons with phylogenetic trees constructed from real data. To carry out these tests and comparisons. it is often necessary to sample. or simulate. trees from the evolutionary models. Sampling trees from these models is more complicated than it may appear at first glance. necessitating careful consideration and mathematical rigor. Seemingly straightforward sampling methods may produce trees that have systematically biased shapes or branch lengths. This is particularly problematic as there is no simple method for determining whether the sampled trees are appropriate.

Critics have pointed out obvious exceptions to these assumptions. Instead of a priori dichotomous disputes about the validity of cultural phylogenetics. we suggest that the debate is better conceptualized as involving positions along continuous dimensions.

The truth is rarely pure and never simple"". The idea that much of recent human history might reflect pure trees of phylogenetic descent is appealing simple. It has stimulated numerous researchers to investigate the extent to which genes. languages and cultures are bound together in codiverging trees of evolutionary history (eg Cavalli Sforza et al. 1994. see Cavalli Sforza & Feldman (2003) for a recent review). Increasingly studies have used explicit phylogenetic methods to make inferences about linguistic history and the evolution of cultural traits (Warnow & Ringe. 1997; Gray & Jordan. 2000; Pagel. 2000; Holden. 2002; O’Brien et al. 2002; Jordan & Shennan. 2003; Holden & Mace. 2003; Rexova et al. 2003). However. a persistent criticism of this approach is that human population history is far from tree-like (Moore 1994. Terrell 1988. Terrell et al 2001). Not only might patterns of genetic. linguistic. and cultural diversity reflect different histories (Bateman et al. 1990). each of these histories might be strikingly reticulate. As one participant at a recent symposium on phylogenetic methods in archaeology growled.“This is not history.

An important application of consensus methods is to combine gene trees to estimate a species tree. To investigate the theoretical properties of consensus trees that would be obtained from large numbers of loci evolving according to a basic evolutionary model. we construct consensus trees from rooted gene trees that occur in proportion to gene-tree probabilities derived from coalescent theory. We consider majority-rule. rooted triple (R*). and greedy consensus trees obtained from known. rooted gene trees. both in the asymptotic case as numbers of gene trees approach infinity and for finite numbers of genes. Our results show that for some combinations of species-tree branch lengths. increasing the number of independent loci can make the rooted majority-rule consensus tree more likely to be at least …,True,xTWXOf8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,143,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/58/1/35/1674751,3452543536190295522,/scholar?cites=3452543536190295522,,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/58/1/35/1674751,0,0,0

Each provides a unique perspective which can aid in the reconstruction of prehistory. This study expands on previous investigations by adding a temporal component from ancient DNA and. in some cases. direct dating of bones of individual chickens from a variety of sites in Europe. the Pacific. and the Americas. The results from the ancient DNA analyses of forty-eight archaeologically derived chicken bones provide support for archaeological hypotheses about the prehistoric human transport of chickens. Haplogroup E mtDNA signatures have been amplified from directly dated samples originating in Europe at 1000 B.P. and in the Pacific at 3000 B.P. indicating multiple prehistoric dispersals from a single Asian centre. These two dispersal pathways converged in the Americas where chickens were introduced both by Polynesians and later by Europeans.

Ill.: University of Chicago Press. c1983-,We present fast new algorithms for evaluating trees with respect to least  squares and minimum evolution (ME). the most commonly used criteria for   inferring phylogenetic trees from distance data. These include: an optimal   O(N² ) time algorithm for calculating the branch (edge) lengths on a tree   according to ordinary or unweighted least squares (OLS); an O(N³ ) time   algorithm for edge lengths under weighted least squares (WLS) and the FitchMargoliash   method; and an optimal O(N⁴) time algorithm for generalised   least squares edge lengths. The Minimum Evolution criterion is based on the   sum of edge lengths. Consequently. the edge lengths algorithms presented   here lead directly to O(N² ). O(N³ ) and O(N⁴) time algorithms for ME under   OLS. WLS and GLS respectively. These algorithms are substantially faster   than all those previously published. and the algorithms for OLS and GLS are   the fastest possible (with respect to order of computational complexity).   An optimal algorithm for determining path lengths in a tree with given   edge lengths is also developed. This leads to an optimal O(N² ) algorithm   for OLS sums of squares evaluation and corresponding O(N³ ) and O(N⁴)   time algorithms for WLS and GLS sums of squares. respectively. The GLS   algorithm is time optimal if the covariance matrix is already inverted. The   considerable increases in speed enable far more extensive tree searches and   statistical evaluations (e.g. bootstrap. parametric bootstrap or jackknife).

The position of the root is still debated. although pinpointing it would aid our understanding of the early evolution of life. Because prokaryote evolution was long viewed as a tree-like process of lineage bifurcations. efforts to identify the most ancient microbial lineage split have traditionally focused on positioning a root on a phylogenetic tree constructed from one or several genes. Such studies have delivered widely conflicting results on the position of the root. this being mainly due to methodological problems inherent to deep gene phylogeny and the workings of lateral gene transfer among prokaryotes over evolutionary time.

Different evolutionary hypotheses (or conflicting phylogenies) arise when different phylogenetic reconstruction methods are applied to the same data set. or when a single method is applied to different data sets (eg different genes). Several similarity metrics between evolutionary trees are currently in use 2]. In this paper. we study the quartet metric. which is based on common subtrees induced by four leaves. This metric has several attractive properties. though its use has been limited by the time required to compute the distance 7]. In this paper. we address this problem by describing an O (n2) algorithm that computes the quartet distance between two evolutionary trees. Two general approaches are currently in use to resolve conflicting phylogenies. One method is to select a consensus tree (or trees) that best represents the information provided by each tree. The maximum agreement subtree (MAST) is an instance of this approach. A substantial amount of effort has been devoted to efficient algorithms for finding the MAST of two or many evolutionary trees. see 8] for a summary of results. A more quantitative approach is to define a similarity metric between trees to assess the stability of a solution by measuring the degree of similarity among the trees. The distributions of various tree similarity metrics are well-studied 7] and are very useful in testing statistical hypotheses.

One recent approach emphasizes the use of genome-wide molecular markers. such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). to identify distinct metapopulation lineages as taxonomic species. Here we investigate the properties of AFLP data. and the usefulness of tree-based and non-tree-based clustering methods to delimit species and reconstruct evolutionary relationships among high-elevation Ourisia species (Plantaginaceae) in the New Zealand archipelago. New Zealand Ourisia are shown to comprise a geologically recent species radiation based on molecular dating analyses of ITS sequences (0.4–1.3 MY). Supernetwork analyses indicate that separate tree-based clustering analyses of four independent AFLP primer combinations and 193 individuals of Ourisia produced similar trees. When combined and analysed using tree building methods. 15 distinct metapopulations could be identified. These clusters corresponded very closely to species and subspecies identified on the basis of diagnostic morphological characters. In contrast.

However. demographic inference in the ancient past is difficult. particularly around the out-of-Africa event in the Late Middle Paleolithic. a period of profound importance to our species’ history. Here we present SMCSMC. a Bayesian method for inference of time-varying population sizes and directional migration rates under the coalescent-with-recombination model. to study ancient demographic events. We find evidence for substantial migration from the ancestors of present-day Eurasians into African groups between 40 and 70 thousand years ago. predating the divergence of Eastern and Western Eurasian lineages. This event accounts for previously unexplained genetic diversity in African populations. and supports the existence of novel population substructure in the Late Middle Paleolithic.

Results: Using this strategy. we successfully stored different file formats in a single synthetic DNA oligonucleotide pool. Compared to most well-established DNA-based data storage coding schemes presented to date. this codec system can achieve a variety of user goals (e.g. reduce homopolymer length to 3 or 4 at most. maintain balanced GC content between 40% and 60% and simple secondary structure with the Gibbs free energy above -30 kcal/mol). It also shows enhanced robustness in transcoding of different data structure and practical feasibility. We tested this codec with an end-to-end experiment including encoding.

However. inferring demography from genome sequences is challenging because genealogies are only weakly constrained by polymorphisms. and the space of genealogies over genomes is huge.

We introduce a continuous-sequence approximation of the CwR. resulting in a continuous-time and -space Markov jump process. We develop a particle filter algorithm for such processes. and introduce the unbounded-lookahead particle filter. generalising the unit-lookahead Auxiliary Particle Filter for discrete-time models.

1112586,Stochastic tree models and probabilistic modelling of gene trees of given species networks,2013,Sha Zhu,,,,,,In the pre-genomic era. the relationships among species and their evolutionary histories were often determined by examining the fossil records. In the genomic era. these relationships are identified by analysing the genetic data. which also enables us to take a close-up view of the differences between the individual samples. Nevertheless. these relationships are often described by a tree-like structure or a network. In this thesis. we investigate some of the models that are used to describe these relationships.  This thesis can be divided into two main parts. The first part focuses on investigating the theoretical properties of several neutral tree models that are often considered in phylogenetics and population genetics studies. such as the Yule–Harding model. the proportional to distinguishable arrangements and the Kingman coalescent models.  In comparison to the first part. the other half of the thesis is more computationally oriented: we focus on developing and implementing methods of calculating gene tree probabilities of given species networks. and simulating genealogies within species networks.,True,X088tmcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/7944,,,,http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/7944/thesis_fulltext.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0
1112587,Hybrid coal,2012,Sha Joe Zhu,,,,,,In phylogenetic study. trees are used for describing evolutionary histories. In particular. a species tree presents population divergences. and a gene tree indicates the times that genes start to differentiate within populations. Even though speciation is driven by gene mutations. using a single gene tree to infer the species tree is not ideal. Often. the inconsistency between gene trees and species trees makes describing species relationships very difficult. Common causes of the conflict include gene duplication. horizontal gene transfer. incomplete lineage sorting. and hybridization [5. 7]. If speciation events occur closely. it is likely that some gene copies remain the same after species divergence. This inconsistency between gene trees and species tree is referred as incomplete lineage sorting.Hybridization refers to interbreeding between species.

1112592,Species tree inference by minimizing deep coalescences,2009,Cuong Than and Luay Nakhleh,5,PLoS Comput Biol,9,e1000501,Public Library of Science,In a 1997 seminal paper. W. Maddison proposed minimizing deep coalescences. or MDC. as an optimization criterion for inferring the species tree from a set of incongruent gene trees. assuming the incongruence is exclusively due to lineage sorting. In a subsequent paper. Maddison and Knowles provided and implemented a search heuristic for optimizing the MDC criterion. given a set of gene trees. However. the heuristic is not guaranteed to compute optimal solutions. and its hill-climbing search makes it slow in practice. In this paper. we provide two exact solutions to the problem of inferring the species tree from a set of gene trees under the MDC criterion. In other words. our solutions are guaranteed to find the tree that minimizes the total number of deep coalescences from a set of gene trees. One solution is based on a novel integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. and another is based on a simple dynamic programming (DP) approach. Powerful ILP solvers. such as CPLEX. make the first solution appealing. particularly for very large-scale instances of the problem. whereas the DP-based solution eliminates dependence on proprietary tools. and its simplicity makes it easy to integrate with other genomic events that may cause gene tree incongruence. Using the exact solutions. we analyze a data set of 106 loci from eight yeast species. a data set of 268 loci from eight Apicomplexan species. and several simulated data sets.

Inc.,Prokaryotic organisms share genetic material across species boundaries by means of a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process has great significance for understanding prokaryotic genome diversification and unraveling their complexities. Phylogeny-based detection of HGT is one of the most commonly used methods for this task. and is based on the fundamental fact that HGT may cause gene trees to disagree with one another. as well as with the species phylogeny. Using these methods. we can compare gene and species trees. and infer a set of HGT events to reconcile the differences among these trees.

However. it has also been noted from simulation results that the MDC criterion is not always guaranteed to infer the correct species tree estimate. In this article. we investigate the consistency of the MDC criterion. Using the multipscies coalescent model. we show that there are indeed anomaly zones for the MDC criterion for asymmetric four-taxon species tree topologies. and for all …,True,b9SLRNMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,63,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cmb.2010.0102,16825231271787064609,/scholar?cites=16825231271787064609,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/90434/cmb-2E2010-2E0102.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Inferring a strain tree from multilocus data of these strains is exceptionally hard since. at this scale of evolution. processes such as homologous recombination result in a very high degree of gene tree incongruence. Results: In this article we present a novel computational method for inferring the strain tree despite massive gene tree incongruence caused by homologous recombination.

The MDC method possesses the desirable Pareto property. and in practice it is quite accurate and computationally efficient. Here. in order to better understand the MDC method. we investigate some properties of the deep coalescence cost. We prove that the unit neighborhood of either a rooted species tree or a rooted gene tree under the deep coalescence cost is exactly the same as the tree's unit neighborhood under the rooted nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) distance. Next. for a fixed species tree. we obtain the maximum deep coalescence cost across all gene trees as well as the number of gene trees that achieve the maximum cost.

Heidelberg,Prokaryotic organisms share genetic material across species boundaries by means of a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Detecting this process bears great significance on understanding prokaryotic genome diversification and unraveling their complexities. Phylogeny-based detection of HGT is one of the most commonly used approaches for this task. and is based on the fundamental fact that HGT may cause gene trees to disagree with one another. as well as with the species phylogeny. Hence. methods that adopt this approach compare gene and species trees. and infer a set of HGT events to reconcile the differences among these trees.In this paper. we address some of the identifiability issues that face phylogeny-based detection of HGT.

In 1997. W. Maddison proposed “minimizing deep coalescences”. or MDC. as one such criterion. This is a parsimonious criterion that. roughly speaking. seeks the tree that minimizes a quantity called extra lineages when all gene trees are reconciled within its branches. Recently. we developed the first exact algorithms for finding the optimal tree under the MDC criterion; these algorithms are guaranteed to find the tree (or trees) that minimizes the number of extra lineages when all input gene trees are reconciled within its branches. These exact algorithms. while taking time that is asymptotically exponential in the number of species under consideration. are capable of analyzing data sets of tens of species and thousands of loci in seconds or minutes.In this chapter. we report on those algorithms. highlighting the computational techniques underlying their development. which we believe may be helpful in achieving algorithmic improvements in more computeintensive criteria. such as maximum likelihood. Further. we show how these algorithmic solutions deal with gene trees that are not necessarily binary. and how to use them on data sets with multiple individuals. While guaranteeing the optimality of the solution entails considering all possible clusters of the taxa under study. we investigate the performance of those solutions when restricted to the set of clusters displayed by the gene trees. In practice. this latter set is much smaller than the set of all clusters. and hence it leads to drastic improvement in the speed of the …,True,b9SLRNMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,12,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.421.9345&rep=rep1&type=pdf,12913743185159846975,/scholar?cites=12913743185159846975,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.421.9345&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,One phylogeny-based approach to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) detection entails comparing the topology of a gene tree to that of the species tree. and using their differences to locate HGT events. Another approach is based on augmenting a species tree into a phylogenetic network to improve the fitness of the evolution of the gene sequence data under an optimization criterion. such as maximum parsimony (MP). One major problem with the first approach is that gene tree estimates may have wrong branches. which result in false positive estimates of HGT events. and the second approach is accurate. yet suffers from the computational complexity of searching through the space of possible phylogenetic networks.The contributions of this paper are two-fold.

1112605,Inference of parsimonious species phylogenies from multi-locus data,2010,Cuong V Than,,,,,,The main focus of this dissertation is the inference of species phylogenies. i.e. evolutionary histories of species. Species phylogenies allow us to gain insights into the mechanisms of evolution and to hypothesize past evolutionary events. They also find applications in medicine. for example. the understanding of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The reconstruction of species phylogenies is. therefore. of both biological and practical importance. In the traditional method for inferring species trees from genetic data. we sequence a single locus in species genomes. reconstruct a gene tree. and report it as the species tree. Biologists have long acknowledged that a gene tree can be different from a species tree. thus implying that this traditional method might infer the wrong species tree. Moreover. reticulate events such as horizontal gene transfer and hybridization make the evolution of species no longer tree-like. The availability of multi-locus data provides us with excellent opportunities to resolve those long standing problems. In this dissertation. we present parsimony-based algorithms for reconciling species/gene tree incongruence that is assumed to be due solely to lineage sorting. We also describe a unified framework for detecting hybridization despite lineage sorting. To address the first problem of species/gene tree incongruence caused by lineage sorting. we present three algorithms.

With the large number of genes involved in the odontogenic process. the opportunity for mutations to disrupt this process is high. Tooth agenesis (hypodontia) is the most common craniofacial malformation with patients missing anywhere from one tooth to their entire dentition. Hypodontia can occur in association with other developmental anomalies (syndromic) or as an isolated condition (non-syndromic). Recent advances in genetic techniques have allowed us to begin understanding the genetic processes that underlie the odontogenic process and to identify the mechanisms responsible for tooth agenesis. Thus far two genes have been identified by mutational analysis as the major causes of non-syndromic hypodontia; PAX9 and MSX1. Haploinsufficiency of either has been observed to cause the more severe forms of hypodontia whilst point mutations cause hypodontia to varying degrees of severity. With the prevalence of hypodontia having been observed to have increased during the 20th century. the future identification and analysis of its genetic basis is essential to allow us to better treat the condition.

1112618,Sequence determinants of human microsatellite variability,2009,Trevor J Pemberton and Conner I Sandefur and Mattias Jakobsson and Noah A Rosenberg,10,,1,1-19,BioMed Central,Microsatellite loci are frequently used in genomic studies of DNA sequence repeats and in population studies of genetic variability. To investigate the effect of sequence properties of microsatellites on their level of variability we have analyzed genotypes at 627 microsatellite loci in 1.048 worldwide individuals from the HGDP-CEPH cell line panel together with the DNA sequences of these microsatellites in the human RefSeq database. Calibrating PCR fragment lengths in individual genotypes by using the RefSeq sequence enabled us to infer repeat number in the HGDP-CEPH dataset and to calculate the mean number of repeats (as opposed to the mean PCR fragment length). under the assumption that differences in PCR fragment length reflect differences in the numbers of repeats in the embedded repeat sequences. We find the mean and maximum numbers of repeats across individuals to be positively correlated with heterozygosity. The size and composition of the repeat unit of a microsatellite are also important factors in predicting heterozygosity. with tetra-nucleotide repeat units high in G/C content leading to higher heterozygosity. Finally. we find that microsatellites containing more separate sets of repeated motifs generally have higher heterozygosity. These results suggest that sequence properties of microsatellites have a significant impact in determining the features of human microsatellite variability.,True,vg-HZ10AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,60,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-612,16076414963391421643,/scholar?cites=16076414963391421643,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-10-612,0,0,0

Recent studies have examined the genetic structure of indigenous populations of Latin America and the Caribbean and their admixed descendants. reporting on the genomic impact of the history of admixture with colonizing populations of European and African ancestry. However. relatively little genomic research has been conducted on admixture in indigenous North American populations. In this study. we analyze genomic data at 475.109 single-nucleotide polymorphisms sampled in indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest in British Columbia and Southeast Alaska. populations with a well-documented history of contact with European and Asian traders. fishermen. and contract laborers. We find that the indigenous populations of the Pacific Northwest have higher gene diversity than Latin American indigenous populations. Among the Pacific Northwest populations. interior groups provide more evidence for East Asian admixture. whereas coastal groups have higher levels of European admixture. In contrast with many Latin American indigenous populations. the variance of admixture is high in each of the Pacific Northwest indigenous populations. as expected for recent and ongoing admixture processes.

Eighty to eighty-five percent of reported cases of hypodontia involve the agenesis of just one or two teeth [Muller et al.. 1970]. indicating that most affected individuals have a mild form of the disorder. The tooth most commonly missing is the third molar (or wisdom tooth). which is absent in as much as 20% of the population. Tooth agenesis involving the mandibular central and lateral permanent incisors has the lowest incidence [Pemberton et al.. 2005].Hypodontia can occur in association with other developmental anomalies (syndromic) or as an isolated condition (non-syndromic). Genes associated with several syndromic conditions that present hypodontia have been identified. including the EDA gene underlying ectodermal dysplasia [Kere et al.. 1996]. Three genes underlying nonsyndromic hypodontia have been identified to date: PAX9 [Stockton et al.. 2000]. MSX1 [Vastardis et al.. 1996]. and AXIN2 [Mostowska et al.. 2006].

China.  METHODS Individual-level data on 25.961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18. 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions. we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11. January 11-22. January 23 - February 1. and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions.   RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions. sex and age groups. except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan. potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases.

Many recent studies have reported similarity between geographic maps of population locations and MDS or PCA maps of genetic variation inferred from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However. this similarity has been evident primarily in a qualitative sense; and. because different multivariate techniques and marker sets have been used in different studies. it has not been possible to formally compare genetic variation datasets in terms of their levels of similarity with geography. In this study. using genome-wide SNP data from 128 populations worldwide. we perform a systematic analysis to quantitatively evaluate the similarity of genes and geography in different geographic regions. For each of a series of regions. we apply a Procrustes analysis approach to find an optimal transformation that maximizes the similarity between PCA maps of genetic variation and geographic maps of population locations. We consider examples in Europe. Sub-Saharan Africa. Asia. East Asia. and Central/South Asia. as well as in a worldwide sample. finding that significant similarity between genes and geography exists in general at different geographic levels. The similarity is highest in our examples for Asia and. once highly distinctive populations have been removed. Sub-Saharan Africa.

Current methods for studying the association of rare variants with traits cannot be readily applied for testing for rare variants by environment interactions. as these methods do not effectively control for the main effects of rare variants. leading to unstable results and/or inflated Type 1 error rates.

Especially for samples with poor DNA quality. this problem causes a downward bias in estimates of observed heterozygosity and an upward bias in estimates of inbreeding. owing to mistaken classifications of heterozygotes as homozygotes when one of the two copies drops out. One general approach for avoiding allelic dropout involves repeated genotyping of homozygous loci to minimize the effects of experimental error.

Five different possible limit processes. each with a different scaled mutation parameter. can be used to describe genetic diversity in a large population.

Genetic evidence of population subdivision can be observed even when gene flow is very high. if the offspring distribution is skewed. A skewed offspring distribution arises when individuals can have very many offspring with some probability. This leads to high probability of identity by descent within subpopulations and results in genetic heterogeneity between subpopulations even when Nm is very large. Thus. we consider a limiting model in which the rates of coalescence and migration can be much higher than for a Wright–Fisher population.

Since a prediction of linkage disequilibrium can be written in terms of correlations in coalescence times. it follows that the prediction of linkage disequilibrium is a function not only of the rate of recombination but also of the reproduction parameters. Low linkage disequilibrium is predicted if the offspring of a single individual frequently replace almost the entire population. However. high linkage disequilibrium can be predicted if the offspring of a single individual replace an intermediate fraction of the population.

This ancestral process appears naturally as a scaling limit of the genealogy of large populations that sustain seedbanks. if the seedbank size and individual dormancy times are of the same order as those of the active population. Mutations appear as Poisson processes on the active lineages and potentially at reduced rate also on the dormant lineages. The presence of “dormant” lineages leads to qualitatively altered times to the most recent common ancestor and nonclassical patterns of genetic diversity. To illustrate this we provide a Wright–Fisher model with a seedbank component and mutation. motivated from recent models of microbial dormancy. whose genealogy can be described by the seedbank coalescent.

For neutral genetic variation. the ratio of singletons to the total number of segregating sites is equivalent to the ratio of total length of external branches to the total length of the gene genealogy.

The underlying population model is a modified Moran model in which the reproducing individual can have very many offspring with some probability. Convergence to a structured coalescent process results when assuming that migration follows a coalescent timescale which can be much shorter than the usual Wright–Fisher timescale. Three different limit processes are possible depending on the coalescent timescale. two of which allow multiple mergers of ancestral lines. The expected time to most recent common ancestor. and the expected total size of the genealogy. of balanced and unbalanced samples can be very similar. even when migration is low. if the coalescent process allows multiple mergers.

Glucocorticoids are a mainstay therapy for asthma because they exert anti-inflammatory effects in multiple lung tissues. including the airway smooth muscle (ASM). However. the mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress inflammation in ASM remains poorly understood. Using RNA-Seq. a high-throughput sequencing method. we characterized transcriptomic changes in four primary human ASM cell lines that were treated with dexamethasone—a potent synthetic glucocorticoid (1 µM for 18 hours). Based on a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value <0.05. we identified 316 differentially expressed genes. including both well known (DUSP1. KLF15. PER1. TSC22D3) and less investigated (C7. CCDC69. CRISPLD2) glucocorticoid-responsive genes. CRISPLD2. which encodes a secreted protein previously implicated in lung development and endotoxin regulation. was found to have SNPs that were moderately associated with inhaled corticosteroid resistance and bronchodilator response among asthma patients in two previously conducted genome-wide association studies. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that dexamethasone treatment significantly increased CRISPLD2 mRNA and protein expression in ASM cells. CRISPLD2 expression was also induced by the inflammatory cytokine IL1β. and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CRISPLD2 further increased IL1β-induced expression of IL6 and IL8.

This transformation is required because existing methods tend to group sequences on the basis of their nucleotide composition. irrespective of their evolutionary history. This effect of differing nucleotide frequencies is illustrated by using a tree-selection criterion on a simple distance measure defined solely on the basis of base composition. independent of the actual sequences. The new LogDet transformation uses determinants of the observed divergence matrices and works because multiplication of determinants (real numbers) is commutative. whereas multiplication of matrices is not.except in special symmetric cases.

1112713,The complexity of reconstructing trees from qualitative characters and subtrees,1992,Michael Steel,9,Journal of Classification,1,91-116,Springer New York,In taxonomy and other branches of classification it is useful to know when tree-like classifications on overlapping sets of labels can be consistently combined into a parent tree. This paper considers the computation complexity of this problem. Recognizing when a consistent parent tree exists is shown to be intractable (NP-complete) for sets of unrooted trees. even when each tree in the set classifies just four labels. Consequently determining the compatibility of qualitative characters and partial binary characters is. in general. also NP-complete. However for sets of rooted trees an algorithm is described which constructs the “strict consensus tree” of all consistent parent trees (when they exist) in polynomial time. The related question of recognizing when a set of subtrees uniquely defines a parent tree is also considered. and a simple necessary and sufficient condition is described for rooted trees.,True,7ezIRWQAAAAJ:fEOibwPWpKIC,570,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02618470.pdf,14211331627883160009,/scholar?cites=14211331627883160009,,https://www.math.canterbury.ac.nz/~m.steel/Non_UC/files/research/complexity.pdf,0,0,0

In this setting. extant species label the leaves of the tree. while the internal vertices correspond to ancestral species. Various techniques exist for reconstructing these evolutionary trees from data. and an important problem is to determine how ""far apart"" two such reconstructed trees are from each other. or indeed from the true historical tree. To investigate this question requires tree metrics. and these can be induced by operations that rearrange trees locally. Here we investigate three such operations: nearest neighbour interchange (NNI). subtree prune and regraft (SPR). and tree bisection and reconnection (TBR). The SPR operation is of particular interest as it can be used to model biological processes such as horizontal gene transfer and recombination.

It has been argued recently that evidence supports such models over later. alternative models that postulate a static distribution of rates across sites. However. in contrast with these latter well-studied models. little is known about the analytic properties of the former model. Here we analyze a covarion-style model and show (i) how to obtain the evolutionary distance between two species from the expected proportion of sites where two species differ.

Since chlorophyll is less reduced and precedes bacteriochlorophyll on the modern biosynthetic pathway. it has been proposed that chlorophyll preceded bacteriochlorophyll in its evolution. However. recent analyses of nucleotide sequences that encode chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes appear to provide support for an alternative hypothesis. This is that the evolution of bacteriochlorophyll occurred earlier than the evolution of chlorophyll.

A major goal of phylogenetics is often to combine estimated gene trees from many loci into an overall estimate of a species tree. When data are missing for some combinations of genes and taxa. supertree methods can be used to combine gene trees on different subsets of taxa into an overall tree. However. studies of the performance of supertree methods when gene tree conflict is due to incomplete lineage sorting are needed to understand their statistical properties in this setting. We find that Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP). the most commonly used supertree method. can in many cases infer the species tree in spite of high levels of conflict in the input gene trees.

This project was conducted to determine whether outpatient MVA expedites care while maintaining patient satisfaction. A cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of patients undergoing surgical management of spontaneous abortion. induced abortion. or retained products of conception with either outpatient MVA under local anesthesia or EVA in the operating room was conducted. Of 138 women completing surveys. 48 (34.8%) underwent outpatient MVA and 90 (65.2%) underwent EVA in the operating room. Procedure length. time from decision to procedure. and patient satisfaction were assessed through a self-administered questionnaire completed post-procedure. Most (77%) patients in the MVA group reported waiting fewer than 2 h from the time of their decision to the procedure. while most (74%) EVA patients reported waiting over 12 h (P < 0.001); the MVA group reported higher satisfaction with time to procedure (P = 0.02). The median procedure length was significantly shorter in the EVA group (10 vs. 20 min. P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in overall satisfaction with the procedure (P = 0.16). Outpatient MVA under local anesthesia is a suitable alternative to operating room-based EVA for management of spontaneous abortion. induced abortion. and retained products of conception.

Details of placement and discontinuation were extracted from medical records.ResultsUterine sound measurements at IUD placement were documented for 1238 of 1322 (93.6%) women (median 8.0 cm. range 4.5–17.0 cm). Most IUDs (88.0%) were placed for contraception. Of 58 women with uterine sound of less than 10 cm. one IUD (1.7%) was discontinued within 1 month of insertion. compared with 5.1% discontinuation among women with uteri of 10 cm or less (p=. 48). Among the 763 women with at least 12 months of follow-up. 39.5% with uteri of more than 10 cm discontinued at 12 months. compared with 29.9% among those with uteri of 10 cm or less (p=. 21). Expulsion incidence at 1 year was similar for uteri of more than 10 cm (7.9%) and those 10 cm or less (6.9%; p=. 74). There were four uterine perforations; three occurred in uteri measuring 10 cm or less at IUD placement. All six pregnancies that occurred with IUDs in place were in women with uterine sound of 10 cm or less.ConclusionsPackage inserts for commercially available IUDs in the United States indicate a maximum uterine sound at the time of IUD placement.

The main objective of the present study is addressed in three stages. First. a new framework for modelling obesity in university students is introduced. The second stage involves data analysis based on Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (BSEM) for estimating the Body Mass Index (BMI)(representative of the obesity level) of students at three university levels: Bachelor. Master and PhD. In the third stage. the highest significant correlation is determined between the BMI and other variables in the research model that were found significant through the second phase. The data for this study were collected from students at selected Malaysian universities. The results indicate that unhealthy food intake (fast food and soft drinks). social media use and stress exhibit the highest weightage contributing to overweight and obesity issues for Malaysian university students.

Theoretically. however. it has been known since 2011 that it is possible to consistently infer the root of the species tree directly from unrooted gene trees without assuming an outgroup. Here. we use approximate Bayesian computation to infer the root of the species tree from unrooted gene trees assuming the multispecies coalescent model. It is hoped that this approach will be useful in cases where an appropriate outgroup is difficult to find and gene trees do not follow a molecular clock.

It proposes policy and implementation strategy for Ministry of Labor. as this ministry directly deals with citizens and foreign workforce. Recent statistics shows that in 2010. the Middle East alone consumed 18 million tons of paper in private and public sectors for various business correspondence and education activities. This extensive consumption of paper is causing two major problems for Saudi Arabia. Middle East as well as the world at large. Firstly. widespread use of paper results in decrease in productivity and efficiency. Secondly. paper manufacturing industry is a major contributor to environment degradation. green house gas emission and pollutions.

This work is based on Smale’s framework which is proposed in his paper “Mathematics of the Neural Response”. According to his proposal. hierarchical architectures can be seen as two sequential and different steps or stages: creating templates and measurements of similarities respectively. The main task of this work is to enhance the accuracy of recognizing Arabic handwriting using Smale's framework. To achieve this goal. this paper presents a statistical developed hierarchical method to improve the extraction of features which have been proved to be more effective in the stated research of Arabic hand-writing recognition.

But in the presence of outlier in the data. its results are unreliable. Hence. the robust regression methods have been suggested for a long time as alternatives to the OLS to solve the outliers problem. In the present study. new ratio type estimators of finite population mean are suggested using simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) utilizing the supplementary information in Bowley’s coefficient of skewness with quartiles. For these proposed estimators. we have used the OLS. Huber-M. Mallows GM-estimate. Schweppe GM-estimate. and SIS GM-estimate methods for estimating the population parameters. Theoretically. the mean square error (MSE) equations of various estimators are obtained and compared with the OLS competitor.

1112774,MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD INFERENCE OF ROOTED SPECIES TREES FROM ROOTED VS UNROOTED GENE TREES.,2019,Ayed RA Alanzi,35,Pakistan Journal of Statistics,3,,,This work investigates that how the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the phylogenetic tree works. MLE is one of the most standard method of estimation among all the methods used in estimation. It is obligatory to find ML before finding the core value of the parameters which proceed to figure out the likelihood function. Scholars used the MLE frequently to prove the notion of species trees from gene trees inspired by the incomplete lineage sorting. They have traditionally used rooted genes tree to understand rooted species tree or unrooted genes tree to realize unrooted species tree. Depending upon the knowledge of the topology of unrooted gene tree. Allman et al.(2011) gave a notion to relate the rooted species tree from unrooted genes trees. This theory was helpful to acknowledge the features of the rooted specie tree. Allman et al.(2011) discovered for the first time that the roots of species tree are using unrooted specie tree as the input data without assuming an outgroup. When an appropriate outgroup is challenging and gene trees do not go with a molecular clock. this approach will be valuable. This study follows the MLE method to compute the maximum value of the correct tree. In addition to that. this study will compare between using rooted gene trees and unrooted gene trees. both with and without DNA sequences. for different number taxa.,True,cnuR1JwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,http://www.pakjs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35303.pdf,,,,http://www.pakjs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/35303.pdf,0,0,0

1112779,Large number of taxa used to estimate a rooted species tree with the ABC method from an unrooted gene tree,,ARA Alanzi,,,,,,Various approaches use gene trees to infer species trees produced from incomplete lineage sorting. Generally. one of these approaches is used to deduce the rooted species tree from a rooted gene tree. or another method can be used to determine the unrooted species tree from an unrooted gene tree. Typically. this unrooted species is then rooted through at least one outgroup. However. in theory. the unrooted gene tree can be used consistently and directly to infer the rooted species tree without using an outgroup. We used an unrooted gene tree with the assumption of a multispecies coalescent model to infer the rooted species tree by using the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). In certain cases. this could be useful. especially when it is hard to locate a fitting outgroup neglected by gene trees. To address the challenges of increasing the taxa number. an ABC was used to gauge the rooted species tree of a large number of taxa. using an unrooted gene tree to develop the rooted species tree. This is the first ABC application that can handle very large numbers of taxa. Based on the results. the Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is generally equal to 2 when the species tree is in imbalance. When the shape of the species tree is balanced. the RF distance is normally equal to 0.

In this review. we provide evidence pointing to the high dispersal capacity of both animals (cladocerans. rotifers and bryozoans) and aquatic macrophytes inhabiting lentic habitats. This evidence includes direct observation of dispersal by vectors such as wind and waterfowl and the rapid colonization of new habitats. Such high dispersal capacity contrasts with the abundant evidence of pronounced genetic differentiation among neighbouring populations in many pond-dwelling organisms. We provide an overview of the potential mechanisms causing a discrepancy between high dispersal rates and reduced levels of gene flow. We argue that founder events combined with rapid local adaptation may underlie the striking patterns of genetic differentiation for neutral markers in many aquatic organisms.

1112781,Cryptic animal species are homogeneously distributed among taxa and biogeographical regions,2007,Markus Pfenninger and Klaus Schwenk,7,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-6,BioMed Central,Cryptic species are two or more distinct but morphologically similar species that were classified as a single species. During the past two decades we observed an exponential growth of publications on cryptic species. Recently published reviews have demonstrated cryptic species have profound consequences on many biological disciplines. It has been proposed that their distribution is non-random across taxa and biomes. We analysed a literature database for the taxonomic and biogeographical distribution of cryptic animal species reports. Results from regression analysis indicate that cryptic species are almost evenly distributed among major metazoan taxa and biogeographical regions when corrected for species richness and study intensity. This indicates that morphological stasis represents an evolutionary constant and that cryptic metazoan diversity does predictably affect estimates of earth's animal diversity.

Although this phenomenon has often been viewed as problematic in the fields of ecology. taxonomy and systematics. it has become a primary source of data for studies on speciation and adaptation. Effects from genetic/evolutionary processes. such as recombination and natural selection. usually develop over extended periods of time; however. they are accelerated in cases of hybridization. Interspecific hybrids exhibit novel genomes that are exposed to natural selection. thus providing a key to unravel the ultimate causes of adaptation and speciation.

Here we report of a fish living in a Mexican cave (Cueva del Azufre) that is rich in highly toxic H2S. We compared the water chemistry and fish communities of the cave and several nearby surface streams. Our study revealed high concentrations of H2S in the cave and its outflow (El Azufre). The concentrations of H2S reach more than 300 μM inside the cave. which are acutely toxic for most fishes. In both sulfidic habitats. the diversity of fishes was heavily reduced. and Poecilia mexicana was the dominant species indicating that the presence of H2S has an all-or-none effect. permitting only few species to survive in sulfidic habitats.

Of these populations. one originated from a typical river habitat. another from a lightless cave chamber and the third one from a small. milky creek outside the cave. We gave hungry females an opportunity to feed in the presence of either another female or a male.

For example. poeciliid females have reduced feeding opportunities when accompanied by a male because females dedicate attention to avoiding male copulation attempts. Poeciliid species differ considerably in male mating behavior. such as the presence or absence of courtship. Courting males display in front of the females. but males attempting to sneak-copulate approach females from behind. that is. in the blind portion of their visual field. and force copulations. which can be viewed as a male persistence trait.

A specific feature of mormyrid fish. the electric organ discharge (EOD). is used for electrolocation and intraspecific communication. We hypothesized that the EOD also facilitates assortative mating and ultimately promotes prezygotic reproductive isolation in African weakly electric fishes. Our behavioural experiments using live males as well as EOD playback demonstrated that female mate recognition is influenced by EOD signals and that females are attracted to EOD characteristics of conspecific males. The dual function of the EOD for both foraging and social communication (including mate recognition leading to assortative mating) underlines the importance of electric signal differentiation for the divergence of African weakly electric fishes.

Deception by the choosing male may be an adaptation to avoid sperm competition. because surrounding males may use public information and copy the focal male's mate choice.,True,3_P7VEEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,64,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208008610,5737739565375371701,/scholar?cites=5737739565375371701,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982208008610,0,0,0

During the past two decades we observed an exponential growth of publications on cryptic species. Recently published reviews have demonstrated cryptic species have profound consequences on many biological disciplines. It has been proposed that their distribution is non-random across taxa and biomes. We analysed a literature database for the taxonomic and biogeographical distribution of cryptic animal species reports. Results from regression analysis indicate that cryptic species are almost evenly distributed among major metazoan taxa and biogeographical regions when corrected for species richness and study intensity. This indicates that morphological stasis represents an evolutionary constant and that cryptic metazoan diversity does predictably affect estimates of earth's animal diversity.

In order to distinguish species. it is necessary that taxonomic characters allow for the separation of individuals into recognisable. homogeneous groups that differ from other such groups in a consistent way. We compared here the suitability and efficacy of traditionally used shell morphology and DNA-based methods to distinguish among species of the freshwater snail genus Radix (Basommatophora.

On the other hand. the Molecularly defined Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU). inferred from mitochondrial COI sequence variation. proved to be congruent with biological species. inferred from geographic distribution patterns. congruence with nuclear markers and crossing experiments. Moreover. it could be shown that the phenotypically plastic shell variation is mostly determined by the environmental conditions experienced.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1374,1211-1217,The Royal Society,Population structure was estimated in a continuous population of a small land snail (Trochoidea geyeri). Mark–recapture experiments and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analyses indicate that the population structure can be described by the isolation by distance model of Wright (1946). Estimates of density and dispersal suggest a neighbourhood size of 70–208 individuals on an area of 13–21 m2. A principal component analysis of the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA data reveals clinal variation of genetic composition across the population. as predicted by the neighbourhood concept. An analysis of molecular variance indicates substantial genetic structuring.

However. many phylogeographical studies often lack sampling designs intensive enough to precisely localize these refugia. The hairy land snail Trochulus villosus has a small range centred on Switzerland. which could be intensively covered by sampling 455 individuals from 52 populations.

Females are. therefore. predicted to avoid such conspicuous males under predation risk. The present study was designed to investigate predator-induced changes of female mating preferences in Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana). Males of this species show a pronounced polymorphism in body size and coloration. and females prefer large. colorful males in the absence of predators. In dichotomous choice tests predator-naïve (lab-reared) females altered their initial preference for larger males in the presence of the cichlid Cichlasoma salvini. a natural predator of P. mexicana. and preferred small males instead. This effect was considerably weaker when females were confronted visually with the non-piscivorous cichlid Vieja bifasciata or the introduced non-piscivorous Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In contrast. predator experienced (wild-caught) females did not respond to the same extent to the presence of a predator. most likely due to a learned ability to evaluate their predators' motivation to prey. Our study highlights that (a) predatory fish can have a profound influence on the expression of mating preferences of their prey (thus potentially affecting the strength of sexual selection). and females may alter their mate choice behavior strategically to reduce their own exposure to predators. (b) Prey species can evolve visual predator recognition mechanisms and alter their mate choice only when a natural predator is present.

If males use social information and copy other males’ choices. this leads to an increased likelihood of sperm competition for both. the copying and the copied male. In livebearing fishes (Poeciliidae). males appear to avoid the risk of being copied by temporarily moving away from preferred females and approaching nonpreferred ones (“audience effect”). thereby exploiting the rival’s propensity to copy. Responding to rival presence with an audience effect bears the risk of losing the initially preferred female. which may swim away. but may help to reduce sperm competition intensity. Males may rate this risk–benefit ratio differentially depending on their personality. for example. more risk-taking (bolder) males might be more likely to respond to an audience …,True,A3atQswAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,37,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/26/5/1314/242379,6159779259132377944,/scholar?cites=6159779259132377944,,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/26/5/1314/242379,0,0,0

In most species. however. males that engage in same-sex sexual behaviour also mate with females. and in theory. same-sex mating could even increase male reproductive fitness if males improve their chances of future heterosexual mating. Females regularly use social information to choose a mate; e.g. male attractiveness increases after a male has interacted sexually with a female (mate choice copying).

In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs. and females from adjacent non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate choice component of premating isolation in this system. We characterized focal females for their personality and found behavioral measures of ‘novel object exploration’. ‘boldness’ and ‘activity in an unknown area’ to be highly repeatable.

We found a species composition that is dominated by invasive species containing the same species as 15 years ago.

We caught guppies of all sizes. and densities of 3.6 adult guppies per square meter were comparable to densities found in their natural distribution area. pointing toward a self-sustaining population in the Gillbach. The CTmin varied between populations and was significantly lower in ornamental and Gillbach guppies compared to guppies from Venezuela. Despite differences in CTmin and their well-known potential to adapt to new environments. guppies originally stem from the tropics. and a further spread will likely be restricted by low winter temperatures.

Beside natural selection. sexual selection via phenotype-assortative mating is thought to promote reproductive isolation. Using the neotropical fish Poecilia mexicana from a system that has been described to undergo incipient ecological speciation in adjacent. but ecologically divergent habitats characterized by the presence or absence of toxic H2S and darkness in cave habitats. we demonstrate a gradual change in male body colouration along the gradient of light/darkness. including a reduction of ornaments that are under both inter- and intrasexual selection in surface populations. In dichotomous choice tests using video-animated stimuli. we found surface females to prefer males from their own population over the cave phenotype. However. female cave fish. observed on site via infrared techniques. preferred to associate with surface males rather than size-matched cave males. likely reflecting the female preference for better-nourished (in this case: surface) males. Hence. divergent selection on body colouration indeed translates into phenotype-assortative mating in the surface ecotype. by selecting against potential migrant males. Female cave fish. by contrast. do not have a preference for the resident male phenotype. identifying natural selection against migrants imposed by the cave environment as the major driver of the observed reproductive isolation.,True,A3atQswAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,15,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/148348/abs/,7875149432574680174,/scholar?cites=7875149432574680174,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/148348/abs/,0,0,0

One of the successful colonizers of this cave is the poeciliid fish Poecilia mexicana. which has received considerable attention as a model organism to examine evolutionary adaptations to extreme environmental conditions. Nonetheless. basic ecological data on the endemic cave molly population are still missing; here we aim to provide data on population densities. size class compositions and use of different microhabitats. We found high overall densities in the cave and highest densities at the middle part of the cave with more than 200 individuals per square meter. These sites have lower H2S concentrations compared to the inner parts where most large sulfide sources are located. but they are annually exposed to a religious harvesting ceremony of local Zoque people called La Pesca. We found a marked shift in size/age compositions towards an overabundance of smaller. juvenile fish at those sites. We discuss these findings in relation to several environmental gradients within the cave (i.e.. differences in toxicity and lighting conditions). but we also tentatively argue that the annual fish harvest during a religious ceremony (La Pesca) locally diminishes competition (and possibly. cannibalism by large adults). which is followed by a phase of overcompensation of fish densities.,True,A3atQswAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,14,https://peerj.com/articles/490,7412509297037089424,/scholar?cites=7412509297037089424,,https://peerj.com/articles/490,0,0,0

Phylogenetically. they are riven with controversy. Previous morphology-based phylogenetic studies have been greatly hampered by rampant parallelism in morphological characters or by incomplete taxon sampling. Based on sequences of nuclear 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA as well as mitochondrial 16S rRNA and COI DNA from 56 taxa. we reconstructed the phylogeny of Euthyneura utilising Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The evolution of colonization of freshwater and terrestrial habitats by pulmonate Euthyneura. considered crucial in the evolution of this group of Gastropoda. is reconstructed with Bayesian approaches. We found several well supported clades within Euthyneura. however. we could not confirm the traditional classification. since Pulmonata are paraphyletic and Opistobranchia are either polyphyletic or paraphyletic with several clades clearly distinguishable. Sacoglossa appear separately from the rest of the Opisthobranchia as sister taxon to basal Pulmonata. Within Pulmonata. Basommatophora are paraphyletic and Hygrophila and Eupulmonata form monophyletic clades. Pyramidelloidea are placed within Euthyneura rendering the Euthyneura paraphyletic. Based on the current phylogeny. it can be proposed for the first time that invasion of freshwater by Pulmonata is a unique evolutionary event and has taken place directly from the marine environment via an aquatic pathway.

Analysis of biogeochemical bulk parameters. selected metals. pigment concentrations as well as grain size distributions revealed a significant spatial heterogeneity in surface sediment composition. It implies that sedimentation in Lake Ohrid is controlled by an interaction of multiple natural and anthropogenic factors and processes.

1112901,Freshwater biogeography and limnological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau-insights from a plateau-wide distributed gastropod taxon (Radix spp.),2011,Parm Viktor von Oheimb and Christian Albrecht and Frank Riedel and Lina Du and Junxing Yang and David C Aldridge and Ulrich Bößneck and Hucai Zhang and Thomas Wilke,6,PloS one,10,e26307,Public Library of Science,Background The Tibetan Plateau is not only the highest and largest plateau on earth; it is also home to numerous freshwater lakes potentially harbouring endemic faunal elements. As it remains largely unknown whether these lakes have continuously existed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). questions arise as to whether taxa have been able to exist on the plateau since before the latest Pleistocene. from where and how often the plateau was colonized. and by which mechanisms organisms conquered remote high altitude lentic freshwater systems. In this study. species of the plateau-wide distributed freshwater gastropod genus Radix are used to answer these biogeographical questions.   Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a broad spatial sampling of Radix spp. on the Tibetan Plateau. and phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA sequence data. three probably endemic and one widespread major Radix clade could be identified on the plateau. Two of the endemic clades show a remarkably high genetic diversity. indicating a relatively great phylogenetic age. Phylogeographical analyses of individuals belonging to the most widely distributed clade indicate that intra-plateau distribution cannot be explained by drainage-related dispersal alone.   Conclusions/Significance Our study reveals that Radix spp. persisted throughout the LGM on the Tibetan Plateau. Therefore. we assume the continuous existence of suitable water bodies during that time. The extant Radix diversity on the plateau might have been caused by multiple colonization events combined with a relatively long intra-plateau evolution. At least one colonization event has a …,True,W9T9oXIAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,51,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026307,8437354567703942836,/scholar?cites=8437354567703942836,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026307,0,0,0

Dordrecht,The morphologically remarkable endemic fauna within ancient lakes has received much attention in the literature. More inconspicuous taxa. however. often lack detailed molecular and morphometrical examination. although their proportion of the endemic fauna of an ancient lake must not be underestimated. Consequently. a better understanding of evolutionary patterns and processes within these lakes requires more knowledge about the often-neglected inconspicuous taxa. In the present study. we focus on the notoriously cryptic pea clam genus Pisidium (Bivalvia: Sphaeriidae). Though the genus is widely distributed. most endemic species are reported only from ancient lakes. including the European ancient sister lake system of Ohrid and Prespa on the Balkan Peninsula.

This is particularly true for so-called ancient lakes. While these lakes are famous for being evolutionary theatres. often displaying an extraordinarily high degree of biodiversity and endemism. in many cases these biota are also experiencing extreme anthropogenic impact. Lake Ohrid. a major European biodiversity hotspot situated in a trans-frontier setting on the Balkans. is a prime example for a lake with a magnitude of narrow range endemic taxa that are under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Unfortunately. evidence for a"" creeping biodiversity crisis"" has accumulated over the last decades. and major socio-political changes have gone along with human-mediated environmental changes. Based on field surveys. monitoring data. published records. and expert interviews. we aimed to (1) assess threats to Lake Ohrids'(endemic) biodiversity.(2) summarize existing conservation activities and strategies. and (3) outline future conservation needs for Lake Ohrid.

A substantial part of this diversity is attributed to well recognized and potential ancient lakes in its southwestern part. However. despite considerable research efforts. faunal relationships among those lakes are not well understood. Therefore. genetic information from native representatives of the mussel genus Dreissena is here used to test the biogeographical zonation of the southwestern Balkans. to relate demographic changes to environmental changes. to assess the degree of eco-insularity. to reconstruct their evolutionary history. and to explore the potential of native taxa for becoming invasive.

However. the spatial and temporal origin of the first invasive population (s) in Western Europe as well as subsequent spreading routes still remain under discussion. In this study. we therefore aim at reconstructing the early invasion history of the quagga mussel in Western Europe based on an age-corrected temporally and spatially explicit spread model. Data were derived from time-series studies at selected sites as well as from a broad spatial survey in Western Europe. According to our spread model. the first successful introduction into Western Europe occurred in the Main-Danube Canal in early 2004. probably via inland navigation. Once populations were established. subsequent spread of the quagga mussel was characterized by a combination of jump dispersal and diffusive spread.

K Ca 3.1 has been proposed to exert pivotal oncogenic functions in tumorigenesis. malignant progression. metastasis. and therapy resistance. Moreover. K Ca 3.1 is expressed by tumor-promoting stroma cells such as fibroblasts and the tumor vasculature suggesting a role of K Ca 3.1 in the adaptation of the tumor microenvironment. Combined. this features K Ca 3.1 as a candidate target for innovative anti-cancer therapy. However. immune cells also express K Ca 3.1 thereby contributing to T cell activation. Thus. any strategy targeting K Ca 3.1 in anti-cancer therapy may also modulate anti-tumor immune activity and/or immunosuppression. The present review article highlights the potential of K Ca 3.1 as an anti-tumor target providing an overview of the current knowledge on its function in tumor pathogenesis with emphasis on vasculo-and angiogenesis as well as anti-cancer immune responses.

Here we report of a fish living in a Mexican cave (Cueva del Azufre) that is rich in highly toxic H2S. We compared the water chemistry and fish communities of the cave and several nearby surface streams. Our study revealed high concentrations of H2S in the cave and its outflow (El Azufre). The concentrations of H2S reach more than 300 μM inside the cave. which are acutely toxic for most fishes. In both sulfidic habitats. the diversity of fishes was heavily reduced. and Poecilia mexicana was the dominant species indicating that the presence of H2S has an all-or-none effect. permitting only few species to survive in sulfidic habitats.

But how does this process generally unfold in nature? We argue that answering this question requires a clearer conceptual framework for understanding selection’s role in speciation. We present a unified framework of speciation. providing mechanistic descriptions of fundamentally distinct routes to speciation. and how these may interact during lineage splitting. Two major categories are recognized: reproductive isolation resulting from (1) responses to selection. “speciation by selection.” or (2) non-selective processes. “speciation without selection.” Speciation by selection can occur via three mechanisms: (1) similar selection.

Females are. therefore. predicted to avoid such conspicuous males under predation risk. The present study was designed to investigate predator-induced changes of female mating preferences in Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana). Males of this species show a pronounced polymorphism in body size and coloration. and females prefer large. colorful males in the absence of predators. In dichotomous choice tests predator-naïve (lab-reared) females altered their initial preference for larger males in the presence of the cichlid Cichlasoma salvini. a natural predator of P. mexicana. and preferred small males instead. This effect was considerably weaker when females were confronted visually with the non-piscivorous cichlid Vieja bifasciata or the introduced non-piscivorous Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In contrast. predator experienced (wild-caught) females did not respond to the same extent to the presence of a predator. most likely due to a learned ability to evaluate their predators' motivation to prey. Our study highlights that (a) predatory fish can have a profound influence on the expression of mating preferences of their prey (thus potentially affecting the strength of sexual selection). and females may alter their mate choice behavior strategically to reduce their own exposure to predators. (b) Prey species can evolve visual predator recognition mechanisms and alter their mate choice only when a natural predator is present.

The gynogenetic Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa) requires sperm from sexual males (e.g. Poecilia latipinna) to trigger embryogenesis. but inheritance is strictly maternal. Consequently. males should try to avoid or reduce the cost of mating with asexuals. We investigated male mate choice by documenting the presence of sperm in natural populations and found that a higher proportion of sexual females had sperm than asexuals. In addition. among those females that had sperm. sexuals had more sperm than asexuals.

Previous work has demonstrated in adult specimens that fish from these extreme habitats convergently evolved drastically increased head and offspring size. while cave fish are further characterized by reduced pigmentation and eye size.

Poecilia sulphuraria from a sulphidic surface spring (“sulphur mollies”). We asked at which points during development changes in the timing of the involved processes (i.e.. heterochrony) would be detectible.   Methods and Results Data were extracted from digital photographs taken of representative embryos for each stage of development and each type of molly. Embryo mass decreased in convergent fashion. but we found patterns of embryonic fat content and ovum/embryo diameter to be divergent among all three types of mollies. The intensity of yellow colouration of the yolk (a proxy for carotenoid content) was significantly lower in cave mollies throughout development. Moreover. while relative head size decreased through development in surface mollies. it increased in both types of extremophile mollies. and eye growth was arrested in mid-stage embryos of cave mollies but not in surface or sulphur mollies.

Inc.,Genetic diversity among laboratory and field populations of Chironomus riparius was investigated using microsatellite DNA analysis. Individuals of midge cultures reared in 10 different laboratories showed a clear reduction in the number of alleles per locus and in the level of heterozygosity compared to two natural populations sampled in southern Germany. To reconstruct the rate of genetic impoverishment under laboratory conditions. genetic diversity was monitored in a C. riparius laboratory population for 23 generations. Additionally. 11 populations originating from different laboratories were crossed. and genetic diversity was compared among pure. crossed. and natural populations.

Traditionally. several subspecies are recognised by morphology and mitochondrial haplotype. each linked to a relict population. During various reintroduction programs in the 20th century. beavers from multiple source localities were released and now form viable populations. These programs differed in their reintroduction strategies. i.e.. using pure subspecies vs. mixed source populations. This inhomogeneity in management actions generated ongoing debates regarding the origin of present beaver populations and appropriate management plans for the future. By sequencing of the mitochondrial control region and microsatellite genotyping of 235 beaver individuals from five selected regions in Germany. Switzerland. Luxembourg. and Belgium we show that beavers from at least four source origins currently form admixed. genetically diverse populations that spread across the study region. While regional occurrences of invasive North American beavers (n = 20) were found. all but one C. fiber bore the mitochondrial haplotype of the autochthonous western Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). Considering this. as well as the viability of admixed populations and the fact that the fusion of different lineages is already progressing in all studied regions. we argue that admixture between different beaver source populations should be generally accepted.,True,GZMmvIEAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097619,9515675903328020122,/scholar?cites=9515675903328020122,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097619,0,0,0

However. as each ancient lake has its own geological and evolutionary history. modes of speciation may differ from system to system. Ancient lakes can act as evolutionary reservoirs that assure the survival of relict species. but at the same time extant species may evolve through intralacustrine speciation. Other aspects of interest are the actual rates of immigration. diversification or extinction as well as the temporal framework of morphological change.

Most of the clones showed a significant response in one to four traits. with no evidence for an association between different traits. Clones from fish habitats were slightly more responsive to the presence of fish kairomones than clones from fishless locations.

However. such dynamics have not been considered at higher taxonomic levels. for example. between parental species and their hybrids. In a field study on a Daphnia hybrid system. we observed that one Daphnia taxon first was relatively under-infected. but became over-infected after a strong increase in frequency. This finding is consistent with the idea of parasite evolution towards the most frequent host taxon. In two experiments. we investigated whether the assumptions made by a model of negative frequency-dependent selection apply to our host taxa system. First. we showed that the parasite can change the outcome of taxa competition and secondly. we confirmed that the over-infection of one host taxon observed in the field has a …,True,WaW1GaAAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,72,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2006.3523,2596770287577537530,/scholar?cites=2596770287577537530,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1634769/,0,0,0

The ultimate explanation for diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton is the avoidance of visual predation in surface waters. Studies on migrating zooplankton have shown that remaining in the cold and food‐poor hypolimnion during the day. however. has demographic costs. Higher temperatures and greater food concentrations in the surface waters are thought to be the main reasons why Daphnia species move upwards at night.2. In this study. we investigated the growth condition of daphniids raised on seston taken from different depths from a lake with and without a deep‐water chlorophyll maximum.3. Juvenile growth rates of Daphnia galeata x hyalina from the lake without a deep‐water chlorophyll maximum were similar for all treatments. After temperature correction. however. growth rates were significantly higher on seston taken from the surface layers.4.

We found that D. galeata occurs more frequently south of the Alps. whereas D. hyalina and D. cucullata are found more in the north. Lakes with D. galeata dominance had higher temperatures whereas D. hyalina dominance could be attributed to low phosphorus loads.

Were this to be so. it would imply that foraging and predator avoidance place conflicting demands on these animals. since an increase in the feeding radius on the surface would be associated with a decrease in the burying depth. and vice versa. The paper presents methods with which to measure siphon length and equations to transform siphon weight to siphon length in two benthic bivalves. Scrobicularia plana and Macoma balthica. Relatively heavy siphons are longer. but also thicker. than lightweight ones. We conclude that most individual bivalves stretch their siphons fully while feeding.

In order to distinguish species. it is necessary that taxonomic characters allow for the separation of individuals into recognisable. homogeneous groups that differ from other such groups in a consistent way. We compared here the suitability and efficacy of traditionally used shell morphology and DNA-based methods to distinguish among species of the freshwater snail genus Radix (Basommatophora. Pulmonata). Morphometric analysis showed that shell shape was unsuitable to define homogeneous. recognisable entities. because the variation was continuous. On the other hand. the Molecularly defined Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU). inferred from mitochondrial COI sequence variation. proved to be congruent with biological species. inferred from geographic distribution patterns. congruence with nuclear markers and crossing experiments. Moreover. it could be shown that the phenotypically plastic shell variation is mostly determined by the environmental conditions experienced. Contrary to DNA-taxonomy. shell morphology was not suitable for delimiting and recognising species in Radix.

We compared transcriptomes among four Daphnia galeata populations and identified transcripts potentially responding to local thermal selection based on an extensive literature search for candidate genes possibly under thermal selection in arthropods.

It has an influence on the adaptive potential to environmental change and the capability to adapt locally. Adaptation to environmental change happens at the population level. thereby contributing to genotypic and phenotypic variation within a species. Predation is an important ecological factor structuring communities and maintaining species diversity. Prey developed different strategies to reduce their vulnerability to predators by changing their behaviour. their morphology or their life history. Predator-induced life history responses in Daphnia have been investigated for decades. but intra-and inter-population variability was rarely addressed explicitly. We addressed this issue by conducting a common garden experiment with 24 clonal lines of European Daphnia galeata originating from four populations. each represented by six clonal lines. We recorded life history traits in the absence and presence of fish kairomones. Additionally. we looked at the shape of experimental individuals by conducting a geometric morphometric analysis. thus assessing predator-induced morphometric changes. Our data revealed high intraspecific phenotypic variation within and between four D. galeata populations. the potential to locally adapt to a vertebrate predator regime as well as an effect of the fish kairomones on morphology of D. galeata.,True,Jj5vZo0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,13,https://peerj.com/articles/5746/,17993883596578511233,/scholar?cites=17993883596578511233,,https://peerj.com/articles/5746/,0,0,0

Combining both approaches by linking genetic analyses and life‐history measurements. a potential genotype–phenotype relationship can be assessed and adaptation at the molecular level demonstrated.

Temperatures are predicted to rise by up to 4 C by 2100 in certain areas. associated with changes in precipitation patterns. This profound change in environmental conditions will probably strongly influence the diversity and distribution of species world wide (Gates. 1993). Numerous studies assessed the impact of climate change on diverse taxa. such as butterflies (Parmesan et al.. 1999). amphibians and reptiles (Araujo et al.. 2006). forest herbs (Skov & Svenning. 2004). most of them relying on Ecological Niche Modelling to predict future suitable areas for the analysed taxa. This method predicts potential distributions for species by deriving an environmental envelope from known distribution points and projecting this envelope onto a spatially interpolated climate surface of an area. Ecological modelling has been used to accurately model the present distribution of many species (eg Peterson. 2001; Anderson et al.. 2002; Hijmans & Graham. 2006). However. such approaches necessarily make inferences based on the realised niche rather than on the fundamental niche. and are therefore biased. The fundamental niche is a theoretical construct and represents the total range which could be occupied by a species if there were no competition. predation and historical factors that limit its observed range (Hutchinson. 1957). but see (Emerson & Gillespie. 2008. for a glossary).

The accumulation of deleterious mutations and gene combinations that cannot be purged should lead to extinction of parthenogenetic forms within 10 4–10 5 generations 7. 8. Evidence is accumulating. however. that some of these might have survived for such periods or even longer 9–14. In the Amazon Molly fish Poecilia Formosa we have detected a process that appears to compensate for disadvantages of asexuality. namely incorporation of subgenomic amounts of DNA from a bisexual host species by microchromosomes.,True,ldIUhWAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,217,https://www.nature.com/articles/373068a0,6036855843797471859,/scholar?cites=6036855843797471859,,,0,0,0
1113069,The evolutionary ecology of gynogenesis,2005,Ingo Schlupp,36,,,399-417,Annual Reviews,Most metazoans engage in recombination every generation. In theory this is associated with considerable cost. such as the production of males. so that asexual organisms. which do not pay this cost. should be able to invade populations of sexuals. Some asexuals depend on sperm of sexual males to trigger embryogenesis. a reproductive mode called gynogenesis. The genetic information of males is typically not used. Theory predicts that such mating complexes are short-lived and highly unstable. Sperm dependency is not only the defining feature of the biology of gynogenetic metazoans. it is also a major puzzle in evolutionary biology. Organisms that apparently combine disadvantages of both sexuality and asexuality are a serious challenge to theory.

Female mate-copying thus contributes to the maintenance of this asexual-sexual species complex by providing an advantage to male sailfin mollies that mate with Amazon females; because of mate-copying these males increase their attractiveness to conspecific females. Here we show that male mate-copying. an unreported phenomenon. also occurs and that it can reverse male preferences for conspecific females.

Courting males display in front of the females. but males attempting to sneak-copulate approach females from behind. that is. in the blind portion of their visual field. and force copulations. which can be viewed as a male persistence trait.

We suggest that video playback is probably suitable for studying motion. shape. texture. size. and brightness. Studying color is problematic because video systems are specifically designed for humans. Any difference in color perception must lead to a different color sensation in most animals. Another potentially problematic limitation of video images is that they lack depth cues derived from stereopsis. accommodation. and motion parallax. Nonetheless. when used appropriately. video playback allows an unprecedented range of questions in visual communication to be addressed. It is important to note that most of the potential limitations of video playback are not unique to this technique but are relevant to all studies of visual signaling in animals.,True,ldIUhWAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,94,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s102110000019.pdf,10774254958540095182,/scholar?cites=10774254958540095182,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/191385695.pdf,0,0,0

This type of environment imposes addi-tional selection pressures on both signallers and receivers other than those classically considered in signaller-receiver dyads. In this chapter. we shall discuss how communication networks influence the behaviour of a signaller and. more specifically. the effect of an audience (defined below) on signalling behaviour. An individual signaller has to cope with two main issues when signalling in a network:(a) it has to compete or cooperate with other signallers. and (b) it has to deal with the presence of several receivers. Signalling at the same time as other individuals poses a problem for the signaller: how does it ensure that its specific signal is detected by a receiver when other conspecifics are signalling? Signallers solve or minimize this problem by either cooperating or competing for the signal broadcast space. For example. in frog and insect choruses. individuals time their signals to avoid acoustic interference (eg alternating their calls) or compete for call order in the chorus (Gerhardt & Huber. 2002; Ch. 13). At the community level. different species with similar signals may broadcast their signals at different times of the day (Endler. 1992).The presence of several receivers presents two additional problems for the signaller. The first is how to direct the signal to a specific receiver. For example. bird song often has a range that encompasses several neighbouring territories. When a bird sings. the song could potentially reach all the neighbours in surrounding ter-ritories.

Amazon mollies (Poecilia formosa) require sperm to trigger embryogenesis. but the males (e.g. Poecilia mexicana) do not contribute genes. Males benefit from mating with Amazon mollies. because such matings make males more attractive to conspecific females. but they might control the cost of such matings by providing less sperm to Amazon mollies. We examined this at the behavioural and sperm levels. P. mexicana males preferred to mate with. and transferred more sperm to conspecific females.

Taylor & Francis Group,Not much more than fifteen years ago. the first decapod phylogenies based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences revolutionized decapod phylogenetics. Initially. this method was accepted only reluctantly. However. a wider understanding of the methods. and the realization that credibility of specific branching patterns can be measured by statistic confidence values. allowed the recognition of molecular systematics as just another phylogenetic approach. in which homologous characters are compared and interpreted in terms of apomorphic or plesiomorphic status. and best possible trees are calculated based on distances. parsimony. or likelihoods. Similar to morphological characters. some of the shared molecular characters can result from convergence. but the large quantity of potential characters to be compared (15.000-17.000 in mtDNA) promises to reveal phylogenetic signal. For many years. preference was given to mitochondrial genes among the molecular markers. because of the relative ease with which they can be amplified (stable and numerous copies per cell) and interpreted (because they are only maternally inherited and lack introns and recombination). and because of higher mutation rates and thus greater variability than nuclear DNA. More recently. some of these apparent advantages were interpreted as shortcomings of mtDNA. and the discovery of selective sweeps. mitochondrial introgressions. and nuclear copies of mtDNA (numts) have questioned the credibility of phylogenies based exclusively on mtDNA.

They can occur in crowds (large aggregations). in small groups. or as socially monogamous pairs. Shrimps from this genus are rare. if not unique among crustaceans. because of their unusual sexual system. To date. the sexual system of all species investigated comprises a protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism: shrimps initially mature and reproduce as males and later in life turn into functional simultaneous hermaphrodites. The evolutionary relationships of the species within the genus are unsettled.

We here apply the five criteria of Eastman and McCune for detecting species flocks in four taxonomic components of the benthic fauna of the Antarctic shelf: teleost fishes. crinoids (feather stars). echinoids (sea urchins) and crustacean arthropods. Practical limitations led us to prioritize the three historical criteria (endemicity. monophyly. species richness) over the two ecological ones (ecological diversity and habitat dominance). We propose a new protocol which includes an iterative fine-tuning of the monophyly and endemicity criteria in order to discover unsuspected flocks. As a result nine « full » species flocks (fulfilling the five criteria) are briefly described. Eight other flocks fit the three historical criteria but need to be further investigated from the ecological point of view (here called « core flocks »). The approach also shows that some candidate taxonomic components are no species flocks at all. The present study contradicts the paradigm that marine species flocks are rare. The hypothesis according to which the Antarctic shelf acts as a species flocks generator is supported. and the approach indicates paths for further ecological studies and may serve as a starting point to investigate the processes leading to flock-like patterning of biodiversity.,True,Rqplhi8AAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,58,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068787,15953739960169218907,/scholar?cites=15953739960169218907,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068787,0,0,0

Females are. therefore. predicted to avoid such conspicuous males under predation risk. The present study was designed to investigate predator-induced changes of female mating preferences in Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana). Males of this species show a pronounced polymorphism in body size and coloration. and females prefer large. colorful males in the absence of predators. In dichotomous choice tests predator-naïve (lab-reared) females altered their initial preference for larger males in the presence of the cichlid Cichlasoma salvini. a natural predator of P. mexicana. and preferred small males instead. This effect was considerably weaker when females were confronted visually with the non-piscivorous cichlid Vieja bifasciata or the introduced non-piscivorous Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). In contrast. predator experienced (wild-caught) females did not respond to the same extent to the presence of a predator. most likely due to a learned ability to evaluate their predators' motivation to prey. Our study highlights that (a) predatory fish can have a profound influence on the expression of mating preferences of their prey (thus potentially affecting the strength of sexual selection). and females may alter their mate choice behavior strategically to reduce their own exposure to predators.

Tadpoles can provide key information for conservation issues and the understanding of amphibian evolution. Moreover. research in tadpoles has the potential to advance species delimitation in the diverse and still understudied Neotropical amphibian fauna. In this study we present morphological tadpole characterisations of 41 lowland species illustrated by detailed imagery (mainly of live specimens). The larvae were identified via captive breeding and genetically using recently published DNA barcodes of adult Bolivian frogs. Tadpoles of three species (Rhinella mirandaribeiroi. Dendropsophus melanargyreus. and D. salli) are described for the first time. The descriptions of 38 tadpoles are at least new for Bolivia (due to the divergent status of many of the Bolivian lineages. further studies are needed to clarify their taxonomy). In addition. we provide information on tadpole habitats. which—combined with morphological data—reveal ecomorphological guilds that further illustrate Bolivia's lowlands tadpole diversity.,True,5eoloyQAAAAJ:0N-VGjzr574C,53,https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4016.1.1,2165599317221776604,/scholar?cites=2165599317221776604,,https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4016.1.1,0,0,0

Within the Mabuya group. Asian members appear to have diverged first. leaving the Neotropical and the Afro-Malagasy Mabuya as sister groups. These relationships. together with the absence of extant or fossil representatives of the Mabuya group from North America. strongly suggest the trans-Atlantic dispersals of Mabuya from Africa to Neotropics. Our results also indicated a closer affinity of the New World Scincella with the New World Sphenomorphus than with the Old World Scincella.

(b) whether there is gradual variation in phenotypic divergence reflecting variation in the strength of natural selection among populations. (c) whether the extent of this divergence is correlated between multiple character suites (i.e.. concerted evolution). and (d) whether gradual variation in phenotypic divergence predicts the degree of reproductive isolation. pointing towards a role for adaptation as a driver of (ecological) speciation. Here. we use poeciliid fishes of the genera Gambusia and Poecilia that have repeatedly evolved extremophile lineages able to tolerate high and sustained levels of toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to answer these questions. We investigated evolutionary divergence in response to H2S in Gambusia spp. (and to a lesser extent Poecilia spp.) using a multivariate approach considering the interplay of life history. body shape. and population genetics (nuclear miscrosatellites to infer population genetic differentiation as a proxy for reproductive isolation). We uncovered both shared and unique patterns of evolution: most extremophile Gambusia predictably evolved larger heads and offspring size. matching a priori predictions for adaptation to sulfidic waters. while variation in adult life histories was idiosyncratic. When investigating patterns for both genera (Gambusia and Poecilia). we found that divergence in offspring-related life histories and body shape were positively correlated across populations. but evidence for individual-level associations …,True,9jJHFwwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,26,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0705-1,6238764627531223497,/scholar?cites=6238764627531223497,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0705-1,0,0,0

Mating preferences often show considerable individual variation. and whether or not certain individuals are more likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied. In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs. and females from adjacent non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate choice component of premating isolation in this system. We characterized focal females for their personality and found behavioral measures of ‘novel object exploration’. ‘boldness’ and ‘activity in an unknown area’ to be highly repeatable. Furthermore. the interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness affected focal females’ strength of preference (SOP) for the resident male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over alien mating partners in bold. but not shy. females. Shy and/or little explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the non-resident phenotype and thus. are more likely to contribute to rare population hybridization.

The Gillbach. a tributary of the river Erft in Germany. receives thermally polluted cooling water from a power plant. Here. we present data on the composition of the fish community in the Gillbach and found a high abundance of invasive species from all over the world. mostly introduced by releases from home aquaria. We found a species composition that is dominated by invasive species containing the same species as 15 years ago. We focused on guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and determined population size using the mark-recapture method. Furthermore. we investigated the lower thermal tolerance limit (CTmin) to determine if Gillbach guppies have already adapted to colder conditions compared to ornamental and Venezuelan wild type fish. We caught guppies of all sizes. and densities of 3.6 adult guppies per square meter were comparable to densities found in their natural distribution area. pointing toward a self-sustaining population in the Gillbach. The CTmin varied between populations and was significantly lower in ornamental and Gillbach guppies compared to guppies from Venezuela. Despite differences in CTmin and their well-known potential to adapt to new environments. guppies originally stem from the tropics. and a further spread will likely be restricted by low winter temperatures.

We collected Gammarus roeselii from 16 sampling sites in the Rhine catchment during two consecutive seasons (summer and winter). Altogether. we dissected n = 1648 individuals and quantified key parameters related to morphological and life-history diversification. including naturally selected (e.g.. gill surface areas) as well as primarily sexually selected traits (e.g.. male antennae). Acknowledging the complexity of selective regimes in streams and the interrelated nature of selection factors. we assessed several abiotic (e.g.. temperature. flow velocity) and biotic ecological parameters (e.g.. conspecific densities. sex ratios) and condensed them into four principal components (PCs). Generalized least squares models revealed pronounced phenotypic differentiation in most of the traits investigated herein. and components of the stream gradient (PCs) explained parts of the observed differences.

Mating preferences often show considerable individual variation. and whether or not certain individuals are more likely to contribute to population interbreeding remains to be studied. In the Poecilia mexicana-species complex different ecotypes have adapted to hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-toxic springs. and females from adjacent non-sulfidic habitats prefer resident over sulfide-adapted males. We asked if consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) predict the strength and direction of the mate choice component of premating isolation in this system. We characterized focal females for their personality and found behavioral measures of ‘novel object exploration’. ‘boldness’ and ‘activity in an unknown area’ to be highly repeatable. Furthermore. the interaction term between our measures of exploration and boldness affected focal females’ strength of preference (SOP) for the resident male phenotype in dichotomous association preference tests. High exploration tendencies were coupled with stronger SOPs for resident over alien mating partners in bold. but not shy. females. Shy and/or little explorative females had an increased likelihood of preferring the non-resident phenotype and thus. are more likely to contribute to rare population hybridization.

The present study was designed to investigate predator avoidance of extremophile populations of Poecilia mexicana and P. sulphuraria that either live in hydrogen sulfide-rich (sulfidic) springs or cave habitats. both of which are known to have impoverished piscine predator regimes. Focal fishes that inhabited sulfidic springs showed slightly weaker avoidance reactions when presented with several naturally occurring predatory cichlids. but strongest differences to populations from non-sulfidic habitats were found in a decreased shoaling tendency with non-predatory swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii) females. When comparing avoidance reactions between P. mexicana from a sulfidic cave (Cueva del Azufre) and the adjacent sulfidic surface creek (El Azufre). we found only slight differences in predator avoidance. but surface fish reacted much more strongly to the non-predatory cichlid Vieja bifasciata. Our third experiment was designed to disentangle learned from innate effects of predator recognition. We compared laboratory-reared (ie. predator-naïve) and wild-caught (ie. predator-experienced) individuals of P. mexicana from a non-sulfidic river and found no differences in their reaction towards the presented predators. Overall. our results indicate (1) that predator avoidance is still functional in extremophile Poecilia spp. and (2) that predator recognition and avoidance reactions have a strong genetic basis.

Populations in the Poecilia mexicana species complex have independently adapted to toxic hydrogen sulfide and show varying degrees of RI. Here. we examined the variation in the mate choice component of prezygotic RI. Mate choice tests across drainages (with stimulus males from another drainage) suggest that specific features of the males coupled with a general female preference for yellow color patterns explain the observed variation. Analyses of male body coloration identified the intensity of yellow fin coloration as a strong candidate to explain this pattern. and common-garden rearing suggested heritable population differences. Male sexual ornamentation apparently evolved differently across sulfide-adapted populations. for example because of differences in natural counterselection via predation. The ubiquitous preference for yellow color ornaments in poeciliid females likely undermines the emergence of strong RI. as female discrimination in favor of own males becomes weaker when yellow fin coloration in the respective sulfide ecotype increases. Our study illustrates the complexity of the (partly non-parallel) pathways to divergence among replicated ecological gradients. We suggest that future work should identify the genomic loci involved in the pattern reported here. making use of the increasing genomic and transcriptomic datasets available for our study system.

1113222,Single-locus recessive inheritance of asexual reproduction in a parasitoid wasp,2011,Christoph Sandrock and Christoph Vorburger,21,Current biology,5,433-437,Cell Press,The evolutionary maintenance of sex is one of the big unresolved puzzles in biology [1]. All else being equal. all-female asexual populations should enjoy a two-fold reproductive advantage over sexual relatives consisting of male and female individuals [1]. However. the “all else being equal” assumption rarely holds in real organisms because asexuality tends to be confounded with altered genomic constitutions such as hybridization [2] and polyploidization [3] or to be associated with parthenogenesis-inducing microbes [4. 5]. This limits the ability to draw general conclusions from any particular system. Here we describe a new system that permits unbiased comparisons of sexual and asexual reproduction: the parasitic wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum. Crossing experiments demonstrated that asexual reproduction has a simple genetic basis in this species and is consistently inherited as a single-locus recessive trait.

The distribution of life cycle variation in aphids is generally determined by ecological forces. mainly climate. because only sexually produced diapausing eggs can survive harsh winters or periods of absence of suitable host plants.

Negative frequency‐dependence emerges readily if interactions between hosts and parasites are genotype‐specific such that no host genotype is most resistant to all parasite genotypes. and no parasite genotype is most infective on all hosts. Although there is increasing evidence for genotype specificity in interactions between hosts and pathogens or microparasites. the picture is less clear for insect host–parasitoid interactions.

In aphids. facultative symbionts affect host plant use and increase thermal tolerance and resistance to natural enemies. In spite of these beneficial effects on aphid fitness. the frequency of facultative symbionts in aphids ranges from low to intermediate.

Therefore. we studied the life history traits and correlations between them in 21 clones of the black bean aphid.

Thus. interest in integrating insects into livestock nutrition as a potentially more sustainable substitute for soybean is very important. but has been poorly researched so far. This study aimed to examine the feeding value of two origins of black soldier fly (BSF) larvae grown on two different substrates (A and B) compared to soybeanbased diets. For this purpose. 50 Lohmann Brown Classic hens (40 weeks of age) were fed five different diets for 7 weeks. The hens were randomly allocated to the diets and kept individually in enriched cages under controlled climate conditions. To determine whether the protein value of the insect material is comparable to that of soybean. the crude protein content of four of the diets (SS-. AA-. AB-. BB-) was set to a level (<15% in DM) which was slightly deficient (recommended: >16%). These diets were opposed to a control diet (SS) covering requirements. Both SS and SS- contained 15% soybean cake and 3% soybean oil. but SS- did not contain sunflower cake.

However. information about their feeding value is scarce. Therefore an experiment was carried out with organic broilers where soybean cake and oil (S) was replaced by defatted meal and fat of BSF larvae grown on two different substrates (A/B). 80 Hubbard S757 broilers were kept in pairs and fattened from day 15 to 63/64 of life with one of the five following diets: a positive control (S/S. protein meal/oil. 21% CP) complying with recommendations for this broiler type. a negative control (SS-. 18% CP). a diet with BSF meal A and fat A (AA. 17% CP). a diet with BSF meal A and BSF fat B (AB. 17% CP) or a diet with BSF meal B (BB. 17% CP. no extra fat). Diets SS-. AA. AB and BB theoretically induced a protein deficiency to determine whether the protein value of the insect material is comparable to that of soybean.

Allopatric diversification driven by geological or climatic processes has been identified as the main mechanism shaping present faunal distribution on the island. There is both consensus and conflict among range patterns of terrestrial species pointing to the different effects of vicariant events on once co-distributed taxa. Tarsiers. small nocturnal primates with possible evidence of an Eocene fossil record on the Asian mainland. are at present exclusively found in insular Southeast Asia. Sulawesi is hotspot of tarsier diversity. whereby island colonization and subsequent radiation of this old endemic primate lineage remained largely enigmatic. To resolve the phylogeographic history of Sulawesi tarsiers we analyzed an island-wide sample for a set of five approved autosomal phylogenetic markers (ABCA1. ADORA3. AXIN1. RAG1. and TTR) and the paternally inherited SRY gene. We constructed ML and Bayesian phylogenetic trees and estimated divergence times between tarsier populations. We found that their arrival at the Proto-Sulawesi archipelago coincided with initial Miocene tectonic uplift and hypothesize that tarsiers dispersed over the region in distinct waves. Intra-island diversification was spurred by land emergence and a rapid succession of glacial cycles during the Plio-Pleistocene. Some tarsier range boundaries concur with spatial limits in other taxa backing the notion of centers of faunal endemism on Sulawesi.

Depending on the intended receiver(s). latrines are either formed at territorial boundaries (between-group communication) or in core areas of home ranges (within-group communication). The relative importance of both types of marking behavior should depend. amongst other factors. on population densities and social group sizes. which tend to differ between urban and rural wildlife populations. Our study is the first to assess (direct and indirect) anthropogenic influences on mammalian latrine-based communication networks along a rural-to-urban gradient in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) living in urban. suburban and rural areas in and around Frankfurt am Main (Germany).

Species Survival Commision-IUCN and SEAPA (South East Asian Primatological Association),The aim of this study was to know the impact of human activities on population density of Tarsius dianae by estimating the relative population density in four habitat types differently influenced by man. The study was conducted in the vicinity of Kamarora. at the northeastern boundary of Lore Lindu National Park. Central Sulawesi. Four different habitats were chosen:(H1) primary or old secondary forest;(H2) secondary forest±30 years after clearance with small-scale selective logging;(H3) forest with interspersed small coffee and cocoa plantations; and (H4) forest with selective logging and plantations. The tarsiers’ sleeping sites were determined using triangulation. Relative population density was estimated by measuring the average distances between three nearest neighbors. The results suggest that different human-influenced habitat have different effects on tarsier’s density. The smallest distances (116.2±18 m) between sleeping sites. which represent the highest estimated population density (57.1 groups in one square km). were found in habitat type H1. the least disturbed habitat. Estimated population density in habitat type H3 or “forest plantations” was 38 groups/km2. followed by habitat type H2 or secondary forest with selective logging 36.4 groups/km2. and the smallest population density was estimated at 32.9 groups/km2 in habitat type H4 or forest with selective logging and plantations.,True,dTv3_TgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan_Merker/publication/266409267_RELATIVE_POPULATION_DENSITY_OF_Tarsius_dianae_IN_MAN-INFLUENCED_HABITATS_OF_LORE_LINDU_NATIONAL_PARK_CENTRAL_SULAWESI_INDONESIA/links/54b50d9b0cf2318f0f9715f9/RELATIVE-POPULATION-DENSITY-OF-Tarsius-dianae-IN-MAN-INFLUENCED-HABITATS-OF-LORE-LINDU-NATIONAL-PARK-CENTRAL-SULAWESI-INDONESIA.pdf,14798772193341561932,/scholar?cites=14798772193341561932,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan_Merker/publication/266409267_RELATIVE_POPULATION_DENSITY_OF_Tarsius_dianae_IN_MAN-INFLUENCED_HABITATS_OF_LORE_LINDU_NATIONAL_PARK_CENTRAL_SULAWESI_INDONESIA/links/54b50d9b0cf2318f0f9715f9/RELATIVE-POPULATION-DENSITY-OF-Tarsius-dianae-IN-MAN-INFLUENCED-HABITATS-OF-LORE-LINDU-NATIONAL-PARK-CENTRAL-SULAWESI-INDONESIA.pdf,0,0,0

Within primates. a shift in evolutionary rates has been identified as the rationale for contrasting findings from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies as to the position of Tarsius. While the latter now seems settled. we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes of three Sulawesi tarsiers (Tarsius dentatus.

Its role in defining the double strand break loci during the meiotic prophase I is crucial for proper chromosome segregation. Therefore. the rapid turnover of the loci determining zinc finger array seems to be causative for incompatibilities. We here investigated the zinc finger domain-containing exon of PRDM9 in 23 tarsiers. Tarsiers. the most basal extant haplorhine primates. exhibit two frameshifting indels at the 5′-end of the array. The first mutation event interrupts the reading frame and function while the second compensates both. The fixation of this allele variant in tarsiers led to hypothesize that de-and reactivation of the zinc finger domain drove the speciation in early haplorhine or tarsiiform primates. Moreover. the high allelic diversity within Tarsius points to multiple effects of genetic …,True,dTv3_TgAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,7,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34618,15848301535902662202,/scholar?cites=15848301535902662202,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34618,0,0,0

In particular. the development of amplifier lakes in rift basins after three million years ago significantly contributed to the exceptional sensitivity of East Africa to climate change compared to elsewhere on the African continent. Amplifier lakes are characterized by tectonically-formed graben morphologies in combination with an extreme contrast between high precipitation in the elevated parts of the catchment and high evaporation in the lake area. Such amplifier lakes respond rapidly to moderate. precessional-forced climate shifts. and as they do so apply dramatic environmental pressure to the biosphere.

A specific feature of mormyrid fish. the electric organ discharge (EOD). is used for electrolocation and intraspecific communication. We hypothesized that the EOD also facilitates assortative mating and ultimately promotes prezygotic reproductive isolation in African weakly electric fishes. Our behavioural experiments using live males as well as EOD playback demonstrated that female mate recognition is influenced by EOD signals and that females are attracted to EOD characteristics of conspecific males. The dual function of the EOD for both foraging and social communication (including mate recognition leading to assortative mating) underlines the importance of electric signal differentiation for the divergence of African weakly electric fishes.

Historically. their phylogenetic origins were obscured due to disagreement about which morphological features are evolutionarily conserved. but now most morphological evidence points to annelid origins. In contrast. recent phylogenetic analyses using different molecular markers produced variable results regarding the position of myzostomids. but all suggested these worms are not derived annelids. To reexamine this issue. we analyzed data from nuclear genes (18S rDNA. 28S rDNA. Myosin II. and Elongation Factor-1α). and a nearly complete myzostomid mitochondrial genome.

Whitehead (1) explains low nucleotide diversities in the control region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of matrilineal whale species with the use of a theory developed for molecular “hitchhiking.” in which diversity at a neutral locus is reduced by selection at a linked locus.

In the proposed model [figure 1 in (1)]. if nonmatrilineal transmission is greater than 0.5%. then mtDNA diversity is little reduced [figure 1D in (1)].

Most importantly. focal males directed their first sexual interaction (after they were presented with the rival male) toward the initially nonpreferred female. suggesting that males deceive other males about their mating preferences.

Amongst the human-infective species. Schistosoma mansoni is also the most commonly used in the laboratory and here we present the systematic improvement of its draft genome. We used Sanger capillary and deep-coverage Illumina sequencing from clonal worms to upgrade the highly fragmented draft 380 Mb genome to one with only 885 scaffolds and more than 81% of the bases organised into chromosomes. We have also used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) from four time points in the parasite's life cycle to refine gene predictions and profile their expression. More than 45% of predicted genes have been extensively modified and the total number has been reduced from 11.807 to 10.852. Using the new version of the genome. we identified trans-splicing events occurring in at least 11% of genes and identified clear cases where it is used to resolve polycistronic transcripts. We have produced a high-resolution map of temporal changes in expression for 9.535 genes. covering an unprecedented dynamic range for this organism. All of these data have been consolidated into a searchable format within the GeneDB (www.genedb.org) and SchistoDB (www.schistodb.net) databases. With further transcriptional profiling and genome sequencing increasingly accessible. the upgraded genome will form a fundamental dataset to underpin further advances in schistosome research.,True,KrwB_TIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,355,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001455,4024932123160759450,/scholar?cites=4024932123160759450,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001455,0,0,0

As well as being an important pathogen. the B. xylophilus genome thus provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution and mechanism of plant parasitism. Here. we present a high-quality draft genome sequence from an inbred line of B. xylophilus. and use this to investigate the biological basis of its complex ecology which combines fungal feeding. plant parasitic and insect-associated stages. We focus particularly on putative parasitism genes as well as those linked to other key biological processes and demonstrate that B. xylophilus is well endowed with RNA interference effectors. peptidergic neurotransmitters (including the first description of ins genes in a parasite) stress response and developmental genes and has a contracted set of chemosensory receptors. B. xylophilus has the largest number of digestive proteases known for any nematode and displays expanded families of lysosome pathway genes. ABC transporters and cytochrome P450 pathway genes. This expansion in digestive and detoxification proteins may reflect the unusual diversity in foods it exploits and environments it encounters during its life cycle. In addition. B. xylophilus possesses a unique complement of plant cell wall modifying proteins acquired by horizontal gene transfer. underscoring the impact of this process on the evolution of plant parasitism by nematodes …,True,KrwB_TIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,329,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002219,3288713110348678840,/scholar?cites=3288713110348678840,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002219,0,0,0
1113298,Improving draft assemblies by iterative mapping and assembly of short reads to eliminate gaps,2010,Isheng J Tsai and Thomas D Otto and Matthew Berriman,11,Genome biology,4,1-9,BioMed Central,Advances in sequencing technology allow genomes to be sequenced at vastly decreased costs. However. the assembled data frequently are highly fragmented with many gaps. We present a practical approach that uses Illumina sequences to improve draft genome assemblies by aligning sequences against contig ends and performing local assemblies to produce gap-spanning contigs. The continuity of a draft genome can thus be substantially improved. often without the need to generate new data.,True,KrwB_TIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,317,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2010-11-4-r41,18384085228566566599,/scholar?cites=18384085228566566599,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gb-2010-11-4-r41,0,0,0

Population genomic analyses can therefore be used to estimate the relative frequencies of these different modes in nature. The life cycle of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus is complex. including clonal reproduction. outcrossing. and two different modes of inbreeding. To quantify these different aspects we analyzed DNA sequence variation in the third chromosome among 20 isolates from two populations. Measures of mutational and recombinational diversity were used to make two independent estimates of the population size. In an obligately sexual population these values should be approximately equal. Instead there is a discrepancy of about three orders of magnitude between our two estimates of population size. indicating that S. paradoxus goes through a sexual cycle …,True,KrwB_TIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,294,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4957.short,18109747493461064024,/scholar?cites=18109747493461064024,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/12/4957.full.pdf,0,0,0

Its remarkable propensity to develop resistance threatens the viability of the sheep industry in many regions of the world and provides a cautionary example of the effect of mass drug administration to control parasitic nematodes. Its phylogenetic position makes it particularly well placed for comparison with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the most economically important parasites of livestock and humans. Here we report the detailed analysis of a draft genome assembly and extensive transcriptomic dataset for H. contortus. This represents the first genome to be published for a strongylid nematode and the most extensive transcriptomic dataset for any parasitic nematode reported to date.

For milestone projects such as Escherichia coli or Homo sapiens. teams of scientists were employed to manually curate and finish these genomes to a high standard. Nowadays. this is not feasible for most projects. and the quality of genomes is generally of a much lower standard. This protocol describes software (PAGIT) that is used to improve the quality of draft genomes. It offers flexible functionality to close gaps in scaffolds. correct base errors in the consensus sequence and exploit reference genomes (if available) in order to improve scaffolding and generating annotations. The protocol is most accessible for bacterial and small eukaryotic genomes (up to 300 Mb). such as pathogenic bacteria. malaria and parasitic worms.
