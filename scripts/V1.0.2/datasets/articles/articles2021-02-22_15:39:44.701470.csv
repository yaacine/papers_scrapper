1045000,Role of glucocorticoids in the physiopathology of excessive fat deposition and insulin resistance,2004,Cedric Asensio and Patrick Muzzin and Françoise Rohner-Jeanrenaud,28,,4,S45-S52,Nature Publishing Group,Glucocorticoids are important hormones in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. We infused normal rats with dexamethasone given intracerebroventricularly (icv) for 3 days. This resulted in hyperphagia. hyperinsulinemia. and marked insulin resistance. Similar metabolic defects were observed following icv infusion of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in normal rats. As central dexamethasone infusion enhanced NPY content in the arcuate nucleus. it suggested that its metabolic effects are mediated by NPY. Moreover. due to the lack of effects observed in vagotomized animals. activation of the parasympathetic nervous system by central dexamethasone infusion is proposed. Glucocorticoid action is known to involve prereceptor metabolism by enzymes such as 11β-HSD-1 that converts inactive into active glucocorticoids. Mice overexpressing 11β-HSD-1 in adipose tissue were shown to be obese and insulin resistant.

1045002,Efficient. Complete Deletion of Synaptic Proteins using CRISPR,2014,Salvatore Incontro and Cedric S. Asensio and Robert H. Edwards and Roger A. Nicoll,,Neuron,,,,One of the most powerful ways to test the function of a protein is to characterize the consequences of its deletion. In the past. this has involved inactivation of the gene by homologous recombination either in the germline or later through conditional deletion. RNA interference (RNAi) provides an alternative way to knock down proteins. but both of these approaches have their limitations. Recently. the CRISPR/Cas9 system has suggested another way to selectively inactivate genes. We have now tested this system in postmitotic neurons by targeting two well-characterized synaptic proteins. the obligatory GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and the GluA2 subunit of the AMPA receptor. Expression of CRISPR/Cas9 in hippocampal slice cultures completely eliminated NMDA receptor and GluA2 function. CRISPR/Cas9 thus provides a powerful tool to study the function of synaptic proteins.,True,3cdu-YwAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,101,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314006758,17652204187272690976,/scholar?cites=17652204187272690976,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314006758,0,0,0

In agreement with a role of resistin in insulin resistance. the administration of recombinant resistin led to glucose intolerance in mice and impaired insulin action in rat liver. However. the regulation of resistin expression by physiological conditions. hormones. or agents known to modulate insulin sensitivity does not always support the association between resistin and obesity-induced insulin resistance. In the present study we investigated the effects of leptin administration on adipose resistin expression in insulin-resistant and obese ob/ob mice.

1045005,RNAi screen identifies a role for adaptor protein AP-3 in sorting to the regulated secretory pathway,2010,Cédric S Asensio and Daniel W Sirkis and Robert H Edwards,191,Journal of Cell Biology,6,1173-1187,The Rockefeller University Press,The regulated release of proteins depends on their inclusion within large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) capable of regulated exocytosis. LDCVs form at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). but the mechanism for protein sorting to this regulated secretory pathway (RSP) and the cytosolic machinery involved in this process have remained poorly understood. Using an RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. we now identify a small number of genes. including several subunits of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein AP-3. which are required for sorting to the RSP. In mammalian neuroendocrine cells. loss of AP-3 dysregulates exocytosis due to a primary defect in LDCV formation.

Using a CRISPR-based system to delete CaMKII and replace it with mutated forms in single neurons. we have rigorously addressed its various synaptic roles. In brief. basal AMPAR and NMDAR synaptic transmission both require CaMKIIα. but not CaMKIIβ. indicating that. even in the adult. synaptic transmission is determined by the ongoing action of CaMKIIα. While AMPAR transmission requires kinase activity. NMDAR transmission does not. implying a scaffolding role for the CaMKII protein instead. LTP is abolished in the absence of CaMKIIα and/or CaMKIIβ and with an autophosphorylation impaired CaMKIIα (T286A).

In addition. we observed that β-less mice have impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion and exhibit an increase in liver PEPCK gene expression in the fed state. suggesting that they have increased gluconeogenesis. Although these characteristics are usually associated with insulin resistance. β-less mice exhibit enhanced insulin sensitivity during insulin tolerance tests.

We now find that midbrain dopamine neurons release glutamate and dopamine with different properties that reflect storage in different synaptic vesicles. The vesicles differ in release probability. coupling to presynaptic Ca2+ channels and frequency dependence. Although previous work has attributed variation in these properties to differences in location or cytoskeletal association of synaptic vesicles. the release of different transmitters shows that intrinsic differences in vesicle identity drive different modes of release.

LDCVs form at the trans-Golgi network. but the mechanisms that sort proteins to this regulated secretory pathway and the cytosolic machinery that produces LDCVs remain poorly understood. Recently. we used an RNAi screen to identify a role for heterotetrameric adaptor protein AP-3 in regulated secretion and in particular. LDCV formation. Indeed. mocha mice lacking AP-3 have a severe neurological and behavioral phenotype. but this has been attributed to a role for AP-3 in the endolysosomal rather than biosynthetic pathway. We therefore used mocha mice to determine whether loss of AP-3 also dysregulates peptide release in vivo. We find that adrenal chromaffin cells from mocha animals show increased constitutive exocytosis of both soluble cargo and LDCV membrane proteins. reducing the response to stimulation. We also observe increased basal release of both insulin and glucagon from pancreatic islet cells of mocha mice. suggesting a global disturbance in the release of peptide hormones. AP-3 exists as both ubiquitous and neuronal isoforms. but the analysis of mice lacking each of these isoforms individually and together shows that loss of both is required to reproduce the effect of the mocha mutation on the regulated pathway. In addition. we show that loss of the related adaptor protein AP-1 has a similar effect on regulated secretion but exacerbates the effect of AP-3 RNAi. suggesting distinct roles for the two adaptors in the regulated secretory …,True,3cdu-YwAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,24,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003812,8762270662925929076,/scholar?cites=8762270662925929076,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003812,0,0,0

As part of the HOPS (Homotypic fusion and Protein Sorting) complex. VPS41 regulates fusion of lysosomes with late endosomes and autophagosomes. Independent of HOPS. VPS41 regulates transport of newly synthesized lysosomal membrane proteins and secretory proteins.

Both patients displayed transient retinal dystrophy. ataxia and dystonia. with brain MRI findings of cerebellar atrophy and a thin saber-shape corpus callosum. Patient-derived fibroblasts contained enzymatically active lysosomes that were poorly reached by endocytic cargo and failed to attract the mTORC1 complex. Consequently. transcription factor TFE3. a driver of autophagy and lysosomal genes. showed continuous nuclear localization which resulted in elevated LC3-II levels and an impaired response to nutrient starvation.

Formation of SGs occurs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where their soluble cargo aggregates to form a dense core. but the mechanisms controlling the sorting of regulated secretory cargoes (soluble and transmembrane) away from constitutively secreted proteins remain unclear. Optimizing the use of the retention using selective hooks method in (neuro-)endocrine cells. we now quantify TGN budding kinetics of constitutive and regulated secretory cargoes. We further show that. by monitoring two cargoes simultaneously. it becomes possible to visualize sorting to the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways in real time.

Two models have been proposed for DCV cargo sorting. The “sorting by entry” model proposes that DCV cargos selectively enter nascent DCVs at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The “sorting by exit” model proposes that sorting occurs by the post-TGN removal of non-DCV cargos and retention of mature DCV cargos. Here we show that the coiled-coil protein CCDC186 controls sorting by exit. Ccdc186 KO insulinoma cells secrete less insulin. fail to retain insulin and carboxypeptidase E in mature DCVs at the cell periphery. and fail to remove carboxypeptidase D from immature DCVs. A mutation affecting the endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex causes similar defects in DCV cargo sorting. and overexpression of CCDC186 recruits EARP to the site of DCV maturation. CCDC186 and EARP may act together to control the post-Golgi retention of cargos in mature DCVs.,True,3cdu-YwAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/616458v1.abstract,9676115054783971788,/scholar?cites=9676115054783971788,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/04/23/616458.full.pdf,0,0,0

HID-1 is a TGN localized peripheral membrane protein contributing to SG formation. Mice lacking HID-1 specifically in pancreatic β-cells are glucose intolerant and display impaired insulin secretion. However. there is no information about the structure or domain architecture of HID-1. and thus it remains unknown how HID-1 binds to the TGN and performs its function. We report that the N-terminus of HID-1 mediates membrane binding through a myristoyl group with a polybasic amino acid patch but lacks specificity for the TGN. Delineation of the minimal domain responsible for HID-1 targeting to the TGN reveals an interaction with the Golgi-localized protein Golga5. Finally. we identify the C-terminus as a novel membrane binding region and the functional domain of HID-1.

The basic machinery responsible for this regulated exocytosis consists of specific membrane proteins present both at the plasma membrane and on ISGs. The protein composition of ISGs thus dictates their release properties. yet the mechanisms controlling ISG budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). which partly determines this molecular composition. remain poorly understood. The cytosolic protein VSP41 was recently identified as a potential coat protein at the TGN involved in the formation of neuroendocrine/neuronal granules. To test whether this protein might contribute to ISG biogenesis. we have generated VPS41 KO Ins1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9.

1045027,Effect of sex. age. and pre-slaughter conditioning on pH. temperature. tenderness and colour of indigenous South African goats.,2004,L Simela and EC Webb and L Frylinck,34,South African journal of animal science,5,,,Sex. age and pre-slaughter conditioning effects on pH. temperature. colour and tenderness properties of M. semimembranosus (SM) of indigenous South African goats were investigated. Sex and age had no significant effect on pH. However. female goat carcasses cooled significantly slower than those of intact males. The carcasses of 2-teeth goats had the slowest and those of the 4–6-teeth goats the fastest cooling rates. The carcasses of pre-slaughter conditioned goats had higher temperatures and lower pH values than the non-conditioned goats at both three and 24 hours post-mortem. Of the meat quality traits. colour was affected mainly by sex and age. Intact males had lower 24-hour a* and chroma values than the females and castrates. Chevon from 2-teeth goats had higher 24-hour and 96-hour a* and 24-hour chroma values than that from the milk-. 4–6-and 8-teeth groups. The milk-teeth goats had a lighter colour (96-hour L* value) than the 8-teeth goats. Pre-slaughter conditioning resulted in longer sarcomeres. lower Warner-Bratzler shear force values and generally a better meat colour. Tenderness and colour properties of chevon were found to be highly dependent on post-mortem pH and temperature as well as the ultimate pH attained by the carcasses.

A contributing factor towards meat tenderness is animal breed type but this has not been quantified in terms of breed stress responsiveness and the effect on meat tenderness. Meat tenderness was identified as one of the major contributing factors to the perception of meat quality (Koohmaraie. 1994). The tenderness of meat varies considerably and therefore prevents meat producers from marketing their produce on the basis of consistent quality (Maher et al.. 2004). The present study focuses on the urinary catecholamine output of three different beef breeds (Brahman-x. Simmental-x and Nguni-x). the pHu and the colour of the meat. The measurement of catecholamines in animals is usually highly invasive. but their measurement in excreted urine is not (Hay and Mormede. 1998). In this study the methodology was extended to the post-mortem situation. Previous studies have reported that the measurement of urinary catecholamine’s indicated that despite the massive release of catecholamines associated with slaughter. urinary concentrations are unaffected by this owing to the delay between elevation of concentrations in the plasma and subsequent elevation in the urine. The concentration of nor-epinephrine is the result of neuronal washout from tissues with sympathetic nerves and thus an important indicator of sympathetic nervous system activity (Young et al.. 1984) and therefore an indicator of stress responsiveness …,True,CxGDLAsAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,28,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=eBHTDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA180&dq=info:dFEhwB6xe7UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=zoMUCOphRp&sig=E42WitjxFdfVdwqA7lLizhCl7Fg,13077240688630911348,/scholar?cites=13077240688630911348,,,0,0,0

Brahman-and Nguni bulls; n= 60 each) were grain-fed and slaughtered at 12 months of age (A-age. fat-class 2). Feed was withdrawn for either three hours or 24 hours pre-slaughter. Within each feed withdrawal group. three electrical stimulation (ES) treatments were applied. viz. ES for 15 seconds. 120 seconds or no stimulation. In Phase 2. the effects of animal age and feeding regime were investigated using of A-age (feedlot and pasture). AB-age (feedlot and pasture) and B-age (pasture) animals. All carcasses were electrically stimulated for 15 seconds. Longer feed withdrawal increased dark-firm-dry (DFD) meat occurrence (pHu> 6) in the Nguni and Simmentaler-cross. Brahman-cross longissimus (LL) tended to be more tender with paler colour and higher drip loss when 120 ES was applied. Longer feed withdrawal recorded higher Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF) than three hour feed withdrawal. However. ES neutralized the effect of stress on tenderness. On average the AB-age feedlot animals produced the most tender LL followed by the B-age pasture and A-age feedlot which was similar to the AB-age pasture. A-age pasture animals produced the least tender LL steaks. The calpain proteolytic system played a pivotal role in determining the ultimate meat tenderness and although connective tissue becomes less soluble in older animals it did not play the determinant role in tenderness in this study.

1045048,The effect of genotype. duration of feed withdrawal and electrical stimulation on meat quality,2005,PE Strydom and L Frylinck,,Proceedings 51st international congress of meat science and technology’. p. m66,,,,Extrinsic factors. such as chilling rate. electrical stimulation and ageing. proved to have major influences on tenderness development of red meat (Ouali. 1990; Olsson et al.. 1994; Koohmaraie. 1996). The variation in tenderness. due to the development of rigor (peak toughness). is related to the conditions (pH and temperature) under which the muscle fibres enter rigor and. subsequently. settle into rigor mortis when all supplies of ATP are exhausted (Review: Hwang. Devine & Hopkins. 2003). Early and recent studies show that minimal shortening occurs above 12-15 C resulting in optimum tenderness (Locker & Hagyard. 1963; Tornberg. 1996). Below this temperature. pre-rigor contracture takes place until rigor is completed resulting in higher rigor toughness (Tornberg. 1996). The historical reason for the development of electrical stimulation was the acceleration of post-mortem glycolysis so that when the muscle entered rigor it was prevented from excessive shortening (Swatland. 1981). Further studies indicated that electrical stimulation may also contribute to the acceleration of proteolysis (Uytterhaegen. Claeys. & Demeyer. 1992). However. high temperature combined with low pH values could result into rigor contracture (termed heat shortening) has a concurrent reduction in ageing potential leading to less tender meat both at rigor mortis and when fully aged (Devine. Wahlgren & Tornberg. 1999). Stress. independent of ultimate pH seems to have a toughening effect on meat which is enhanced by electrical stimulation according to Morton. Bickerstaffe.

It consisted of 38-kDa subunits and had a pI about 6.0. The specificity of the lectin was assayed by hemagglutination inhibition. N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) was a good inhibitor and its N-acetyl group at C-5 was critical for lectin-ligand interaction. Substitution of the C-9 hydroxyl on Neu5Ac with an O-acetyl group (9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac) increased the inhibitory potency of this molecule. Furthermore. O-acetyl substitution of all the hydroxyl groups yielded even better inhibitors (2.4.7.8.9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac and its 1-O-methyl ester). Removal of the hydroxyl or O-acetyl group connected to C-2 reduced the potency of these inhibitors. The lectin agglutinated and stimulated human but not mouse lymphocytes.

Studies of the impact of ADPN on clinical outcomes have yielded contradictory results so far. Here. we examined the association of ADPN with serum magnesium (s-Mg) and calcium (s-Ca) levels and explored the possibility whether these two factors could modify the relationship between ADPN and all-cause mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease.   Methodology/Principal Findings After baseline assessment. 47 hemodialysis and 27 peritoneal dialysis patients were followed- up for a median period of 50 months. S-Mg and s-Ca levels emerged as positive and negative predictors of ADPN levels. respectively. During the follow-up period 18 deaths occurred. There was a significant 4% increased risk for all-cause mortality for each 1-µg/ml increment of ADPN (crude HR. 1.04; 95% CI. 1.01–1.07). even after adjustment for s-Mg and s-Ca levels. dialysis mode. age. albumin and C-reactive protein.

Furthermore. low s-Mg and high s-Ca levels were independently associated with malnutrition. inflammation. arterial stiffening and risk of death.

Available control strategies include use of insecticides/nematicides but these have proved detrimental to the environment. while other strategies like crop rotation and resistant cultivars have serious limitations. This scenario provides an opportunity for the utilization of technological advances like RNA interference (RNAi) to engineer resistance against these devastating parasites. First demonstrated in the model free living nematode. Caenorhabtidis elegans; the phenomenon of RNAi has been successfully used to suppress essential genes of plant parasitic nematodes involved in parasitism. nematode development and mRNA metabolism. Synthetic neurotransmitants mixed with dsRNA solutions are used for in vitro RNAi in plant parasitic nematodes with significant success. However. host delivered in planta RNAi has proved to be a pioneering phenomenon to deliver dsRNAs to feeding nematodes and silence the target genes to achieve resistance. Highly enriched genomic databases are exploited to limit off target effects and ensure sequence specific silencing.

In the present study. the levels of vitamin E and vitamin C along with those of antioxidant enzymes. like superoxide dismutase. peroxidase and catalase. were estimated in sixteen soybean varieties to explore their effectiveness against off‐flavour generation. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) number. an indicator of lipid peroxidation. was used to measure the quality with respect to off‐flavour. Data on activities of various antioxidant enzymes indicated that the off‐flavour is mainly generated enzymatically by the action of lipoxygenase on polyunsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore. varieties PK 416 and JS 7105 had the highest level of vitamin E while their TBA number was the lowest indicating the inverse relationship between the two parameters. It was further observed that the peroxidative effect of higher vitamin C …,True,_OpBC_YAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,24,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.1667,3860500303714155845,/scholar?cites=3860500303714155845,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34393949/anil_dahuja-04.pdf,0,0,0
1045089,Genomic organization. phylogenetic comparison. and expression profiles of the SPL family genes and their regulation in soybean,2017,Rajiv K Tripathi and Ridhi Goel and Sweta Kumari and Anil Dahuja,227,Development genes and evolution,2,101-119,Springer Berlin Heidelberg, SQUAMOSA Promoter-Binding Protein-Like (SPL) genes form a major family of plant-specific transcription factors and play an important role in plant growth and development. In this study. we report the identification of 41 SPL genes (GmSPLs) in the soybean genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were divided into five groups (groups 1–5). Further. exon/intron structure and motif composition revealed that the GmSPL genes are conserved within their same group. The N-terminal zinc finger 1 (Zn1) of the SBP domain was a CCCH (Cys3His1) and the C terminus zinc finger 2 (Zn2) was a CCHC (Cys2HisCys) type. The 41 GmSPL genes were distributed unevenly on 17 of the 20 chromosomes. with tandem and segmental duplication events. We found that segmental duplication has made an important contribution to soybean SPL gene family expansion.
