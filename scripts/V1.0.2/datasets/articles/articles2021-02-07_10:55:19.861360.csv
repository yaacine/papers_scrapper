70580,Signaling through scaffold. anchoring. and adaptor proteins,1997,Tony Pawson and John D Scott,278,,5346,2075-2080,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The process by which extracellular signals are relayed from the plasma membrane to specific intracellular sites is an essential facet of cellular regulation. Many signaling pathways do so by altering the phosphorylation state of tyrosine. serine. or threonine residues of target proteins. Recently. it has become apparent that regulatory mechanisms exist to influence where and when protein kinases and phosphatases are activated in the cell. The role of scaffold. anchoring. and adaptor proteins that contribute to the specificity of signal transduction events by recruiting active enzymes into signaling networks or by placing enzymes close to their substrates is discussed.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2618,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/278/5346/2075.abstract,18101002912438513293,/scholar?cites=18101002912438513293,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edita_Aksamitiene/post/Differences_between_adaptors_and_scaffolds_in_signaling/attachment/5cff1811cfe4a7968da9500b/AS%3A768439715110913%401560221713879/download/Signaling+through+Scaffold%2C+Anchoring+and+Adaptor+Proteins.pdf,0,0,0
70581,AKAP signalling complexes: focal points in space and time,2004,Wei Wong and John D Scott,5,,12,959-970,Nature Publishing Group,Multiprotein signalling networks create focal points of enzyme activity that disseminate the intracellular action of many hormones and neurotransmitters. Accordingly. the spatio-temporal activation of protein kinases and phosphatases is an important factor in controlling where and when phosphorylation events occur. Anchoring proteins provide a molecular framework that orients these enzymes towards selected substrates. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are signal-organizing molecules that compartmentalize various enzymes that are regulated by second messengers.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1113,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm1527,12693891010417999858,/scholar?cites=12693891010417999858,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.240&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Here we show that homologues of proteins necessary for asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans associate with each other in mammalian cells and tissues. mPAR-3 and mPAR-6 exhibit similar expression patterns and subcellular distributions in the CNS and associate through their PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains. mPAR-6 binds to Cdc42/Rac1 GTPases. and mPAR-3 and mPAR-6 bind independently to atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms. In vitro. mPAR-3 acts as a substrate and an inhibitor of aPKC.

70583,Phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD by mitochondria-anchored protein kinase A,1999,Hisashi Harada and Brian Becknell and Matthias Wilm and Matthias Mann and Lily Jun-shen Huang and Susan S Taylor and John D Scott and Stanley J Korsmeyer,3,Molecular cell,4,413-422,Cell Press,Signaling pathways between cell surface receptors and the BCL-2 family of proteins regulate cell death. Survival factors induce the phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. a proapoptotic member. Purification of BAD kinase(s) identified membrane-based cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) as a BAD Ser-112 (S112) site-specific kinase. PKA-specific inhibitors blocked the IL-3-induced phosphorylation on S112 of endogenous BAD as well as mitochondria-based BAD S112 kinase activity. A blocking peptide that disrupts type II PKA holoenzyme association with A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) also inhibited BAD phosphorylation and eliminated the BAD S112 kinase activity at mitochondria. Thus. the anchoring of PKA to mitochondria represents a focused subcellular kinase/substrate interaction that inactivates BAD at its target organelle in response to a survival factor.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,750,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500804694,9773423948998212370,/scholar?cites=9773423948998212370,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276500804694,0,0,0

For example. ‘A-kinase anchoring proteins’ (AKAPs) bind to the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to direct the kinase to discrete intracellular locations. Recently. functional studies aimed at disrupting AKAP–PKA complexes have demonstrated a role for anchored PKA in various cellular processes. including gene transcription. hormone-mediated insulin secretion and ion-channel modulation.

In neurons. adenosine 39. 59-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is localized at postsynaptic densities by association of its regulatory subunit with an A kinase anchor protein. AKAP79. Interaction cloning experiments demonstrated that AKAP79 also binds protein phosphatase 2B. or calcineurin (CaN). A ternary complex of PKA. AKAP. and CaN was isolated from bovine brain. and colocalization of the kinase and the phosphatase was established in neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons. The putative CaN-binding domain of AKAP79 is similar to that of the immunophilin FKBP-12. and AKAP79 inhibited CaN phosphatase activity.

Similarly. in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3′.5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein. AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme. protein kinase C (PKC). binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus. AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,617,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/271/5255/1589.abstract,12172075387877945374,/scholar?cites=12172075387877945374,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/klauck_sci_1996_p1589.pdf,0,0,0

AKAPs are a group of structurally diverse proteins with the common function of binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell. This mode of regulation ensures that PKA is exposed to isolated cAMP gradients. which allows for efficient catalytic activation and accurate substrate selection. Several AKAPs coordinate multiple members of signaling cascades. effectively assembling upstream activators and downstream effectors within the same macromolecular complex. Consequently. AKAPs may serve as points of integration for numerous signaling pathways.

In most cases the net signaling effect is to activate protein kinases or phosphoprotein phosphatases. which. in turn. alter the phosphorylation state of cellular target proteins. Although both enzyme classes have been intensely researched since the late 1950s. it is still unclear how individual hormones activate the correct pool of kinase or phosphatase to trigger specific intracellular events. One explanation that has recently attracted attention is a “targeting hypothesis” proposing that phosphorylation events are controlled in part by where kinases and phosphatases are located in the cell (1). In accordance with this proposal. it has become apparent that intracellular targeting of both enzyme classes is determined by association with “targeting subunits” or “anchoring proteins.” While there have been several general reviews on this subject (1–3). this article will focus on subcellular targeting of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 1,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,317,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/dellacqua_jbc_1997_p12881.pdf,12087769256551720986,/scholar?cites=12087769256551720986,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/dellacqua_jbc_1997_p12881.pdf,0,0,0

The WAVE-associated GTPase activating protein called WRP is implicated in human mental retardation. and WAVE-1 knock-out mice have altered behavior. Neuronal time-lapse imaging. behavioral analyses. and electrophysiological recordings from genetically modified mice were used to show that WAVE-1 signaling complexes control aspects of neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Gene targeting experiments in mice demonstrate that WRP anchoring to WAVE-1 is a homeostatic mechanism that contributes to neuronal development and the fidelity of synaptic connectivity.

A hormone binds its receptor. the receptor activates adenylate cyclase via an intermediary G protein. and CAMP is liberated from the intracellular face of the plasma membrane. This first part is relatively straightforward. but the next two steps in the process require a more sophisticated level of molecular organization. First of all. CAMP activates the CAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by binding to the regulatory subunits (R) of the dormant PKA holoenzyme and causes the release of the active catalytic subunit (C). Then comes the mysterious part. Although PKA is a multifunctional enzyme with a broad substrate specificity. hormonal activation of the kinase somehow permits preferential phosphorylation of specific target substrates.

In this report we demonstrate that the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP-Lbc assembles an activation complex for the lipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase D (PKD). Using a combination of biochemical. enzymatic. and immunofluorescence techniques. we show that the anchoring protein contributes to PKD activation in two ways: it recruits an upstream kinase PKCη and coordinates PKA phosphorylation events that release activated protein kinase D. Thus. AKAP-Lbc synchronizes PKA and PKC activities in a manner that leads to the activation of a third kinase.

At the MAM. these chaperones control ER homeostasis but also play a role in the onset of ER stress-mediated apoptosis. likely through the modulation of ER calcium signaling. These opposing roles of MAM-localized chaperones suggest the existence of mechanisms that regulate the composition and the properties of ER membrane domains. Our results now show that the GTPase Rab32 localizes to the ER and mitochondria. and we identify this protein as a regulator of MAM properties. Consistent with such a role.

An attractive mechanism for expression of long term depression is the loss of surface AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazale-4-propionate) receptors at synapses. Here we show that a threshold level of NMDA receptor activation must be exceeded to trigger a stable loss of AMPA receptors from the surface of cultured hippocampal neurons.

AKAP79 brings together different combinations of enzyme binding partners to customize the regulation of effector proteins. In neurons. muscarinic agonists mobilize an AKAP79-anchored pool of PKC that phosphorylates the KCNQ2 subunit of the M channel. This inhibits potassium permeability to enhance neuronal excitability. Using a dual fluorescent imaging/patch-clamp technique. we visualized AKAP79-anchored PKC phosphorylation of the kinase activity reporter CKAR concurrently with electrophysiological changes in KCNQ2 channels to show that AKAP79 synchronizes both signaling events to optimize the attenuation of M currents.

Mechanistic understanding of this process is hampered by limited structural information on these macromolecular complexes. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) spatially constrain phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA). Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions of type-II PKA-AKAP18γ complexes reveal hetero-pentameric assemblies that adopt a range of flexible tripartite configurations. Intrinsically disordered regions within each PKA regulatory subunit impart the molecular plasticity that affords an ∼16 nanometer radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits. Manipulating flexibility within the PKA holoenzyme augmented basal and cAMP responsive phosphorylation of AKAP-associated substrates. Cell-based analyses suggest that the catalytic subunit remains within type-II PKA-AKAP18γ complexes upon cAMP elevation. We propose that the dynamic movement of kinase sub-structures. in concert with the static AKAP-regulatory subunit interface. generates a solid-state signaling microenvironment for substrate phosphorylation.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01319.001,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:otzGkya1bYkC,95,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01319,10660568462838606096,/scholar?cites=10660568462838606096,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01319.pdf,0,0,0

We now demonstrate that two alternatively spliced forms of mAKAP are expressed: mAKAPα and mAKAPβ. The longer form. mAKAPα. is preferentially expressed in the brain. mAKAPβ is a shorter form of the anchoring protein that lacks the first 244 amino acids and is preferentially expressed in the heart. The unique amino terminus of mAKAPα can spatially restrict the activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Biochemical and genetic analyses demonstrate that simultaneous recruitment of PDK1 and ERK onto mAKAPα facilitates activation and release of the downstream target p90RSK.

AKAP79 facilitates PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser845 on GluR1 to potentiate AMPA receptor function (Colledge et al.. 2000). Likewise.

A burgeoning knowledge of compartmentalized cAMP signaling is revealing how the local control of signaling enzyme activity impacts upon disease. The aim of this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster is to highlight how misregulation of local cyclic AMP signaling can have pathophysiological consequences.

A key component is the aquaporin‐0 (AQP0) water channel whose permeability is tightly regulated in healthy lenses. Using a variety of cellular and biochemical approaches we have discovered that products of the A‐kinase anchoring protein 2 gene (AKAP2/AKAP‐KL) form a stable complex with AQP0 to sequester protein kinase A (PKA) with the channel. This permits PKA phosphorylation of serine 235 within a calmodulin (CaM)‐binding domain of AQP0.

70795,Coordination of cAMP signaling events through PKA anchoring,1999,John D Scott and Mark L DelľAcqua and Iain DC Fraser and Steven J Tavalin and Linda B Lester,47,,,175-207,Academic Press,Mechanisms must clearly exist to organize the correct repertoire of signaling molecules into coordinated units that allow only a subset of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrates to become phosphorylated. One mechanism involves the restriction of PKA to localized sites of action where it can only phosphorylate those substrates in its immediate vicinity. This is achieved in one of the two ways; compartmentalized accumulation of the second messenger cAMP or anchoring of the kinase to subcellular structures and organelles. This chapter describes the accumulating data. suggesting that the subcellular location of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase is regulated in part. through association with a family of A-kinase anchoring proteins called AKAPs.

We sought to compare the immune response of pregnant women to H1N1 infection versus vaccination and to determine the extent of passive immunity conferred to the newborn.   Methods/Findings During the 2009-2010 influenza season. we enrolled a cohort of women who either had confirmed pH1N1 infection during pregnancy. did not have pH1N1 during pregnancy but were vaccinated against pH1N1. or did not have illness or vaccination. Maternal and umbilical cord venous blood samples were collected at delivery. Hemagglutination inhibition assays (HAI) for pH1N1 were performed. Data were analyzed using linear regression analyses. HAIs were performed for matched maternal/cord blood pairs for 16 women with confirmed pH1N1 infection. 14 women vaccinated against pH1N1. and 10 women without infection or vaccination. We found that pH1N1 vaccination and wild-type infection during pregnancy did not differ with respect to (1) HAI titers at delivery. (2) HAI antibody decay slopes over time. and (3) HAI titers in the cord blood.   Conclusions Vaccination against pH1N1 confers a similar HAI antibody response as compared to pH1N1 infection during pregnancy. both in quantity and quality.

70804,Subcellular targeting of kinases and phosphatases by association with bifunctional anchoring proteins,1995,VM Coghlan and ZE Hausken and JD Scott,23,,3,592-596,Portland Press Ltd.,Since the discovery by Sutherland and colleagues [l-31 of cyclic AMP as an intracellular second messenger for hormone-mediated events. considerable research has focused on understanding its action. A key step in this process was the discovery by Fischer and Krebs that cyclic AMP. M $+ and ATP were factors affecting the activity of phosphorylase b kinase [4]. which led to the discovery of a cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)[51. Since then. it has been demonstrated that 20 or more different hormones activate PKA through a common signalling pathway that elevates intracellular cyclic AMP [6-81.PKA is a multifunctional enzyme with a broad substrate specificity. It is therefore hard to imagine how the kinase is able to phosphorylate the correct target proteins rapidly and preferentially in response to activation by individual hormones. This is particularly true if one considers PKA as a soluble enzyme freely diffusing throughout the cytoplasm. Under these conditions. elevation of cyclic AMP concentration would cause an indiscriminate burst of phosphorylation. Thus a preferred hypothesis is that PKA is compartmentalized and individual hormones preferentially activate specific pools of kinase that are co-localized with substrate proteins (Figure 1). Consequently. the localization of PKA may be a key regulatory event in determining the intracellular sites of hormone action. Support for PKA compartmentalization is provided by three lines of evidence: different hormones activate specific PKA subtypes [9]. cyclic AMP accumulates in distinct cellular compartments [lo]. and PKA subunits are detected in different cellular compartments [11.121 …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC,32,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6357/5322731023e5cdd60169051869a451048b00.pdf,18333416390781051051,/scholar?cites=18333416390781051051,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6357/5322731023e5cdd60169051869a451048b00.pdf,0,0,0

Protein phosphorylation is a reversible process involving two classes of signalling enzymes: protein kinases. which catalyse the phospho-transfer reaction. and phosphoprotein phosphatases. which catalyse the dephosphorylation step [1. 2]. The activity of both enzyme classes is tightly regulated and responds to fluctuations in diffusible second messengers such as Ca2+. phospholipid and cAMP [2]. The predominant effect of cAMP is to activate the CAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). which modifies serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins [3]. Since PKA has a broad substrate specificity and is present in relatively high intracellular concentrations [4]. it is critical to restrict the activity of the enzyme and its substrate availability …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C,29,https://portlandpress.com/biochemsoctrans/article-abstract/24/4/986/93658,13021504240665736094,/scholar?cites=13021504240665736094,,,0,0,0

Reabsorption of water from the luminal fluid of the nephron occurs through aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water pores in principal cells that line the kidney-collecting duct.

NY,Synthesis of the second messenger cAMP activates a variety of signaling pathways critical for all facets of intracellular regulation. Protein kinase A (PKA) is the major cAMP-responsive effector. Where and when this enzyme is activated has profound implications on the cellular role of PKA. A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) play a critical role in this process by orchestrating spatial and temporal aspects of PKA action. A popular means of evaluating the impact of these anchored signaling events is to biochemically interfere with the PKA–AKAP interface. Hence. peptide disruptors of PKA anchoring are valuable tools in the investigation of local PKA action.

A-kinase anchoring protein 220 (AKAP220) is a multivalent anchoring protein that can sequester a variety of signal transduction enzymes. These include protein kinase A (PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Using a combination of molecular and cellular approaches we show that GSK3β phosphorylation of Thr-1132 on AKAP220 initiates recruitment of this kinase into the enzyme scaffold. We also find that AKAP220 anchors GSK3β and its substrate β-catenin in membrane ruffles. Interestingly. GSK3β can be released from the multienzyme complex in response to PKA phosphorylation on serine 9. which suppresses GSK3β activity. The signaling scaffold may enhance this regulatory mechanism. as AKAP220 has the capacity to anchor two PKA holoenzymes.

The PKA holoenzyme is targeted to specific subcellular sites through the interaction of the regulatory subunits with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). We previously reported that FSH regulates expression of AKAPs. In this report we examine the relationship between AKAP expression and cell shape. Granulosa cells cultured in the absence of FSH tend to spread and flatten. Cell spreading is accompanied by an increased expression of a 140-kDa AKAP. This spreading/flattening phenotype is independent of the specific extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin. polylysine. and gelatin) on which cells are plated.

70842,Therapeutic strategies for anchored kinases and phosphatases: exploiting short linear motifs and intrinsic disorder,2015,Patrick J Nygren and John D Scott,6,,,158,Frontiers,Phosphorylation events that occur in response to the second messenger cAMP are controlled spatially and temporally by protein kinase A (PKA) interacting with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Recent advances in understanding the structural basis for this interaction have reinforced the hypothesis that AKAPs create spatially constrained signaling microdomains. This has led to the realization that the PKA/AKAP interface is a potential drug target for modulating a plethora of cell-signaling events. Pharmacological disruption of kinase-AKAP interactions has previously been explored for disease treatment and remains an interesting area of research. However. disrupting or enhancing the association of phosphatases with AKAPs is a therapeutic concept of equal promise. particularly since they oppose the actions of many anchored kinases. Accordingly. numerous AKAPs bind phosphatases such as PP1. calcineurin (PP2B). and PP2A. These multimodal signaling hubs are equally able to control the addition of phosphate groups onto target substrates. as well as the removal of these phosphate groups. In this review. we describe recent advances in structural analysis of kinase and phosphatase interactions with AKAPs. and suggest future possibilities for targeting these interactions for therapeutic benefit.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C,21,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2015.00158/full,2780353962831438288,/scholar?cites=2780353962831438288,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2015.00158/full,0,0,0

Lorente de Nó (’81) recognized that the cortex of the nucleus (layers 1 and 2) bore a remarkable resemblance to the cerebellum. in both the structural characteristics of the cells and their organization. The chief organization of the nucleus is based on a concentric laminar arrangement of cells. their dendrites. and fiber systems. somewhat like a single cerebellar folium. A local cartesian framework can be imposed on the nucleus. where the principal axes are depth (perpendicular to the local surface). the striai axis (parallel to the long axis of the nucleus and to the unmyelinated parallel fibers in the molecular layer). and the transstriai axis (parallel to the isofrequency planes formed by the auditory nerve fibers).

Conformational flexibility in regions of intrinsic disorder within A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79) delineates PP2B access to phosphoproteins. Structural analysis by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) reveals an ensemble of dormant AKAP79-PP2B configurations varying in particle length from 160 to 240 Å. A short-linear interaction motif between residues 337–343 of AKAP79 is the sole PP2B-anchoring determinant sustaining these diverse topologies. Activation with Ca2+/calmodulin engages additional interactive surfaces and condenses these conformational variants into a uniform population with mean length 178 ± 17 Å. This includes a Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro sequence (residues 125–128 of AKAP79) that occupies a binding pocket on PP2B utilized by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin.

The protein kinase A–anchoring protein dAKAP1 compartmentalizes protein kinase A (PKA) and other signaling enzymes at the outer mitochondrial membrane and thereby controls mitochondrial function and dynamics. Modulation of these processes occurs in part through regulation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1).

We exploited the AKAP targeting concept to create genetically encoded platforms that restrain kinase inhibitor drugs at distinct subcellular locations. Local Kinase Inhibition (LoKI) allows us to ascribe organelle-specific functions to broad specificity kinases.

FLCs uniquely produce DNAJ-PKAc. a chimeric enzyme consisting of a chaperonin-binding domain fused to the Cα subunit of protein kinase A. Biochemical analyses of clinical samples reveal that a unique property of this fusion enzyme is the ability to recruit heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This cellular chaperonin is frequently up-regulated in cancers. Gene-editing of mouse hepatocytes generated disease-relevant AML12DNAJ-PKAc cell lines. Further analyses indicate that the proto-oncogene A-kinase anchoring protein-Lbc is up-regulated in FLC and functions to cluster DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70 sub-complexes with a RAF-MEK-ERK kinase module. Drug screening reveals Hsp70 and MEK inhibitor combinations that selectively block proliferation of AML12DNAJ-PKAc cells. Phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrates that DNAJ-PKAc biases the signaling landscape toward ERK activation and engages downstream kinase cascades. Thus. the oncogenic action of DNAJ-PKAc involves an acquired scaffolding function that permits recruitment of Hsp70 and mobilization of local ERK signaling.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:AFXcoJnoRH0C,9,https://elifesciences.org/articles/44187,5567676070751686907,/scholar?cites=5567676070751686907,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/44187.pdf,0,0,0

70905,Drugs that regulate local cell signaling: AKAP targeting as a therapeutic option,2021,Paula J Bucko and John D Scott,61,,,361-379,Annual Reviews,Cells respond to environmental cues by mobilizing signal transduction cascades that engage protein kinases and phosphoprotein phosphatases. Correct organization of these enzymes in space and time enables the efficient and precise transmission of chemical signals. The cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A is compartmentalized through its association with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs are a family of multivalent scaffolds that constrain signaling enzymes and effectors at subcellular locations to drive essential physiological events. More recently. it has been recognized that defective signaling in certain endocrine disorders and cancers proceeds through pathological AKAP complexes. Consequently. pharmacologically targeting these macromolecular complexes unlocks new therapeutic opportunities for a growing number of clinical indications.

We identified a Caenorhabditis elegans RhoGEF protein. RHGF-2. as a binding partner of the C. elegans multi-PDZ domain scaffold protein MPZ-1 (MUPP1 in mammals). RHGF-2 exhibits significant identity to the mammalian RhoGEFs PLEKHG5/Tech/Syx and contains a class I C-terminal PDZ binding motif (SDV) that interacts most strongly to MPZ-1 PDZ domain eight. RHGF-2 RhoGEF activity is specific to the C. elegans RhoA homolog RHO-1 as determined by direct binding. GDP/GTP exchange and serum response element-driven reporter activity. rhgf-2 is an essential gene since rhgf-2 deletion mutants do not elongate during embryogenesis and hatch as short immobile animals that arrest development. Interestingly. the expression of a functional rhgf-2:: gfp transgene appears to be exclusively neuronal and rhgf-2 overexpression results in loopy movement with exaggerated body bends.

Restriction of enzyme location contributes to the fidelity of each cellular response. A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) target the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and other signalling enzymes to defined subcellular locations. We have developed a new strategy that combines RNA interference of the endogenous protein and replacement with AKAP79/150 forms unable to anchor selected binding partners. Using this approach we show that AKAP79/150 coordinates different enzyme combinations to modulate the activity of two distinct neuronal ion channels: AMPA-type glutamate receptors and M-type potassium channels. Utilization of distinct enzyme combinations in this manner provides a means to expand the repertoire of cellular events that the same AKAP modulates.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C,5,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171933506000069,13326033719219959682,/scholar?cites=13326033719219959682,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.422.2248&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

70955,A-Kinase-Anchoring Protein–Lbc Connects Stress Signaling to Cardiac Hypertrophy,2013,F Donelson Smith and John D Scott,33,Molecular and cellular biology,1,2-3,American Society for Microbiology Journals,Heart failure often occurs as a consequence of persistent trauma to the myocardium. Cardiovascular pathologies. including hypertension. valvular disease. atherosclerosis. and ischemia. can all lead to pressure overload and myocardial dysfunction. In the face of such stressors. the heart attempts to maintain normal contractile function by initiating a complex remodeling process involving the reexpression of developmental genes. This process leads to an increase in cardiac muscle mass commonly referred to as pathological cardiac hypertrophy. If trauma is persistent or severe. such compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed or become maladaptive and heart failure ensues. Stress signaling pathways play an important role in cellular responses to cardiotoxic insults such as mechanical shear and an overabundance of proinflammatory molecules.

PCHIS is a hybrid electronic-paper medical record system that is clinically useful to health care providers. The paper chart still contains the bulk of information but the key facts about any given patient (diagnoses. surgeries. medications. allergies) and about the process of care (frequency of visits. referral patterns. test ordering. etc.) are readily available in electronic form. These key data are easily coded. are quickly and simultaneously accessible in multiple locations. serve as an excellent chart substitute whenever the paper chart is unavailable. and can be retrieved for in-depth analysis at any time. whether for clinical. administrative. research. or quality assurance purposes. The process of care can be studied and. to some extent. can also be modified by the system. as demonstrated by the physician response to the reminder system within PCHIS. The medical record chart summary. mandated by Joint Commission for ambulatory patient charts. is easily provided in hard copy as well as electronically. Whereas physician compliance in providing data to the system was initially sporadic. physician support has increased tremendously as the system has become more clinically useful to them. It is a system that exists and functions well within a patchwork of multiple different medical information systems. It is a system with sufficient intrinsic flexibility that it can and will continue to evolve in response to the needs of physicians and administrators.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:w0odbtu79TwC,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/10119974,15751317440795306393,/scholar?cites=15751317440795306393,,,0,0,0

NY,Classical physiological experiments identified cAMP as a diffusible intracellular secondary messenger capable of activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). These studies defined hormone-and location-specific patterns of PKA activation. suggesting that PKA signaling was compartmentalized. For example. in perfused rat cardiomyocytes. adrenergic stimulation selectively activates a pool of PKA isolated from certain fractions. while prostanoids predominately activate cytosolic PKA (Scott et al. 2013). The first AKAP to be identified. microtubuleassociated protein 2 (MAP2). was copurified with the PKA regulatory subunit subtype II (RII) from rat brain extracts. Over 50 additional AKAP family members have subsequently been identified (Fraser and Scott 1999; Scott et al. 2013). AKAPs are structurally diverse and share little primary sequence similarity. but are functionally similar and are classified by their ability to copurify with PKA catalytic activity from tissues (Langeberg and Scott 2015).,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C,2,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/gabrovsek_and_bucko_EncySigol_2017_p1.pdf,7955957556022904277,/scholar?cites=7955957556022904277,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/gabrovsek_and_bucko_EncySigol_2017_p1.pdf,0,0,0

Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers. Inc.. Atlanta. GA (United States),Manufactured products. such as fenestration systems and the materials comprising the systems. are often observed to degrade due to exposure to the elements of weather. While standard and nonstandard methods have been developed to provide a means of assessing the effect of weathering. questions often arise concerning the relationship of resultant test data with actual in-service performance. In view of the questions concerning the relevance of test data and the rapidly growing focus on quality assurance. there is strong interest in developing improved test protocols. This paper focuses on the key choices that must be made in the design of weathering tests and includes identification of the currently available methods used for weathering of fenestration systems and the primary shortcomings of those methods.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:8RAEygVn5_EC,2,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/211857,10575171859048917065,/scholar?cites=10575171859048917065,,,0,0,0

AChR clusters were observed from 16 – 72 hours after treatment when Z+ agrin was adsorbed to the surface of microparticles. but this time frame was extended to 120 hours and beyond when agrin was covalently linked to the microparticle surface. Similar AChR clustering was observed both when covalent agrin microparticles were allowed to settle from a culture medium suspension above a cell-seeded fibrin surface and when C2C12 cells were seeded on an agrin microparticle-containing fibrin surface. The latter microparticle delivery method enabled construction of 3D agrin-presenting fibrin scaffolds. which …",True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C,1,https://dspace.zsr.wfu.edu/handle/10339/57186,2836448415208124166,/scholar?cites=2836448415208124166,,https://dspace.zsr.wfu.edu/bitstream/handle/10339/57186/Scott_wfu_0248D_10761.pdf,0,0,0

Signal specificity is achieved through local activation of signaling enzymes that are anchored to subcellular organelles and membranes. In particular. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) coordinate and control cAMP responsive events. AKAPs were originally classified based on their ability to bind cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A; PKA). The activity of PKA is regulated by its two regulatory subunits. which from a dimer that binds to the two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory dimer dissociates the catalytic subunits and activates PKA. Anchoring of PKA by AKAPs constrains PKA activity to a relevant subset of potential substrates. Thus.

NY,Maintaining a steady balance between energy production and consumption is a cornerstone of all living cells. Failure to maintain this balance affects most. if not all. cellular activities as these processes are normally tightly coupled to the energy status of the cell. It is beginning to emerge that human diseases such as obesity. Type 2 diabetes. and even certain types of cancer may be linked to underlying defects in the regulation of energy balance. Since the evolution of eukaryotes. the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) system has played a pivotal role in maintaining energy homeostasis by regulating the enzymes that control flux through virtually every branch of metabolism. AMPK functions primarily as a fuel gauge monitoring the ratio of AMP to ATP. which can be regarded as a molecular read-out of cellular energy status. It becomes activated when energy utilisation overtakes energy production. and …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-6382-6_9,8019969209292040255,/scholar?cites=8019969209292040255,,,0,0,0

The myosin light chain kinases comprise a family of tissue-specific isozymes whose function is to phosphorylate one of the light chain components. the P- or DTNB-light chain. of myosin. Distinct isozyme forms of Myosin Light Chain Kinase (MLCK) have been identified in skeletal. cardiac and smooth muscle. In addition. MLCK has been detected in nonmuscle tisues such as brain. T-cells. platelets and cultured fibroblasts. All of the isozymes share several properties in common.

Functional upregulation of LTCCs under hyperglycemic conditions involves cAMP‐dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. yet the mechanistic details of how these pathological phenomena promote vasoconstriction is unclear. Here. we report that a subpopulation of CaV1.2 channels is located within nanometer proximity of PKA catalytic subunits at the sarcolemma of native murine and human arterial myocytes. This organization requires selective scaffolding of PKA RIIα by A‐kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150; murine ortholog of human AKAP79).

Endothelial-dependent vasodilation by classic agents such as acetylcholine (ACh) depends on an elevation of EC Ca2+. and can act through the generation of nitric oxide (NO). An elevation of EC Ca2+ also activates small-and intermediate-conductance (SK and IK) potassium channels. This leads to endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization (“EDH”). which is spread through gap junctions in specialized EC projections to adjacent smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to cause vasodilation of small resistance arteries and arterioles. and this pathway is responsible for the majority of the ACh-induced dilation in resistance arteries [1].

The scaffolding protein AKAP150 is a key regulator of calcineurin (CaN). a phosphatase known to modulate expression of the regulatory BKCa β1 subunit. Whether AKAP150 mediates BKCa channel suppression during hyperglycemia and diabetes is unknown.Objective: To test the hypothesis that AKAP150-dependent CaN signaling mediates BKCa β1 downregulation and impaired vascular BKCa channel function during hyperglycemia and diabetes.Methods and Results: We found that AKAP150 is an important determinant of BKCa channel remodeling. CaN/NFATc3 activation. and resistance artery constriction in hyperglycemic animals on high fat diet (HFD). Genetic ablation of AKAP150 protected against these alterations. including augmented vasoconstriction. D-glucose-dependent suppression of BKCa channel β1 subunits required Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and mobilization of a CaN/NFATc3 signaling pathway. Remarkably. HFD mice expressing a mutant AKAP150 unable to anchor CaN resisted activation of NFATc3 and downregulation of BKCa β1 subunits. and attenuated HFD-induced elevation in arterial blood pressure.Conclusions: Our results support a model whereby subcellular anchoring of CaN by AKAP150 is a key molecular determinant of vascular BKCa channel remodeling. which contributes to vasoconstriction during diabetes.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/43030220/AKAP150_Contributes_to_Enhanced_Vascular20160224-26002-1sapynr.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43030220/AKAP150_Contributes_to_Enhanced_Vascular20160224-26002-1sapynr.pdf,0,0,0

Increased β‐ adrenergic signaling after myocardial infarction (MI) triggers activation of the Ca2+‐dependent phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor NFATc3. resulting in down‐regulation of voltage‐gated K+ (KV) channel in ventricular myocytes. Here we tested the hypothesis that AKAP150 targeting of calcineurin to the sarcolemma is required for NFATc3 activation and the subsequent down‐regulation of KV currents observed after MI. We found that ablation of AKAP150 decreased NFATc3 nuclear translocation and was protective against down‐regulation of KV currents after MI.

When individuals with autism. intellectual. and communication disabilities become victims of crime. communicating effectively with these individuals can present challenges to law enforcement. especially in a crisis situation when the need to communicate effectively is critical. A law enforcement officer’s general lack of understanding of and ability to communicate with individuals with disabilities puts those individuals at greater risk. The ability for law enforcement personnel to understand and communicate with individuals with autism. intellectual. and communication disabilities is a critical step in reducing victimization.

Prasad V …,2010,John D Scott and Carmen W Dessauer,,,,,,Spatiotemporal specificity of cAMP action is best explained by targeting protein kinase A (PKA) to its substrates by A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). At synapses in the brain AKAP79/150 incorporates PKA and other regulatory enzymes into signal transduction networks that include βadrenergic receptors. α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. We previously showed that AKAP79/150 clusters PKA with type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) to assemble a negative feedback loop in which the anchored kinase phosphorylates AC5 to dynamically suppress cAMP synthesis. We now show that AKAP79 can associate with multiple AC isoforms. The N-terminal regions of AC 5. 6. and 9 mediate this protein-protein interaction. Mapping studies located a reciprocal binding surface between residues 77-108 of AKAP79. Intensity-and lifetime-based Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) demonstrated that deletion of AKAP7977-108 region abolished AC5/AKAP79 interaction in living cells. Addition of the AKAP7977-153 polypeptide fragment uncouples AC5/6 interactions with the anchoring protein and prevents PKA-mediated inhibition of AC activity in membranes. Use of the AKAP7977-153 polypeptide fragment in brain extracts from wild type and AKAP150-/-mice reveals that loss of the anchoring protein results in decreased AMPA receptor-associated AC activity. Thus we propose that AKAP79/150 mediates proteinprotein interactions that place AC5 in proximity to synaptic AMPA receptors.Localized activation of PKA triggers a plethora of intracellular signaling processes (1 …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:sJPMR1oEGYQC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fefb/b83886966e8fb436cdf143e9e22b59ad6111.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fefb/b83886966e8fb436cdf143e9e22b59ad6111.pdf,0,0,0

Recent studies have suggested that members of the IQ motif GTPase Activating Proteins (IQGAP) gene family are important modulators of the actin cytoskeleton that ultimately regulate processes such as polarity. cell migration and neurite outgrowth.

71148,Compartmentalization of Cyclic AMP Signalling,2006,JD Scott,34,Biochemical Society Transactions,part 4,,,Scaffolding proteins create order out of chaos. Multifunctional binding proteins such as the AKAPs (A-kinaseanchoring proteins) oversee the dynamic organization of signalling events by clustering activator proteins with kinases. phosphatases and phosphodiesterases and directing them toward their downstream effectors. This article will focus on the role of AKAPs in the spatial and temporal control of cAMP signalling events.Although the investigation of cAMP signalling has been underway for over 50 years. it was not until the early 1980s that the compartmentalized modulation of these events was appreciated. This concept developed from physiological experiments showing that stimulation of cAMP synthesis by different agonists produced distinct physiological outputs. even within the same cell. For example. adrenergic stimulation activated a particulate pool of PKA (protein kinase A or cAMP-dependent protein kinase) in cardiomyocytes. whereas stimulation with prostaglandin E1 activated a cytosolic pool of the enzyme [1]. These observations were compatible with previous evidence that the PKA holoenzyme. which consists of two regulatory (R) and two catalytic (C) subunits. exists in two forms: a cytoplasmic type I PKA holoenzyme and a type II PKA holoenzyme that was considered to be particulate. This differential distribution of the PKA holoenzymes also implied that mechanisms were in place to segregate distinct cAMP signals. The development of fluorescent probes and advanced imaging techniques largely proved this hypothesis. For example. overexpressed rat olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. which have been modified to be …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:1xBWf43XMUgC,0,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/scott_biochem_soc_2006_p465.pdf,,,,http://faculty.washington.edu/scottjdw/pdfs/scott_biochem_soc_2006_p465.pdf,0,0,0

Multiprotein signaling complexes create focal points of enzyme activity to disseminate the intracellular action of many hormones and neurotransmitters. The spatio-temporal activation of protein kinases and/or phosphatases is important in controlling where and when phosphorylaton events occur. Anchoring proteins and targeting subunits provide a molecular framework that orients protein kinases and phosphatases toward selected substrates. Prototypic examples of these “signal-directing molecules” are A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that sustain multicomponent signaling complexes of the cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) and G proteins and other enzymes.

AKAP79. is a multivalent anchoring protein that maintains the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. protein kinase C. and protein phosphatase-2B (PP2B/calcineurin) at the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses where it is recruited into complexes with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-subtype glutamate receptors. We have used cellular targeting of AKAP79 truncation and deletion mutants as an assay to map the PP2B-binding site on AKAP79.

So. on a recent flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong I read Protein Modules in Cellular Signaling. a compendium of 43 articles on various aspects of signal transduction. edited by Ludwig Heilmeyer and Peter Friedrich. This book focuses on recent advances in understanding the cellular signalling pathways that relay information from the cell surface to target proteins located at discrete sites within the cell. An enigmatic yet fundamental principle of signal transduction is that parallel signalling pathways operate with a common repertoire of enzymes to propagate diverse physiological responses. One explanation is that signalling cascades are highly organized into localized transduction units. each tailored to respond optimally to a particular signal.

The core of the model is the distribution of pinning and coercive energies due to the polycrystalline nature of the material. Also. because domain nucleation for thin-films seem to be surface dominant. and surface space-charges are usually present. the model assumes that the pinning energies are field activated due to surface screening effects. The model is based on the well known two-state cluster theory in statistical physics. Further results from the model include the log (t) dependence of fatigue as a direct consequence of a gaussian distribution of pinning energies. And. for the first time a theoretical description of the V'dependence of fatigue is also described.

71201,Down regulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity at mitosis may involve phosphorylation of regulatory subunits by members of the CDK family,1996,LAMB Ned and SCOTT John and FERNANDEZ Anne,88,Biology of the Cell,1-2,73,No longer published by Elsevier,Inactivation of interphase events involving CAMP-dependent protein kinase plays an important role in activation of mammalian cells into mitosis. Overexpression of A-kin&se catalytic activity effectively compromises mitotic entry whereas an inactivation of the kinase through microinjection of specific peptide inhibitor induces morphological changes similar to those observed during early prophase. Inhibition of A-kinase also acts in a synergistic manner with cdc2 in the induction of lamin breakdown in mammalian cells. Whereas PKI is a potential candidate for inducing these changes. it is both highly sensitive to intracellular proteases and poorly expressed by either northern blotting or immunological methods. We have therefore examined the alternative possibility that A-kinase down regulation at mitosis is brought about by the endogenous regulatory subunits. We show that both RI or RI1 can be directly phosphorylated by different members of the cdk family at a site implicated in CAMP binding. Moreover. this phosphorylation can be detected in vivo and occurs coincidentally with mitotic entry. The microinjection of two mutant forms of RII. one mutated at the cdk phosphorylation site and the other mutated at both CAMP binding sites. induce effects on cell morphology and cytoskeleton similar to those observed with microinjection of PKI. Taken together. these data suggest that the inhibition of CAMP binding to the regulatory subunits via &-mediated direct phosphorylation of R subunits. may play an important role in the induction of mitosis in mammalian cells.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/48309799/S0248-4900_2897_2986859-120160825-6319-qpap9l.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48309799/S0248-4900_2897_2986859-120160825-6319-qpap9l.pdf,0,0,0

These involve load variations and system faults. That has to be sorted out before a power system engineer accepts MHD into his system. A major factor in power system planning is the availability of the power plant as determined by its reliability and maintenance needs. This availability depends on the reliability not only of the generator. but on the auxiliary and downstream components. as well as. the power inverters conditioning system. Another most important factor is the need to design the power conditioning and control system with a clear understanding of what the power system requires and what undesired conditions the power system imposes on it. MHD generator characteristics and power conditioning system performances must be matched to power system demands and characteristics. Within this context. the paper assesses design requirements relative to the following areas: steady state power supply; dynamic and transient conditions. functions of the power conditioning system.

Oxford University Press,This short paperback book relates animal behavior to ecology and the phenomena of population growth and regulation. Davis has deliberately omit-ted extensive treatment of individual behavior. and his first two chapters are essentially a very brief introduction to sensory phenomena. Chapter 3 discusses the changing factors in the habitat to which an animal must adjust. and Chapter 4 points out that animals. through their adaptive behavior and movement. are able to escape from the restric-tions of their habitats. and in general evolve toward controlling and modi-fying the environment. Chapter 5 takes up social behavior and the resultant organization of populations. chiefly with respect to territories and dominance hierarchies.All of this is essentially introductory to chapters on the regulation and survival of populations.

Another cause is. that the Excise has not. and still does not. avail itself sufficiently of the great and ascertained ad-vantages derived from the publication of the names and addresses of adulterators or sellers of adulterated articles. In proof of this statement. the fact may be cited. that in the course of a whole year scarcely a dozen cases of adulteration are brought by the Excise under the notice of the public.

September 23rd. full of years and honour. there passed away at the age of 75. George Cursham. MD Paris. FRCP Long will Dr. Cursham be mourned and his memory affectionately cherished by those who were admitted to the privilege of his intimate acquaintance. Dr. Cursham's high principle and unfailing rectitude. combined with his clear judgment. made him highly respected by his professional brethren. who must feel that one has gone forth from amongst them whose place will not easily be filled. Dr. Cursham was for many years Physician to the Brompton Consumption Hospital and to the Asylum for Female Orphans; he was also for some years Secretary to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. and held up to the time of his death the post of Inspector of Anatomy to the provincial schools.JOHN SCOTT. FRCS ED.. OF CULROSS. IT is the wish of some medical men to die in harness. but it is seldom that such is so fully carried out as in the sudden and sad death of Mr. John Scott of Culross. He went out on the morning of the 15th August apparently in good health. and had visited one or two of his patients and was on his way to see another. when he felt the first symptoms of the fatal seizure. After three such warnings he came out of his gig. told his boy not to leave him. and lay down by the road-side and died.

part of the letter written by Mr. West in your JOURNAL of the 8th inst. But. at the same time. there

PKC and protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin that regulates phosphorylation pathways underlying neuronal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) synaptic plasticity. AKAP79/150 postsynaptic targeting requires three N-terminal basic domains that bind F-actin and acidic phospholipids. Here we report a novel interaction of these domains with cadherin adhesion molecules that are linked to actin through β-catenin (β-cat) at neuronal synapses and epithelial adherens junctions. Mapping the AKAP binding site in cadherins identified overlap with β-cat binding; however. no competition between AKAP and β-cat binding to cadherins was detected in vitro. Accordingly. AKAP79/150 exhibited polarized localization with β-cat and cadherins in epithelial cell lateral membranes. and β-cat was present in AKAP-cadherin complexes …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:9LpHyFPp1DQC,0,https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/prev/20180314-aop/pdf/10.1091/mbc.e05-02-0134,,,,,0,0,0

While the repetition rate of the Quantel pump lasers in the final Gemini amplifier limits TA3 operations to 0.05 Hz. TA2 can be operated at 5 Hz. Until now TA2 has reduced the repetition rate to a maximum of 1 Hz because of the practical challenges of increasing to the full capability. In this report we address these issues and describe the first experimental campaign conducted with the full 5 Hz repetition rate.

The transmitted laser and electron beam generated in a laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerator are clearly observed to depend on the gas jet backing pressure. The spectral properties of these beams are seen to be smooth functions of the input parameters. when averaging over a set 49 shots for each value and employing gradual changes in pressure. This allows for detailed examination of the interaction physics. and can better reveal threshold behaviour and highly localised optima.

71262,AKAP150-dependent cooperative TRPV4 channel gating is central to,,Michael I Kotlikoff Hill-Eubanks and John D Scott and Luis F Santana and T Mark,,,,,,Endothelial cell dysfunction. characterized by a diminished response to endothelial cell–dependent vasodilators. is a hallmark of hypertension. TRPV4 channels play a major role in endothelial-dependent vasodilation. a function mediated by local Ca2+ influx through clusters of functionally coupled TRPV4 channels rather than by a global increase in endothelial cell Ca2+. We showed that stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on endothelial cells of mouse arteries exclusively activated TRPV4 channels that were localized at myoendothelial projections (MEPs). specialized regions of endothelial cells that contact smooth muscle cells. Muscarinic receptor–mediated activation of TRPV4 depended on protein kinase C (PKC) and the PKC-anchoring protein AKAP150. which was concentrated at MEPs. Cooperative opening of clustered TRPV4 channels specifically amplified Ca2+ influx at MEPs. Cooperativity of TRPV4 channels at non-MEP sites was much lower. and cooperativity at MEPs was greatly reduced by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ or AKAP150 knockout. suggesting that Ca2+ entering through adjacent channels underlies the AKAP150-dependent potentiation of TRPV4 activity. In a mouse model of angiotensin II–induced hypertension. MEP localization of AKAP150 was disrupted. muscarinic receptor stimulation did not activate TRPV4 channels. cooperativity among TRPV4 channels at MEPs was weaker. and vasodilation in response to muscarinic receptor stimulation was reduced. Thus. endothelial-dependent dilation of resistance arteries is enabled by MEP-localized AKAP150. which ensures the proximity of PKC to TRPV4 …,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:1r-w4gtu6w8C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/43929362/AKAP150-dependent_cooperative_TRPV4_chan20160320-22940-1i1oex0.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43929362/AKAP150-dependent_cooperative_TRPV4_chan20160320-22940-1i1oex0.pdf,0,0,0

His discovery of protein phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism (with Edmond Fischer) touched all aspects of biomedical science and profoundly influenced therapeutic approaches now widely used in clinical care. Ed’s life story epitomizes his commitment to family and colleagues. excellence in research and service to the biochemical community. Ed Krebs was born in Lansing. Iowa. on June 6. 1918. the son of a Presbyterian minister and a schoolteacher. His father died suddenly when Ed was 15 and. at the height of the Great Depression. the family moved to Urbana. Ill.. for financial reasons. It was there that Krebs completed high school and earned a degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1940. As an undergraduate. he became enamored with organic chemistry but eventually chose to become a physician. largely because he won a scholarship to attend Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The principal responsibility of a medical school during the war years was to train physicians for the armed forces. However. Krebs also was encouraged to participate in “medical research.” After graduating from medical school in 1943 and doing 18 months of residency training in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. Krebs went on active duty as a medical officer in the Navy. After being discharged from the Navy in 1946. Krebs returned to St. Louis with plans of becoming an academic internist.

Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis. with approximately 50% of patients with compensated cirrhosis developing ascites over the course of 10 years. After developing ascites that necessitates hospitalization. the risk of mortality increases to 15% at 1 year and nearly 50% at 5 years. Complications following the development of ascites include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. dilutional hyponatremia. refractory ascites. hepatic hydrothorax. and hepatorenal syndrome.

Existing biomaterial technologies are not designed to provide physical guidance cues to regenerating axons–a design parameter that is known to be important in promoting neural regeneration [2]. We hypothesize that implantable biomaterial scaffolds can be patterned to provide optimal physical guidance cues for regenerating axons. To test this hypothesis. we have employed an embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglia (DRG) model to evaluate scaffold performance in vitro. Our key goal is to promote rapid axon growth through the scaffold. as swift reinnervation of targets lessens the likelihood of neuromuscular junction atrophy and permanent loss of function [3]. To this end. we have evaluated scaffold performance by quantifying maximum axon length.,True,mzG58bYAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC,0,http://www.termis.org/docs/abstracts/am2010/1098.pdf,,,,http://www.termis.org/docs/abstracts/am2010/1098.pdf,0,0,0

Both sPLA2s induced TNF-α and IL-6 release in a concentration-dependent manner by increasing their mRNA expression. This effect was independent of their enzymatic activity because 1) the capacity of sPLA2s to mobilize arachidonic acid from HLM was unrelated to their ability to induce cytokine production; and 2) two catalytically inactive isoforms of group IB sPLA2 (bromophenacyl bromide-inactivated human sPLA2 and the H48Q mutant of the porcine sPLA2) were as effective as the catalytically active sPLA2s in inducing cytokine production.

The much higher enzymatic activity of human group X sPLA2(hGX) compared with human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA) on phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich vesicles is due in large part to the higher affinity of the former enzyme for such vesicles; this result also holds when vesicles contain cholesterol and sphingomyelin. The inclusion of anionic phosphatidylserine in PC vesicles dramatically enhances interfacial binding and catalysis of hGIIA but not of hGX. This is the result of the large number of lysine and arginine residues scattered over the entire surface of hGIIA. which cause the enzyme to form a supramolecular aggregate with multiple vesicles.

This review focuses on the description of a number of classes of rationally designed phospholipase A2 inhibitors. The development of a theoretical framework for the proper analysis of inhibitors is presented. Structural studies of phospholipase A2‐inhibitor complexes suggest how the lipolysis reaction is catalyzed. Finally. some recent results on the use of phospholipase A2 inhibitors in living cells and tissues are revealed.— Gelb. M. H.. Jain. M. K..

The sPLA2 found in honey bee venom is neurotoxic and binds to this receptor with high affinity. In this paper. we have used a number of mutants of bee venom sPLA2 produced in Escherichia coli to determine the structural elements of this protein that are involved in its binding to N-type receptors. Mutations in the interfacial binding surface. in the Ca2+-binding loop and in the hydrophobic channel lead to a dramatic decrease in binding to N-type receptors. whereas mutations of surface residues localized in other parts of the sPLA2 structure do not significantly modify the binding properties.

Trypanosoma cruzi. by blocking ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase. Tipifarnib is an inhibitor of human protein farnesyltransferase. We synthesized tipifarnib analogues that no longer bind to protein farnesyltransferase and display increased potency for killing parasites. This was achieved in a structure-guided fashion by changing the substituents attached to the phenyl group at the 4-position of the quinoline ring of tipifarnib and by replacing the amino group by OMe. Several compounds that kill Trypanosoma cruzi at subnanomolar concentrations and are devoid of protein farnesyltransferase inhibition were discovered.

Previously we showed that blocking PFT in the malaria parasite led to cell death and that THQ-based inhibitors are the most potent among several structural classes of PFT inhibitors (PFTIs). We have prepared 266 THQ-based PFTIs and discovered several compounds that inhibit the malarial enzyme in the sub- to low-nanomolar range and that block the growth of the parasite (P. falciparum) in the low-nanomolar range.

A novel pre-steady-state kinetic analysis with enzyme tightly bound to vesicles and with a substrate that undergoes slow intervesicle exchange establishes that pPAF-AH accesses its substrate from the aqueous phase and thus is not an interfacial enzyme.

The objective of this study was to identify genes differentially expressed in EIB and to understand the function of these genes in the biology of asthma.  Methodology/Principal Findings Genome-wide expression profiling of airway leukocytes and epithelial cells obtained by induced sputum was conducted in two groups of subjects with asthma with and without EIB (n = 7 per group). at baseline and following exercise challenge. Based on the results of the gene expression study. additional comparisons were made with a normal control group (n = 10).

This situation is due perhaps to a longstanding research emphasis on developmental regulation in sporulating strains of B. subtilis and the popularly held belief that Escherichia coli is the paradigm for prokaryotic gene expression. However. research during the past few years on tryptophan biosynthesis (10. 19. 20) and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis (7) and initial studies on other biosynthetic pathways have uncovered features that distinguish gene organization and regulation in species of Bacillus from those in the Gram-negative enteric bacteria.

Since they can be released by virtually any cell lineages and are retrieved in biological fluids. microparticles appear as potent biomarkers.

This characteristic is reflected in the lack of ability of this enzyme to bind productively to zwitterionic interfaces. Part of the molecular basis for this lack of activity is an absence of tryptophan. a residue with a known preference for residing in the interfacial region of zwitterionic phospholipid bilayers.

BEAS-2B cells contain three different RNA splice variants of cPLA2β (β1. β2. and β3). cPLA2β1 is identical to the previously cloned cPLA2β. predicted to encode a 114-kDa protein. However. cPLA2β2 and cPLA2β3 splice variants are smaller and contain internal deletions in the catalytic domain.

However. the phospholipid asymmetry across intracellular membranes is not known. Two models have been proposed for the selective targeting of K-Ras4B. which contains a C-terminal farnesyl cysteine methyl ester adjacent to a polybasic peptide segment. to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. One involves electrostatic interaction of the lipidated polybasic domain with anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane. and the other involves binding of K-Ras4B to a specific protein receptor.

V. IIA. and IID. A similar expression pattern was also found in human skin biopsies. Protein analysis showed that under serum-free conditions only group X secreted phospholipase A2 is secreted into cell culture supernatants of HaCaT as well as human primary keratinocytes. whereas the other secreted phospholipases A2 were not detectable at protein level. HaCaT keratinocytes constitutively released secreted phospholipase A2 activity into the cell culture supernatant. being reected by a constant release of fatty acids. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. which is a potent inducer of inammation in skin. drastically reduced the mRNA level of group X secreted phospholipase A2 and other secreted phospholipase A2 subtypes as well as secreted phospholipase A2 activity in cell culture supernatants. This suggests that inhibition of secreted phospholipase A2 expression and activity as well as of fatty acid release by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment might be a critical step impairing the integrity of the epidermis during phorbol-ester-induced pathologic processes in skin.

In this study. we provide an improved pre-mass spectrometry lipid extraction procedure that avoids the acid-catalyzed decomposition of plasmenyl phospholipids that is problematic with previously reported methods. We show that the use of lysophospholipid internal standards with perdeuterated fatty acyl chains avoids isobar problems associated with the use of internal standards containing odd carbon number fatty acyl chains. We also show that LC prior to MS is required to avoid numerous problems associated with isobars and with MS in-source decomposition of lysophosphatidylserine.

FTase inhibitors have emerged as a significant target for development of anticancer therapeutics and. more recently. for the treatment of parasitic diseases caused by protozoan pathogens. including malaria (Plasmodium falciparum). We present the X-ray crystallographic structures of complexes of mammalian FTase with five inhibitors based on an ethylenediamine scaffold. two of which exhibit over 1000-fold selective inhibition of P. falciparum FTase.

Considering the link between confluence and cell–cell junction formation. and the emerging role of cPLA2α in intracellular trafficking. we tested whether Golgi-associated cPLA2α is involved in the trafficking of junction proteins. Here. we show that the redistribution of cPLA2α from the cytoplasm to the Golgi correlates with adherens junction maturation and occurs before tight junction formation.

71588,Newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases: methodologies. screen positive rates. normalization of datasets. second-tier tests. and post-analysis tools,2018,Michael H Gelb,4,International journal of neonatal screening,3,23,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,All of the worldwide newborn screening (NBS) for lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) is done by measurement of lysosomal enzymatic activities in dried blood spots (DBS). Substrates used for these assays are discussed. While the positive predictive value (PPV) is the gold standard for evaluating medical tests. current PPVs for NBS of LSDs cannot be used as a performance metric due to statistical sampling errors and uncertainty in the onset of disease symptoms. Instead. we consider the rate of screen positives as the only currently reliable way to compare LSD NBS results across labs worldwide. It has been suggested that the expression of enzymatic activity data as multiple-of-the-mean is a way to normalize datasets obtained using different assay platforms. so that results can be compared. and universal cutoffs can be developed. We show that this is often not the case. and normalization is currently not feasible. We summarize the recent use of pattern matching statistical analysis together with measurement of an expanded group of enzymatic activities and biomarkers to greatly reduce the number of false positives for NBS of LSDs. We provide data to show that these post-enzymatic activity assay methods are more powerful than genotype analysis for the stratification of NBS for LSDs.

Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) are interesting not only as prototypes for interfacial catalysis. but also because they mobilize precursors for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids and platelet activating factor. and these agents ultimately control a wide range of secretory and inflammatory processes. Since PLA2 carry out their catalytic function at membrane surfaces. the kinetics of these enzymes depends on what the enzyme ‘sees’ at the interface. and thus the observed rate is profoundly influenced by the organization and dynamics of the lipidwater interface (‘quality of the interface’). In this review we elaborate the advantages of monitoring interfacial catalysis in the scooting mode. that is. under the conditions where the enzyme remains bound to vesicles for several thousand catalytic turnover cycles. Such a highly processive catalytic turnover in the scooting mode is useful for a rigorous and quantitative characterization of the kinetics of interfacial catalysis.

Patients with the infantile form of Krabbe disease can be treated at a presymptomatic stage with human stem cell transplantation which improves survival and clinical outcomes. However. without a family history. most cases of infantile Krabbe disease present after onset of symptoms and are ineligible for transplantation. In 2006. New York began screening newborns for Krabbe disease to identify presymptomatic cases. To ensure that those identified with infantile disease received timely treatment. New York public health and medical systems took steps to accurately diagnose and rapidly refer infants for human stem cell transplantation within the first few weeks of life. After 11 years of active screening in New York and the introduction of Krabbe disease newborn screening in other states. new information has been gained which can inform the design of newborn screening programs to improve infantile Krabbe disease outcomes. Recent information relevant to Krabbe disease screening. diagnosis. and treatment were assessed by a diverse group of public health. medical. and advocacy professionals. Outcomes after newborn screening may improve if treatment for infantile disease is initiated before 30 days of life.

The currently two available methodologies used for measurement of enzymatic activities are tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and digital microfluidics fluorimetry (DMF-F). In this chapter we summarize the workflows for the two platforms. Neither platform is fully automated. but the relative ease of workflow will be dependent upon the specific operation of each newborn screening laboratory on a case-by-case basis. We provide the screen positive rate (the number of below cutoff newborns per 100.000 newborns) from all NBS laboratories worldwide carrying out MS/MS-based NBS of one or more LSDs. The analytical precision of the MS/MS method is higher than that for DMF-F as shown by analysis of a common set of quality control DBS by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Both the MS/MS and DMF-F platforms enable multiplexing of the LSD enzymes. An advantage of MS/MS over DMF-F is the ability to include assays of enzymatic activities and biomarkers for which no fluorimetric methods exist. Advantages of DMF-F over MS/MS are:(1) simple to use technology with same-day turn-around time for the lysosomal enzymes with the fastest rates compared to MS/MS requiring overnight analytical runs.;(2) the DMF-F instrumentation. because of its simplicity. requires less maintenance than the MS/MS platform.

With the large number of additional sPLA2s in the mammalian genome. the involvement of other sPLA2s in the asthma model is possible – in particular. the group V sPLA2 (sPLA2-V) that like sPLA2-X is highly active at hydrolyzing membranes of mammalian cells.   Methodology and Principal Findings The allergen-driven asthma phenotype was significantly reduced in sPLA2-V-deficient mice but to a lesser extent than observed previously in sPLA2-X-deficient mice. The most striking difference observed between the sPLA2-V and sPLA2-X knockouts was the significant impairment of the primary immune response to the allergen ovalbumin (OVA) in the sPLA2-V−/− mice. The impairment in eicosanoid generation and dendritic cell activation in sPLA2-V−/− mice diminishes Th2 cytokine responses in the airways.

LSDs are progressive conditions that are typically asymptomatic at birth. potentially making them ideal candidates for newborn screening (NBS). Over the past decade. the development of high-throughput assays with multiplexing capabilities for use with dried blood spot (DBS) samples has facilitated several pilot NBS programs for LSDs worldwide. Such programs have been invaluable in providing knowledge of these disorders. particularly in regards to their true incidence and the overall feasibility of widespread population screening for LSDs.

71685,Off-target effect of the cPLA2α inhibitor pyrrophenone: Inhibition of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum,2016,Bogeon Yun and HeeJung Lee and Heather Ewing and Michael H Gelb and Christina C Leslie,479,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,1,61-66,Academic Press,Cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) mediates agonist-induced release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipid for production of eicosanoids. The activation of cPLA2α involves increases in intracellular calcium. which binds to the C2 domain and promotes cPLA2α translocation from the cytosol to membrane to access substrate. The cell permeable pyrrolidine-containing cPLA2α inhibitors including pyrrophenone have been useful to understand cPLA2α function. Although this serine hydrolase inhibitor does not inhibit other PLA2s or downstream enzymes that metabolize arachidonic acid. we reported that it blocks increases in mitochondrial calcium and cell death in lung fibroblasts. In this study we used the calcium indicators G-CEPIA1er and CEPIA2mt to compare the effect of pyrrophenone in regulating calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in response to A23187 and …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:65Yg0jNCQDAC,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X1631484X,8111498641687042966,/scholar?cites=8111498641687042966,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5063313/,0,0,0

The transcriptional pathway mediating this effect is however unknown. Since products of PLA2 activity are endogenous activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). we postulated that sPLA2s mediate their effects on sPLA2-IIA expression via sPLA2 activity and subsequent PPARα activation. This study shows that various sPLA2s. including venom enzymes. human sPLA2-IIA. wild-type and catalytically inactive H48Q mutant of porcine pancreatic sPLA2-IB. enhance the TNFα-induced sPLA2-IIA expression at the mRNA and protein levels. In cells transfected with luciferase sPLA2-IIA promoter constructs. sPLA2s are active only when the promoter contains a functional PPRE-1 site. The effect of exogenous sPLA2s is also blocked by the PPARα inhibitor MK886. Interestingly. the expression of sPLA2-IIA induced by TNFα alone is also attenuated by MK886. by the sPLA2-IIA inhibitor LY311727. by heparinase. which prevents the binding of sPLA2-IIA to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. and by the specific cPLA2-α inhibitor pyrrolidine-1.

71708,The importance of assay imprecision near the screen cutoff for newborn screening of lysosomal storage diseases,2019,Bruce H Robinson and Michael H Gelb,5,International journal of neonatal screening,2,17,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,For newborn screening (NBS) of lysosomal storage diseases. programs measure enzymatic activities in dried blood spots (DBS) and. in most cases. act on samples where the measurement is below a specific cutoff value. The rate of false positives and negatives in any NBS program is of critical importance. The measured values across a population of newborns are governed by many factors. and in this article we focus on assay imprecision. Assay parameters including the Analytical Range and the Z-Factor have been discussed as a way to compare assay performance for NBS of lysosomal storage diseases. Here we show that these parameters are not rigorously connected to the rate of false positives and negatives. Rather. it is the assay imprecision near the screen cutoff that is the most important parameter that determines the rate of false positives and negatives. We develop the theoretical treatment of assay imprecision and how it is linked to screen performance. What emerges is a useful type of parametric plot that allows for rigorous assessment of the effect of assay imprecision on the rate of false positives and false negatives that is independent of the choice of screen cutoff value. Such plots are useful in choosing cutoff values. They also show that a high assay imprecision cannot be overcome by changing the cutoff value or by use of postanalysis. statistical tools. Given the importance of assay imprecision near the cutoff. we propose that quality control DBS are most useful if they span a range of analyte values near the cutoff.

The majority of low enzyme results are due to pseudodeficiencies. and studies from the Mayo Clinic have shown that the false positive rate can be greatly reduced by including a second-tier analysis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in DBS as part of NBS. In the present study. we obtained newborn DBS from 13 patients with severe MPS-I and 2 with attenuated phenotypes. These samples were submitted to four different GAG mass spectrometry analyses in a comparative study:(1) internal disaccharide;(2) endogenous disaccharide;(3) Sensi-Pro;(4) Sensi-Pro Lite (a variation of Sensi-Pro with a simplified workflow). Patients with attenuated MPS-I show less GAG elevation than those with severe disease. and all MPS-I patients were separated from the reference range using all four methods. The minimal differential factor (lowest GAG marker level in MPS-I samples divided by highest level in the reference range of 30 random newborns) was about two for internal disaccharide. Sensi-Pro. and Sensi-Pro Lite methods. The endogenous disaccharide was clearly the best method with a minimal differential of 16-fold.

Schistosomiasis. a chronic and painful infection. is caused by various species of the Schistosoma flatworm. There is only one partially effective drug. praziquantel. a worrisome situation should drug resistance emerge. As many essential metabolic pathways and enzymes are shared between eukaryotic organisms. it is possible to conceive of small molecule interventions that target more than one organism or target. particularly when chemical matter is already available. Farnesyltransferase (FT). the last common enzyme for products derived from the mevalonate pathway. is vital for diverse functions. including cell differentiation and growth.

There are no potent inhibitors for hGIII-sPLA2 reported to date. so we adapted a fluorescence-based enzyme activity monitoring method to a high-throughput screening format. We opted to use an assay based on phospholipid substrate present in phospholipid vesicles since this matrix more closely resembles the natural substrate of hGIII-sPLA2. as opposed to phospholipid/detergent mixed micelles. The substrate is a phospholipid analogue containing BODIPY fluorophores dispersed as a minor component in vesicles of nonfluorescent phospholipids.

The method is rendered highly quantitative by use of a chemically identical but isotopically differentiated internal standard. Such an internal standard corrects for losses of analyte signal in the assay owing to sample handing or MS/MS signal loss because of suppression of analyte ionization in the electrospray source.

71728,Study of the Role of Cytosolic Phospholipase A 2 Alpha in Eicosanoid Generation and Thymocyte Maturation in the Thymus,2015,Matthieu Rousseau and Gajendra S Naika and Jean Perron and Frederic Jacques and Michael H Gelb and Eric Boilard,10,PloS one,5,e0126204,Public Library of Science,The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ. home of maturation and selection of thymocytes for generation of functional T-cells. Multiple factors are involved throughout the different stages of the maturation process to tightly regulate T-cell production. The metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases. lipoxygenases and specific isomerases generates eicosanoids. lipid mediators capable of triggering cellular responses. In this study. we determined the profile of expression of the eicosanoids present in the mouse thymus at different stages of thymocyte development. As the group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids. thereby generating arachidonic acid. we further verified its contribution by including cPLA2α deficient mice to our investigations. We found that a vast array of eicosanoids is expressed in the thymus. which expression is substantially modulated through thymocyte development. The cPLA2α was dispensable in the generation of most eicosanoids in the thymus and consistently. the ablation of the cPLA2α gene in mouse thymus and the culture of thymuses from human newborns in presence of the cPLA2α inhibitor pyrrophenone did not impact thymocyte maturation. This study provides information on the eicosanoid repertoire present during thymocyte development and suggests that thymocyte maturation can occur independently of cPLA2α.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:wLxue7F8ec0C,3,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126204,18132350956770270702,/scholar?cites=18132350956770270702,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0126204,0,0,0

71730,A simple and inexpensive device for removal of solvent from a large collection of sample tubes,2006,Michael H Gelb and Brian P Holm,8,Journal of combinatorial chemistry,1,15-17,American Chemical Society,Introduction. In most high-throughput chemical synthesis processes. whether it be combinatorial or parallel synthesis. one is faced with the task of having to remove solvent from a large number of containers. such as glass tubes or vials. Removal of solvent by evaporation is a necessary step following various synthetic workup or chromatographic procedures. Solvent removal from a collection of containers is typically carried out with a vacuum centrifuge in which centrifugal force is used to prevent mechanical sample loss due to violent solvent boiling or degassing (bumping). Although vacuum centrifuges that can accommodate hundreds of sample containers are commercially available. they are very expensive and require a large amount of laboratory space. We now describe a simple alternative to a vacuum centrifuge that can be assembled for less than a few thousand dollars and is capable of removing solvent from several hundred or more tubes.Results and Discussion. The new device is shown in Figure 1. and a full description and construction information along with photographs is given as Supporting Information. It is a stainless steel chamber with an O-ring-sealed acrylic lid. The side of the box is fitted with a vacuum port and a four-electrode feed-through. Inside the box at its base is an acrylic heat insulator sheet and a layer of aluminum honeycomb. which serves as a heat-conducting rack for hundreds of test tubes. The honeycomb is heated by six canister heaters inserted at regular intervals in cells of the honeycomb block. Electrical current to these heaters is controlled by an inexpensive solid-state temperature control unit attached to the …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:LdasjJ6CEcoC,3,http://faculty.washington.edu/gelb/2006/gelb2006-J.Comb.Chem-no8iss1p15.pdf,511596601913436567,/scholar?cites=511596601913436567,,http://faculty.washington.edu/gelb/2006/gelb2006-J.Comb.Chem-no8iss1p15.pdf,0,0,0

In human lung. spleen and ovary. and in a lung epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) cPLA2β is expressed as a 100 kDa protein not the 114 kDa form originally predicted. Using RNA-interference. the 100 kDa protein in BEAS-2B cells was confirmed to be cPLA2β. BEAS-2B cells contain three different RNA splice-variants of cPLA2β (β1. β2 and β3). cPLA2β1 is identical to the previously cloned cPLA2β. predicted to encode a 114 kDa protein. However. cPLA2β2 and cPLA2β3 splice-variants are smaller and contain internal deletions in the catalytic domain. The 100 kDa cPLA2β in BEAS-2B cells is the translated product of cPLA2β3. cPLA2β3 exhibits calciumdependent PLA2 activity against palmitoylarachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. lowlevel lysophospholipase activity. but no activity against phosphatidylcholine. Unlike Group IVA cPLA2α. cPLA2β3 is constitutively bound to membrane in un-stimulated cells. localizing to mitochondria and early endosomes. cPLA2β3 is widely expressed in tissues suggesting that it has a generalized function at these unique sites.Phospholipase A2(PLA2) enzymes catalyze hydrolysis of sn-2 acyl chains from membrane phospholipids.

We carried out a research study to assess the feasibility of screening MLD using dried blood spots (DBS) from de-identified newborns.MethodsTo minimize the false-positive rate. a two-tier screening algorithm was designed. The primary test was to quantify C16: 0-sulfatide in DBS by ultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The screening cutoff was established based on the results from 15 MLD newborns to achieve 100% sensitivity. The secondary test was to measure the ARSA activity in DBS from newborns with abnormal C16: 0-sulfatide levels. Only newborns that displayed both abnormal …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:eFf2swCANGcC,1,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-01017-5,5201820935113114358,/scholar?cites=5201820935113114358,,,0,0,0

As for assays for more common diseases. it is important to achieve congruence when multiple clinical laboratories provide testing. Four clinical laboratories. one research laboratory. and a commercial vendor collaborated with the goal to achieve congruence in quantitative psychosine measurement in DBS. A set of DBS calibrators was prepared by a single vendor and used in each reference laboratory to make a standard curve of measured psychosine in DBS versus the stated calibrator psychosine level. Congruence between the participating five laboratories was achieved using the psychosine DBS calibrators. This allowed application of disease-specific reference ranges obtained by the reference laboratory with the most extensive data by the other reference laboratories. Congruence between multiple reference laboratories in the measurement of the absolute concentration of biomarkers in DBS (and by extension other samples) is possible by the use of a common set of DBS calibrators.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:Gpwnp1kGG20C,1,https://www.mdpi.com/2409-515X/6/2/29,17980158956659552396,/scholar?cites=17980158956659552396,,https://www.mdpi.com/2409-515X/6/2/29/pdf,0,0,0

Using mutant CHO-K1 cell lines. it is shown that this arachidonate release does not require heparan sulfate proteoglycan-or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. It is shown that the potent secreted phospholipase A2 inhibitor Me-Indoxam is cell-impermeable. By use of Me-Indoxam and the cell-impermeable. secreted phospholipase A 2 trapping agent heparin. it is shown that hGIIA liberates free arachidonate prior to secretion from the cell. With hGX-transfected CHO-K1 cells. arachidonate release occurs before and after enzyme secretion. whereas all of the arachidonate release from HEK293 cells occurs prior to enzyme secretion. Immunocytochemical studies by confocal laser and electron microscopies show localization of hGIIA to the cell surface and Golgi compartment. Additional results show that the interleukin-1β-dependent release of arachidonate is promoted by secreted phospholipase A 2 expression and is completely dependent on cytosolic (group IVA) phospholipase A 2.

We have shown that protein prenylation occurs in the trypanosomatids T. brucei. T. cruzi. and L. amazonensis. We have detected the enzyme that attaches farnesyl groups to proteins. protein farnesyltransferase (PFT). in the cytosol of these parasites and have purified T. brucei PFT to homogeneity. PFT farnesylates the cysteine SH of a tetrapeptide sequence at the C-termini of proteins (CaaX. where C is cysteine. a is usually but not necessarily an aliphatic residue. and X is a variety of amino acids). CaaX mimetics that are potent PFT inhibitors are also potent at killing trypanosomatids in vitro. Since CaaX mimetics are being intensively developed as anti-cancer agents. we can take advantage of the wealth of pre-clinical data on these agents as we develop these compounds as anti-trypanosomatid agents (piggy-back approach).,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:nPTYJWkExTIC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Fairlamb/publication/225032289_Target_discovery_and_validation_with_special_reference_to_trypanothione/links/09e4150faa61902978000000.pdf#page=131,1177574865268572200,/scholar?cites=1177574865268572200,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Fairlamb/publication/225032289_Target_discovery_and_validation_with_special_reference_to_trypanothione/links/09e4150faa61902978000000.pdf#page=131,0,0,0

The resulting set of 1035 hit compounds was reviewed by a team of medicinal chemists. leading to the nomination of 17 chemically distinct scaffolds for further investigation. The first triage step was the assessment for brain permeability (looking for brain levels at least 20% of plasma levels) in order to optimize the chances of developing candidates for treating late-stage human African trypanosomiasis. Eleven scaffolds subsequently underwent hit-to-lead optimization using standard medicinal chemistry approaches. Over a period of six years in an academic setting. 1539 analogs to the 11 scaffolds were synthesized. Eight scaffolds were discontinued either due to insufficient improvement in antiparasitic activity (5). poor pharmacokinetic properties (2). or a slow (static) antiparasitic activity (1). Three scaffolds were optimized to the point of curing the acute and/or chronic T. brucei infection model in mice. The progress was accomplished without knowledge of the mechanism of action (MOA) for the compounds. although the MOA has been discovered in the interim for one compound series. Studies on the safety and toxicity of the compounds are planned to help select candidates for potential clinical development.

They catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 ester bond of glycerophospholipids. producing free fatty acids including arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids. 1 The secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) family (groups IB. IIA. IIC. IID. IIE. IIF. III. V. X and XII) are mainly small secreted proteins of 14-18 kDa. GIIA was among the first groups of sPLA2 identified and was found in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It has also been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions and is believed to enhance lipid accumulation in arterial intima. 2The domain of GIIA sPLA2 contains three long α-helices. two-stranded β-sheets referred as β-wings. and a conserved Ca2+ binding loop. Most of the residues of the GIIA sPLA2 surface are basic. which may cause the selectivity of the enzyme of binding to anionic vesicles. The active site consists of the catalytic dyad His47/Asp91. the Ca2+ ion and a long lipophilic tunnel which tends to enfold the aliphatic parts of substrates when they occur. The discovery of potent and selective PLA2 inhibitors is of great pharmaceutical importance. 3 Kokotos and cowokers have developed a novel class of inhibitors (1a. 1b) for cytosolic phospholipase A2 (GIVA cPLA2). 4 Most recently. it was found that the long chain 2-oxoamide GK126 based on the amino acid (S)-leucine displayed inhibition of human and mouse GIIA sPLA2 (IC50 300 nM and 180 nM. respectively). 5 Here. we present a series of docking experiments of long chain 2-oxoamide …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:NxmKEeNBbOMC,0,http://repository.edulll.gr/edulll/bitstream/10795/3094/2/3094_1.81_%CE%91%CE%9D_7_9_12.pdf,,,,http://repository.edulll.gr/edulll/bitstream/10795/3094/2/3094_1.81_%CE%91%CE%9D_7_9_12.pdf,0,0,0

HexA-/-mice. depleted of β-hexosaminidase A gene. remains asymptomatic to 1 year of age. owing to the ability of these mice to catabolise stored GM2 ganglioside via sialidase(s) removing sialic acid into glycolipid GA2 which further processed by β-Hexosaminidase B. thereby bypassing the HexA defect. To elucidate whether plasma membrane associated sialidase Neu3 can contribute to GM2 ganglioside degradation. we generated a double deficient mouse model by crossing previously generated HexA-/- mouse model and Neu3-/- mouse model. HexA-/-Neu3-/- mice are healthy at birth but lost weight gradually and died at 4-4.5 months of age. Thin layer chromatography analysis of HexA-/-Neu3-/- mice showed increased GM2 ganglioside level and altered ganglioside pattern in brain as well as liver. kidney and testis.

71821,C31 CLINICAL ASTHMA I: Phospholipid Hydrolysis And Surfactant Alterations In Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction,2015,RA Aguillon Prada and RD Hite and Y Lai and WA Altemeier and A Chakrabarti and MJ Novotny and MH Gelb and TS Hallstrand,191,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,1,American Thoracic Society,Background:Indirect airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a fundamental feature of asthma that is manifested as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Secreted phospholipase A2 (SPLA2) s are elevated in the airways of patients with asthma. and may play a key role in the development of EIB through the regulation of pulmonary surfactant phospholipid hydrolysis and eicosanoid formation.Objectives:To determine if exercise challenge alters sPLA2 release and phospholipid hydrolysis in subjects with asthma.Methods:We obtained hypertonic-induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples (baseline and post exercise) from a cohort of 34 patients with asthma (based on direct AHR to methacholine and indirect AHR to dry air exercise challenge) whose precise phenotype has been previously reported.

In mouse lung fibroblasts A23187 triggered mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) formation. necrotic cell death and LDH release that were blocked by cyclosporin A (CsA) and EGTA. LDH release temporally correlated with arachidonic acid release but did not involve cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) or calcium independent PLA2. Surprisingly. release of arachidonic acid and LDH from cPLA2‐deficient fibroblasts was inhibited by the cPLA2 inhibitor pyrrophenone. and another serine hydrolase inhibitor KT195. by preventing mitochondrial calcium loading. Inhibitors of calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II. a mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) regulator. also prevented MPTP formation and arachidonic acid release induced by A23187 and by H2O2.

71830,Epithelial Regulation Of Mast Cell Phenotype And Function In Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction Through Tslp And Il-33,2013,Teal S Hallstrand and Ying Lai and William Altemeier and John Vandree and Adrian M Piliponsky and Brian Johnson and Cara L Appel and Charles W Frevert and Dallas M Hyde and Steven F Ziegler and Dirk E Smith and Michael H Gelb and William R Henderson,,,,A2675-A2675,American Thoracic Society,Rationale: Mast cell degranulation occurs following exercise challenge in patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). We previously found that patients with EIB relative to asthmatics without EIB have increased gene expression for the mast cell proteases tryptase and carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) but low expression of chymase in the airway epithelium. This unique mast cell protease gene signature suggests that patients with EIB have a unique mast cell phenotype infiltrating the airway epithelium. In the present study. we sought to examine epithelial regulators of mast cell phenotype and function to understand the origin and function of this mast cell population. Methods: We conducted endobronchial biopsies and epithelial brushings in a group of patients with asthma and EIB. and made comparisons to asthmatics without EIB. and to normal controls.

71831,Monthly Meeting,2013,Michael H Gelb and František Tureček and Jack Driscoll,,Nucleus,,,,Diseases caused by inborn errors of metabolism represent a diverse group of several thousand known syndromes (1). Some affect specific organs. some are systemic. and their effects range from mild that appear in adolescence or adulthood. to severe that. if untreated. result in an early death of affected children. Inborn errors of metabolism are rare on an individual basis. but their combined prevalence can be as high as one in a few thousand newborns. In the past decade. breakthrough progress has been made by US pharmaceutical companies in developing sophisticated therapies. such as those based on enzyme replacement or erythropoietic stem cell transplantation. to treat metabolic diseases and save lives of affected children. The new therapies are expensive and carry inherent risks. which places extremely stringent criteria on diagnostic accuracy. Detection of inborn errors poses specific problems. as the disorder phenotype may not be obvious in the early stages of the disease to apply the suitable therapy. Therefore. most disorders are detected by chemical or bioanalytical methods using blood samples from newborns. Even the use of bioanalytical methods is not without problems. For example. detection of specific low-level proteins in blood is made difficult by interferences from high-abundance blood proteins such as albumin. DNA analysis is hampered by the genetic variability of mutations leading to the disorder. Detection of disease-specific metabolites can be problematic because of their low levels in blood and interferences from other. chemically very similar. blood components. This leaves enzyme activity analysis as a powerful …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC,0,https://www.nesacs.org/pub_nucleus/2013/May13.pdf,,,,https://www.nesacs.org/pub_nucleus/2013/May13.pdf,0,0,0

71836,Production of Vascular Endothelial Growth,2010,Gianni Marone and Massimo Triggiani and Rob Oslund Ribatti and Michael H Gelb and Gerard Lambeau,,,,,,Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis mediated by vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are main features of chronic inflammation and tumors. Secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) are overexpressed in inflammatory lung diseases and cancer and they activate inflammatory cells by enzymatic and receptor-mediated mechanisms. We investigated the effect of sPLA2s on the production of VEGFs from human macrophages purified from the lung tissue of patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Primary macrophages express VEGF-A. VEGF-B. VEGF-C. and VEGF-D at both mRNA and protein level. Two human sPLA2s (group IIA and group X) induced the expression and release of VEGF-A and VEGF-C from macrophages. Enzymatically-inactive sPLA2s were as effective as the active enzymes in inducing VEGF production. Me-Indoxam and RO092906A. two compounds that block receptor-mediated effects of sPLA2s. inhibited group X-induced release of VEGF-A. Inhibition of the MAPK p38 by SB203580 also reduced sPLA2-induced release of VEGF-A. Supernatants of group X-activated macrophages induced an angiogenic response in chorioallantoic membranes that was inhibited by Me-Indoxam. Stimulation of macrophages with group X sPLA2 in the presence of adenosine analogs induced a synergistic increase of VEGF-A release and inhibited TNF-a production through a cooperation between A2A and A3 receptors. These results demonstrate that sPLA2s induce production of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in human macrophages by a receptor-mediated mechanism independent from sPLA2 catalytic activity. Thus. sPLA2s may play an important …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rosaria_Staiano/publication/42806737_Production_of_Vascular_Endothelial_Growth_Factors_from_Human_Lung_Macrophages_Induced_by_Group_IIA_and_Group_X_Secreted_Phospholipases_A2/links/00b7d5230419870599000000.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rosaria_Staiano/publication/42806737_Production_of_Vascular_Endothelial_Growth_Factors_from_Human_Lung_Macrophages_Induced_by_Group_IIA_and_Group_X_Secreted_Phospholipases_A2/links/00b7d5230419870599000000.pdf,0,0,0

71838,National Cholesterol Awareness Month Article,2010,Preetha Shridas and William M Bailey and Florence Gizard and Rob C Oslund and Michael H Gelb and Dennis Bruemmer and Nancy R Webb,,,,,,Objective—GX sPLA2 potently hydrolyzes plasma membranes to generate lysophospholipids and free fatty acids; it has been implicated in inflammatory diseases. including atherosclerosis. To identify a novel role for group X (GX) secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) in modulating ATP binding casette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ATP binding casette transporter G1 (ABCG1) expression and. therefore. macrophage cholesterol efflux. Methods and Results—The overexpression or exogenous addition of GX sPLA2 significantly reduced ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in J774 macrophage-like cells. whereas GX sPLA2 deficiency in mouse peritoneal macrophages was associated with enhanced expression. Altered ABC transporter expression led to reduced cholesterol efflux in GX sPLA2-overexpressing J774 cells and increased efflux in GX sPLA2-deficient mouse peritoneal macrophages. Gene regulation was dependent on GX sPLA2 catalytic activity. mimicked by arachidonic acid and abrogated when liver X receptor (LXR) α/ß expression was suppressed. and partially reversed by the LXR agonist T0901317. Reporter assays indicated that GX sPLA2 suppresses the ability of LXR to transactivate its promoters through a mechanism involving the C-terminal portion of LXR spanning the ligand-binding domain. Conclusion—GX sPLA2 modulates gene expression in macrophages by generating lipolytic products that suppress LXR activation. GX sPLA2 may play a previously unrecognized role in atherosclerotic lipid accumulation by negatively regulating the genes critical for cellular cholesterol efflux.(Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2010; 30: 2014-2021.),True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florence_Gizard/publication/46281636_Group_X_Secretory_Phospholipase_A2_Negatively_Regulates_ABCA1_and_ABCG1_Expression_and_Cholesterol_Efflux_in_Macrophages/links/5a08766e4585157013a74252/Group-X-Secretory-Phospholipase-A2-Negatively-Regulates-ABCA1-and-ABCG1-Expression-and-Cholesterol-Efflux-in-Macrophages.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florence_Gizard/publication/46281636_Group_X_Secretory_Phospholipase_A2_Negatively_Regulates_ABCA1_and_ABCG1_Expression_and_Cholesterol_Efflux_in_Macrophages/links/5a08766e4585157013a74252/Group-X-Secretory-Phospholipase-A2-Negatively-Regulates-ABCA1-and-ABCG1-Expression-and-Cholesterol-Efflux-in-Macrophages.pdf,0,0,0

71851,The Role of Phospholipases A2 in Eicosanoid Generation and Airway Inflammation,2007,Michael H Gelb,21,,5,A209-A209,Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,The mammalian genome encodes several secreted phospholipases A2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2. All of these enzymes have been obtained in recombinant form and their in vitro interfacial enzymatic properties studied. Inhibitors of these enzymes are being developed by structure‐based approaches. Mice deficient in each of the phospholipases A2 are available or being prepared.Using all of these tools. we are exploring the possible role of each mammalian phospholipase A2 in liberating arachidonic acid from cellular membranes as the first step in the biosynthetic pathway leading to eicosanoids (prostaglandins and leukotrienes). Studies will be presented showing that the mode of phospholipase A2 action is determined by its membrane binding properties. We are also studying a mouse model of allergic asthma to reveal the role of specific phospholipases A2 in promoting airway inflammation.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:hSRAE-fF4OAC,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.21.5.a209,,,,,0,0,0

Porphyria cutanea tarda and hereditary coproporphyria are two porphyrias with low activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) and coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO). respectively. The common method to determine the efficiency of UROD or CPO is to use HPLC to separate the reaction mixture and quantify the products by fluorometry or UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Reliable assays for UROD and CPO are not widely available in part because of the enzyme instability. Herein we present a new method using MS/MS to quantify the products for these two enzymes in blood samples after simple and fast liquid-liquid extraction.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:kF1pexMAQbMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5095371223039918515&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
71854,Newborn Screening for Lysosomal Storage Disorders,2007,C Ronald Scott and Frantisek Turecek and Michael H Gelb,,,,169-178,Springer. Boston. MA,Screening newborn infants for treatable metabolic diseases has been in existence for over four decades. It was initiated by Dr. Robert McCready in 1962 in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and was based on the work of Dr. Robert Guthrie for the detection of phenylketonuria. The initiation of screening for phenylketonuria and its subsequent expansion to include congenital hypothyroidism. galactosemia. congenital adrenal hyperplasia. biotinidase deficiency. and hemoglobin abnormalities has had a profound effect in preventing the serious consequences from these disorders in susceptible individuals (for review. see Levy and Albers. 2000). The basis of newborn screening is founded on the availability of a simple test that can be performed on a drop of blood obtained from an infant. In practice. several drops of blood are obtained from the infant near the time of birth. placed on specific filter papers …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-70909-3_12,,,,,0,0,0

The disease is endemic in South and Central America with > 16 million people chronically infected and ≈14.000 deaths per year. Current treatment options are inadequate to cure this infection; thus. research is needed to discover better chemotherapeutics. We have an ongoing project making inhibitors to a key enzyme involved in sterol biosynthesis of T. cruzi. sterol 14-demethylase (Tc14DM). This enzyme. the target of azole antifungal drugs. is a well established antimicrobial target. We hypothesize that new compounds can be synthesized with optimal anti-T. cruzi activity. and these will be sufficiently active to cure animals (and humans) with chronic T. cruzi infection.

To understand the molecular basis for the selective binding of hGIIA to anionic membranes. 14 single-site. spin-labeled hGIIA proteins were analyzed in the presence and absence of vesicles of anionic phospholipid by time domain and continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin relaxant techniques. Surprisingly. for hGIIA bound to anionic vesicles. all of the spin labels were highly protected from water-soluble spin relaxants. Together with light scattering studies. these EPR results suggest the formation of a supramolecular aggregate involving clusters of hGIIA molecules …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:A8cqit5AE6sC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13399313570549471185&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Using Micrococcus luteus as a model system we demonstrate the very high specificity of this human enzyme for such hydrolysis compared with the group IB. IIE. IIF. V and X human sPLA2s. A unique feature of the group IIA enzyme is its very high pI due to a large excess of cationic residues on the enzyme surface. The importance of this global positive charge in bacterial cell membrane hydrolysis and bacterial killing has been examined using charge reversal mutagenesis. The global positive charge on the enzyme surface allows penetration through the bacterial cell wall thus allowing access of this enzyme to the cell membrane. Reduced bacterial killing was associated with the loss of positive charge and reduced cell membrane hydrolysis.

Dordrecht,Understanding the processes by which cells liberate free arachidonic acid (AA) from phospholipids is important because this is the first step in the production of the eicosanoids. which mediate a diverse set of biological events including many inflammatory responses related to diseases. It is generally accepted that the glucocorticoid steroids exert their anti-inflammatory properties. at least in part. by blocking the cell’s ability to liberate AA from membrane phospholipids. It now seems certain that the 85-kDa group IV phospholipase A2. also known as cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). is directly involved in liberating AA from cellular phospholipids for the biosynthesis of eicosanoids. and thus it is important to understand how this enzyme is regulated in mammalian cells.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:pQTOvowfQioC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-015-9721-0_16,,,,,0,0,0

Dordrecht,Over the past decade. it has become clear that mammalian cells not only express a variety of intracellular phospholipases A2 (PLA2). but also a diverse set of secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s). While PLA2s are generally considered as key enzymes which control the production of lipid mediators. the function of the 10 distinct sPLA2s cloned so far remains ill-defined. Using venom sPLA2s. two types of specific membrane receptors (N and M) have been identified in various mammalian tissues. Of physiological relevance. the M-type receptor can bind with high affinities to several mammalian sPLA2s. making it likely that mammalian sPLA2s are endogenous ligands of the receptors initially identified with venom sPLA2s. and that the physiological function of the mammalian sPLA2s is not limited to their catalytic activity.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:zdjWy_NXXwUC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-015-9721-0_15,,,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/39041/1/Advances%20in%20prostagiandin%20and%20leukotriene%20research.pdf#page=95,0,0,0

Rat mastocytoma RBL-2H3 cells transfected with heparin-binding (sPLA2-IIA.-V. and-IID). but not heparin-nonbinding (sPLA2-IIC). enzymes released more granule-associated markers (-hexosaminidase and histamine) than mock-or cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2)-transfected cells after stimulation with IgE and Ag. Site-directed mutagenesis of sPLA2-IIA and-V revealed that both the catalytic and heparin-binding domains are essential for this function.

These results suggest that the heparin-binding sPLA2s bind to the perigranular membranes through their heparin-binding domain. and lysophospholipids produced in situ by their enzymatic action may facilitate the ongoing membrane fusion. In contrast to the redundant role of sPLA2-IIA.-IID. and-V in the regulation of degranulation. only sPLA2-V had the ability to markedly augment IgE/Ag-stimulated immediate PGD2 production. which reached a level comparable to that elicited by cPLA2. The latter observation reveals an unexplored functional segregation among the three related isozymes expressed in the same cell population.

In the present study. we have investigated the ability of several stress stimuli to activate SAPKs in platelets and to induce phosphorylation of their substrates. Treatment of human platelets with H2O2 stimulated SAPK2a and its downstream target mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2). Kinase activity reached a maximum after 2-5 min and declined towards basal levels after 15 min. Arsenite caused a steady increase of MAPKAP-K2 activity up to 15 min. The level of maximal kinase activation by H2O2 and arsenite was comparable with the effect caused by the physiological platelet stimulus thrombin. A high osmolarity solution of sorbitol induced comparatively small activation of SAPK2a and MAPKAP-K2.

CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER. BAY 15. SHANNON INDUSTRIAL ESTATE CO. CLARE. IRELAND,Preincubation with interleukin-2 (IL-2). a T cell-derived cytokine. enhanced the increase in intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+](i)) induced by angiotensin II (AII) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). IL-2 itself did not affect the basal [Ca2+](i) level or the maximal response of [Ca2+](i) increase induced by AII. Furthermore. IL-2-induced enhancement was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ suggesting that IL-2 enhances Ca2+ influx induced by AII. IL-2 also enhanced the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by AII. although IL-2 alone did not stimulate DNA synthesis. Genistein. an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases. significantly inhibited IL-2-induced enhancement of both Ca2+ influx and DNA synthesis induced by AII. A neutralizing antibody against heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) partially inhibited IL-2-induced enhancement of DNA synthesis induced by AII. These findings suggest that autocrine HB-EGF is partially involved in the mechanism of IL-2-induced enhancement of DNA synthesis. On the other hand IL-2 stimulated both glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and prostacyclin syntheses and enhanced the stimulation of both GAG and prostacyclin syntheses induced by AII. Therefore. IL-2 may play important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and vascular disease by modulating the responsiveness to AII in VSMC.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:wSy_KLzO7YEC,0,https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/211636,,,,,0,0,0

Inc.,The role of mevalonic acid (MVA) and its products (isoprenoids) in cell proliferation prompted us to investigate the effect of drugs affecting diverse enzymatic steps of the MVA pathway on rat aorta smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. To evaluate this parameter. synchronized SMC (2 x 10 5 cells/dish) were incubated in a medium containing 10% FCS with the tested drugs for 72 hours. SMC proliferation was measured by cell count after trypsinization of the monolayers. using a Coulter Counter. Competitive inhibitors of HMGCoA reductase (statins) decreased SMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect induced by simvastatin 3.5 μM (30%+/-3.8 of control cells) was prevented by the addition of 100 μM MVA (100%+/-2.3). 10 μM farnesol (F-OH)(85%+/-1.2) and 5 μM of all-trans geranylgeraniol (GG-OH)(precursors of prenylated proteins)(81%+/-1.1). but not by 2-cis GG-OH (precursor of …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:c_xDhezhKKUC,0,https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=277420,,,,,0,0,0

71943,Modification of proteins by prenyl groups,1995,Michael H Gelb,4,,,323-333,Elsevier,Both farnesyl (15-carbon) and geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) prenyl groups are covalently attached to cysteine residues of a subset of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Prenyl groups are derived from mevalonic acid. which is also the starting material for the biosynthesis of cholesterol. These posttranslational modifications occur at the C-terminus of the protein. and the modified-cysteine residue is often methylated on its α-carboxyl group. Many prenylated proteins such as ras. transducin. and heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in signal transduction across cell membranes. Prenyl groups most likely help to anchor proteins in membranes. but in many cases. protein-protein interactions are also required to support tight membrane binding. In the case of ras proteins. the farnesyl group is required for the functions of this protein that occur in the absence of membranes. This suggests that prenyl groups may act as molecular …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569258206800164,,,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/2914/1/E.%20Edward%20Bittar%20%282%29.pdf#page=338,0,0,0

Catalysis,1989,Wei Yuan and Karen Fearon and Michael H Gelb,106,"Cell Activation and Signal Initiation: Receptor and Phospholipase Control of Inositol Phosphate, PAF, and Eicosanoid Production: Proceedings of a UCLA Symposium Held in Keystone, Colorado, April 17-23, 1988",,351,AR Liss,A number of phospholipid analogues are described and evaluated as inhibitors of phospholipase A. from cobra venom. Tight-binding inhibitors were designed which structurally resemble the tetrahedral reaction intermediate that forms in the hydrolysis of phospholipid substrates. Phospholipid analogues containing a difluoro ketone replacement for the enzyme-susceptible ester were prepared. These compounds were tested in a well-defined mixed micelle assay system consisting of Triton X-100 and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine substrate. A variety of structure activity studies together with fluorine-NMR established that the hydrated form of the fluoro ketone is the actual inhibitor. Phosphonate-containing phospholipids were also prepared. One of the phosphonates was found to be an extremely potent inhibitor. with an ICS value of 5 uM. Again. extensive structure-activity data were obtained which are consistent with the importance of the tetrahedral phosphonate for tight binding inhibition. To probe the role of the calcium in the hydrolysis. a number of sulfursubstituted analogues were prepared. including thioamides and thiophosphonates. In the thiophosphonate series. both stereoisomers at the phosphorous atom were prepared and tested as inhibitors. A large stereoselectivity in the inhibition was observed. A large amount of evidence is presented to suggest that these compounds are functioning as true tight-binding inhibitors of phospholipase A. as opposed to other. less specific. modes of inhibition.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:a2necdfpwlEC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1583967052606112923&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

A covalent adduct is formed that deacylates slowly with a half-life of 23 h. X-ray diffraction analysis at 1.9-A resolution of the inactivator-enzyme complex shows that the y-oxygen of the active-site serine (serine-195) is covalently attached to C-1 of (Z)-2-benzylpentenedioic acid. the benzyl group of the inactivator is held in the hydrophobic specificity pocket of the enzyme. and the free carboxylate forms a salt bridge with the active-site histidine (histidine-57). The conformational changes that occur in the protein as a result of complexation are described. It is proposed that formation of the salt bridge prevents access of water and. therefore. hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme. have recently reported that serine proteases are inactivated by substituted 6-chloro-2-pyrones (Westkaemper & Abeles. 1983).

Newborn screening for Pompe disease is ongoing. and improved methods for distinguishing affected patients from those with pseudodeficiency. especially in the Asian population. would substantially reduce the number of patient referrals for clinical follow-up.METHODS: We measured the enzymatic activity of GAA in dried blood spots on newborn screening cards (DBS) using a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay. The assay displayed a relatively large analytical range compared to the fluorimetric assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-αglucoside. DBS from newborns confirmed to have infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD. n= 11) or late-onset Pompe (LOPD. n= 12) Pompe disease and those from patients bearing pseudodeficiency alleles with or without Pompe mutations. or Pompe disease carriers (n= 230) were studied.RESULTS: Using the MS/MS GAA assay in DBS. 96% of the pseudodeficiency newborns and all of the Pompe disease carriers were well separated from the IOPD and LOPD newborns. The fluorometric assay separated< 10% of the pseudodeficiencies from the IOPD/LOPD group.CONCLUSIONS: The relatively large analytical range MS/MS GAA assay but not the fluorimetric assay in DBS provides a robust approach to reduce the number of referrals and should dramatically facilitate newborn screening of Pompe disease.,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:NtGNdKbuCngC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7dd/7a2fd79ed72d68017c25e0d3b5854b5ccb0e.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d7dd/7a2fd79ed72d68017c25e0d3b5854b5ccb0e.pdf,0,0,0

Limitations of the enrichment procedure stem from the capture of hydrophobic residues by the gel bead as well as the nonspecific binding of carboxylate groups of Asp. Glu or peptide C termini by the metal ion. Several methods. including the esterification of carboxylate side chains (Figure 1) 1 have been developed to alleviate these limitations. most involve derivatization of sample components. an invasive process that requires large amounts of sample.The IMAC technique involves an agarose bead derivatized with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) or nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA). The tricarboxylate NTA is then loaded with a metal ion. typically Fe III. which chelates the negatively charged phosphate of a phosphorylated Ser. Thr or Tyr residue.

71975,Design and Synthesis of Specific Inhibitors for Cytosolic Phospholipase A2α and ζ,,Matthew Sonnett and Tim Janetos and Michael Gelb,,,,,,It is well known that mammals contain several types of phospholipase A2. The cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2s) are one type. and are composed of six enzymes: cPLA2α. cPLA2β. cPLA2γ. cPLA2δ. cPLA2ε. and cPLA2ζ. 1 There has been significant interest in the cPLA2α isoform because of the enzyme’s 10 fold preference for hydrolysis at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone in phospholipids. resulting in the liberation of arachadonic acid. 2 Arachadonic acid serves as a precursor for several highly regulated inflammatory mediators that play an important role in asthma. atherosclerosis. and arthritis. 3 To address these problems. inhibitors that target cPLA2α have been developed to serve as anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Wyeth pharmaceuticals has released a class of indole inhibitors that inhibit cPLA2α at< 10 nM IC50. 4 However. a recent study has shown that in cPLA2α-/-stimulated lung fibroblasts …,True,jgOlF7MAAAAJ:L_l9e5I586QC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12441492469869664699&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Mass spectrometry has proven to be an extremely powerful tool for characterizing the composition of purified complexes (2-4). However. because mass spectrometry is not a quantitative technique. the usefulness of the data is limited. For example. without quantitative measurements. it is difficult to detect dynamic changes in complex composition. and it can be difficult to distinguish bona fide complex components from nonspecifically co-purifying proteins. Here we describe a strategy for characterizing the composition of protein complexes and their dynamic changes in composition by combining affinity purification approaches with stable isotope tagging and mass spectrometry.

After digestion with Asp-N and/or trypsin. the reaction products were subjected to nano-LC-MALDI tandem MS (MS/MS). The new software tools for MS data analysis are designed to be used in an integrated workflow for crosslinking multiple proteins with isotopically labeled bis-NHS esters in buffer containing heavy and/or normal water. allowing the use of multiple proteases and common peptide modifications. The program iXLINK easily processes MS-MALDI data. extracting mass pairs for potentially crosslinker-modified peptide species. including peptide mass mapping to a peptide candidate database. Due to the diagnostic quadruplet mass pattern of peptides modified with hydrolyzed crosslinker (monolinks). when [18O] water was used during the crosslinking reaction. iXLINK easily manages to distinguish mass signals generated from monolinks and from crosslinked petides.

Arachidonic acid is part of a complex biochemical pathway. but essentially it is a major precursor to the inflammation response. There are many types of phospholipase A2. whose roles are understood to varying degrees. but of particular interest to this project is secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). types IIA. V. and X. We seek to develop an inhibitor of sPLA2 that has the properties of being selective (between the different types of enzyme). potent. and cellpermeable. If an inhibitor can be developed that meets these three criteria. we can use inhibition as a tool to elucidate the role that the different sPLA2 enzymes play in cells. which is not currently fully understood. There are a host of possible inhibitors that have received cursory attention from various sources.My research project is two-fold. The first part is involves the synthesis of a variety of inhibitors from smaller. commercially available chemicals. The second part of this research project involves using a special assay developed at the Gelb lab to determine the potency and selectivity of the inhibitors.

71991,Age-invariant face recognition,2010,Unsang Park and Yiying Tong and Anil K Jain,32,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,5,947-954,IEEE,One of the challenges in automatic face recognition is to achieve temporal invariance. In other words. the goal is to come up with a representation and matching scheme that is robust to changes due to facial aging. Facial aging is a complex process that affects both the 3D shape of the face and its texture (e.g.. wrinkles). These shape and texture changes degrade the performance of automatic face recognition systems. However. facial aging has not received substantial attention compared to other facial variations due to pose. lighting. and expression. We propose a 3D aging modeling technique and show how it can be used to compensate for the age variations to improve the face recognition performance.

It is effective against both drug-resistant and cerebral malaria-causing strains of Plasmodium falciparum. The relatively low yield (0.01±0.8%) of artemisinin in A. annua is a serious limitation to the commercialization of the drug. Therefore. the enhanced production of artemisinin either in cell/tissue culture or in the whole plant of A. annua is highly desirable. It can be achieved by a better understanding of the biochemical pathway leading to the synthesis of artemisinin and its regulation by both exogenous and endogenous factors. Furthermore. genetic engineering tools can be employed to overexpress gene (s) coding for enzyme (s) associated with the rate limiting step (s) of artemisinin biosynthesis or to inhibit the enzyme (s) of other pathway competing for its precursors.

Among the organic type. polymeric flocculants (synthetic as well as natural) are preferred because of their low dosage. easy handling. inertness to pH changes. production of large cohesive flocs and versatile tailorability. The concern for environmental and ecological issues warrants the use of the biodegradable flocculant in waste water and industrial effluent treatments. Natural polysaccharides such as starch. gums. glues. alginate. etc. function as bridging flocculants. This could be accounted for by the purification and chemical modification. It has been established that by grafting polyacrylamide branches on polysaccharides. the dangling grafted chains have easy approachability to the contaminants. Among the grafted guar gum. xanthan gum. carboxy methyl cellulose and starch. grafted starch flocculates better. Starch consists of amylose (a low molecular weight linear polymer) and amylopectin (a high molecular weight. branched polymer). The grafted amylopectin is found to be a suitable flocculant for various kinds of industrial effluents. Here we summarize the various investigations carried out using flocculants based on polysaccharides.FLOCCULATION is an essential phenomenon in domestic/industrial waste water treatment and mineral beneficiation1–3.

The test is based on immunological detection of small quantities of albumin in the urinary samples of diabetes patients. There are several limitations of the use of microalbuminuria as an index of renal function. It is therefore desirable to identify additional protein markers that would augment prediction of diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study is to identify urinary protein markers for specific and more accurate prediction of nephropathy in diabetes patients. DESIGN: 100 registered Type II diabetic patients were studied. Abundant proteins of microalbuminuria positive urinary samples of these patients were analyzed by proteomics approaches of 2-Dimentional Gel Electrophoresis (2DGE) and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 2-DGE analysis of the urine sample revealed four main proteins along with albumin in these samples. These were zinc alpha-2 glycoprotein. alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. alpha-1 microglobulin and IgG as identified by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Tune of Flight (MALDI-ToF) and by western blot. Twenty control samples and three cases with microalbuminuria negative to positive transition does suggest the early and co-appearance of the markers with albumin. We have also analyzed full length spectrum of these samples by MALDI-ToF. CONCLUSION: Our study shows the presence of additional proteins in urine samples of microalbuminuria positive diabetes patients. These proteins can be used as markers for specific and accurate clinical analysis of Diabetic nephropathy.

72034,Biosynthesis of archaeal membrane ether lipids,2014,Samta Jain and Antonella Caforio and Arnold JM Driessen,5,,,641,Frontiers,A vital function of the cell membrane in all living organism is to maintain the membrane permeability barrier and fluidity. The composition of the phospholipid bilayer is distinct in archaea when compared to bacteria and eukarya. In archaea. isoprenoid hydrocarbon side chains are linked via an ether bond to the sn-glycerol-1-phosphate backbone. In bacteria and eukarya on the other hand. fatty acid side chains are linked via an ester bond to the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate backbone. The polar head groups are globally shared in the three domains of life. The unique membrane lipids of archaea have been implicated not only in the survival and adaptation of the organisms to extreme environments but also to form the basis of the membrane composition of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). In nature. a diverse range of archaeal lipids is found. the most common are the diether (or archaeol) and the tetraether (or caldarchaeol) lipids that form a monolayer. Variations in chain length. cyclization and other modifications lead to diversification of these lipids. The biosynthesis of these lipids is not yet well understood however progress in the last decade has led to a comprehensive understanding of the biosynthesis of archaeol. This review describes the current knowledge of the biosynthetic pathway of archaeal ether lipids; insights on the stability and robustness of archaeal lipid membranes; and evolutionary aspects of the lipid divide and the last universal common ancestor LUCA.

This kind of dosing pattern may result in constantly changing. unpredictable plasma concentrations. Drugs can be delivered in a controlled pattern over a long period of time by the controlled or modified release drug delivery systems. They include dosage forms for oral and transdermal administration as well as injectable and implantable systems. For most of drugs. oral route remains as the most acceptable route of administration. Certain molecules may have low oral bioavailability because of solubility or permeability limitations. Development of an extended release dosage form also requires reasonable absorption throughout the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Among the available techniques to improve the bioavailability of these drugs fabrication of osmotic drug delivery system is the most appropriate one.

However. ultrasound does not allow good visualization of the pubic bones in relation to the pelvic outlet. and the pubic bones may interfere with needle placement in the anterior peripheral aspect of the prostate. Adequate irradiation of the entire periphery of the prostate is important to assure tumor control. since most tumors are multicentric and may involve the anterior aspect of the prostate.

Talc‐based composites of PLA/PCL blends were prepared by melt blending. SEM analysis demonstrates that PLA appears as discrete domain phase. while PCL acts as a bulk phase in the blend. Talc addition decreases PLA domain sizes and voids in the matrix. This results in significant improvement of oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of composite by 33 and 25%. respectively. at 3 wt.‐% talc loading.

To evaluate the effects of bisphosphonate treatment in a controlled study. the oim/oim mouse model of OI was studied. Nursing infant mouse pups (∼ 2 wk old) with moderate to severe OI (oim/oim mouse) and age-and background-matched control mice (+/+) were treated either with the third-generation bisphosphonate alendronate (ALN). or with saline. Fracture risk. bone quality. and growth were evaluated over a 12-wk treatment period.

72062,Genetic reserves,1975,SK Jain,,Crop genetic resources for today and tomorrow,,379-396,Cambridge University Press,The importance of wild relatives of many domesticated species as a germplasm resource is generally recognized; yet. as noted by Frankel (1970a; 1974). relatively little attention has been paid to the social and biological issues involved in their conservation in situ. ie the establish-ment of genetic reserves. In contrast to gene banks comprising seed collections or tissue cultures. genetic wildlife conservation must recog-nize the long-term needs–the need for continued evolution within natural environments. and the need for the preservation of wild biota as potentially useful resources for the future. Continued evolution in environments now changing at an accelerated rate (review by Detwyler. 1971. among others) will require genetic variation for adaptive changes (Frankel. 1970b). and certain basic ecological conditions for continued reproduction and persistence. Most nature conservation programs are aimed at the level of ecosystems. or multispecies communities; and they may give particular emphasis to some of the many threatened or near-extinct species which are recognized (eg IUCN Red Data Book). Genetic conservation goes further in recognizing the need for a wide genetic base. and should. therefore. be seriously considered as a part of. as well as in parallel with. nature conservation. Basic issues of survival (ie avoidance of extinction). adaptive evolution. maintenance of variation in populations. the long-term stability of population numbers and of species abundance within communities. are all central problems in modern population biology and relevant to nature conservation.

In this paper one such model is considered where inelastic deformations are accounted for via conservation laws for elastic strain with relaxation source terms. Plastic deformations are governed by the relaxation time of tangential stresses. Compared with alternative Eulerian conservative models. the governing system consists of fewer equations overall.

We studied apoptotic changes and their correlation with expression of selected cytochrome P450s (CYPs) in PC12 cells exposed to MCP. A significant induction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels were observed in cells exposed to MCP. Following the exposure of PC12 cells to MCP (10−5 M). the levels of protein and mRNA expressions of caspase-3/9. Bax. Bcl2. P53. P21. GSTP1-1 were significantly upregulated. whereas the levels of Bclw. Mcl1 were downregulated. A significant induction in the expression of CYP1A1/1A2. 2B1/2B2. 2E1 was also observed in PC12 cells exposed to MCP (10−5 M). whereas induction of CYPs was insignificant in cells exposed to 10−6 M concentration of MCP. We believe that this is the first report showing altered expressions of selected CYPs in MCP-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. These apoptotic changes were mitochondria mediated and regulated by caspase cascade. Our data confirm the involvement of specific CYPs in MCP-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and also identifies possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of organophosphate pesticide-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,67,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017757,2512732911090112674,/scholar?cites=2512732911090112674,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017757,0,0,0

Ltd.,A mathematical model of anaerobic digestion has been developed which considers the process as occurring through hydrolysis followed by a sequence of steps which have been considered together as a pseudo‐first order process. The Michaelis‐Menten equation has been modified to incorporate variable enzyme concentration. An immobilized reactor has been designed. fabricated and operated on cowdung feed to obtain data for estimating the model parameters by non‐linear regression.

Northern blot analysis shows that mouse ferritin H and L mRNAs each contain approximately 1.1 kilobases. The levels of both mRNAs increase after addition of dimethyl sulfoxide in a biphasic manner. After a sharp rise in the first 6 h. the levels decline and then rise again over the next 90 h. These increases in mRNA levels reflect increased transcription of both mRNAs. Analysis of ferritin subunit synthesis surprisingly showed no corresponding increase in the rate of protein synthesis. suggesting that the additional mRNA was not in functional polysomes. These studies also indicated a novel processing of mouse ferritin H subunits. H subunits appear to be synthesized as a precursor of approximately 22.500. This form is not present in mature shells.

72103,Silymarin-a review on the pharmacodynamics and bioavailability enhancement approaches,2010,A Ghosh and T Ghosh and S Jain,2,Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology,10,348-355,,Silymarin. a flavonolignan from ‘milk thistle’(Silybum marianum) plant is used from ancient times as a hepatoprotective drug. Along with hepatoprotective action other actions includes antioxidant. anti-lipid peroxidative. antifibrotic. anti-inflammatory. immunomodulatory and liver regenerating. Silymarin has clinical applications in alcoholic liver diseases. liver cirrhosis. Amanita mushroom poisoning. viral hepatitis. toxic and drug induced liver diseases. Psoriasis. and in Neuroprotective and neurotropic activity. Though silymarin does not have antiviral properties against hepatitis virus. it promotes protein synthesis. helps in regenerating liver tissue. controls inflammation. enhances glucoronidation and protects against glutathione depletion. The flavonoid silymarin and one of its structural components. silibinin. are substances with documented hepatoprotective properties. They are proved to be a useful for hepatoprotection in hepatobiliary diseases and in hepatotoxicity due to drugs. The non traditional use of silymarin may make a breakthrough as a new approach to protect other organs in addition to liver. But the main drawback of silymarin is its poor solubility therefore different approaches are been taken to enhance the solubility in turn the bioavailability of the drug. In this review we discuss about its Chemistry. Pharmacodynamics. safety. therapeutic efficacy and Bioavailability enhancement approaches used so far. As it is having a good safety profile. better patient tolerability and an effective drug at an affordable price. in near future new derivatives or new combinations of this drug may prove to be useful.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC,58,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amitava_Ghosh5/publication/47619037_Silymarin-_A_review_on_the_Pharmacodynamics_and_Bioavailability_Enhancement_Approaches/links/547ff8f80cf250f1edbfaa09/Silymarin-A-review-on-the-Pharmacodynamics-and-Bioavailability-Enhancement-Approaches.pdf,3479775773135087356,/scholar?cites=3479775773135087356,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amitava_Ghosh5/publication/47619037_Silymarin-_A_review_on_the_Pharmacodynamics_and_Bioavailability_Enhancement_Approaches/links/547ff8f80cf250f1edbfaa09/Silymarin-A-review-on-the-Pharmacodynamics-and-Bioavailability-Enhancement-Approaches.pdf,0,0,0
72104,A low leakage and SNM free SRAM cell design in deep sub micron CMOS technology,2006,Sanjeev K Jain and Pankaj Agarwal,,,,4 pp.,IEEE,As the IC process technology scales. the oxide thickness and operating voltage continues to decrease. The gate oxide thickness in recent and future IC process technology has approached the limit when direct tunneling causes gate leakage in both on state and off state of MOSFET transistor operation modes. Also. lower operating voltage will lower the stability of SRAM cell resulting in lower value of static noise margin. In this paper. a novel read '0' static noise margin (SNM) free eight transistors (8T) SRAM cell is proposed that reduces gate leakage power in the zero state. taking into consideration the fact that in ordinary program most of the bits stored in caches are zeros for both the data and instruction streams. Compared to conventional six transistors (6T) SRAM cell. new 8TSRAM cell reduces total leakage by 50.2% in the zero state at low temperature. where gate leakage is dominant.

This situation may arise in polymer technology involving the stretching of plastics sheets. The resulting system of non-linear ordinary coupled differential equations has been solved by the finite element method. using the variational Ritz model. Numerical results obtained for velocity. microrotation and temperature distributions are shown graphically. It was found that an increase in the micropolar parameter leads to a faster rate of cooling of the sheet. Also the velocity increases with an increase in micropolar effects.

India is experiencing one of the highest motorization growth rates in the world. This paper examines the influence of population growth. increase in urbanizations and economic development on rapid growth of motor vehicles in India by using secondary data which are correlated by line graph method. Economic development is the major factor affecting the growth rate of motor vehicles. Motor vehicle growths have been largely concentrated in major cities which deteriorate the environmental condition of Urban India.

72128,Cytogenetics of rye (Secale spp.),2013,Sudhanshu Kumar Jain,,,,,Springer,Rye first appeared rather late in the history of human civilization. The oldest archaeological records of rye date from the Hallstatt period in Silesia. Thuringia and Westfalia and from the Lacene period. After the pioneering work of N. 1. V AVILOV on the origin of cultivated plants three broad classes came in recognition: wild. weedy and cultivated rye. As a crop. rye is most winterhardy of all cereals so that in Northern Europe its cultivation reaches beyond the Arctic circle in Finland. While Soviet Russia contributes most to the total world production. in Finland. Poland. Germany. Sweden. Netherlands and Belgium also its rank is high among grain crops. It is striking to note that for the past many years. research on practical agronomical and breeding problems has been quite active in these countries and current ly attempts to improve rye are being made on modern lines. Some of the main problems in this field concern with the development of hybrid varieties. improvement of autotetraploid fertility. use of best pollina tion procedures to obtain highly self-fertile lines and the transfer of rye characters to wheat as such or in the form of amphiploid Triticales. In Russia. however. the Michurinist agrobiologists are primarily engaged in the study of interspecific conversions. branched ear types and nutritional methods of improving varieties. and perhaps this is one reason of only little having been known about rye genetics.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:nPT8s1NX_-sC,49,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=E3zsCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:LT4uui8CTqQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=yfw_xOWkAi&sig=-hzOqM1GCvNRk3kmUgjMTKFFUBs,11839402874413923885,/scholar?cites=11839402874413923885,,,0,0,0

The simple looking method of accepting money deposits from savers and then lending the same money to borrowers. banking activity encourages the flow of money to productive use and investments. This in turn allows the economy to grow. In the absence of banking business. savings would sit idle in our homes. the entrepreneurs would not be in a position to raise the money. ordinary people dreaming for a new car or house would not be able to purchase cars or houses. The government of India started the cooperative movement of India in 1904. Then the government therefore decided to develop the cooperatives as the institutional agency to tackle the problem of usury and rural indebtedness. which has become a curse for population. In such a situation cooperative banks operate as a balancing centre. At present there are several cooperative banks which are performing multipurpose functions of financial. administrative. supervisory and development in nature of expansion and development of cooperative credit system. In brief. the cooperative banks have to act as a friend. philosopher and guide to entire cooperative structure. The study is based on some successful co-op banks in Delhi (India). The study of the bank‟ s performance along with the lending practices provided to the customers is herewith undertaken. The customer has taken more than one type of loan from the banks.

72139,Topics in plant population biology,2016,Otto Thomas Solbrig,,,,,Macmillan International Higher Education,POPULATION BIOLOGY is concerned with the documentation and explanation of changes in gene frequency. number of individuals. and phenotypic characteristics of members of populations over time. Population biology includes aspects of population genetics. demography. population ecology. plant physiology. and adaptive morphology; it is primarily a synthetic discipline. The two main objectives of population biology are: to under-stand in precise detail how natural selection operates (this involves not only determining that heritable changes take place but establish-ing precisely when and where in the life cycle these changes occur) and to understand rigorously the mechanisms of adaptation. It is not sufficient. therefore. to establish a correlation between the presence of a given phenotypic characteristic and a set of environmental factors. but it is necessary to provide the causal factors. Consequently. the population biologist tries to establish the patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation in time and space. hoping to understand how these patterns arise by the action of natural selection and in exactly what ways they are adaptive. in order to develop predictive models and theories.Biological phenomena are. however. so complex. so multidi-mensional. that they cannot be understood by the patient accumulation of data. no matter how accurately and carefully gathered.

72140,An experimental and numerical investigation of mechanical properties of glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites,2013,Satnam Singh and Pardeep Kumar and SK Jain,4,Advanced Materials Letters,7,567-572,,Composites are one of the most advanced and adaptable engineering materials. The strength of any composite depends upon volume/weight fraction of reinforcement. L/D ratio of fibers. orientation angles and other factors. The present work focuses on determination of mechanical properties of pure epoxy and random oriented glass fiber (mat) reinforced epoxy at 10% and 20% weight fractions of glass fibers. The test specimens were prepared and tested according to ASTM standards. The experimental results revealed that with increase in weight fraction of reinforcement. the tensile strength and flexural strength increased by 14.5% and 123.65% for 20% glass reinforced composites over pure epoxy. The numerical results obtained were in good agreement to the experimental results. However increased reinforcement increases the brittleness of material which may results in low impact strength. This study further can be used to optimize the weight fraction of glass fibers. to achieve a combination of strength without compromising the impact strength of composites.

Multipulse NMR techniques such as. distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer and 2-dimensional heteronuclear correlation have been applied for the unambiguous assignment of the 2.0−3.5 ppm region due to α-substituents on the aromatic ring in the 1H NMR spectra. The estimation of polynuclear aromatics is based on the estimation of bridgehead aromatic (Arb) and substituted aromatic (Arq) carbons using equations developed. The proposed 1H NMR-based method correlates very well with the standard IP-391/90- and mass-spectrometric-based method (R2 = 0.99). ,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:53uzXsUip0wC,46,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef980052y,805888944040610248,/scholar?cites=805888944040610248,,,0,0,0

METHODS: A prospective study comprising of 22 patients of CRF who have to receive their first haemodialysis. All patients were subjected to standard four hours haemodialysis. The parameters of oxidative stress ie erythrocyte malonaldehyde (MDA). reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured before and after haemodialysis. RESULTS: The value of mean erythrocyte MDA (9.40+/-3.36 mumol/L) and SOD (617+/-64.33 units/ml) were significantly higher in patients of CRF before haemodialysis than in controls (p< 0.001). The mean GSH levels were significantly lower (451+/-63.91 micrograms/ml) in patients than in controls before haemodialysis (p< 0.001). After haemodialysis MDA levels further increased (12.27+/-4.38 mumol/L). SOD levels decreased (458+/-69.58 EU/ml) and GSH levels further decreased (396+/-41.41 micrograms/ml)(p< 0.001).

The most meaningful reading is obtained at 10 centimeters below knee anteriorly. The critical value is approximately 35 millimeters of mercury. since the pO2 value for below-knee amputations performed upon most patients with a 10 centimeter below knee amputation was less than this. further surgical treatment was required. while all patients with values above this underwent successful amputation. Determination of the 10 centimeter below knee-control site ratio does not appear to provide any further advantage over the absolute 10 centimeter below knee site value. However. the control site measurement should be taken to eliminate central circulatory failure. The technique can be easily undertaken by hospital technicians or regular nursing or junior medical staff. A site reading requires an average of 35 minutes.

It is endemic to >100 tropical and sub-tropical countries around the world placing an estimated 3.6 billion people at risk. It is caused by four genetically similar but antigenically distinct. serotypes of dengue viruses. There is neither a vaccine to prevent nor a drug to treat dengue infections. at the present time. The major objective of this work was to explore the possibility of identifying a small molecule inhibitor of the dengue virus protease and assessing its ability to suppress viral replication in cultured cells. We cloned. expressed and purified recombinant dengue virus type 2 protease. Using an optimized and validated fluorogenic peptide substrate cleavage assay to monitor the activity of this cloned dengue protease we randomly screened ~1000 small molecules from an ‘in-house’ library to identify potential dengue protease inhibitors. A benzimidazole derivative. named MB21. was found to be the most potent in inhibiting the cloned protease (IC50 = 5.95 μM). In silico docking analysis indicated that MB21 binds to the protease in the vicinity of the active site. Analysis of kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction suggested that MB21 presumably functions as a mixed type inhibitor. Significantly. this molecule identified as an inhibitor of dengue type 2 protease was also effective in inhibiting each one of the four serotypes of dengue viruses in infected cells in culture. based on analysis of viral antigen synthesis and infectious virus production. Interestingly. MB21 did not manifest any discernible cytotoxicity.

72182,An analytical study on social responsibility performance evaluation as an accounting measure of management efficiency,2007,Sugan C Jain and Dilip Kumar Sen and Muinuddin Khan and Swapan Kumar Bala,21,Ai & Society,3,251-266,Springer-Verlag,This paper is a portrayal of how social responsibility performance evaluation can act as an accounting measure of management efficiency. In fact. it has given much importance to socio-economic and socio-human obligations to others. The paper attempts to show that these days there is a great need to emphasise more clearly social responsibility. which the corporate sector can and should undertake. The theme of the paper is that the scope of corporate social responsibility encompasses not only economic well-being but also the human aspects of life. In addition. if management of a corporation performs its social responsibility well. one may say that management has done its job efficiently. This study is based on mainly literature review. Analytical thinking is also another building block of this paper. However. the limitation of this study is that no data of the existing situation of Bangladesh or India pertaining to …,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:SWgZeABleR0C,39,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-006-0057-2,4060138909017471909,/scholar?cites=4060138909017471909,,,0,0,0

72214,Efficient nash equilibrium resource allocation based on game theory mechanism in cloud computing by using auction,2015,Amin Nezarat and GH Dastghaibifard,10,PloS one,10,e0138424,Public Library of Science,One of the most complex issues in the cloud computing environment is the problem of resource allocation so that. on one hand. the cloud provider expects the most profitability and. on the other hand. users also expect to have the best resources at their disposal considering the budget constraints and time. In most previous work conducted. heuristic and evolutionary approaches have been used to solve this problem. Nevertheless. since the nature of this environment is based on economic methods. using such methods can decrease response time and reducing the complexity of the problem. In this paper. an auction-based method is proposed which determines the auction winner by applying game theory mechanism and holding a repetitive game with incomplete information in a non-cooperative environment. In this method. users calculate suitable price bid with their objective function during several round and repetitions and send it to the auctioneer; and the auctioneer chooses the winning player based the suggested utility function. In the proposed method. the end point of the game is the Nash equilibrium point where players are no longer inclined to alter their bid for that resource and the final bid also satisfies the auctioneer’s utility function. To prove the response space convexity. the Lagrange method is used and the proposed model is simulated in the cloudsim and the results are compared with previous work. At the end. it is concluded that this method converges to a response in a shorter time. provides the lowest service level agreement violations and the most utility to the provider.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:8U9l5EwV_MEC,34,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138424,15910742121435530547,/scholar?cites=15910742121435530547,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138424,0,0,0

Interaction with specific receptor(s) at the cell surface is one of the first events in the pathogenesis of Dengue virus. However. relatively little is known about these receptors. Cellular receptors in human monocytes and mouse neural cells are main target for the viral infection. The envelope protein of the virus (E-protein) plays important role in attachment of virus to target cells and their interaction with cellular receptors. The modulation of receptor gene(s) and/or protein(s) can be used as a method for interfering with virus entry and can thus become a new method for disease prevention. The receptors can be purified by affinity chromatography using E-protein as ligand.

The density functional theory (DFT) based ab initio approach has been used to calculate the electronic and transport properties of BN sheet in presence of ammonia gas. Analysis confirms that the band gap of the sheet increases due to presence of ammonia. Out of different positions. the bridge site is the most favorable position for adsorption of ammonia and the mechanism of interaction falls between weak electrostatic interaction and chemisorption. On relaxation. change in the bond angles of the ammonia molecule in various configurations has been reported with the distance between NH3 and the sheet. An increase in the transmission of electrons has been observed on increasing the bias voltage and I-V relationship.

NAPs participate in the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes thus contributing to chromatin structure organization. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains two nucleosome assembly proteins termed PfNapL and PfNapS. Three-dimensional crystal structure of PfNapS has been determined and analysed. Gene knockout and localization studies were also performed on PfNapS using transfection studies. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to identify histone-binding sites on PfNapS. Extensive sequence and structural comparisons were done with the crystal structures available for NAP/SET family of proteins. Crystal structure of PfNapS shares structural similarity with previous structures from NAP/SET family. Failed attempts to knock-out the gene for PfNapS from malaria parasite suggest essentiality in the parasite. GFP-fused PfNapS fusion protein targeting indicates cellular localization of PfNapS in the parasite nucleus. Fluorescence spectroscopy data suggest that PfNapS interacts with core histones (tetramer. octamer. H3. H4. H2A and H2B) at a different site from its interaction with linker histone H1. This analysis illustrates two regions on the PfNapS dimer as the possible sites for histone recognition.

Biosynthesis of these lipids is poorly understood. Here we identify and characterize the archaeal membrane protein CDP-archaeol synthase (CarS) that catalyzes the transfer of the nucleotide to its specific archaeal lipid substrate. leading to the formation of a CDP-activated precursor (CDP-archaeol) to which polar head groups are attached. The discovery of CarS enabled reconstitution of the entire archaeal lipid biosynthesis pathway in vitro. starting from simple isoprenoid building blocks and using a set of five purified enzymes.

72273,Changing antimicrobial resistance pattern of isolates from an ICU over a 2 year period.,2012,Sachin Jain and Zarine Khety,60,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,,"27-8, 33",,OBJECTIVE: To study the changing patterns of antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacilli esp. E. coli. Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a 37 bedded ICU of a private hospital. METHODS: All isolates obtained from a wide range of clinical samples (eg: urine. pus. blood. sputum. BAL. tracheal secretions) from ICU patients were evaluated for sensitivity patterns by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: In the 2 year study period the rise in the number of gram negative isolates was proportionally high along with increase in their resistance pattern. Dramatic rise in ESBL's has led to multidrug resistant E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Also organisms like Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are multiresistant making optimal therapy selection difficult. The incidence of ESBL's has increased from 30-75% of the total isolates. The sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Meropenem has decreased from 90% to 60%. The antibiotic that remained most active against all gram negative organisms for 2 years was Imepenem. Piperacillin-Tazobactum and Amikacin. The positive result from this study was decrease in the number of S. aureus isolates from 25% in 2008 to 12% in 2009. The reason for this achievement was implementation of good and strict infection control practices. CONCLUSION: 1) Antibiotic resistance continues to rise among hospital acquired gram negative pathogens and complicates empirical selection of antibiotics in the ICU. 2) Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas are still the dominant organisms in the ICU. 3) Imepenem.

72282,Factors influencing peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in normal subjects-II,1983,SK Jain and Rajendra Kumar and DA Sharma,1,Lung India,3,92,Medknow Publications,A sample of 456 males and 424 females was selected randomly from among healthy northern Indian subjects and their peak expiratory flow rate was determined by the Wright's peak flow meter to evaluate the effect of various factors influencing it. There was a significant difference of PEFR in both the sexes. The correlation of PEFR with the age was negative in both the sexes. and with anthropometric measurements (height. weight and body surface area) it was positive. Low socio-economic status and moderately or over-crowded area of residence were found to decrease PEFR. Smokers were found to have significantly lower value of PEFR in comparison to nonsmokers. The duration of smoking was found to be a more important factor than the amount of tobacco smoked per day in impairing PEFR. It was also noted that PEFR tended to decline more rapidly among the smokers than the nonsmokers after the age of …,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:4pF9x-cDGsoC,28,https://www.lungindia.com/article.asp?issn=0970-2113;year=1983;volume=1;issue=3;spage=92;epage=97;aulast=Jain;type=0,2092545562247820823,/scholar?cites=2092545562247820823,,,0,0,0

The expression of this protein was low when cloned under the T7 promoter without any fusion tags. High yield of GMCSF was achieved (~ 88 mg/L of fermentation broth) in the shake flask when the gene was fused to the E. coli TRX gene. The protein was purified using a single step Ni 2+-NTA affinity chromatography and the column bound fusion tag was removed by on-column cleavage with enterokinase. The recombinant hGMCSF was expressed as a soluble and biologically active protein in E. coli. and upon purification. the final yield was~ 44 mg/L in shake flask with a specific activity of 2.3× 10 8 U/mg. The results of Western blot and RP-HPLC analyses. along with biological activity using the TF-1 cell line. established the identity of the purified hGMCSF.

Termites are also amongst the most difficult insects to study because of their cryptic behaviour and natural nesting habitat. There are around 2600 species of termites in 280 genera which have been described worldwide and about 39% of the total termite species are found in Africa. Termite identification is crucial to understanding termite distribution and their relationship to climate change. Some termite species are well known pests of agricultural crops. forest trees. wood products and timber-in-service causing considerable damage in Africa.This review paper attempts to collate information on African termite distribution and climate change and highlights some knowledge gaps.

It is (1) remarked that “next to the pelvis. the skull is the most easily sexed portion of the skeleton”. It has been suggested (2-5) that the measurements of the foramen magnum are useful for determining the sex. There are two osteological techniques used to determine the sex of an individual; the first is visual assessment to evaluate the morphological sex traits and second is the metrical. in which the skeletal assessment relies on methods based on measurements. The metric approach is more objective and less dependent on observer experience. AIM & OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is morphometric evaluation of foramen magnum dimensions in north Indian population and to use these dimensions for sex estimation. MATERIAL & METHOD: This study is conducted on 68 human adult skulls of known sex collected from museum of anatomy department of TMMC & RC Moradabad and also from nearby medical colleges of same geographical. cultural and climatic conditions. Well preserved cranial bases were used for this study. Digital stainless steel caliper. osteometric board and blunt craniophore were the instruments used in this study. ANALYTICAL TEST:“t” test. RESULTS: The dimensions of the foramen magnum were significantly higher in men’s skulls.

Moench) crop is genetically suited to hot and dry agro-ecologies with frequent drought. where it is difficult to grow other crops. In north Gujarat areas sorghum is mainly grown for dual and forage purposes. Therefore. it can play a vital role for the uplift of socio-economic status of the farmers of north Gujarat areas through development of high yielding varieties along with reasonable amount of green and dry fodder for the livestock.The study of relationships among quantitative traits is important for assessing the feasibility of joint selection of two or more traits and hence for evaluating the effect of selection for secondary traits on genetic gain for the primary trait under consideration. A positive genetic correlation between two desirable traits makes the job of the plant breeder easy for improving both traits simultaneously. The path coefficient analysis allows partitioning of correlation coefficient into direct and indirect contributions (effects) of various traits towards dependent variable and thus helps in assessing the cause-effect relationship as well as effective selection. Hence. this study is aimed to analyze and determine the traits having greater interrelationship with yield utilizing the correlation and path analysis for different traits in forage sorghum.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:OtrppQHxQ5wC,25,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elangovan_M/publication/252383856_Correlation_and_path_coefficient_analysis_for_agronomical_traits_in_forage_sorghum_Sorghum_bicolor_L_Moench/links/00b4952086fafb5b67000000/Correlation-and-path-coefficient-analysis-for-agronomical-traits-in-forage-sorghum-Sorghum-bicolor-L-Moench.pdf,16630268413915324988,/scholar?cites=16630268413915324988,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elangovan_M/publication/252383856_Correlation_and_path_coefficient_analysis_for_agronomical_traits_in_forage_sorghum_Sorghum_bicolor_L_Moench/links/00b4952086fafb5b67000000/Correlation-and-path-coefficient-analysis-for-agronomical-traits-in-forage-sorghum-Sorghum-bicolor-L-Moench.pdf,0,0,0

The presence of a parallel electric field introduces a change in the zero‐order distribution function through the modification of electron thermal velocity in that direction. As a result of this asymmetric energy transfer. the distribution function becomes temperature dependent and complex. By using this feature. expressions for the growth rate of instability have been derived. These results have been used to study the growth rate of whistler mode waves propagating in the magnetosphere.

Stability indicating HPLC methods are used to separate various drug related impurities that are formed during the synthesis or manufacture of drug product. This article discusses the strategies and issues regarding the development of stability indicating HPLC system for drug substance. A number of key chromatographic factors were evaluated in order to optimize the detection of all potentially relevant degradants. The method should be carefully examined for its ability to distinguish the primary drug components from the impurities. New chemical entities and drug products must undergo forced degradation studies which would be helpful in developing and demonstrating the specificity of such stability indicating methods. At every stage of drug development practical recommendations are provided which will help to avoid failures.INTRODUCTION: Most of the optimization of HPLC method development have been focused on the optimization of HPLC conditions. This article will look at this topic from other perspectives. Forced degradation or stress testing is undertaken to demonstrate specificity when developing stability-indicating methods. particularly when little information is available about potential degradation products.

Our proposed novel approach can detect and combat bots. adopting a two-pronged strategy. using a stand-alone and a network algorithm. The stand-alone algorithm. which runs independently on each node of the network. monitors active processes on the node and triggers the network algorithm when a suspicious process is identified. The network algorithm will then analyse conversations to and from the hosts to deduce the bot pattern and bot signatures which can subsequently be used by the stand-alone algorithm to thwart bot processes at their very onset.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:rMiSbtrAJs8C,24,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJWMC.2012.046776,12703485857752122633,/scholar?cites=12703485857752122633,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.1629,0,0,0

Current research is now directed towards finding naturally occurring antioxidant of plant origin. In Indian system of medicine Commiphora mukul is an important medicinal plant its resinous part has been used in various ailments and as health tonic. To understand the mechanisms of pharmacological actions. the in vitro antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate extract of Commiphora mukul was investigated for reducing power activity and total antioxidant activity. The ethyl acetate extract C. mukul exhibited good reducing power activity at higher concentration. which was measured at 700 nm. Gallic acid was used as standard antioxidant. Total antioxidant activity was determined by thiocyanate method. which was measured at 500 nm. α-tocopherol was used as standard. the standard. showed 76.38% inhibition at 500 μg/ml concentration while C. mukul extract showed 51.16% inhibition at the same concentration. In these testing. a significant correlation existed between concentrations of the extract and percentage inhibition of free radicals and reducing power. The antioxidant property may be related to the antioxidant vitamins. phenolic acids and micronutrients present in the extract.

These young girls face considerable health risks due to higher maternal and perinatal mortality. Early child bearing is not only a health problem for mother and child but is also associated with serious socio-economic and demographic implications as well. In developing countries 20% to 60% of young women's pregnancies and births are unintended. most coming sooner than planned. In India some demographers have estimated that if marriages were postponed from the age of 16 to 20 years. the number of births would decrease by 20 to 30 per-cent. That is the reason one of the socio-demographic goals set by national population policy. 2000 is to promote delayed marriages for girls. not earlier than age of 18 years and preferably after 20 years of age. It is important to maximise utilisation of prenatal. intranatal and postnatal care services among adolescent mothers. Lastly. it is important to improve the heamoglobin status and nutrition and empower our girls by educating them and making them aware of disadvantages of anaemia. early marriage and also of legal laws against teenage marriages.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:ShjGdcaqzI0C,24,https://europepmc.org/article/med/18975511,6019056436957159355,/scholar?cites=6019056436957159355,,,0,0,0
72326,Scan tests tolerant to indeterminate states when employing signature analysis to analyze test outputs,2008,,,,,,,Scan tests tolerant to indeterminate states generated in an integrated circuit (IC) when employing signature analysis to analyze test outputs. Bits with indeterminate-state are masked when scanning out the bits from the scan chains to force such indeterminate bits to a known logic level. This prevents a signature generator receiving the outputs of a scan test from generating an invalid signature. In an embodiment. masking information is stored in encoded form in a memory. A decoding circuit decodes the masking information and provides mask data under control from a mask controller. Mask data is sent to a masking circuit which also receives corresponding bits from scan-out vectors. with each scan-out vector being generated by a corresponding one of multiple scan chains.

Various metallic and non-metallic objects are placed over the penis to increase sexual performance or because of autoerotic intentions. We describe a case who had put a hard plastic bottle over his penis which resulted in strangulation of the penis. To remove it was a challenge as the chances of injury to the surgeon and the patient were high. Patient was successfully managed and had an uneventful recovery. There was no erectile dysfunction and uroflow was normal. The patient was lost in the follow up. so long term outcome could not be studied.

If reliability is to be enhanced by adding a link across one of the pairs of its nodes. one needs to select the appropriate pair to achieve maximum gain in reliability. The obvious choice is the source-. terminal-node pair. But such an installation may not be possible due to terrain conditions or large distance between source-. terminal-node which makes installing such a link very expensive and time consuming. A heuristic method is proposed to compare the reliability gains for other different pairs of nodes and hence to select the best pair out of given pairs.

Antibodies to any one DENV serotype have the potential to predispose an individual to more severe disease upon infection with a different DENV serotype. A dengue vaccine must elicit homotypic neutralizing antibodies to all four DENV serotypes to avoid the risk of such antibody-dependent enhancement in the vaccine recipient. This is a formidable challenge as evident from the lack of protective efficacy against DENV-2 by a tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine that has completed phase III trials recently. These trial data underscore the need to explore non-replicating subunit vaccine alternatives. Recently. using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. we showed that DENV-2 and DENV-3 envelope (E) glycoproteins. expressed in absence of prM. implicated in causing severe dengue disease. self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). which elicit predominantly virus-neutralizing antibodies and confer significant protection against lethal DENV challenge in an animal model. The current study extends this work to a third DENV serotype. We cloned and expressed DENV-1 E antigen in P. pastoris. and purified it to near homogeneity. Recombinant DENV-1 E underwent post-translational processing. namely. signal peptide cleavage and glycosylation. Purified DENV-1 E self-assembled into stable VLPs. based on electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis.

Biochar was capable to neutralize all the acid produced. As a neutralizing agent. Mg2+ dominated over Ca2+.

Scatter plots of time-averaged line depth. line width. and Doppler shifts. as well as the root mean square temporal fluctuation of these quantities against the time-averaged equivalent width at a few hundred spatial locations were obtained. The statistical behaviour of these line parameters and their fluctuations was used to infer plausible reasons for the fluctuations. Examination of these results showed that the line parameter fluctuations could be caused by fluctuations in the coronal UV radiation (which could drive the spicules) or by the appearance of density inhomogeneities such as spicules within the line forming domain. In either case. the data can be interpreted as representing the initial phases of spicules.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:eO3_k5sD8BwC,22,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00146199,11744602845216338585,/scholar?cites=11744602845216338585,,http://prints.iiap.res.in/bitstream/handle/2248/2561/Singh.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

These structures are self assembled by non covalent and ionic bonds. The solid core provides the structural stability. while the carbohydrate coating protects against dehydration and stabilizes the biochemically active molecules.

Wide spread use of herbs throughout the globe has raised serious concerns over its quality. safety. and efficacy. Our investigation showed that these investigated medicinal plants could prevent ulcer in a dose-dependent manner. Histological studies revealed that these medicinal plants did not show any acute toxicity. Preliminary photochemical screening of this medicinal plant identified the presence of important secondary metabolites like flavonoids and tannins. A peptic ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer. One that is in the duodenum is called a duodenal ulcer. Peptic ulcers happen when the acids that help you digest food damage the walls of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause is infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Another cause is the long-term use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Stress and spicy foods do not cause ulcers. but can make them worse. As many as 70-90% of ulcers are associated with Helicobacter pylori. a spiral-shaped bacterium that lives in the acidic environment of the stomach.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In the present study. we demonstrate the biological activity of esterified caffeic acid with methyl vanillate also termed as caffeic acid methyl vanillate ester (CAMVE). CAMVE potentiates TNF‐induced cell death as analyzed by cell viability assay and blocks inflammatory stimuli‐induced nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF‐κB) activation and NF‐κB‐dependent genes expression. CAMVE‐mediated inhibition of NF‐κB or induction of cell death is not cell type specific. CAMVE inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting G1 to S phase progression. It suppresses TNF‐induced Bcl‐2 expression and potentiates chemotherapeutic agents‐mediated cell death. CAMVE enhances intracellular free Ca2+ and thereby activates calcineurin. Calcineurin. in turns. activates nuclear transcription factor NF‐AT and its dependent genes such as FasL. which induces cell death.

Immediately upstream of the initiating AUG in the ferritin mRNA is a stretch of 67 nucleotides which contains sequences complementary to several regions in 28 S RNA. One such region can form 55 base pairings with the 5′ noncoding region of the ferritin H mRNA. Most of the complementarity is due to repeats of CCG in the ferritin mRNA and GGC in the ribosomal RNA.

The intrinsic association constants and the number of binding sites have been calculated from Scatchard plots. The effect of temperature on these constants was studied at pH 5.57 by polarographic technique and it was found that these values were decreased with increasing temperature. The effect of pH was found to be similar by equilibrium dialysis technique. The number of sites available for binding with the molybdate ions is much less than the actual number of cationic groups. which are 26. 21 and 18 at pH values 5.57. 7.50 and 9.50 respectively.

In WSN architecture. the Base Station (BS) is a single point of failure. because it collects sensor readings and performs command and control tasks. So BSs are main targets of the jamming attack. For mitigating the effects of BS jamming attacks. we propose a hybrid model of defense. which combines 3 defense techniques. The first technique is BS replication. so in a jamming condition. there may be some unjammed replicated BSs for providing service to the network. The second technique is the evasion of BS from jammed location to any unjammed location. The third technique is multipath routing for providing alternative paths for communication with BS in case of jamming of one or more paths.

To investigate this region further. its oligomerisation was considered necessary to augment intracellular biochemical stability. Two to ten unit long tandem repeats of the E region (X16-n) were generated and their expression vectors constructed. Transient transfection of the E expression vectors along with different CAT constructs showed increase in the reporter activity. Interestingly a direct correlation was observed between the number of E repeat units in an expression vector and the level of transactivation.

A sufficient amount of water pressure is necessary for the hydraulic confinement of the stored product in unlined caverns in order to prevent any leakage to the outside environment. This water is supplied through a network of water curtain tunnels and boreholes located above the caverns some distance away. However. excessive leakage inside caverns is controlled by carrying out grouting of rock fissures such that seepage is brought under acceptable limits.

Outcome of schizophrenia is reported to be better in India. In this report based on census data. we highlight substantially greater mortality observed among the mentally ill than among the general population during famines in India in the 19th century. A possible selection against the most severe forms of schizophrenia could account for greater occurrence of better-outcome phenotypes.

Addressing these increasing challenges will depend on how people manage the basin’s groundwater resources. on which the reliance will increase further due to limited prospects for additional surface storage development. This report assesses the potential of the Ganges Water Machine (GWM). a concept proposed 40 years ago. to meet the increasing water demand through groundwater. and mitigate the impacts of floods and droughts. The GWM provides additional subsurface storage (SSS) through the accelerated use of groundwater prior to the onset of the monsoon season. and subsequent recharging of this SSS through monsoon surface runoff. It was identified that there is potential to enhance SSS through managed aquifer recharge during the monsoon season. and to use solar energy for groundwater pumping. which is financially more viable than using diesel as practiced in many areas at present. The report further explores the limitations associated with water quality issues for pumping and recharge in the GRB. and discusses other related challenges. including availability of land for recharge structures and people’s willingness to increase the cropping intensity beyond the present level.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:YbLjypsZzowC,13,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YtKkDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=info:eZK7mJQ1xc8J:scholar.google.com&ots=F1xZTCBcUd&sig=82zrKSBALP1JUoMh_xt_dsUwBfA,14971431448596943481,/scholar?cites=14971431448596943481,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YtKkDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR6&dq=info:eZK7mJQ1xc8J:scholar.google.com&ots=F1xZTCBcUd&sig=82zrKSBALP1JUoMh_xt_dsUwBfA,0,0,0

The acid hydrolysis and first pass effects can be avoided. The release of drug can be affected by continuous secretion of saliva. The mucin film exists in oral mucosa offers an opportunity to develop mucoadhesive system. which retain at absorption site for prolonged time by mucoadhesive binding. The close contact with absorption membrane causes more absorption of the drug. The pH of buccal cavity ranges between 5-7. and does not cause any problem to the drug with the right dosage form design and formulation; the permeability and the local environment of the mucosa can be controlled and manipulated in order to accommodate drug permeation. Buccal drug delivery is a promising area for continued research with the aim of systemic delivery of orally inefficient drugs as well as a feasible and attractive alternative for non-invasive delivery of potent peptide and protein drug molecules.

The surface was treated with electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma consisting of 25% H2 and 75% N2. Remarkable improvement in the selectivity with respect to ethyl alcohol and reduction in the sensitivity for humidity was observed after this treatment. The response and recovery time for resistive sensing were of the order of 50 and 30 s respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transformation infra red studies showed that the increased cross-linking of PC is responsible for the creation of new functional groups which have imparted the sensing of alcohol vapor through extrinsic doping.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:R8TPKZP7usQC,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X02006651,12855355219458812677,/scholar?cites=12855355219458812677,,,0,0,0

Melphalan and dacarbazine are commonly used for treatment of melanoma and their effect is potentiated by hyperthermia. The present study attempts to enhance the antitumour effect of melphalan by encapsulating it in temperature-sensitive liposomes and using it in combination with localized hyperthermic treatment of tumours for targeted delivery. Small unilamellar vesicles made of synthetic lipids (distearoyl phosphatidyl choline and dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline). showing gel to liquid crystalline phase transition at 42 degrees C. were used for encapsulation of melphalan. In vivo antitumour efficacy of the combination of liposomal melphalan and hyperthermia was determined using B16F10 murine melanoma transplanted into C57Bl/6 mice. A significant reduction in tumour volume and increased survival time was observed in tumour-bearing mice treated with a combination of hyperthermia and thermosensitive liposome-encapsulated melphalan compared with animals treated with an equivalent dose of free melphalan with or without hyperthermia. These results suggest that hyperthermia in combination with temperature-sensitive liposome-encapsulated melphalan may serve as a useful targeted drug delivery system for more effective management of melanoma.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,13,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8541722,10568973308485056567,/scholar?cites=10568973308485056567,,,0,0,0

The Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal is the most comprehensive global environmental agreement on hazardous and other wastes; which aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects resulting from the generation. management. transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous and other wastes (http://www.basel.int/). In the 1990s the focus was set on the control over toxic substances by means of smart design for recycling and manual disassembly of hazardous components in the recycling phase itself. Experiences of the last ten years show that electronic waste policies should serve multiple and broader societal goals. Developments in shredding and separation technologies have led to the realisation that dismantling as such does not bring the desired toxic control. as it depends much more on the destination of disassembled components. and there are relatively high costs involved. The recovery of valuable materials and energy preservation has also become much more important. There is an obvious change in thinking and approach to WEEE (Puja Sawhney et. al. 2008).

72590,Impact of node density and mobility on scalable routing protocols in mobile AdHoc networks,2012,Vinay Kumar and Sanjeev Jain and Sudarshan Tiwari,5,Special Issue of International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 8887) on Communication Security,,21-27,,Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) is a self-configurable network of mobile nodes connected by wireless links to form an arbitrary topology and communicate to each other without the use of existing infrastructure. Complexities of routing between the nodes are increasing due to the highly dynamic nature of the mobile ad hoc network results in frequent change in network topology. The routing protocols are faced with the challenge of producing multi-hop routing under host mobility and bandwidth constraint. Scalability issues are attracting attention these days due to the presence of both large node density and mobility of the nodes in ad hoc networks. Random waypoint mobility is used in this simulation. In this paper analysis and comparisons of routing protocols such as: Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vectoring Routing Protocol (AODV). Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Dynamic MANET On demand Routing (DYMO) is done on the basis of the packet delivery ratio. average end to end delay. average jitter and throughput.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:FlduMtdN19MC,12,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.735.3567&rep=rep1&type=pdf,9851403848758387997,/scholar?cites=9851403848758387997,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.735.3567&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The use of the transconjunctival incision instead is an alternative in suitable patients. The records of 17 patients were reviewed in whom a transconjunctival incision was used during total maxillectomy. These included 13 in whom the Weber–Ferguson incision was used. and 4 who had a sublabial incision. There was mild conjunctival oedema in all the cases during the immediate postoperative period but it did not last for more than two days. Four patients had mild to moderate oedema of the lid that resolved within two days. One had mild ectropion with transient epiphora. which was caused by early removal of the medial canthal sutures. We found the approach to be cosmetically acceptable as it avoids a scar in the subciliary region.

The proliferation of electronic messaging has been witnessed during the last few years. The acute problem of node failure and connection failure is frequently encountered in communication through various types of networks. We know that a network can be defined as an undirected graph N(V.E). It is believed that in a network the nodes as well as the connections can fail and hence can cause unsuccessful communication. So. it is important to estimate the network reliability to encounter the network failure. Various tools have been used to estimate the reliability of various types of networks. In this paper we are considering the approach of neuro optimization for estimating the network reliability. We use the simulation annealing to estimate the probabilities of various nodes in the network and Hopfield model to calculate the energies of these nodes at various thermal equilibriums. The state of the minimum energy represents the maximum reliability state of the network.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:Xl6nMSl579sC,12,http://www.ije.ir/&url=http:/www.ijeir.info/article_71809.html,12397646537862534906,/scholar?cites=12397646537862534906,,http://www.ije.ir/article_71809_15e3346259182399ddf28d1387aa8d0a.pdf,0,0,0

Identification of high-yielding stable genotypes (G) across environments (E) is challenging because of the complex G× E interactions (GEI). In the present study. the performance of 16 forage sorghum genotypes over seven locations across the rainy seasons of 2010 and 2011 was investigated using GGE biplot analysis. Analysis of variance revealed the existence of significant GEI for fodder yield and all eight associated phenotypic traits. Location accounted for a higher proportion of the variation (0· 72–0· 91). while genotype contributed only 0· 06–0· 21 of total variation in different traits. Genotype-by-location interactions contributed 0· 02–0· 13 of total variation. Promising genotypes for fodder yield and each of the associated traits could be identified effectively using a graphical biplot approach. The majority of test locations were highly correlated. A ‘Which-won-where’study partitioned the test locations into two mega-environments (MEs): ME1 was represented by five locations with COFS 29 as the best genotype. while ME2 had two locations with S 541 as the best genotype. The existence of two MEs suggested a need for location-specific breeding. Genotype-by-trait biplots indicated that improvement for forage yield could be achieved through indirect selection for plant height. leaf number and early vigour.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:YK4ucWkmU_UC,10,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sujay_Rakshit2/publication/281539706_Assessing_genotype-by-environment_interactions_and_trait_associations_in_forage_sorghum_using_GGE_biplot_analysis/links/55ed1c7608ae65b6389f4236/Assessing-genotype-by-environment-interactions-and-trait-associations-in-forage-sorghum-using-GGE-biplot-analysis.pdf,9820236215106432671,/scholar?cites=9820236215106432671,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sujay_Rakshit2/publication/281539706_Assessing_genotype-by-environment_interactions_and_trait_associations_in_forage_sorghum_using_GGE_biplot_analysis/links/55ed1c7608ae65b6389f4236/Assessing-genotype-by-environment-interactions-and-trait-associations-in-forage-sorghum-using-GGE-biplot-analysis.pdf,0,0,0

72677,Donor hematopoietic stem cells confer long-term marrow reconstitution by self-renewal divisions exceeding to that of host cells,2012,Sushmita Roy and Saleem Javed and Swatantra K Jain and Subeer S Majumdar and Asok Mukhopadhyay,7,PLoS One,12,e50693,Public Library of Science,Dormant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are activated by microenvironmental cues of the niche in response to the injury of bone marrow (BM). It is not clearly understood how engrafted cells respond to these cues and are involved in marrow regeneration. The purpose of this study was to decipher this cellular response in competitive environment. BM cells of CD45.2 mice were transplanted in sub-lethally irradiated CD45.1 mice. The status of the donor and recipient stem cells (LSK: Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+) were determined by flowcytometry using CD45 alleles specific antibodies. The presence of long-term engraftable stem cells was confirmed by marrow repopulation assay in secondary hosts. and cell cycle status was determined by staining with Ho33342 and pyronin Y. and BrdU retention assay. The expressions of different hematopoietic growth factor genes in stromal compartment (CD45− cells) were assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The presence of donor cells initially stimulated the proliferation of host LSK cells compared with control mice without transplantation. This was expected due to pro-mitotic and anti-apoptotic factors secreted by the donor hematopoietic cells. Upon transplantation. a majority of the donor LSK cells entered into cell cycle. and later they maintained cell cycle status similar to that in the normal mouse. Donor-derived LSK cells showed 1000-fold expansion within 15 days of transplantation. Donor-derived cells not only regenerated BM in the primary irradiated host for long-term. they were also found to be significantly involved in marrow regeneration after the second cycle of …,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050693,11424389162066992210,/scholar?cites=11424389162066992210,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050693,0,0,0

When conflict arises due to shared resources or overlap of instructions or logical error. the deadlock state appears where further processing of jobs is blocked completely. While the scheduler jumps from one job to another in order to perform the processing the transition mechanism appears. This paper presents a general structure of transition scenario for the functioning of CPU scheduler in the presence of deadlock condition in setup of multilevel queue scheduling. A data model based Markov chain model is proposed to study the transition phenomenon and a general class of scheduling scheme is designed. Some specific and well known schemes are treated as its particular cases and are compared under the setup of model through a proposed deadlock-waiting index measure.

These methods were developed based on the simultaneous estimation of drugs in a binary mixture without previous separation. The methods employed were Absorbance Ratio Method (Q-Analysis)(I) and Simultaneous Equation Method (Vierodt’s Method)(II). The first method employs 271.5 nm as λ1 (Isobestic point) and 286 nm as λ2 (λmax of Lornoxicam) for formation of equations. The second method employs estimation of a drug concentration by selecting λmax where the absorbances of these drugs were maximum. So λmax for Lornoxicam and Paracetamol is 286 nm and 257 nm respectively. Lornoxicam and Paracetamol obey Beer’s law in the concentration range 8-40 µgmL-1 (r 2= 0.9998) and 10-50 µgmL-1 (r 2= 0.9999) in 0.1 N NaOH. The mean recovery for Lornoxicam and Paracetamol were found to be 98.38±1.28% and100±0.50% from method I and 100.33±0.56% and100±0.40% from method II. The developed methods were validated according to ICH guidelines and values of accuracy. precision and other statistical analysis were found to be in good accordance with the prescribed values.

72723,Medicinal plants with neuropharmacological properties from Indian origin,2014,SACHIN KUMAR Jain and SUMIT Parihar and NEHA Pandey,6,Int J Pharm Pharm Sci,10,36-40,,Neuropharmacology is the scientific study of the effects of drugs on the central nervous system. Its primary focus is actions of medications for psychiatric and neurologic disorders as well as those of drugs of abuse. The goal of Neuropharmacology is to apply information about drugs and their mechanisms of action. develop safer and more effective treatments and eventually curative and preventive measures for a host of nervous system abnormalities. There are a number of drugs being used in the traditional medicine for treatment of various CNS disorders and presently many of these drugs are being explored scientifically to ascertain their CNS activities. Significant number of studies has been performed to find alternative treatment for diseases of the nervous forum by identifying structures with activity at the central nervous system. However. most of the screenings are usually conducted on an ad hoc basis and not systematically. The initial purpose of this review is to summarize plants with neuropharmacological activities. in particular. those that have not been fully studied and that have molecular mechanisms whose active constituents are responsible for the activities remained to be identified. The second purpose was to identify potential target plants for future studies of new and alternative therapies for the treatment of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:It3QlvBKHbMC,9,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1670843459999287132&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1670843459999287132,/scholar?cites=1670843459999287132,,,0,0,0

Nanotoxicology is aimed at providing information on the potential toxicological effects. risk assessment and safety evaluation of nanostructured materials on human health. Nanoparticles present possible dangers. both medically and environmentally. They are also able to pass through cell membranes in organisms and their interactions with biological systems are relatively unknown. Animal studies have shown that nanoparticles can penetrate cells and tissues. move through the body and brain and cause biochemical damage. The greater chemical reactivity of nanomaterials result in increased production of reactive oxygen species which may contribute to similar patterns of cell injury and alterations at the molecular level by initiation. propagation and autocatalytic chain reactions.

If not managed properly. this insect causes serious damage directly from larval feeding on a variety of dried fruits and stored vegetables and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) seeds. Jha (2003) observed 9.8-64.8% damage in different wheat cultivars due to release of C. cautella larvae after 70 days of its release. Control of C. cautella population world-wide is primarily dependent on repeated application of contact insecticide as space and structural treatment or as protectants. Global concern with the health and environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides. from both consumers and government agencies has led to heightened restrictions and limitations on the use of these products. Being compounds of natural origin. no problems with persistence in the environment are anticipated (Gebbinck et al. 2002). Thus. products based on plant extracts. phyto-oils and purified substances of plant origin can be an alternative to the conventional pesticides (Isman 2001). Lantana camara is an evergreen hairy shrub planted as an ornamental hedge. widely found in tropics and sub-tropics and coastal locations of Asia. It is also an important weed pest of tropical crops.

In the case of the RC structures. this is achieved by applying the limit state theory to the static strains measured on the top and the bottom reinforcement bars at specified locations. taking material non-linearity into account. The methodologies are verified on models of steel frame. steel truss bridge and an RC beam. The paper also covers the measurement of dynamic strain for extraction of structural natural frequencies for condition assessment of structures. Performance of two different sensors. electrical strain gauges (ESGs) and lead zirconate titanate based piezo-electric ceramic (PZT) patches. is compared in this respect. Structural damage is located using changes in natural frequency and mode shapes of the structure. PZT patches are found to display much superior performance as compared to the ESGs for dynamic strain measurement. They are not only cost-effective but also impose minimal hardware and signal conditioning requirements.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:t7izwRedFcYC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suresh_Bhalla/publication/264041867_Performance_and_Condition_Monitoring_of_Structures_Using_Discrete_Strain_Measurements/links/57b48ee808aeddbf36e6e6c8.pdf,17355974703487002406,/scholar?cites=17355974703487002406,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Suresh_Bhalla/publication/264041867_Performance_and_Condition_Monitoring_of_Structures_Using_Discrete_Strain_Measurements/links/57b48ee808aeddbf36e6e6c8.pdf,0,0,0

Generalized transresistances are defined as the ratio of transconductance to square of conductance. and their proportionality to channel length and reciprocal square of gate drive is exploited to develop six new analytical methods for determination of MOSFET threshold voltage and channel length. Quantitative expressions for the error components due to short channel geometry effects. asymmetry and bias dependence of source and drain series resistances. and mobility degradation are derived and related to total threshold voltage and channel length errors of various methods.

Ten generations of bidirectional mass selection for seed weight. plant height. and days to flower were conducted within a foundation seed lot of ‘Double Dwarf Yellow Milo 38’ (DD38) grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) to evaluate this possibility. Selection gains were evaluated by comparing nonselected and tenth cycle selected populations grown in replicated experiments at three locations in 1978.Divergence of population means of plus and minus selected strains was significant (p ≤ 0.01) for all three traits. while asymmetry of response was significant (p ≤0.01) for seed weight and days to flower only.

72850,Approaches for enhancing the bioavailability of acyclovir: a critical review,2013,R Sankar and S Jain,,,,,,Acyclovir. a purine nucleoside analogue. is a promising antiviral compound effective against Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). From the past 3 decades. it has been extensively exploited by the scientists for the diseases caused by these infective viruses. Upto a certain extent they are able to make dosage forms which can treat the infections caused by these viruses but. cannot perfectly/completely cure the ailments. In spite of its effective antiviral activity. oral bioavailability of Acyclovir is low (15 to 30%) and highly variable. This review discusses various possible reasons for the poor oral bioavailability of Acyclovir. In addition. it also focuses on various formulation approaches investigated by formulation scientists for the improvement of its oral bioavailability such as self microemulsifying drug delivery system. gastroretentive mucoadhesive microspheres. microemulsions. niosomes etc. Though the reasons for the poor oral bioavailability of Acyclovir are conflicting and inconclusive. many authors have reported widely varying formulation approaches to circumvent this problem and results suggested that these dosage forms can take place in the market. However detailed clinical studies are still needed to reconfirm these findings. The present review critically analyzes the pharmacokinetic and clinical limitations of conventional therapy of Acyclovir and different formulation strategies taken by the research scientists to overcome its formulation and clinical limitations.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:ntg98fmFLVcC,7,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.405.8248,7766048620490368033,/scholar?cites=7766048620490368033,,,0,0,0

72865,A proposed hybrid method for islanding detection,2010,Smita Shrivastava and S Jain and RK Nema,2,International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology,5,813-817,,In this paper Islanding detection methods for distributed resources are reviewed. The mainly used islanding detection techniques may be classified as active and passive techniques. Passive techniques don’t perturb the system but they have larger nondetection zones. whereas active techniques have smaller nondetection zones but they perturb the system. In this paper a new hybrid method is proposed for detecting islanding of inverter based distributed generators.

With the implementation of Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) allover the state of Delhi. Initial drug resistance (IDR) to Isoniazid and Rifampicin assumes great importance and needs to be monitored on a regular basis. We undertook to study the IDR against the first line essential drugs ie Isoniazid (H). Rifampicin (R). Ethambutol (E) and Streptomycin (S) from April 1999 to March 2000 in newly diagnosed sputum positive cases of pulmonary tuberculosis attending TB clinics under RNTCP in Delhi. A total of 157 consecutive new smear positive patients attending TB clinics under RNTCP were taken into the study. All sputum samples were subjected to culture and drug sensitivity tests on LJ medium after decontamination of samples by Petroff's method. Resistance was expressed as the percentage of colonies that grow on critical concentration of the drugs. To determine the proportion of resistance. the number of colonies on the control and the number of colonies on the drug medium were determined. A total of 94.77% samples were sensitive to the four first line essential drugs and IDR to any drug was 5.22%. The resistance to Rifampicin alone was nil but the resistance to Isoniazid alone was 2.24%. Combined resistance to both Rifampicin and Isoniazid was 2.98%.

In the publication. the mutant clone was reported to contain all of the B. burgdorferi plasmids of the wild type parent clone; however. this finding was interpreted in error and the authors now understand that in addition to lacking gene bbk46. the mutant clone also lacks plasmid lp28-1. It has been reported previously that B. burgdorferi clones lacking lp28-1 are unable to evade the host immune response resulting in the inability of the spirochetes to persist in mice [1-5].

In the present work. a piezo-force actuator using a stack of PZT plates mounted suitably in a diamond shaped mechanical amplifier is described. The piezo-stack under voltage excitation generates longitudinal displacement along its axis which gets amplified due to the shape of the mechanical amplifier in the transverse direction. The generated force versus displacement characteristics of the actuator at various excitation voltages have been studied using a low force transducer and a linear displacement probe and are reported in this work. It is expected that further work on piezo-force actuator would help establish low force calibration facility.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:hZ5_QnqxF7AC,6,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asp/jom/2013/00000001/00000002/art00007,13448063427217677009,/scholar?cites=13448063427217677009,,,0,0,0

72938,Inhibitory effect of antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin on the growth of colorectal tumour cells,2012,Priyanka Khare and Om Singh and Swatantra K Jain and Saleem Javed and Rahul Pal,,,,,NISCAIR-CSIR. India,Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was initially believed to be secreted exclusively by the embryo with its primary function being “rescue” of the corpus luteum. However. recently it has been found that the hormone (or its individual subunits) is also secreted by many cancers and that in many cases secretion is associated with poor patient prognosis. In this study. we assessed the presence of hCG in colorectal cancer cells (CCL-253) and evaluated the anti-tumour effects of  anti-hCG antibodies in vitro and in vivo. Anti-hCG antibodies were reactive with CCL-253. as revealed by confocal immunoflourescence microscopy; both cell surface and intracellular expression were observed. Western blot analysis showed that antibodies appeared to interact with several moieties. indicating a level of cross-reactivity. Anti-hCG antiserum specifically reduced the viability of tumor cells and the addition of complement increased in vitro anti-tumor effects. In nude mice implanted with CCL-253 cells. administration of anti-hCG antiserum caused a significant reduction in tumor volume; all treated animals survived. while mortality was observed in control animals. Results suggest that anti-hCG antibodies can mediate significant anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo and lend support to the rationale of anti-hCG immunization in the therapy of gonadotropin- sensitive cancers.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,6,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/13839,3315808305099992686,/scholar?cites=3315808305099992686,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/13839/1/IJBB%2049%282%29%2092-96.pdf,0,0,0

Dendrimers have often been refered to as the “Polymers of the 21st century”. The unique architectural design of dendrimers. high degree of branching. multivalency. globular structure and well-defined molecular weight. clearly distinguishes these as unique and optimum nanocarriers in medical applications such as drug delivery. gene transfection. tumor therapy and diagnostics etc. An increasingly large number of drugs being developed today facing problems of poor solubility. bioavailability and permeability. dendrimers can work as a useful tool for optimizing drug delivery of such problematic drugs. Also the problem of biocompatibility and toxicity can be overcome by careful surface engineering. Recent successes in simplifying and optimizing the synthesis of dendrimers provide a large variety of structures with reduced cost of their production. Also as research progresses. newer applications of dendrimers will emerge and the future should witness an increasing numbers of commercialized dendrimer based drug delivery systems.A dendrimer (from Greek dendra for tree) is a highly branched synthetic polymer and consists of a core where a monomer unit is attached. leading to a monodisperse. tree-like. star-shaped or generational structure with precise molecular weights and diameters in the 2 to 10 nm range size.

Keeping this in view. the clinical profile of nasal myiasis with special reference to entomological aspects was studied in 13 cases from February 1991 to March 1992. It was found to be common in age group 61– 70 yrs (38.5%). Foetor. maggots in the nose. blood stained nasal discharge. necrotic material and atrophic turbninates were seen in all cames. The major complications were maxillary sinusitis found in all the cases and diffuse cellulitis of face in 69.2% cases. Penetration of fly into the nasal cavity was recalled by 38.4% cases. Treatment consisted of removing the maggots manually after turpentine nasal douche. Larvae were cultured on fresh placenta/tonsil in 8 cases.

Monitoring of individual oxygenates in gasoline is important for quality control and regulatory purpose. Although. several analytical methods based on gas chromatography have been reported. a need was still felt to develop a simple and cost effective method of analysis. In this paper. a packed column gas chromatographic method is described for the analysis of C1−C4 alcohols. MTBE and TAME over a wide concentration range (2–20% V/V) in gasoline. The method involves determination of alcohols and ethers separately on two different columns.

The electric field component corresponding to the slow wave mode (SWM) of SWS is excited by an E‐plane horn antenna. The special features of the microwave transmission line are the stable tuning for a given antenna and no requirement for water cooling on any of the components. Two types of SWS. a helical coil and a slotted line antenna. are studied. and the experiments are carried out in nitrogen and argon. The plasma producing capability is examined for these systems in the region wce.wpe≳wrf. where wce. wpe. and wrf correspond to electron cyclotron. plasma. and microwave frequencies. respectively.

72998,Comparative performance analysis of image de-noising techniques,2019,Vivek Kumar and Atul Samadhiya,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.06529,,,,Noise is an important factor which when get added to an image reduces its quality and appearance. So in order to enhance the image qualities. it has to be removed with preserving the textural information and structural features of image. There are different types of noises exist who corrupt the images. Selection of the denoising algorithm is application dependent. Hence. it is necessary to have knowledge about the noise present in the image so as to select the appropriate denoising algorithm. Objective of this paper is to present brief account on types of noises. its types and different noise removal algorithms. In the first section types of noises on the basis of their additive and multiplicative nature are being discussed. In second section a precise classification and analysis of the different potential image denoising algorithm is presented. At the end of paper. a comparative study of all these algorithms in context of performance evaluation is done and concluded with several promising directions for future research work.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:ZtJ3RtM1NaMC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06529,7764680554356221645,/scholar?cites=7764680554356221645,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.06529,0,0,0

It is shown that the class of bounded unions of pattern languages over finitely generated Abelian automatic groups is explanatorily learnable. For patterns in which variables occur at most n times. it is shown that the classes of languages generated by such patterns as well as their bounded unions are. for finitely generated automatic groups. explanatorily learnable by an automatic learner. In contrast. automatic learners cannot learn the unions of up to two arbitrary pattern languages over the integers. Furthermore. there is an algorithm which. given an automaton describing a group G. generates a learning algorithm M G such that either M G explanatorily learns all pattern languages over G or there is no learner for this set of languages at all. not even a non-recursive one.

The prime motive of developing a fluidic thrust vectoring system has been to reduce the weight of the mechanical thrust vectoring system and to further simplify the configuration. Aircrafts using vectored thrust rely to a lesser extent on aerodynamic control surfaces such as ailerons or elevator to perform various maneuvers and turns than conventional-engine aircrafts and thus have a greater advantage in combat situations. Fluidic thrust vectoring systems manipulate the primary exhaust flow with a secondary air stream which is typically bled from the engine compressor or fan. This causes the compressor operating curve to shift from the optimum condition. allowing the optimization of engine performance.

State of Karnataka. India. A total of 69 km of arterial roadway stretch covered with asphalt concrete pavements in one of the six zones of the city was used for pavement condition assessment and development of pavement condition indices. Since there were no previous records of pavement condition assessment. engineering criteria was recommended and developed based on the prevalent field conditions and pavement distresses. The pavement condition parametric indices were estimated using the engineering criteria based threshold indices. which were used as major inputs in the development of a BpPMS computer program. A unique feature of the ranking-prioritization based system toolkit is that it helps an agency to prefer to maintain only selective roadway network sections that are in dire need of maintenance and plan to defer actions for the rest of the sections as part of future maintenance. Overall. the approach taken in this study is a promising assessment concept which will aid an agency to implementing a network level BpPMS for the best upkeep of the region’s roadway infrastructure that would deteriorate otherwise owing to monetary constraints.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:KYgttONoxcsC,5,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/25dc/e2be36c42aca1c977c1ba0c9b011c957678b.pdf,15519025526851577005,/scholar?cites=15519025526851577005,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/25dc/e2be36c42aca1c977c1ba0c9b011c957678b.pdf,0,0,0

The connection of a wind energy conversion system to the grid requires a robust phase locked loop (PLL) and continuous monitoring of the grid conditions such as overvoltage. undervoltage. overfrequency. underfrequency. and grid outages. This paper describes a flexible control operation to operate a small wind turbine in both stand-alone mode via planned islanding and grid connected mode as well. In particular. a proper monitoring and control algorithm is required for transition between the modes. A wavelet based energy function is used for detection of grid disturbances as well as recovery of grid so that transition between the modes is made. To obtain good power quality LCL filter is used to reduce ripples. PLL is used for synchronization whenever mode changes from stand-alone to grid connected. Simulation results from a 10 kW wind energy conversion system are included to show the usefulness of the proposed methods.

Worldwide. an estimated. 3 million cases of pesticide exposure are reported per year. It has been established that pesticide chemicals can alter immune function and causes immunotoxicity. We have developed a model for immunotoxicity testing of chemicals in vitro by analyzing cytokine gene expression. The changes in cytokine gene expression observed in vitro was used as an endpoint for studying perturbation of the immune system in vivo. This system employs cell lines that have been transformed using constructs that have promoter region of Th1. Th2 cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These promoter regions regulate the expression of a reporter gene. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). and the activity of promoter to the external stimuli was compared with the expression of endogenous cytokine genes. CyclosporinA. FK506 (tacrolimus) and pentoxifylline. have been tested on this model and they showed specific pattern of suppression of reporter gene expression treated with PMA/Ionomycin and LPS. These immunosuppressants also suppressed the PMA/Ionomycin and LPS induced endogenous gene expression of these cytokines.

First. multi-path loops are converted into code-fragments consisting of simpler loops via a transformation called control flow refinement. Progress invariants are determined for appropriate locations in the procedure to represent relationships between a state that can arise at that program location and the previous state at that location. A bound finding mechanism (such as one based on pattern matching) is then used to compute loop bounds from progress invariants.

A dose dependent reduction in germination. seedling height and seedling dry weight was observed with increasing concentrations of mutagens. The mutagenic effect was neutralized by the GA and IAA treatment and increased the germination. seedling height and seedling dry weight. respectively. Induced pollen sterility was also significant and dose dependent at all the concentrations of mutagens and improvement in the pollen fertility was observed with post treatment of IAA and GA. A wide spectrum of chlorophyll and macro mutations was observed in the progenies of M2 generation. The frequency and spectrum of chlorophyll and macro mutants increased with increasing concentrations of the mutagens. DMS induced a broader spectrum of chlorophyll and macro mutations in M2 generation as compared to EMS. In the present investigation. DMS was more effective and EMS was efficient mutagen.

Nanded district,2008,Rahul Banerjee and SK Jain and K Shivkumar,,Maharashtra. Mem. Geol. Soc. India,73,55-84,,Palaeoproterozoic granitoids exposed around Thadisaoli area. Nanded district. Maharashtra are northeastern extensions of Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) in Dharwar Craton and belong to its younger phase. These granitoids are predominantly represented by pink granite and pegmatitic/quarzofeldspathic rock (±maghemite clusters). and are traversed by younger phosphatic cherty cataclasites close to the Deccan Trap capping. Anomalous radio elemental concentrations have been recorded in these granitoids and phosphatic cherty cataclasite. The granitoids are also rich in rare metal and rare earth elements. whereas phosphatic cherty cataclasites are poor in RM&REE content. Predominance of LREE over HREE (LREE/HREE= 4.37) and fractionation among LREE are characteristic feature of Thadisaoli granitoids. The higher concentrations of radio elements and REE in granitoids are reflected in the form of presence of discrete uranium (primary–uraninite; secondary–b-uranophane) and thorium (thorite) minerals including high content of resistates viz.. apatite. zircon. allanite. sphene. cerianite. monazite. and ilmenite while radioactivity is mainly associated with phosphatic material in cherty cataclasites. In thorium–uranium diagram. a pronounced and progressive enrichment of uranium has been indicated in both. granitoids and cherty cataclasites. which might have lead to uranium mineralisation.

Typhoid caused by Salmonella typhi remains a major health concern in India and worldwide. Also. with emergence of multidrug resistant strains. Salmonella has acquired increased virulence. communicability and survivability. resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Though a number of vaccines for typhoid are available against S. typhi (or also against S. typhimurium). these have certain undesirable side effects and the search for new immunogens suitable for vaccine formulation is still continuing. The immune response to primary Salmonella infection involves both humoral and cell-mediated responses. The protective immunity against Salmonella depends on host- parasite interaction. however; the detailed mechanism of virulence. innate resistance and susceptibility of host remains unclear. This review focuses on the molecular. immunological and cellular mechanisms of pathogenesis of Salmonella infection to provide an insight to counteract bacterial infections and allow a better understanding of its clinical manifestations. It also reviews better technological possibilities combined with increased knowledge in related fields such as immunology and molecular biology and allow for new vaccination strategies.

Despite its success. it has a few drawbacks. It may be time-consuming and requires considerable planning. and at times the dog-ears cannot be avoided. The suture line passes over the distal end of the stump. which is usually a problem during prosthetic use. The skew flap technique retains the advantages of the long posterior flap technique and eliminates the difficulties of prosthetic fitting. The equal skin flaps are skewed so that the flaps become anteromedial and posterolateral. whereas the calf muscle flap remains long underneath the skewed skin flaps. The posterior muscles are brought anteriorly covering the cut ends of the bones and are buried in between the tibia and its anterior periosteum. by suturing their margins with the periosteum.

Increasing aspect ratios of the on-chip interconnects lead to higher coupling capacitances and ultimately higher cross-talk noise. which degrades signal integrity. In this paper we propose a clamping circuit for on-chip busses. which clamps a victim wire in an on-chip bus based on the states of its immediate aggressors. These clampers help the driver of the victim wire in draining the charge. which is induced due to cross-talk between aggressors and victim wires. This helps in decreasing the cross-talk peak noise and also the delay variability (referred to as delay noise). Simulation results for a 10 mm long communication bus (parallel wires) laid at minimum pitch in 0.13 /spl mu/m CMOS technology show that a reduction of 30%(17.6%). 37%(27.2%) and 26%(65.8%) in cross-talk peak noise amplitude (delay noise) is observed for point …,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:rhSvDnGaX0QC,5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1383296/,14627501349956482399,/scholar?cites=14627501349956482399,,,0,0,0

The ECR plasma is produced in a coaxial line configuration and hence the source is compact. The plasma parameters (plasma density and electron temperature) are measured using a Langmuir probe. The plasma parameters are mainly dependent on the center conductor (stub) dimensions of the coaxial line. The characterization of plasma for both conical and cylindrical stubs is carried out and it is found that the conical stub produces relatively denser and more stable plasma than the cylindrical stub. The typical plasma density and electron temperature are 3×1010 cm−3 and 5 eV. respectively. for argon plasma.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC,5,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1146686,7968574590599445565,/scholar?cites=7968574590599445565,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sunil_Jain7/publication/224480344_A_compact_coaxial_electron_cyclotron_resonance_plasma_source/links/53f5a04c0cf2888a7491c6fe/A-compact-coaxial-electron-cyclotron-resonance-plasma-source.pdf,0,0,0

73079,Analysis of the pressuremeter test by FEM formulation of the elasto-plastic consolidation,1985,Subodh Kumar Jain,,,,,,A decade has passed since the development of the self-boring pressuremeter (SBPM). Even though the device has been recognized by the geotechnical engineering profession as having high promise for evaluating in-situ stress-strain behavior of soils. its use is limited. In large part. this is due to the fact that there are important unanswered questions about the SBPM test. One of the major issues concerns the influence of drainage in the soil as it is sheared. In clays. the test is assumed to be undrained. but there is no way to control this other than by the rate of loading and no method has been put forth heretofore to define the required rate.   This dissertation addresses the drainage issue by applying a numerical model capable of simulating the pressuremeter test under variety of conditions. To develop parameters for the soil model. a comprehensive laboratory testing effort was needed. The validity of the numerical model and the soil parameters is established by comparing it to SBPM tests performed in the field.   The numerical model uses the finite element method in a special code capable of handling large strains. consolidation effects. and nonlinear soil behavior. Particular attention is addressed to the issue of pore pressure development and its dissipation. Relative influences of important soil parameters such as the permeability are checked against various rates of loading in the SBPM test. The results demonstrate that drainage likely occurs in most cases using conventional test procedures. and that this. in turn. leads to an error in interpretation of SBPM data. Based on the findings in the analyses. a procedure is proposed which should lead to …,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:oYVvnHz_XzQC,5,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/53881,5939949028801086308,/scholar?cites=5939949028801086308,,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/53881/LD5655.V856_1985.J346.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Any disturbance results in some power quality (PQ) issues. Poor power quality may have economic and operational impacts on both electric utilities and consumers. It is aimed that electric utilities must be able to supply high quality of power to consumers. Therefore. early detection of power quality problems is needed to allow a reasonable time for protection and controlling devices to interfere and take appropriate actions. In this work. power quality monitoring is proposed through wavelet energy distribution of a signal. mapped in time and frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform. The PQ issues such as voltage sag. voltage swell and momentary interruptions have been processed in a time window.

Hydrotropic solution may be a proper choice to preclude the use of organic solvents so that an attempt has been made to develop simple. accurate. novel. safe and precise spectrophotometric method for estimation of poorly-water soluble drug meloxicam. Methods: Solubility of meloxicam is increased by using 8% phenol and 25% sodium benzoate solution as hydrotropic agent. There was more than 32 fold solubility enhanced in hydrotropic solution as compare with distilled water. The meloxicam shows the maximum absorbance at 362 nm. At this wavelength hydrotropic agent and other tablet excipients do not shows any significant interference in the spectrophotometric assay. Results: The developed method was found to be linear in the range of 15-75 μg/ml with correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.9994. The mean percent label claims of tablets of meloxicam in two marketed. formulation-I and formulation-II estimated by the proposed method were found to be 98.35±0.76 to 98.53±0.94 respectively. The developed methods were validated according to ICH guidelines and values of accuracy. precision and other statistical analysis were found to be in good accordance with the prescribed values.

We report of the disease in a family caused due to sesame oil adulteration. Peculiarity to report this disease is that it occurred due to consumption of contaminated sesame seeds oil instead of mustard oiland secondly epidemic dropsy is also not very common in western Rajasthan. Five members of a family presented to the hospital with history of generalised body swelling. itching and marked cutaneous flush. Few of them also have shortness of breath. dry cough. palpitation. diarrhoea. vomiting and haemoptysis. On physical examination rashes. pallor and signs of cardiac failure were present in few patients. None of them had neurological symptoms and signs. After multiple interviews history of consumption of home made sesame seeds oil was explored in the family and the differential diagnosis of epidemic dropsy was made. Edible oil sample of the sesame seeds oil turned out to be positive for sanguinarine. Sanguinarine and dehydrosanguinarine are two major toxic alkaloids of Argemone oil. which cause widespread capillary dilatation. proliferation and increased capillary permeability. Leakage of the protein-rich plasma component into the extracellular compartment leads to the formation of oedema. There is no specific therapy.

REC-2006 treatment 2 h before irradiation strongly inhibited the cleavage of ATM and PARP-1 in HepG2 cells. The expression of nuclear apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) was found to be more inhibited (~17%) in HepG2 cells in REC-2006 + radiation-treated group. More inhibition (~33%) of cytochrome c was observed in HepG2 cells upon REC-2006 treatment 2 h prior irradiation. Similarly. significantly more (                ) inhibition of Apaf-1. caspase-9 and caspase-3 was observed in REC-2006 + radition-treated group in HepG2 cells. REC-2006 treatment restored the expression of ICAD in HepG2 cells; however. no restoration was observed in Hep3B cells. Lower nuclear to cytoplasmic CAD ratio was observed in HepG2 cells (~0.6) as compared with Hep3B cells (~1.2) in REC-2006 + radiation-treated group. In conclusion. REC-2006 rendered higher protection in HepG2 cells by inhibiting the expression and translocation of AIF. inhibiting the cleavage of ATM and PARP-1. restoring the expression of ICAD. inhibiting the release of cytochrome c and thus modulating the expression of Apaf-1 caspase-9 and activity of caspase-3.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,4,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/758326/abs/,16204707399091451105,/scholar?cites=16204707399091451105,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/758326/abs/,0,0,0

73146,Functions and significance of nitric oxide in patho-physiological processes,2007,Pankaj Gautam and SK Jain,,,,,CSIR,Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that regulates a diverse range of physiological processes in many tissues. NO is enzymatically synthesized from L-arginine by three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). It plays an important role in a large number of normal physiological (regulation of blood pressure. neurotransmission. wound repair and host defense mechanisms) as well as in patho-physiological (inflammation. infection. apoptosis. neoplastic diseases. liver cirrhosis. diabetes) processes. With an unpaired electron. NO is a strong pro-oxidant produced in conditions like sepsis. It also exerts its effect through other free radicals such as superoxide and hydroxyl ions and causes oxidative stress within the cell. Reactive nitrogen intermediates play a central role in cell death (apoptosis). which is mediated by the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor. NO mediated apoptosis occurs in various cell types such as macrophages. lymphocytes. thymocytes. endothelial cells. At lower concentration (10 nM-1 μM) NO has been shown to have antiapoptotic effect. which is cyclic GMP dependent. One of the most beneficial functions of NO is its implication in host defense against intracellular pathogens (Salmonella and Leishmania). Its derivatives such as per-oxynitrite are strong bactericidal in nature. Involvement of NO in inflammatory responses has been shown not only in experimental models but also in human inflammatory diseases. The antioxidant and antiapoptotic properties make this molecule of great therapeutic significance.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC,4,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/3047,8494439505831243130,/scholar?cites=8494439505831243130,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/3047/1/IJBT%206(3)%20293-304.pdf,0,0,0

The essence of spraying is reduction of spray solution into droplets that is usually achieved by nozzles operating at constant pressure. specific discharge and cone angle. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of cone angle on the droplet spectrum of a hollow cone nozzle by keeping constant operating pressure at 3 kg/cm2 and discharge of 473 ml/min. Six nozzles with cone angles of 57.66 º. 59.0 º. 64.4 º. 68.5 º. 77.0 º and 87.0 º were tested. A droplet analyzer analyzed the number of spray droplets. Amongst six nozzles. the spraying performance of a hollow cone nozzle with a cone angle of 68.5 º was best. The tests with this nozzle resulted in a useful volume of 3.189 x 10-4 cc. a maximum volume mean diameter of 149.99 µm and a maximum droplet density of 636 droplet/sq cm. which provided effective disease control.The uniformity coefficient of this cone angle was 0.955. which is near unity. The second best value for useful volume (2.847 x 10-4 cc) and droplet density (617 droplets/sq cm) were for a cone angle of 64.4 º which had a uniformity coefficient 0.975.

73150,Whither genome research: Of man. mosquito and malaria,2005,Utpal Tatu and Samta Jain and P Padma Priya,30,,5,567-571,Springer India,1. BackgroundMalaria continues to be a global health challenge. More number of people die of malaria than any other single infectious disease world over. While the occurrence of malaria is mainly localized to tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. the numbers of people infected with malaria are very large. Recent WHO survey reports over 500 million cases of malaria annually. resulting in more than 2 million deaths. of which about a million are children in sub-saharan Africa. Global warming together with increasing travel and communication between under-developed and developed nations is predicted to aid further spread of malaria in the world. Malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite belonging to the genus Plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans through anopheles mosquito vector. The parasite enters the human body through bite of an infected mosquito and develops in the liver to give rise to merozoites. Merozoites enter the blood stream and invade the erythrocytes to multiply asexually. Small populations of merozoites convert to gametocytes in the blood stream and upon entry into a fresh mosquito undergo sexual development in the mosquito mid gut to form the gametes. Fusion of the gametes gives rise to zygotes. which develop into motile ookinete and invade the mid gut epithelium. The ookinetes emerge from the basal epithelium cell surface and convert into an oocyst that releases thousands of sporozoites in the hemocoel. Sporozoites eventually invade the salivary glands of the mosquito and are transmitted to a fresh human host during the next blood meal. Thus the parasite has to alternate between the …,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:jSAVyFp_754C,4,https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/030/05/0567-0571,1273358904125228970,/scholar?cites=1273358904125228970,,https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/030/05/0567-0571,0,0,0

73160,Advancement of endochronic theory in engineering mechanics,2000,SK Jain,,Europen Congress on Computational Methods in Applied Sciences and Engineering,,,,Since its inception in 1971 by KC Valanis. the endochronic theory has undergone periods of both scrutiny and acceptance. In 1989. a flier on a book* took the mechanics researchers in the United States by surprise. The flier read.“… By direct numerical integration of its constitutive equations. the book appears to have achieved a breakthrough in the development of endochronic theory.” At the same time. a paper** caught the attention of researchers. The author essentially said. the endochronic theory would not work. Valanis*** rushed to rebut the claims of the new researcher. Researchers✝ at Virginia Tech✝✝ showed that computational schemes and the methods of determination of material parameters were capable of invalidating this outstanding theory. Since the publication of their work in 1991. no refutation of the endochronic theory has been seen in the literature. This conference presentation is an extension of their 1991 paper.Here. numerical integration methods leading to solutions of boundary value problems by the endochronic theory are presented. Procedures for determining material parameters of the endochronic theory are established. The numerical schemes are examined for efficacy in modeling random nonproportional tests on OFHC copper. Finally. the results of a biaxial experiment on a metal matrix composite are compared against the predictions of the endochronic theory via a finite element micromechanics model.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:yeKNu01O_4gC,4,http://congress2.cimne.com/eccomas/proceedings/eccomas2000/pdf/429.pdf,10578625845560055484,/scholar?cites=10578625845560055484,,http://congress2.cimne.com/eccomas/proceedings/eccomas2000/pdf/429.pdf,0,0,0

73168,The Krukenberg operation,1996,SK Jain,,"Amputation: Surgical Practice and Patient management, eds. Murdoch & Wilson",,313-8,,The hand is one of the most intricately designed mechanisms of the human body. The loss of one hand causes a severe degree of handicap. and. inevitably. with the loss of both hands the handicap is multiplied. In contrast. it has to be recognized that the function of the arm and hand can never be matched by the functions achieved by the pros-thetic hand. In addition to the fine controlled movements of the hand. proprioception and the sense of touch are of vital importance. Both these sensory functions together act as a third eye for an individual; thus. even a blind person can recognize an object by its shape. density. surface. etc. We may hope to develop a prosthesis with such sensory functions in the next century but up until now all we have is a hand prosthesis exhibiting only slight movements and moderate cosmesis. Loss of vision in addition to the loss of both hands is. thankfully. rare and usually takes place when a device explodes while handling. Thrasher accidents. frost-bite. electric burn injuries and machine (industrial) accidents are other causes of amputation of both the hands. The Krukenberg procedure of converting two non-functional below-elbow stumps into sensitive and functional organs makes a double hand amputee into a totally independent individual. In such an amputee who has also lost his vision the procedure is of vital importance. This procedure was devised by Krukenberg (1917) with the aim to make a double hand amputee totally independent. However. the procedure fell into disrepute due to its unsightly appearance. The Krukenberg procedure has been regularly performed at the Artificial Limb Centre.

Reactions between carbohydrates and proteins in water and their relation to transfer of carbohydrates across red-cell membranes,1958,ICL Bruce and CH Giles and SK Jain,,Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed),,1610-1613,Royal Society of Chemistry,The refractometric method of detecting intermolecular complexes has been used with dilute aqueous solutions of glucose. sucrose. or meso-inositol and proteins or models of proteins. These and other results suggest that:(a) normal carbohydrates do not form hydrogen-bond complexes with proteins in dilute aqueous or aqueous alkaline solutions because of the protective effect of the water; and (b) nzeso-inositol and simpler solutes. eg. alcohols. do form complexes. probably by hydrogen-bonding. Differences in transport rates of various solutes including carbohydrates across red-cell membranes can thus be explained. Apparently the more readily the solute forms hydrogen bonds with a protein. the slower is its diffusion rate in the membrane.CARBOHYDRATES and proteins may react in aqueous media in many biological systems.

Its chronic inflammatory state is thought to predispose patients to metabolic syndrome (MetS). which is a significant predictor of cardiovascular events. The objective of the study is to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in psoriatic patients with only cutaneous involvement and to evaluate the correlation between presence of MetS and psoriasis severityMethods: We performed hospital based. cross-sectional study on 100 adult patients with psoriasis vulgaris and equinumbered age and sex matched controls. MetS was diagnosed by revised National Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Panel III criteria.Results: A higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome was found in psoriasis patients as compared to controls [28 (28%) vs 9 (9%). P value= 0.0005]. Impaired fasting glucose level. hypertension. hypertriglyceridemia and abdominal obesity were more prevalent in psoriasis group. No statistically significant difference was found between prevalence of low levels of HDL and presence of metabolic syndrome. Presence of metabolic syndrome was not associated with severity and duration of psoriasis. Female patients with psoriasis were more frequently having metabolic syndrome.

Airdata sensors installed on aircraft normally measure pressures and flow angles in the local flow field and do not measure the parameters of free stream conditions that the entire aircraft flies in. As a result all the measurements by airdata sensors need to be corrected. This paper proposes an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based technique for the calibration of various parameters measured by Air Data System (ADS). The paper specifically addresses calibration of static pressure sensors at high angles of attack and transonic Mach number as the main theme.

73233,Age-invariant face recognition using shape transformation,2013,Shubham Jain and Aditya Nigam and Phalguni Gupta,,,,453-461,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,This paper proposes a novel facial image transformation that minimizes the variation due to aging in facial features. It transforms a face image of an individual according to the probe image to register the facial features. The images are globally registered using Delaunay triangulation which reduces the linear variation in individual’s appearance due to aging.

73253,Model-based image compression framework for CT and MRI images,2011,Sandeep Jain and Ankush Mittal and Sujoy Roy,3,International Journal of Medical Engineering and Informatics,1,40-52,Inderscience Publishers,This paper presents a novel model-based compression method for medical images. Unlike existing model-based compression methods. the proposed method is truly lossless and provides good compression ratio. The proposed method entails two major operations: registration of model and input (to be compressed) images. and compression of residual image (difference of model and input image). A context-based registration technique is proposed that depends on the criterion of minimising the residual image size. A quadtree-based adaptive block partitioning with rearrangement (QABPR) compression scheme is used to compress the residual image. Comparison with existing medical image compression methods and standard lossless compression techniques shows promising results.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:BOlwja0KXvYC,3,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJMEI.2011.039075,1926093867026275725,/scholar?cites=1926093867026275725,,,0,0,0
73254,Pervasive computing for automobiles: An approach to maximize user convenience and safety using VANETs,2010,Sini Shibu and Sanjeev Jain,2,International Journal of Computer and Electrical Engineering,6,1793-8163,,Invention of wheel was perhaps the most significant invention in the evolution of mankind. From the earliest carts to the present day automobiles. industry has witnessed dramatic changes and innovations. But even today. automobiles are equipped with mechanical. electrical and electronic devices that are not smart enough to take decisions on behalf of the user. The way mobile computing devices and applications are developed. deployed and used in automobiles today falls short of the potential for pervasive computing. This paper attempts to build a model of an automobile that uses pervasive computing to maximize user convenience and safety. The concept used is that of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). The major concern in a VANET is to provide reliable and efficient packet delivery mechanism taking into consideration the limited battery back-up of the mobile devices and also the available bandwidth. Moreover. data communication between vehicular mobile devices can minimize head-on collisions by proper auto-break mechanism implementation using Ultra Sound Generators and sensors. The implementation issues are also addressed in this paper. Ultimately. this paper presents ideas that could make driving simpler and safer as compared to the present day.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:4w9WtRFcIoYC,3,http://www.ijcee.org/papers/275-E681.pdf,13227918896563205521,/scholar?cites=13227918896563205521,,http://www.ijcee.org/papers/275-E681.pdf,0,0,0

PID tuning formulas are derived for unstable second order plus dead time (SOPDT) processes based on IMC principle. To achieve smooth output response. even in the presence of measurement noise. a first order low pass filter is inserted in the process output. Second order low pass filter used in this design reduces the effect of process-model mismatch and thus improves the performance.

The basic principle of such storage in unlined rock caverns is the hydraulic confinement. Thus. the rock caverns are planned at a depth such that there is sufficient hydrostatic pressure to counter the vapour pressure of the stored product. A water curtain system above the cavern ensures that the water flow is directed into the cavern. which prevents leakage of products into the surrounding ground. The paper presents the interaction between cavern units under different operating conditions. The influence of vertical water curtain system and presence of a circular tunnel between the cavern units is also presented.

Researchers at Virginia Tech showed that computational schemes and the methods of determination of material parameters were capable of invalidating this outstanding theory. Since the publication of their work in 1991. no refutation of the endochronic theory has been seen in the literature. This presentation is an extension of their 1991 paper.A five parameter endochronic solid is constructed by incorporating two exponential terms in the kernel function of the endochronic theory. Methods are presented for efficiently integrating the endochronic equations and a procedure is established for determing the material function.

The method presented is a single stage separation technique and involves simultaneous separation of barium and preconcentration of REEs onto activated carbon (AC) from barites. The REEs are selectively sorbed onto AC at pH 6±1. in presence of complexing agent. triethanolamine. used to prevent precipitation by various interfering elements. The effects of various parameters for quantitative sorption of REEs on AC are discussed. The REEs are desorbed from AC simply by treating AC with 3.2 M HNO 3. thus avoiding the tedious and time consuming operation of ashing AC. The decontamination factor for Ba is around 1600. The concentration of Ba in the final preconcentrate (25 ml) is< 10 μg/ml and its interference on REEs by ICP-AES is negligible. An high enrichment factor for REEs is achievable by taking large sample weight. to have a better precision. Accuracy of the method is evaluated by comparing it with ion exchange method. The precision of the method is±10% at one ppm level. The method has been applied on numerous barite samples for determination of REEs.(author),True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:RW1BPcyHXiwC,3,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:38095475,11010650802261558855,/scholar?cites=11010650802261558855,,,0,0,0

Acarbose and their combination in modifying the sucrose absorption in patients of non Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Fifty patients of NIDDM were randomly distributed in three groups. Group A had 20 patients who received 20 grams of guargum. Group B had 10 patients who received 100 mg of Acrabose. Group C had 20 patients who received 10 grams of guargum and 50 grams of Acrabose. All the patients underwent 50 grams sucrose tolerance test with and without the trial drugs. Blood glucose levels were determined at 0. 30. 60. 90 and 120 minutes after sucrose loading. With the drugs. there was a significant decrease in the blood glucose levels at all time intervals (p< 001) in all the three groups. In all the three groups the blood glucose levels with the trial drugs was significantly lower (p< 001) than without the drug. It was seen that acarbose alone and guargum alone did not differ significantly in reducing the blood sugar level whereas combination of two produced significantly greater reduction in blood glucose levels than either of the drug used alone. Thus both guargum and acarbose are equally effective in modifying the absorption of sucrose. When combined in half the dosage they have synergistic effect and the reduction in blood glucose level is greater than either of the drug used alone.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:yuCoZvLJRl8C,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8005921,1655818396361270640,/scholar?cites=1655818396361270640,,,0,0,0

The two activities viz. opsonic (parasite dependent) and cytophilic (macrophage dependent) were noted to operate independent of each other. The phagocytosis promoting activity was found to be complement dependent. The receptor site for binding of HIS opsonized but not medium opsonized parasite on the surface of macrophages was blocked by pretreatment of these cells with HIS-soluble antigen combination.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:afsF9h1fxg0C,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2941478,9356755600595044980,/scholar?cites=9356755600595044980,,,0,0,0

73309,Diffusion coefficient of trona in water,1982,Gurmukh D Mehta and Satish C Jain,21,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Process Design and Development,3,394-395,American Chemical Society,Introduction Trona is a naturally occurringchemical. commonly known as sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2C03-NaHC03· 2H20). The world’s largest deposit of trona. containing an estimated amount of 17 billion tons. is in Green River. WY (Kirk-Othmer. 1964). This salt is mainly used in the manufacture of soda ash. ie. sodium carbonate. Because of the abundantsupply of nearly pure trona in the United States. this solute is potentially a very attractive candidate for use in a salt-stratified nonconvecting solar pond (Tabor. 1963; Nielsen. 1980; Mehta. 1979). While there are ample data on mining of trona and of solid trona in equilibrium with Na2C03-NaHC03 solution. very little. if any. information is available on the chemical stability of trona or solution of trona solution or solution of trona and soda ash in various proportions without any solid phase.

On the other hand. during severe physical exertion. there is an increasing awareness of breathing and as the limit of tolerance approaches. there may be a feeling of acute breathlessness. Dyspnoea or shortness of breath at rest or during exertion is also the most commonly encountered symptom in respiratory disorders.

Acute cholecystitis can worsen and result in various complications. Gall bladder perforation leading to generalised peritonitis is a lethal complication.Methods: In this retrospective observational study we have reviewed 550 cases of acute cholecystitis who were admitted to our institution in 8 years ie from 2008 to 2015. Perforations due to other causes (trauma. iatrogenic causes. and carcinoma) were excluded. Niemeier classification was used to identify the patients. Direct-abdominal X-ray series. abdominal ultrasound scanning (US). abdominal contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT). routine blood cell count. and blood chemistry tests were performed.Results: Fourteen cases (2.5%) were found to have gall bladder perforations during the course of investigations and intraoperatively. Ten (71.42%) were females out of the total fourteen patients. Mean age was 65 years and presenting features on admission were nausea. vomiting. abdominal pain. fever and variable general condition. Aetiopathology of gall bladder perforation remains obscure till date. This clinical condition still remains a diagnostic as well as therapeutic challenge to surgeons. On detailed review of literature. we could not get few references. as the condition is uncommon.Conclusions: We have done this study to analyse the variable clinical presentation. correlation of non-invasive investigations and intraoperative findings and outcome in cases of gall bladder perforations so as to improve our further management of such cases.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:q7hqJx8pYzEC,2,https://mail.ijsurgery.com/index.php/isj/article/view/687,12611862853628631034,/scholar?cites=12611862853628631034,,https://mail.ijsurgery.com/index.php/isj/article/download/687/684,0,0,0

These modalities are useful in detecting at-risk. ischemic. infarcted. nonviable and scarred regions of myocardium. The abnormal area appears as a region of hypoperfusion or cold spot with or without dyskinesia. 2D-echocardiography (ECHO) is very useful in assessing the status of cardiac chambers and flow through the valves. Pericardial effusion can also be detected with high sensitivity by ECHO. Radiograph of chest is very helpful in the assessment of the status of pulmonary parenchyma & vasculature and presence of pleural effusion.

Two models were used to study the effects of Spirulina Platensis on nociception which was induced by acetic acid (Writhing test). formalin (Paw licking test). Spirulina Platensis was administered in the dose range of 200 and 400 mg/kg orally 1 h prior to pain induction. Spirulina Platensis contains β-carotene and biliproteins (phycocyanin and biliphycocyanin). Oral administration of Spirulina Platensis revealed dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in all the models for antinociception and it blocked both the neurogenic and inflammatory pain and the nociceptive activity was comparable with the reference drug. The results indicate that 400 mg/kg dose of Spirulina Platensis showed significant antinociceptive activity. The activity can be related with the significant biliprotein such as phycocyanin and biliphycocyanin that have potent anti-oxidant activity.INTRODUCTION: Pain is sensiorial modality. which in many cases represents the only symptom for diagnosis of several diseases.

73386,Delay-aware load balanced routing protocol for IEEE 802.16 wireless mesh networks,2012,Sanjeev Jain and Vijay Shanker Tripathi and Sudarshan Tiwari,9,International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI),6,421,International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI),In IEEE 802.16 Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) routing. delay aware load balancing can be achieved by selecting the shortest path with low latency and network load. But network load and latency together are not considered in most of the existing routing metrics. Here. we propose a delay aware load balanced routing protocol for wireless mesh networks by designing a combined route metric. Initially. we calculate the metric of traffic interference (TIM) which considers the traffic load of interfering neighbors. Next. we calculate the metric for end to end service delay (EDM) by using the expected time spent in transmitting all packets waiting for transmission through a link. This metric can be used to select the path with the lowest end-to-end service delay in terms of current network load. Using these two metrics we define a combined route metric for efficient route selection. A route discovery mechanism is proposed which broadcasts request packets along with expected link delay and load value. The suitable path is selected based upon the least routing metric value. A route maintenance mechanism is also proposed to maintain the stability of the network. Using this. frequent changes in the path can be avoided and transmission efficiency is increased. By simulation results. we show that the proposed protocol reduces the delay and overhead there by increasing the overall packet delivery ratio. when compared with existing protocols.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:twffdjNOitAC,2,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25776745.pdf,17718990184789794311,/scholar?cites=17718990184789794311,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/25776745.pdf,0,0,0

To investigate the failure process of the landslide. the slope was modelled along two different profiles using a finite element package PHASE2 based on a 2-dimensional elasto-plastic model for calculating stresses and displacements. The material properties for different layers on the slope were chosen from the laboratory test results of soil samples and available literature. Shear Strength Reduction (SSR) analysis was performed to determine the critical Strength Reduction Factor (SRF). It is observed that the critical SRF is 0.54 for left flank and 0.53 for right flank slope profiles. This indicates that the slope is highly unstable. The results show very good correlation with the observed field conditions. The locations of the landslide scars. from where the sliding processes have already been initiated. match exactly with the FE analysis result. The plane of sliding is observed to be the boundary between the bedrock and the highly weathered disintegrated dolomitic soil. A model to predict the progressive failure mechanism of the western flank of the landslide has also been attempted. After sliding of the material from the toe portion. the result of the FE analysis showed the probable location of 2nd phase of detachment and with further sliding the final phase of detachment was obtained.

73395,Stability-indicating RP-HPLC method for analysis of Fenofibrate in the bulk drug and in a pharmaceutical dosage form,2011,Nilesh Jain and Ruchi Jain and Surendra Jain and Deepak Kumar Jain,10,Journal of Pharmaceutical Research,1,16-20,,A novel stability-indicating RP-HPLC method has been developed and validated for quantitative analysis of fenofibrate in the bulk drug and in a pharmaceutical dosage form. Use of a 250 mm× 4.6 mm. 5μm particle. C18 column with 95: 05% v/v acetonitrile and acetate buffer pH 5.0 as isocratic mobile phase enabled separation of the drug from its degradation products. UV detection was performed at 268 nm. The method was validated for linearity. accuracy (recovery). precision. specificity. and robustness. The linearity of the method was satisfactory over the range 10-50 μgmL-1 (correlation coefficient 0.9997). The limits of detection and quantification were 0.011 and 0.043 μgmL-1. respectively. Recovery of fenofibrate from the pharmaceutical dosage form ranged from 100.6 to 104.1%. Fenofibrate was subjected to stress conditions (hydrolysis (acid. base). oxidation. photolysis. and thermal degradation) and the samples were analyzed by this method. The substance was unstable in basic conditions. The drug was stable under the other stress conditions investigated. The degradation products were well resolved from main peak. The forced degradation study prove the stability indicating power of the method and therefore. the validated method may be useful for routine analysis of fenofibrate as bulk drug. in respective dosage forms. for dissolution studies and as stability indicating assay method in pharmaceutical laboratories and industries.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:B4wWq2ztVNgC,2,http://journalofpharmaceuticalresearch.org/index.php/kpc/article/view/89032,5028883064282177846,/scholar?cites=5028883064282177846,,http://journalofpharmaceuticalresearch.org/index.php/kpc/article/viewFile/89032/67711,0,0,0

The present paper utilizes this technique to monitor the hydrolytic degradation of metronidazole and its prodrug with ciprofloxacin. ie 2-(2-methyl-5-nitroimidazol-1-yl) ethyl-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1. 4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-quinoline-3-carboxylate. The synthesis of the present mutual prodrug was envisaged to combine the antiprotozoal and anaerobic antibacterial effects of metronidazole with antibacterial effects of ciprofloxacin. Heat flux microcalorimeter was used to determine the rate of heat evolved during the degradation of the drug and prodrug as a function of concentration. pH and temperature. In terms of enthalpy of hydrolysis the response is exothermic both for drug and prodrug. However. the absolute value of the enthalpy of reaction (ΔrH0) is low for the prodrug. The degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics. showed marked stability at pH 3-7 followed by accelerated hydrolysis at higher pH. characteristic of general acid-base catalysis. The catalytic rate constant for hydrogen ion (kH) and hydroxyl ion (kOH) were found to be 0.413 and 526.1 M-1 h-1. respectively. at 318.15 K. The hydrolysis of the prodrug was found to be approximately 50-60 times faster than that of the drug. This may be attributed to the fact that hydrolysis of ester group in prodrug is assisted by keto group on the ciprofloxacin.

All subjects underwent 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in a fasting state. Samples for glucose (0. 30. 60. 90 & 120 min) and insulin (0 & 120 min) were withdrawn. Assessment of insulin resistance was carried out by Insulin suppression test (Modified Harano's method) ie simultaneous infusion of glucose as 20% dextrose@ 6 mg/kg/min and plain human insulin@ 50 mU/kg/hr. Steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) and steady state plasma insulin (SSSI) of 120-150 min of infusion were determined. Metabolic clearance rate for glucose (MCR) calculated as rate of glucose infusion/SSPG and insulin clearance rate (ICR) as rate of insulin infusion/SSSI. Lower the MCR and ICR. higher is the state of IR. Correlations of MCR and ICR with various clinical and metabolic variables were then studied. The result of present study suggests that cirrhosis is an insulin resistant state with low clearance rates for glucose and insulin. significant higher levels of glucose and insulin in postprandial state and markedly low levels of lipids. The state of insulin resistance is independent of severity of hepatic decompensation as classified by Child-Pugh's classification. etiology. nutritional status. clinical state. liver function tests and serum lipids.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:iomT83CKXisC,2,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.607.1209&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1300701075088936734,/scholar?cites=1300701075088936734,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.607.1209&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

73423,Antimalarial activity of a new herbal formulation,2005,SK Jain and HR Chitme,67,Indian journal of pharmaceutical sciences,1,101,OMICS International,Malaria is recognized as a highly widespread infectious disease of world caused by sporozoa of genus Plasmodium. Most antimalarial drugs were developed on the basis of their action against asexual erythrocytic forms of malaria parasites. which are responsible for the clinical illness. More recently. chloroquine-resistant strains of P. vivax also have been reported. Practical. effective and safe drugs. insecticides and vaccines still are needed to combat malaria. The object of the present study was to develop a more effective. scientific-based herbal formulation by using traditional medicines. The screening was done by Peter's 4 day test by means of parasite counts. There was no parasitaemia from 15th day post infection in both drug treated animals. All animals were found infection free and healthy. The preliminary pharmacological studies revealed that the prepared formulation possesses promising antimalarial activity justifying its use for the management of malarial infections.,True,6be7CWoAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC,2,https://www.ijpsonline.com/abstract/antimalarial-activity-of-a-new-herbal-formulation-439.html,17689870579935932635,/scholar?cites=17689870579935932635,,https://www.ijpsonline.com/articles/antimalarial-activity-of-a-new-herbal-formulation.pdf,0,0,0

A study was undertaken in African marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) to identify the suitable storage environment for ex-situ conservation of seeds and the factors responsible for the longevity of the stored seeds. The present study suggested that size of achene be an important attribute to estimate the health and quality of seed lots in marigold. The seed deteriorate with increase in storage period and moisture content. Seed leachate conductivity was not found to be a good indicator of viability loss when seed was stored at low temperature. Seeds can be dried up to 1.5% moisture content without loosing viability. However. seed moisture content between 3-6% is safe for long-term storage at low temperature (−20°C).

PRP should have a platelet concentration of 500% above whole blood levels. as it is this concentration which has been shown to enhance bone and soft tissue healing. Objectives: To prepare PRP in a general purpose centrifuge and assess its platelet count and growth factor levels. Methods: 14 subjects with chronic periodontitis needing open flap debridement surgery. Prior to surgery 30 ml of the patient's blood was obtained by venipuncture and this was processed in a general purpose centrifuge (Beckman J6 MI. Florida. USA). Whole blood was centrifuged at a first spin of 700 rpm (120G) for 20 minutes and this separated the red blood cells from the plasma. This plasma was centrifuged again at 1750 rpm (800G) for 15 minutes to yield 3 ml of PRP at the bottom with platelet poor plasma (PPP) at the top. Growth factor analyses for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-AB) and transforming growth factor (TGFβ1) in the PRP were performed as per standard protocol using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: The mean platelet count was 1144140"" 573020/μl which represented an increase of 596% above baseline (p< 0.001).

Among radionuclides used in radiopharmaceuticals 99mTc plays an important role in widespread applications. The preeminence of 99mTc is attributable to its optimal nuclear properties of a short half-life and a gamma photon emission of 140 keV. which is suitable for high-efficiency detection and which results in low radiation exposure to the patient. Radionuclides in nuclear medicine are all synthetic and fall into four categories namely. generator produced. thermal neutron reactor produced. cyclotron produced and pile produced. Radiopharmaceuticals undergo a very lengthy and expensive regulatory process as well as extensive chemical and physical testing (pH. isotonicity and chemical parameters) to insure that the final product is sterile. pyrogen free. safe for human use and is efficacious. These include both animal and human studies prior to release of the product for sale. Clinical application of radioactive diagnostic and therapeutic agents constitutes one of the great advances in nuclear medicine. Various radiopharmaceuticals have been applied clinically in the diagnosis of various malignant and benign conditions.

In such cases. techniques for statistical analysis are summoned to make inferences about the behavior of the variables.Statistics deals with methods to draw inferences about the properties of a population based on sample data from that population. Population refers to a collection of objects. It can be finite or infinite. for example. the collection of all flow data of a river at a given site.
