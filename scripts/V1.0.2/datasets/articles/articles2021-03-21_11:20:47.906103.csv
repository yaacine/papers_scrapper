Low energy photoelectrons are measured using a hemispherical electron energy analyzer with an imaging detector that allows us to detect the energy and the angular distributions of the photoelectrons simultaneously. A Mach–Zehnder interferometer was built for the time-resolved 2PPE (TR-2PPE) measurement to study ultrafast surface excited electron dynamics. which was demonstrated on the Cu (111) surface. A scheme for measuring time-dependent 2PPE (TD-2PPE) spectra has also been developed for studies of surface photochemistry.

These measurements show that energy dissipation pathways involving nonadiabatic conversion of vibrational energy to electronic energy can result in electronic excitation of more than 3 eV. consistent with the available vibrational energy. We measured the dependence of the electron energy distributions on the translational and vibrational energy of the incident NO and find a clear positive correlation between final electron kinetic energy and initial vibrational excitation and a weak but observable inverse dependence of electron kinetic energy on initial translational energy.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) show excellent promise as plasmonic catalysts. Plasmonic materials have localized surface plasmon resonances. oscillations of the electron bath at the surface of a nanoparticle. that generate energetically intense electric fields which rapidly decay into energetically excited electrons. The excited electrons have the potential to destabilize atoms strongly bound to the catalysts through occupation of antibonding orbitals. Tuning the antibonding orbitals to make them accessible for occupancy by electrons is achieved by coating the AuNP in a thin layer of another transition metal. such as ruthenium. silver. or platinum. creating a bimetallic nanoparticle. We will initially study carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation in the presence of ruthenium-gold bimetallic nanoparticles (RuAuNPs). as CO oxidation is a well modeled system. Carbon and oxygen atoms are strongly bound in CO molecules and the bond between oxygen and ruthenium is typically strong. inhibiting reaction rates. Excited electrons from the AuNPs can transfer to the oxygen-ruthenium antibonding orbital and weaken the bond and making the atomic oxygen more reactive.

1179923,Investigating the Interactions Between Individual Calmodulin and HIV-1 Protein Domains,2020,Riley K Kendall and Jerry LaRue,,,,,,The World Health Organization found that 37.9 million people were living with HIV by the end of 2018. HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system through viral replication and the destruction of CD4+ T-cells. which are white blood cells that detect infection and make antibodies. A cure for HIV has not yet been discovered. HIV-1 contains a Gag polyprotein which regulates the stages of viral replication. Previous studies suggest that the myristoyl group of a matrix protein peptide found on the Gag polyprotein. MA. forms a complex with a calcium-binding. multifunctional regulatory protein called Calmodulin (CaM). CaM has also been found to be upregulated upon HIV infection. The MA/CaM complex induces extended conformation and causes a decrease in the compact structure of MA. which is predicted to impact the accessibility of interaction sites within MA and lead to rapid HIV viral production. Through hindering the myristoyl group on MA. it is possible that production of HIV can be greatly decreased. Before exploring this possibility. it is first necessary that the site and mechanism of the protein-protein interaction is identified and understood. For this reason. our lab is investigating the interactions of the independent N-terminal and C-terminal domains of MA and CaM. The MA protein has tryptophan-containing helices on its domains which allows for quantification using fluorescence spectroscopy and anisotropy. By investigating each protein domain and tryptophan signal separately. the location where binding occurs can be isolated and it can be determined if the interaction of one CaM or MA domain is required. or a prerequisite. for the …,True,dVNM3lwAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,0,https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cusrd_abstracts/383/,,,,,0,0,0

PD is prevalent in males and is typically seen in patients in their 60s. The most notable symptom of PD is the degeneration of neuronal control. especially in the hands. Over $156 million is spent on researching this disease and about $25 billion is spent for diagnosed patients each year. Aside from managing the financial burdens of PD. patients also have physical burdens. Most patients develop tremors and have difficulties writing. eating. and can degenerate quickly. The PD has previously been attributed to the lack of the neurotransmitter. dopamine. in the patient’s brain; however recent biochemical studies have surfaced other biomolecular mechanisms that attribute to PD. such as the interaction between Calmodulin and α-Synuclein. Calmodulin (CaM) is a protein found in the brain of healthy patients and is an intermediate calcium (Ca 2+) binding messenger with over 100 different targets in eukaryotic cells. α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a protein found at the ends of neurons in the presynaptic terminals in healthy patients. suggesting involvement with neurotransmitter signaling. however the exact function of α-Syn is still under investigation. Recent studies show that α-Syn and CaM interact resulting in protein aggregation. The α-Syn aggregation is the main structural component of Lewy bodies which is enhanced in the presence of Ca 2+.

Functionalized fullerenes. such as polyhydroxy fullerenes (PHF. fullerols. or fullerenols). have attracted particular attention due to their water solubility and toxicity. Here. we report surprisingly beneficial and/or specific effects of PHF on model organisms representing four kingdoms. including the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. the fungus Aspergillus niger. and the invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia. The results showed that PHF had no acute or chronic negative effects on the freshwater organisms. Conversely. PHF could surprisingly increase the algal culture density over controls at higher concentrations (i.e.. 72% increase by 1 and 5 mg/L of PHF) and extend the lifespan and stimulate the reproduction of Daphnia (e.g. about 38% by 20 mg/L of PHF). We also show that at certain PHF concentrations fungal growth can be enhanced and Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings exhibit longer hypocotyls. while other complex physiological processes remain unaffected. These findings may open new research fields in the potential applications of PHF. e.g.. in biofuel production and aquaculture.

1180147,Photo-degradation of methyl orange with direct solar light using znoand activated carbon-supported Zno,2009,Hikmat S Hilal and Ghazi YM Nour and Ahed Zyoud,,"Water Purification. Novascience Pub, NY",,,,ZnO is a wide band gap (3.2 eV) semiconductor. with limited photo-catalytic applications to shorter wavelengths only. However. it is suitable to use in solar light photo-degradation of different contaminants. due to a number of reasons. taking into account that the reaching-in solar radiation contains only a tail in the near UV region. The high absorptivity of ZnO makes it efficient photo-catalyst under direct solar light. Moreover. it is relatively safe. abundant and non costly. In this chapter. ZnO has been investigated as a potential catalyst for photo-degradation of methyl orange (a known dye) in aqueous solutions with direct natural solar light under different conditions. The major aim was to assess the efficiency and stability of ZnO under photo-electrochemical (PEC) conditions. and to suggest techniques to enhance such features. This will shed light on the future applicability of ZnO as a candidate for economic and friendly processes in water purification.Recovery of ZnO particles. after reaction completion. has been facilitated by supporting ZnO onto activated carbon. to yield AC/ZnO system. The AC/ZnO was used as catalyst for contaminant photo-degradation in water solutions under direct solar light. Both catalytic systems. naked ZnO and AC/ZnO. were highly efficient in degrading both contaminants. reaching complete removal in reasonable times. The latter system showed higher efficiency. In both systems. the reaction goes faster with higher catalyst loading. until a maximum efficiency is reached at a certain concentration. after which the catalyst concentration did not show a systematic effect.,True,0AGPQMgAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,20,https://www.academia.edu/download/41540741/Why_Vapor_Pressure_of_a_Volatile_Liquid_20160125-26048-1t4kx48.pdf,16724847219390708281,/scholar?cites=16724847219390708281,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41540741/Why_Vapor_Pressure_of_a_Volatile_Liquid_20160125-26048-1t4kx48.pdf,0,0,0

Photodegradation of water organic contaminants by semiconductors is a safe and non-costly method. In photodegradation. the organic contaminant is completely mineralized with radiation and oxygen using stable semiconductor nanoparticles as photocatalysts.

Like other organic contaminants. it is necessary to find safe and economic methods to remove them from the water. In this work. anthocyanin was used as a natural dye sensitizer for the wide band gap nanosize rutile TiO2. The TiO2/Anthocyanin particles were supported on activated carbon particle surfaces. The resulting composite. which was prepared and characterized by different methods. was then used as a catalyst in the photodegradation of phenazopyridine (a model pharmaceutical contaminant) under a solar simulated light. Depending on experimental conditions. up to 90% of the contaminant was mineralized leaving no new organic products in the reaction mixture. The results show the feasibility of using the activated carbon-supported TiO2/Anthocyanin photocatalyst for pharmaceutical contaminant removal in water. The natural dye anthocyanin readily sensitized the TiO2 to visible light. The unsupported TiO2. with its nanosize particles. was not easy to recover by simple separation methods. while the activated carbon-supported catalyst was easily isolated by decantation after reaction cessation. Moreover. the recovered AC/TiO2 catalyst could also be regenerated by adding fresh anthocyanin sensitizer after recovery for further reuse.

X-ray diffractometry and a kinetic analysis. The results indicated that WO3 is completely reduced to W° near 800 °C. via the formation of WO2.72 (at 520 °C) and WO2 (at 600 °C) as intermediate products.

The branch points were produced by incorporating a styryl dithioate ester (a RAFT monomer). The inclusion of AMMA ensures that the polymers fluoresce in the blue region so that they can be visualized in cells in culture. The feed composition was designed to provide lower critical solution temperatures (LCST) between 30 and 37 °C. and therefore the polymers are above the LCST at the usual temperature for culture of human cells. Inclusion of 1.2 propandiol-3-methacrylate (GMA) results in the formation of stable aggregates above the LCST rather than flocculated masses of polymer. and these colloidally stable sub-micron particles can undergo phagocytosis into human dermal fibroblasts.

Topologically open microgels composed of water swollen highly branched polymers prepared from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) were modified with a cell-adhesive peptide (GRGDS) to produce particles for gently detaching and then transferring cultured cells to new substrates. The particles bind to cell surface integrins on both dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells and at temperatures above the lower critical solution temperature (34 °C) remove cells from their normal culture substrates. Brief (45 min) cooling of the resultant particle–cell dispersion to beneath 34 °C releases the cells to grow on new substrates.

Here. we have successfully combined a new class of non-biological binder molecules with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-based sensor detection for direct. label-free detection of Gram-positive bacteria making use of the specific coil-to-globule conformation change of the vancomycin-modified highly branched polymers immobilized on the surface of gold screen-printed electrodes upon binding to Gram-positive bacteria. Staphylococcus carnosus was detected after just 20 min incubation of the sample solution with the polymer-functionalized electrodes. The polymer conformation change was quantified with two simple 1 min EIS tests before and after incubation with the sample. Tests revealed a concentration dependent signal change within an OD 600 range of Staphylococcus carnosus from 0.002 to 0.1 and a clear discrimination between Gram-positive Staphylococcus carnosus and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria. This exhibits a clear advancement in terms of simplified test complexity compared to existing bacteria detection tests.

Because platelets do not have a nucleus. proteomics constitutes an optimal approach to follow platelet molecular events associated with the onset of the acute episode.  Methodology/Principal Findings We performed the first high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteome analysis of circulating platelets from patients with non-ST segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and validations were by western blotting. Forty protein features (corresponding to 22 unique genes) were found to be differentially regulated between NSTE-ACS patients and matched controls with chronic ischemic cardiopathy. The number of differences decreased at day 5 (28) and 6 months after the acute event (5). Interestingly. a systems biology approach demonstrated that 16 of the 22 differentially regulated proteins identified are interconnected as part of a common network related to cell assembly and organization and cell morphology. processes very related to platelet activation. Indeed. 14 of those proteins are either signaling or cytoskeletal. and nine of them are known to participate in platelet activation by αIIbβ3 and/or GPVI receptors. Several of the proteins identified participate in platelet activation through post-translational modifications. as shown here for ILK. Src and Talin. Interestingly. the platelet-secreted glycoprotein SPARC was down-regulated in NSTE-ACS patients compared to stable controls. which is consistent with a secretion process from activated platelets.

Proteomic studies in legumes have increased significantly in the last years but few studies have been performed to date in P. vulgaris. We report here a proteomic analysis of bean seeds by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE).

The mechanism of propagation of these infectious agents will not be understood until their structure is solved. Given that high resolution techniques such as NMR or X-ray crystallography cannot be used. a number of lower resolution analytical approaches have been attempted. Thus. limited proteolysis has been successfully used to pinpoint flexible regions within prion multimers (PrPSc). However. the presence of covalently attached sugar antennae and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moieties makes mass spectrometry-based analysis impractical. In order to surmount these difficulties we analyzed PrPSc from transgenic mice expressing prion protein (PrP) lacking the GPI membrane anchor. Such animals produce prions that are devoid of the GPI anchor and sugar antennae. and. thereby. permit the detection and location of flexible. proteinase K (PK) susceptible regions by Western blot and mass spectrometry-based analysis. GPI-less PrPSc samples were digested with PK. PK-resistant peptides were identified. and found to correspond to molecules cleaved at positions 81. 85. 89. 116. 118. 133. 134. 141. 152. 153. 162. 169 and 179. The first 10 peptides (to position 153). match very well with PK cleavage sites we previously identified in wild type PrPSc. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the structure of PrPSc consists of a series of highly PK-resistant β-sheet strands connected by short flexible PK-sensitive loops and turns. A sizeable C-terminal stretch of PrPSc is highly resistant to PK and therefore perhaps also contains β-sheet secondary …,True,-sVylnQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050111,3715957686706184336,/scholar?cites=3715957686706184336,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050111,0,0,0

Prehramheno-Biotehnoloski Fakultet,Phaseolin is the major seed storage protein of common bean. It comprises a complex set of glycoproteins heterogeneous in their polypeptide composition that is encoded by a gene family. Analyses of phaseolin banding patterns by one-dimensional electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) have been central to the current understanding of the diversity of wild and cultivated common beans. In this work. we have carried out a detailed description and interpretation of phaseolin diversity in cultivated common beans of different geographic origins (Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools) based on the current two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technology and mass spectrometry (MS). High-quality 2-DE gel images revealed very complex phaseolin patterns across the studied cultivars. Specifically. patterns of phaseolin within cultivars were organized in a horizontal string of multiple isospot pairs varying in isoelectric point and molecular mass. The degree of similarity among phaseolin patterns was estimated from the percentage of spots shared between pairs of cultivars. Analyses of proteomic distances between phaseolin types by non-metrical multidimensional scaling revealed that 2-DE phaseolin profiles are more similar among cultivars belonging to the same gene pool. However. higher differentiation was found among cultivars of the Andean gene pool. Analysis of genetic variations of the PCR-based SCAR marker of phaseolin seed protein was in general agreement with 2-DE phaseolin patterns. but provided supplementary information regarding diversity among cultivars.

Thus. study of DISC1 may provide a clue to understand the biology of major mental illness. A neuropeptide precursor VGF has potent antidepressant effects and has been reportedly associated with bipolar disorder. Here we show that DISC1 knockdown leads to a reduction of VGF. in neurons. VGF is also downregulated in the cortices from sporadic cases with major mental disease. A positive correlation of VGF single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with social anhedonia was also observed.

However. the caspase-dependent regulation of intestinal stem cell properties remains poorly understood. Here. we demonstrate that Dronc. the Drosophila ortholog of caspase-9/2 in mammals. limits the proliferation of intestinal progenitor cells and prevents the premature differentiation of enteroblasts into enterocytes. Strikingly. these unexpected roles of Dronc are non-apoptotic and have been uncovered under experimental conditions without basal epithelial turnover. A novel set of genetic tools have also allowed us to correlate these Dronc functions with its specific accumulation and transient activation in enteroblasts. Finally. we establish that the Dronc-dependent regulation of enteroblast quiescence. largely relies on the fine-tuning of the Notch and Insulin-TOR signalling pathways. Together. this data provides novel insights into the caspase-dependent but non-apoptotic modulation of enteroblast differentiation in non-regenerative conditions.

Indeed β-CD and its derivatives have been widely used in the formulation of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals despite their poor abilities to act as a molecular container (e.g.. weak binding (Ka<104 M−1) and their challenges toward chemical functionalization. Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) are a class of molecular containers that bind to a variety of cationic and neutral species with high affinity (Ka>104 M−1) and therefore show great promise as a drug delivery system.  Methodology In this study we investigated the toxicology. uptake. and bioactivity of two cucurbit[n]urils (CB[5] and CB[7]) and three CB[n]-type containers (Pentamer 1. methyl hexamer 2. and phenyl hexamer 3). All five containers demonstrated high cell tolerance at concentrations of up to 1 mM in cell lines originating from kidney. liver or blood tissue using assays for metabolic activity and cytotoxicity. Furthermore. the CB[7] molecular container was efficiently internalized by macrophages indicating their potential for the intracellular delivery of drugs. Bioactivity assays showed that the first-line tuberculosis drug. ethambutol. was as efficient in treating mycobacteria infected macrophages when loaded into CB[7] as when given in the unbound form. This result suggests that CB[7]-bound drug molecules can be released from the container to find their intracellular target.

CIPS is based on the crystallisation of calcite within pores and on the surfaces of constituent sand/silt grains so that the grains become strongly cemented but pores essentially remain open. This calcite cement crystallises from a proprietary solution which is permeated into the material. Because it is a non-particulate. low viscosity. water-based solution multiple permeations are possible. Mechanical strength is significantly increased with each injection but porosity is reduced only slightly. Improvements in the mechanical properties of calcareous and silica sands treated with CIPS have been demonstrated by a variety of laboratory tests including unconfined compressive strength (UCS). direct shear and triaxial tests.

The ODN2 in this duplex is selected to be longer than the ODN1. Therefore. in the presence of a nucleic acid (analyte). which is fully complementary to the ODN2 strand. the duplex is decomposed with formation of an analyte/ODN2∼Q duplex and a catalytically active. single stranded PS∼ODN1. In this way the catalytic activity of the PS can be controlled by the specific nucleic acids. We applied this reaction earlier for the amplified detection of ribonucleic acids in live cells (Arian.

By using a recently developed fluorogenic endoperoxide (EP) probe. we confirmed that during the aging process the amount of EPs on the oxo‐G surface is reduced. Furthermore. aging was found to strongly affect cell membrane carrier properties of this material.

It was shown that cerium may be extracted from the spent polishing slurries by leaching with strong mineral acids in the presence of reducing agents; the solution may be used directly for the preparation of a ceria-based reactive sorbent. A mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide was effective in the digestion of partially dewatered glass-polishing slurry. After the removal of undissolved particles. cerous carbonate was precipitated by gaseous NH3 and CO2. Cerium oxide was prepared by a thermal decomposition of the carbonate precursor in an open crucible and tested as reactive sorbent for the degradation of highly toxic organophosphate compounds. The samples annealed at the optimal temperature of approximately 400°C exhibited a good degradation efficiency toward the organophosphate pesticide fenchlorphos and the nerve agents soman and VX.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this effect but there is still much discrepancy. Aiming for the rationalization of the effects of these structural features on the properties of imidazolium ILs. we present a thermodynamic and computational study of two methylated ILs at the C2 position of imidazolium.

As expected the higher vibrational contribution of the –CF2– groups contributes for the higher heat capacities of the perfluorinated compounds. Concerning the fusion/sublimation equilibria. fluorination of the alcohols decreases ΔH and ΔS of phase transitions. Compared to the regular –CH2– alkyl chain structure. the less symmetric –CF2– spiral conformation is characterized by a less efficient molecular alignment in crystal packing. thus explaining the lower ΔH.

The activation energies of the individual oligomerization stages are a few hundred kilojoules per mole. which prevent efficient adenine synthesis in interstellar space or in the atmosphere of Titan. On the other hand. when the oligomerizations start from HCNH+. the activation energies of sequential HCN or HNC additions are significantly reduced. Kinetic analyses results suggest that adenine synthesis by proton-catalyzed oligomerizations cannot occur efficiently in interstellar space or in the atmosphere of Titan. even though some oligomerization stages can occur under the latter condition.

Al–1%Si (Al(Si)). 99.99% Al (Al(4N)) and 99.999% Al (Al(5N)). SEM images showed that a uniform Zn layer was deposited on Al(Cu) and Al(Si) but not on Al(4N) or Al(5N) after the double zincate process. Immersion potential during the zincate process indicated that the duration of substitution reaction of Zn deposition and Al dissolution on Al(Cu) was shorter than that on the other alloys. These results suggest that a small amount of Cu increases the efficiency of the zincate process and the density of Zn deposition.

There are many sources to share the information but instant chat messengers and social networking websites are the quick and easy means to share anything. Sometimes. even news stories are initially broken up on social media sites and further on chat messengers instead of any news channel and newspaper etc. Due to these technology advancements. some people are misusing these instant chat messengers to share suspicious activities and make plans to do something suspicious. This kind of chat is mainly available in textual format. In this paper. a social graph based concept is used to identify suspicious terms. chat sessions and users. Here. users are considered as nodes and the relation of user with any chat log is considered as edge of the graph. In this process. Support Vector Machine is used to identify & classify the suspicious key terms. Apriori algorithm is used for the social graph generation. Suspiciousness of any chat group can be predicted based on the support & confidence level of Apriori algorithm. Experiment results are evaluated in order to identify suspicious key terms. key users and key sessions. Also the weightage of key terms. key user score and normalized score has been evaluated.

The flooded environment is lethal for most plant species because it restricts gas exchange and induces an energy and carbon crisis. Flooding survival strategies have been studied in Oryza sativa. a cultivated monocot. However. our understanding of plant adaptation to natural flood-prone environments remains scant. even though wild plants represent a valuable resource of tolerance mechanisms that could be used to generate stress-tolerant crops.

Recent efforts have focused on preventing cancer cell proliferation associated with glutamine addiction by targeting glutaminase using the inhibitor BPTES (bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1.3.4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide). In the current study. an investigation of the BPTES induced changes in metabolism was made in two human breast cancer cell lines. MCF7 (an estrogen receptor dependent cell line) and MDA-MB231 (a triple negative cell line). relative to the non-cancerous cell line. MCF10A. NMR spectroscopy combined with a recently established smart-isotope tagging approach enabled quantitative analysis of 41 unique metabolites representing numerous metabolite classes including carbohydrates. amino acids. carboxylic acids and nucleotides. BPTES induced metabolism changes in the cancer cell lines were especially pronounced under hypoxic conditions with up to 1/3 of the metabolites altered significantly (p<0.05) relative to untreated cells. The BPTES induced changes were more pronounced for MCF7 cells. with 14 metabolites altered significantly (p<0.05) compared to seven for MDA-MB231.

Metabolic changes during senescence can provide detailed information on cellular status and may also have implications for the development of effective treatment strategies. The metabolic response to Adriamycin (ADR) treatment. which causes senescence as well as cell death. was obtained with the aid of metabolic profiling and isotope tracing in two human breast cancer cell lines. MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. After 5 days of ADR treatment. more than 60% of remaining. intact cells entered into a senescent state. characterized by enlarged and flattened morphology and positive blue staining using SA-β-gal. Metabolic trajectory analysis showed that the two cell lines’ responses were significantly different and were divided into two distinct stages. The metabolic shift from the first stage to the second was reflected by a partial recovery of the TCA cycle. as well as amino acid and lipid metabolisms. Isotope tracing analysis indicated that the higher level of glutamine metabolism helped maintain senescence. The results suggest that the dynamic changes during senescence indicate a multi-step process involving important metabolic pathways which might allow breast cancer cells to adapt to persistent ADR treatment. while the higher level of anapleurosis may be important for maintaining the senescent state. Ultimately. a better understanding of metabolic changes during senescence might provide targets for cancer therapy and tumor eradication.

M202 and the submergence tolerant cv. M202(Sub1) during and after submergence stress.  This work uses multiple analytical techniques. including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). and reversed-phase ion-pair ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (RPIP-UPLC-MS) to explore the metabolite profiles of the tolerant and intolerant rice varieties in response to abiotic stress. Untargeted metabolomics was used to query the metabolic impact of submergence on the tolerant and intolerant rice varieties.  In results obtained by both NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS. the metabolic profiles of the two varieties diverged as early as 1 d of submergence.  Using both techniques. the tolerant variety was shown to significantly conserve carbohydrate resources.  A comparison of the NMR and GC-MS results demonstrated that multiple analytical techniques provide the best metabolite coverage.  Additionally. a previously unreported NMR resonance was identified as belonging to the methyl protons of the dipeptide alanylglycine (AlaGly).  Although the metabolic function of the dipeptide is unclear. AlaGly was the only metabolite to decrease during submergence and not recover during the 1 d recovery period.

A low-temperature solution-based alternative has been developed. and this strategy exploits the enhanced reactivity of nanoparticles and the nanometer diffusion distances afforded by binary nanocomposite precursors. Prereduced metal nanoparticles are combined in known ratios. and they form nanomodulated composites that rapidly transform into intermetallics and alloys upon heating at low temperatures. The approach is general in terms of accessible compositions. structures. and morphologies. Multiple compounds in the same binary system can be readily accessed; e.g.. AuCu. AuCu3.

The spherical aggregates. which generally have diameters between 10 and 100 nm. are built from smaller 1−3 nm Rh particles. The dense nanostructures are thermally stable beyond 100 °C. and they have a tendency to form ordered superstructures upon drying. Combining sodium n-dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with PVP modifies the size and morphology of the primary 1−3 nm particles. but does not change the spherical shape of the aggregates except at high concentrations of SDS. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements show that the large aggregates are formed directly in solution from small Rh particles. consistent with TEM and AFM results.

The approach involves the rapid settling and dewetting of suspensions of spherical colloids on lithographically templated surfaces. Using this method. we can quickly and easily fabricate close-packed colloidal crystal microarrays of both silica and polystyrene spheres that range in size from 500 nm to 4.5 μm. The microarrays tend to induce the formation of monolayer colloidal crystals. which can be interconnected and removed from the templates as free-standing colloidal crystal slabs. The same approach can also be used to assemble two-dimensional colloidal crystal superlattices that can adopt a variety of structures.

This type of restoration treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach in order to respect the mandatory experimental protocols: the assessment of the conservation state. developing the cleaning solutions by applying washing tests. that are compatible with the nature of the dirt deposits and with the original materials. and finally the monitoring of interventions through appropriate selection of methods and interdisciplinary techniques of scientific investigation. Cleaning interventions that require organic solvents are highly toxic for the operator. and that is why nowadays. traditional cleaning processes that make use of plant extracts and aqueous extracts of plants are studied more and more. Also. because the cleaning process touches the integrity of the noble patina. and in cases of surfaces that are gilded directly on the ground layer (boles) or on other painting layers. that act differently upon wash. there is the risk of exudates. of advanced softening of the painting layer. of peeling the gilded areas. of material losses. of dirt and some color components getting scattered etc. Washing tests require mandatory differentiated protocols for the two gilding cases presented in the paper.

We used live-cell superresolution and light-sheet imaging to study the organization and dynamics of the Mediator coactivator and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) directly. Mediator and Pol II each form small transient and large stable clusters in living embryonic stem cells. Mediator and Pol II are colocalized in the stable clusters. which associate with chromatin. have properties of phase-separated condensates. and are sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors. We suggest that large clusters of Mediator. recruited by transcription factors at large or clustered enhancer elements. interact with large Pol II clusters in transcriptional condensates in vivo.,True,9V5rfIsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,438,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6400/412.abstract,3853523371890979504,/scholar?cites=3853523371890979504,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6543815/,0,0,0

However. the dynamic molecular processes involved make it difficult to correlate clustering with functional consequences in vivo. We developed a live-cell super-resolution approach to uncover the correlation between mRNA synthesis and the dynamics of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) clusters at a gene locus. For endogenous β-actin genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. we observe that short-lived (~8 s) Pol II clusters correlate with basal mRNA output. During serum stimulation. a stereotyped increase in Pol II cluster lifetime correlates with a proportionate increase in the number of mRNAs synthesized. Our findings suggest that transient clustering of Pol II may constitute a pre-transcriptional regulatory event that predictably modulates nascent mRNA output.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13617.001,True,9V5rfIsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,132,https://elifesciences.org/articles/13617,1991235204330302764,/scholar?cites=1991235204330302764,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/13617.pdf,0,0,0

Organized cellular DNA (chromatin) presents substantial barriers to such lengthy searches. Using dynamic single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer. we determined that the mismatch repair (MMR) initiation protein MutS forms a transient clamp that scans duplex DNA for mismatched nucleotides by 1D diffusion for 1 s (~ 700 base pairs) while in continuous rotational contact with the DNA. Mismatch identification provokes ATP binding (3 s) that induces distinctly different MutS sliding clamps with unusual stability on DNA (~ 600 s). which may be released by adjacent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).

The genetics and biophysical mechanism of mismatch repair (MMR) has been extensively studied since its discovery nearly 50 years ago. MMR is a strand-specific excision-resynthesis reaction that is initiated by MutS homolog (MSH) binding to the mismatched nucleotides. The MSH mismatch-binding signal is then transmitted to the immediate downstream MutL homolog (MLH/PMS) MMR components and ultimately to a distant strand scission site where excision begins. The mechanism of signal transmission has been controversial for decades. We have utilized single molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET).

Heavy enzymes (isotopically substituted) provide an experimental tool for bond-vibrational links to enzyme catalysis. A recent transition path sampling study with heavy purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) characterized the experimentally observed mass-dependent slowing of barrier crossing (Antoniou. D.; Ge. X.; Schramm. V. L.; Schwartz. S. D. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2012. 3. 3538). Here we computationally identify second-sphere amino acid residues predicted to influence the freedom of the catalytic site vibrational modes linked to heavy enzyme effects in PNP. We mutated heavy and light PNPs to increase the catalytic site vibrational freedom.

To investigate what positions on the DCI cyclohexanol ring may be amenable to modification to improve pharmaceutical formulations. a series of analogues based on DCI were synthesised. These compounds were then evaluated for their ability to stimulate glucose transport using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a model system. Positional analyses indicate that the hydroxyl group at position 1 is not essential for activity and can be modified without affecting glucose uptake. Removal of the hydroxyl at position 3 also had minimal effect on activity but this group is sensitive to modification.

CapLC–NMR relies on good capillary‐scale chromatography where highly concentrated peaks with a volume closely matched to the NMR flow cell are achievable.

Golden. CO (United States),Biomass gasification provides the potential to efficiently and economically produce a renewable source of a clean gaseous fuel suitable for power generation or synthesis gas (syngas) applications. Biomass as the feedstock for the process is uniquely suited to this application because it provides the means to increase the nations energy security. and also. to potentially provide a more stable agricultural industry. An important side benefit of the use of biomass is the effective minimization of the primary greenhouse gas. carbon dioxide (CO {sub 2}). by providing a means to close-loop the CO {sub 2} cycle. However. high molecular weight hydrocarbon constituents (tar) in the product gas from gasification can complicate the downstream uses of the gas.

1182390,Additives to prevent coking in ethylene furnaces,2009,Girish Srinivas and Jeffrey R Engel and Michael Karpuk and James Nabity and Steven Gebhard and David T Wickham,,"AIChE Spring Meeting, Tampa, FL, USA",,,,Coke formation in ethylene furnaces during naphtha cracking is produced by a mechanism in which the iron and nickel in the metal reactor walls catalyze the formation of graphitic carbon in the shape of long filaments. The formation of coke on the metal tube walls is thought to be a three step process where 1) hydrocarbons decompose on the hot metal surface. 2) carbon atoms diffuse into the metal lattice where they react with Fe and Ni forming metastable iron and nickel carbides. which then 3) decompose into graphitic carbon and metal according to C2H2n+ 2--> C+ Fe+ Ni--> Fe3C+ Ni3C--> Fe+ Ni+ graphite. The formation of graphitic carbon is a very strong thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Once graphitic carbon forms in the bulk metal. it creates pressure within crystal structure. causing some small metal particles to become dislodged. In the pyrolytic environment of the naphtha cracking process. the dislodged crystallites continue to catalyze carbon formation. sometimes forming a carbon filament on the back side of the metal particle. Understanding this mechanism for coke deposition is critical to identifying approaches for minimizing coking during naphtha cracking for ethylene production. TDA Research Inc. has identified several additives that block the formation of the metastable carbide intermediates by forming strong. thermally stable surface compounds upon which filamentous coke cannot form. These compounds are stable at temperatures in excess of 1000C (1832F). and in the case of one of our more recent formulations. also resists attack by sulfur.

A range of conventional management actions are available to reduce nutrient loss at source. and it is important to evaluate possible reductions. and costs. so that limited funds can be targeted to realise the greatest moderation of nutrient loss. A lumped landuse nutrient generation rate model was developed for four catchments (Wilson Inlet. Oyster Harbour. Torbay Inlet and Princess Royal Harbour) near Albany Western Australia and the output compared with existing monitoring data. The nutrient moderating effects of six conventional management actions (perennial pastures; vegetated stream buffers; minimum tillage. effective fertiliser use; stock control and water management; and effl uent management) and their associated costs were implemented at different levels in the model. These were used to determine the extent to which these actions could address offsite nutrient pollution. and the cost of doing so. Management actions were implemented in three major scenarios representing the status quo (current nutrient reduction efforts through volunteerism). the highest possible implementation of each action (perhaps indicating mandated change) and the most cost effective set of actions.

The first documented example of a coordination compound of alkenes is the air-stable Zeise’s salt. K [PtCl3 (ethene)]⋅ H2O [1]. Alkenes undergo significant structural changes upon coordination with a metal center: first. the C–C bond distance increases. which indicates a decrease in the bond order. Second. the C–H bonds are bent out of the C= C plane. which can be attributed to a deviation from the sp2 character of the carbon atoms. These structural changes are strictly related to the very nature of the bond between alkene and metal. which is based on the following aspects:(i) a partial donation of electrons from the π orbital of the olefin to an empty d orbital of the metal (σ-dative component); and (ii) a partial donation of electrons from ad …,True,smJBFkQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118860168#page=51,3677070214448483137,/scholar?cites=3677070214448483137,,,0,0,0

These kinetically challenging reactions are catalyzed exclusively by enzymes in the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily and have been grouped into four classes (A–D). Class B radical SAM (RS) methylases require a cobalamin cofactor in addition to the [4Fe-4S] cluster that is characteristic of RS enzymes. However. their poor solubility upon overexpression and their generally poor turnover has hampered detailed in vitro studies of these enzymes. It has been suggested that improper folding. possibly caused by insufficient cobalamin during their overproduction in Escherichia coli. leads to formation of inclusion bodies.

While the importance of the lignin matrix is well documented and the biosynthetic pathways for monolignols are known. the process by which lignin precursors or monolignols are transported and polymerized to form this matrix remains a subject of considerable debate. In this study. we have synthesized and tested an analog of coniferyl alcohol that has been modified to contain an ethynyl group at the C-3 position. This modification enables fluorescent tagging and imaging of this molecule after its incorporation into plant tissue by click chemistry-assisted covalent labeling with a fluorescent azide dye. and confers a distinct Raman signature that could be used for Raman imaging. We found that this monolignol analog is incorporated into in vitro-polymerized dehydrogenation polymer (DHP) lignin and into root epidermal cell walls of 4-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Incorporation of the analog in stem sections of 6-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants and labeling with an Alexa-594 azide dye revealed the precise locations of new lignin polymerization.

V (V) was converted to ternary ion-associate complex with 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol and tetrazolium violet. In the presence of diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid and NH4F as the masking agents determination of V (V) was highly selective. and V (IV) was among the masked ions. Due to this fact V (IV) could be determined indirectly from the difference in the absorbance measured in the presence and absence of the oxidizing agent. which oxidised V (IV) to V (V). The factors influencing determination of V (V) in the presence of large excess of V (IV) have been investigated.

Molecular iodine was determined spectrophotometrically at 295 nm by the measurement of the intrinsic triiodide absorbance after the addition of an excess of TBA iodide to the sample and following VALLME of the ion-pair TBA-I3 with amyl acetate. The procedure for iodate determination includes the formation of iodine as a result of iodate reduction with TBA-I in acid solution.

1182486,Liquid-liquid extraction-spectrophotometric determination of molybdenum using o-hydroxythiophenols,2014,Ali Z Zalov and Kiril B Gavazov,5,analytical methods,,6,,Molybdenum has been recognized as an essential trace element for plants. animals and humans [1-3]. In plants. it has a key function in the fixation of the atmospheric nitrogen. while in humans. it is important for the activity of the enzymes xantine oxidase. sulphite oxidase. and aldehyde oxidase. It is known that molybdenum has a beneficial effect on patients with sulphite sensitivity and asthma. It has also been stated that it reduces the incidence of dental caries. On the other hand. molybdenum can be toxic at high concentrations [2-4]. In mammals. it increases the lability of blood pressure. disturbs the cholesterol transport and causes bone deformation. Effects of acute molybdenum toxicity include diarrhoea. anaemia and gout. Chronic occupational exposure has been associated with weakness. fatigue. lack of appetite. anorexia. joint pain and tremor [3].Despite its relative rarity in the Earth’s crust (estimated abundance in the range 0.05-40 mg kg–1 with a mean value of 1.5 mg kg–1)[5. 6]. geochemical anomalies leading to molybdenum deficiencies in plants are not common [7. 8] and are mostly of concern for leguminous crops. Molybdenum fertilization is often based on visual deficiency symptoms and/or history of crop rotation [8].

Despite the vital role of P450 8B1 activity in cardiovascular health. research studies of other 12α-hydroxy steroid derivatives are rare. A synthetic route to incorporate a C12α-hydroxy group into the C12-methylene (–CH2–) in dehydroepiandrosterone derivatives is disclosed. The incorporation of the C12-oxygen was accomplished through a copper mediated Schönecker oxidation of an imino-pyridine intermediate. introducing the 12β-hydroxy group.

An unexpected conversion of [1]+ into [2] 2+. which involves substitution of chloride by CH3CN at the copper centre. has been observed in CH3CN/H2O mixtures. Surprisingly. formation of the acetonitrile complex does not occur in neat acetonitrile and requires the presence of water. The kinetics of this reaction has been studied and the results indicate that the process is accelerated when the water concentration increases and is retarded in the presence of added chloride. Computational studies have also been carried out and a mechanism for the substitution reaction is proposed in which attack at the copper centre by acetonitrile or water causes disruption of the cubane-type core. ESI-MS experiments support the formation of intermediates with an opencore cluster structure. This kind of process is unprecedented in the chemistry of M3M’Q4 (M= Mo. W; Q= S.

Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV infection among the HBsAg negative/antiHBc positive donations from a highly HIV prevalent region of India. A total of 729 HBsAg negative donor units were included in this study. Surface gene and precore region were amplified by in house nucleic acid test (NAT) for detection of occult HBV infection and surface gene was analyzed after direct sequencing. A total of 220 (30.1%) HBsAg negative donors were antiHBc positive. of them 66 (30%) were HBV DNA positive by NAT. HBV DNA positivity among 164 antiHBc only group. was 27.1% and among 40 antiHBs positive group was 30.0%. HBV/D (93.3%) was predominant and prevalence of both HBV/C and HBV/A was 3.3%.

In this work. the cDNA encoding CD63 homologue (TmCD63) was cloned from larvae of a coleopteran beetle. Tenebrio molitor. The cDNA is comprised of an open reading frame of 705 bp. encoding putative protein of 235 amino acid residues. In silico analysis shows that the protein has four putative transmembrane domains and one large extracellular loop. The characteristic “Cys-Cys-Gly” motif and “Cys188” residues are highly conserved in the large extracellular loop. Phylogenetic analysis of TmCD63 revealed that they belong to the insect cluster with 50%–56% identity. Analysis of spatial expression patterns demonstrated that TmCD63 mRNA is mainly expressed in gut and Malphigian tubules of larvae and the testis of the adult. Developmental expression patterns of CD63 mRNA showed that TmCD63 transcripts are detected in late larval. pupal and adult stages. Interestingly. TmCD63 transcripts are upregulated to the maximum level of 4.5 fold. in response to DAP-type peptidoglycan during the first 6 h. although other immune elicitors also caused significant increase to the transcript level at later time-points.

The active site coordination of CDO comprises a mononuclear iron ligated by the Nε atoms of three protein-derived histidines. thus representing a new variant on the 2-histidine-1-carboxylate (2H1C) facial triad motif. Nitric oxide was used as a spectroscopic probe in investigating the order of substrate−O2 binding by EPR spectroscopy. In these experiments.

Chemical pretreatment included pulping. bleaching. and acid hydrolysis to remove lignin. hemicellulose. and extractive substances were conducted. This was followed by high-shear homogenization and ultrasonication to produce nanocellulose. Morphological changes to the PLF due to treatment were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This showed that the PLF had a diameter of 1–10 µm after high-shear homogenizing. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that the nanofibers after ultrasonication for 60 min showed 40–70 nm diameters. Particle size analysis (PSA) indicates that the fibers had an average diameter of 68 nm. Crystallinity index was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and had the highest value after acid hydrolysis at 83% but after 60 min ultrasonication. this decreased to 62%. Meanwhile. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed there was no chemical structure change after acid hydrolysis. The most significant finding from thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is that the higher degradation temperature of nanofibers indicates superior thermal stability over untreated fiber. These results indicate that PLF waste could become a viable source of commercially valuable nanocellulose.

Starch. glycerol. and distilled water were mixed with 0.5. 0.1. 1.5 or 2 wt% of CNF. A gel made from this mixture was sonicated using an ultrasonic probe (600 W) for 5 min then cast in a petri dish. The addition of CNF resulted in a significant improvement (p≤ 0.05) on the properties of the bionanocomposite. 2 wt% CNF loading led to a maximum tensile strength of 9.8±0.8 MPa; 160% higher than film without fibers. The highest CNF loading resulted in the lowest moisture absorption and water vapor permeability. and highest thermal resistance of the bionanocomposite films tested. These improved characteristics were due to the ultrasonication dispersing the CNF homogeneously throughout the starch matrix and suggest that this CNF …,True,CA2nST8AAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643819308965,15876631616222087612,/scholar?cites=15876631616222087612,,,0,0,0

A suspension consisting of distilled water. starch. and glycerol was mixed with various cellulose loadings (0. 2. 6. and 10 g) then gelatinized using a hot plate with a magnetic stirrer. The biocomposite gel was sonicated using an ultrasonication probe (47.78 W/cm 2 for 4 min). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs for the fracture surface of resulting biocomposite films displayed a rougher surface than starch film. indicating fiber dispersion in the matrix. The opacity and moisture resistance of biocomposite films increased with the addition of cellulose. The opacity was at a maximum value (243.05 AUnm) with 10 g fiber. which was 11.27% higher than the starch film without cellulose. Moisture absorption of this biocomposite was 16.79% lower than the starch film. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) confirmed this more hydrophobic nature with lower transmittance at–OH stretching in the composite than the starch film.

This limitation eventually hinders the testing. It is necessary to optimize on the aspect of memory storage capability to reduce the storage requirements. In light of foregoing. the partial discharge data retrieval techniques with sampling rate methods were used to detect the peak of partial discharge as well as the PD constituent representatives. The optimization process was performed by using integration of oscilloscope and LabVIEW software. The partial discharge data recording can be easily confined to the points of the partial discharge occurrence only. As results. the storage points were reduced by taking wave magnitude associated with PD. thereby resulting in more representative data.

It is often considered as the ultimate marker for predicting the pressure and burden on oral health. Respiration is also a routine vital function running continuously through the human body and most commonly assessed by a spirometer. Hence. we planned the present study to assess the impact of complete dentures on the functioning of the respiratory system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study. a spirometric assessment of the effect of complete dentures on respiratory performance was done. A total of 100 subjects were included. and diagnostic spirometer was used for carrying out the spiro-metric test at different stages of each subject. The spirometric test was carried out at four different stages: In the absence of both the denture (AODs). with both the dentures (maxillary and mandibular) inserted in the patient's mouth (BDs). with only maxillary denture inserted in the oral cavity (UDs). and finally. by inserting only the mandibular dentures in the oral cavity (LDs). Forced vital capacity (FVC). peak expiratory flow (PEF). forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75%(FEF25-75) were evaluated. All the results were compiled and assessed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software.

1182764,An important role of a BAHD acyl transferase‐like protein in plant innate immunity,2009,Zuyu Zheng and Anthony Qualley and Baofang Fan and Natalia Dudareva and Zhixiang Chen,57,The Plant Journal,6,1040-1053,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Salicylic acid (SA) is an important regulator of plant resistance to biotrophic and hemi‐biotrophic pathogens. The enhanced pseudomonas susceptibility 1 (eps1) mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana is hypersusceptible to both virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Through positional cloning. the EPS1 gene was isolated and found to encode a novel member of the BAHD acyltransferase superfamily. Pathogen‐induced accumulation of SA and expression of pathogenesis‐related (PR) genes were compromised in the eps1 mutant.

A variety of systems have been adapted to capture. analyze. identify. and quantify airborne metabolites released by plants. Metabolomic experiments typically involve four steps: sample collection. preparation. product separation. and data analysis. To date. two different types of headspace sampling. static and dynamic. are widely used for volatile metabolome investigation. For static headspace analysis. solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is used to sample volatiles while push and pull as well as closed-loop stripping methods are used for dynamic headspace sampling.

Dordrecht,More than one percent of secondary metabolites is represented by volatile compounds which are involved in plant reproduction and defense. About 20% of this volatile subset are aromatic constituents consisting of phenylpropanoids. benzenoids. phenylpropenes. and nitrogen-containing aromatics. Despite the wide diversity of aromatic compounds only a small number are released. often at low levels. in response to and anticipation of attacks by herbivorous insect species. Scattered amounts of information show that aromatic volatiles have roles in repulsion and intoxication of attacking organisms as well as in the attraction of beneficial insect species that control pest insect populations through predation and parasitization.

However. investigation into sweat for biomarker discovery applications is still in its infancy. To add support for the use of sweat as a non-invasive media for human performance monitoring. volunteer participants were subjected to a physical exertion model using a treadmill. Following exercise. sweat was collected. aliquotted. and analyzed for metabolite and protein content via high-resolution mass spectrometry. Overall. the proteomic analysis illustrates significant enrichment steps will be required for proteomic biomarker discovery from single sweat samples as protein abundance is low in this medium. Furthermore. the results indicate a potential for protein degradation. or a large number of low molecular weight protein/peptides. in these samples. Metabolomic analysis shows a strong correlation in the overall abundance among sweat metabolites. Finally. hierarchical clustering of participant metabolite abundances show trends emerging. although no significant trends were observed (alpha = 0.8. lambda = 1 standard error via cross validation). However. these data suggest with a greater number of biological replicates. stronger. statistically significant results. can be obtained.

Typical approaches use media coated with various reagents that require an extraction step prior to analysis by liquid chromatography or gas chromatography GC combined with a various detectors.

1182845,Electrochemical synthesis of highly oriented. transparent. and pinhole-free ZnO and Al-doped ZnO films and their use in heterojunction solar cells,2016,Donghyeon Kang and Dongho Lee and Kyoung-Shin Choi,32,Langmuir,41,10459-10466,American Chemical Society,Electrochemical synthesis conditions using nonaqueous solutions were developed to prepare highly transparent (T > 90%) and crystalline ZnO and Al-doped ZnO (AZO) films for use in solar energy conversion devices. A focused effort was made to produce pinhole-free films in a reproducible manner by identifying a key condition to prevent the formation of cracks during deposition. The polycrystalline domains in the resulting films had a uniform orientation (i.e.. the c-axis perpendicular to the substrate). which enhanced the electron transport properties of the films. Furthermore. electrochemical Al doping of ZnO using nonaqueous media. which was demonstrated for the first time in this study. effectively increased the carrier density and raised the Fermi level of ZnO. These films were coupled with an electrodeposited p-type Cu2O to construct p-n heterojunction solar cells to demonstrate the utilization of these films for …,True,NtuToZIAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,16,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01902,9206654448852249272,/scholar?cites=9206654448852249272,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donghyeon_Kang2/publication/309531659_Electrochemical_Synthesis_of_Highly_Oriented_Transparent_and_Pinhole-Free_ZnO_and_Al-Doped_ZnO_Films_and_Their_Use_in_Heterojunction_Solar_Cells/links/5ab55066aca2722b97cacbba/Electrochemical-Synthesis-of-Highly-Oriented-Transparent-and-Pinhole-Free-ZnO-and-Al-Doped-ZnO-Films-and-Their-Use-in-Heterojunction-Solar-Cells.pdf,0,0,0
1182846,Evidence for light-induced oxygen exchange in the oxidation of liquid hydrocarbons on oxygen 18-labelled titanium dioxide,2013,Jongmyung Choi and Donghyeon Kang and Kyu Hyung Lee and Byeongno Lee and Kyung Joong Kim and Nam Hwi Hur,3,RSC advances,24,9402-9407,Royal Society of Chemistry,Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles labelled with 18O isotopes were prepared via a sol–gel method with titanium alkoxide and 18O water precursors. The presence of 18O in the labelled TiO2 sample was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and secondary-ion mass spectrometry. The photocatalysis of cyclohexane under UV light was investigated using 18O-labelled TiO2 as the catalyst; this reaction yielded 18O-containing cyclohexanone as the major product. The 18O content in the cyclohexanone product dramatically decreased with increasing reaction time. This isotopic experiment demonstrates that the oxygen atom in cyclohexanone originates from surface oxygen in 18O-labelled TiO2. Similar photoreactions performed with toluene and para-xylene as the hydrocarbon substrates afforded oxidation products containing 18O isotopes. The migration of oxygen atoms in 18O-labelled TiO2 into liquid …,True,NtuToZIAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC,8,https://pubs.rsc.org/--/content/articlehtml/2013/ra/c3ra40460a,15151103998529287772,/scholar?cites=15151103998529287772,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donghyeon_Kang2/publication/255771900_Evidence_for_light-induced_oxygen_exchange_in_the_oxidation_of_liquid_hydrocarbons_on_oxygen_18-labelled_titanium_dioxide/links/5ab55127aca2722b97cacbd1/Evidence-for-light-induced-oxygen-exchange-in-the-oxidation-of-liquid-hydrocarbons-on-oxygen-18-labelled-titanium-dioxide.pdf,0,0,0

Pt-@ meso-. were prepared using a bi-functional linker molecule. A large number of Pt NPs in Pt-@ meso-. ranging from 5 to 8 nm. are embedded into the shell and some of them are in close contact with  NPs. The hydrogenation of cyclohexene over the Pt-@ meso- microsphere at  and 1 atm of  yields cyclohexane as a major product. In addition. it gives oxygenated products. Control experiments with -labelled water and acetone suggest that surface-bound oxygen atoms in  are associated with the formation of the oxygenated products. This oxidation reaction is operative only if  and Pt NPs are in close contact. The Pt-@ meso- catalyst is separated simply by a magnet. which can be re-used without affecting the catalytic efficiency.,True,NtuToZIAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,5,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201132833920772.page,14796929912745451840,/scholar?cites=14796929912745451840,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201132833920772.pdf,0,0,0
