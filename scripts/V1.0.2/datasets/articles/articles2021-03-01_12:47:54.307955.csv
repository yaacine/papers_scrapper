In this study. the combustion experiment of a treated low-sodium coal with sodium aluminosilicate additive was conducted in a lab-scale drop tube furnace (DTF) at 1500 °C to reveal the contribution of mineral melting and coalescence to PM2.5 reduction. Meanwhile. two typical Na-loaded coals (in which the sodium was loaded in the form of NaCl and sodium carboxylate. respectively) with kaolin added were also burnt under O2/N2 and O2/CO2 atmospheres to investigate the effect of interaction between kaolin and different chemical form sodium on PM2.5 reduction.

We studied 12 different refractories including Al-. Ti-. Mn-. Mg-. Y-. Si-. La-. Zr-. Ce-. Nd-. Pr- and Yb-based supports. among which Yb and Pr are newly introduced ones. The sorbents were synthesized using the same wet-mixing method. by which the inert supports could be well dispersed among the ultra-fine active specie of CaO/CaCO3 particles to fully play the role of frameworks for sintering resistance. The sorbents stabilized by these inert supports were also cyclically tested under the same conditions.

LS0.4 exhibited superior catalytic behavior for Hg0 oxidation at 100–200 °C. The superior performance was mainly due to the surface adsorbed oxygen species in the catalysts. Effects of different components in the flue gas including HCl. O2. SO2. H2O. NO and NH3 on Hg0 oxidation efficiencies were studied. The results suggested that HCl significantly enhanced Hg0 oxidation efficiency in the presence of O2 and 10 ppmv HCl was sufficient for enhancing the oxidation process.

The results of this suggest that in the absence of HCl.

The optimal temperature and MnO2 content for mercury oxidation was 250 °C and 5 wt%. However. Mn/CNT almost lost the ability to oxidize mercury in the presence of 500 ppm SO2 because SO2 reacted with MnO2 in the catalyst to form manganese sulfate. Tests of mercury oxidized by Mn–Mo/CNT indicated that SO2 could enhance mercury oxidation by this catalyst and that the optimal temperature for mercury oxidized by Mn–Mo/CNT decreased to 150 °C mainly because Mo was able to promote the transformation of SO2 to SO3. which is beneficial for mercury oxidation. and Mo was also able …,True,NlXZ_MYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,49,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894715013613,6973966810786497678,/scholar?cites=6973966810786497678,,,0,0,0

The results showed that B–S–I exhibited more remarkable Hg0 removal ability than B–I. This was because B–S–I demonstrated more excellent iodine uptake capacity due to the reaction between iodine and the starch loaded on B–S–I. I2 was validated to exist in B–S–I due to the KI oxidation by air and starch–iodine complex could be formed. The starch–iodine complex was considered to have the ability to provide I2 for Hg0 to form iodated mercuric compounds. O2 promoted Hg0 removal while H2O inhibited them. B–S–I exhibited a higher extent of Hg0 removal than B–I in the presence of O2 because more KI adsorbed by B–S–I could be oxidized to I2 by O2.

The results showed that both the ultrafine PM yield and its Cl content increased when blends with a higher fraction of high-Cl coal were burned. To clarify the effects of increased Cl content on the formation of ultrafine PM during the combustion of coal. combustion of every single coal with several concentrations of extra added HCl was further conducted in a well-controlled drop tube furnace.

In comparison with pure CaO. the improved CO2 capture performance was observed for CaYb10 over prolonged carbonation-calcination cycles under a severe test condition. This improvement could be ascribed to the enriched macropores within 50–100 nm. which was identified by the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis.

The Hg0 removal activity tested under the atmosphere of pure N2 and in the presence of O2 showed that the MnOx/starch-bentonite exhibited better activity and stability than MnOx/bentonite. It was evident that the Hg0 removal efficiency over the novel catalytic sorbent (BS10M2) only declined by 16.9%. while that over MnOx/bentonite fell by 68.7% after a 5 h test under the atmosphere of N2 + 6%O2 at 120 °C.

However. this traditional routine is complicated and energy-consuming. Moreover. the improved performance would be weakened again during the granulation process. Hence. the implement of the modification and granulation within one step to produce CaO-based sorbents is of significant importance for CLP. This work. for the first time. proposes a simple and facile gel-casting technique to achieve the one-step synthesis of highly-efficient CaO-based sorbents pellets.

The major challenge in the application lies in the poor CO2 capture performance under realistic conditions of low CO2 concentrations. owing to the dense structure and poor porosity. In this work. Li4SiO4 sorbents were prepared with porous micromorphologies and large contact areas using a variety of organometallic Li-precursors. achieving fast CO2 sorption kinetics. high capacity and excellent cyclic stability at a low CO2 concentration (15 vol%). It was found that a high conversion of ~ 74% was maintained for pure Li4SiO4 even after 100 sorption/desorption cycles.

The mercury conversion of V2O5–MoO3/TiO2 exceeded 90% in the actual flue gas. and the commercial SCR system almost lost the ability. This is mainly because the actual SCR catalyst has been running for 35.000 h and the test of V2O5–MoO3/TiO2 was in absence of NH3. To clarify the assumption. a laboratory experiment was carried out. V2O5–MoO3/TiO2 and the fresh commercial SCR catalyst were tested in the simulated flue gases in presence and absence of NH3.

In the present study. EVS with supported silver nanoparticles (EVS-Ag100) as the catalytic sorbent was synthesized for elemental mercury (Hg°) capture. The physical and chemical properties of the sorbents were investigated. The raw EVS exhibited a poor Hg° capture capacity (7.7 μg g−1). because most of the vanadium species in the structure of EVS were V4+. The loading of the silver could significantly enhance the Hg° capture capacity (63.4 μg g−1). EVS-Ag100 exhibited a superior Hg° capture performance at temperatures of approximately 150 °C.

Generally. it is believed the inhibitory effect is caused by competitive adsorption between Hg0/HCl and H2O. In this study. we found that the MnOx was also aged in the flue gas with high concentration of H2O. The results indicated that the catalysts would be aged by H2O. The characterization of the fresh and aged catalysts showed that the amount of Mn4+ and chemisorbed oxygen species decreased. H2O didn't inhibit HCl adsorption on the catalyst surface. but suppressed the formation of active chlorine species. which was active for Hg0 removal.

1090747,Effect of Pore-Size Distribution on Phase Transition of Hydrocarbon Mixtures in Nanoporous Media,2016,Lei Wang and Xiaolong Yin and Keith Neeves and Erdal Ozkan,,SPE Journal,,15,SPE,Pore sizes of many shale-oil and tight gas reservoirs are in the range of nanometers. In these pores. capillary pressure and surface forces can make the phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures different from that characterized in pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) cells. Many existing phase-behavior models use a single pore size to describe the effect of confinement on phase behavior. To follow up with our earlier theoretical studies and experimental observations. this research investigates the effect of pore-size distribution. By use of a vapor/liquid equilibrium model that considers the effect of capillary pressure. we present a procedure to simulate the sequence of phase changes in a porous medium caused by a pore-size distribution.

Horizontal well with multistage hydraulic fracturing is an enabling technology for economic production of these shale resources. Recovery factors of liquid rich shale reservoirs is typically less than 10%. hence. there is an incentive for implementing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies to improve oil production from these very tight reservoirs. Brine. chemical (surfactant). gas. or combination of these fluids imbibition or injection in huff-n-puff scenario could improve oil recovery of liquid rich shale reservoirs. In this study. low-salinity water and low-salinity water + surfactant imbibition are assessed as both hydraulic fracturing and EOR fluids in liquid rich shale reservoirs.

Its mechanism rests on the effect of a thermal shock (sharp thermal gradient) introduced by cryogen on the hot surface of reservoir rock. Fractures can then be initiated and propagated due to strong local tensile stress. The objective of this research is to simulate the cryogenic fracturing experiments on Niobrara shale samples.

This system consists of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and cationic microgels synthesized by inverse suspension polymerization with acrylamide and methylacryloxylethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride as monomers. By adding HPAM into cationic microgel suspensions. flocculation occurs because of electrostatic attraction. Then it reversibly restructures from bulk to an insulated microgel particle at a critical salt concentration (CSC). In the profile modification test. this flocculation system diverts nearly 100% chase water into the low permeable tube compared to 20% by using microgels only.

This study investigates the development and morphology of cracks generated from cryogenic thermal shock in a borehole geometry under no external confining stress. A borehole was drilled through transparent acrylic specimens. Liquid nitrogen was injected into the wellbore. and the fractures were initiated by the thermal shock. The initiated fractures allowed further penetration of the cryogen. which helped to propagate fractures throughout the specimen. Fracture growth was characterized by abrupt starts and stops. which suggest that the tensile stress inside the borehole must reach a certain threshold for fracture initiation and growth.

The drying rate increases with the increase in drying air temperature and blanching also increases the drying rate. The drying rate also depends on shape and size of the ginger rhizome and asparagus roots. The highest drying rate of the ginger rhizome and asparagus roots was found for sliced samples followed by splitted and whole samples. The moisture content of the whole ginger rhizome and asparagus roots remains almost constant during the drying period of 32 h and this is true for either blanched samples or non-blanched samples.The intensity of green (-a*) colour of blanched basoka leaves was significantly higher than that of the non-blanched leaves. Lightness of ginger rhizomes decreased with an increase in drying temperature for all samples except sliced and blanched samples. Cream colour of asparagus roots remained almost unchanged after drying but the brightness increased. The change of quality of dried asparagus roots in terms of colour was not significant in the temperature range of 50 to 70 0 C. Five thin layer drying models have been fitted to the experimental data of blanched basoka leaves. sliced blanched ginger rhizomes and asparagus roots.

But the large number of accelerometers. the attenuation of the signals as they travel through the structure. and the influences of external sources. are all problems associated with this technique. In this work. an angular motion sensor in the form of a optical encoder is used instead of the traditional accelerometer. The frequency spectra of the accelerometer and the optical encoder outputs are compared under various conditions and system faults. The results indicate that the new technique provides information that is more suitable as a basis for a automatic test system.

The value of wind-generated power to an electric utility system depends upon the characteristics of the wind resource and load demand. cost of the conventional capacity and energy displaced by the WTGS. and the cost of additional backup units that may be required in order to accommodate the power fluctuations of the remaining load on the utility.Because of the intermittent and random nature of the wind speed. wind power cannot be scheduled in advance and classical generation analysis does not work well. The best analyses have been carried out through an hour-by-hour simulation using several years of input data. Figure 1 outlines the basic methodology used in these analyses for establishing the value of WTGS to a utility. A standard utility generation expansion model is run. without WTGS present. to determine the fixed and variable costs that a utility would incur to meet its load and reliability requirements. using conventional sources. Wind systems are then added to the mix. at no cost to the utility. and hourly wind power used as a negative load to cancel out some of the hourly load that the utility would experience without WTGS present.

However. this concept of removal does not facilitate an informed discussion of micropollutants. It is increasingly apparent that for many micropollutants. transformation products (TPs)(conjugated or metabolized forms of the parent compound) exist and may even exceed the parent form in both concentration and toxicity in WWTP effluents. For example. oxidation of the antiviral drug acyclovir and its biodegradation product carboxy-acyclovir. produces a TP more acutely toxic than its parent form. 1 TPs complicate our understanding of how treatment conditions affect micropollutant fate and are a contributing factor for large reported differences in removal of micropollutants across WWTPs.

Exposure models can be used to estimate exposures to chemicals in the absence of biomonitoring data and as tools in chemical risk prioritization and screening. We apply a PCP exposure model based on the product intake fraction (PiF). which is defined as the fraction of chemical in a product that is taken in by the exposed population. to estimate chemical intake based on physicochemical properties and PCP usage characteristics. The PiF can be used to estimate route and pathway-specific exposures during both the use and disposal stages of a product.

1090809,Clearing the waters of the fracking debate,2013,Alexi Sara Ernstoff and Brian R Ellis,1,Michigan Journal of Sustainability,,,Michigan Publishing. University of Michigan Library,Much of the debate on “fracking” in the United States is fueled by poor communication among stakeholders. Information in the public sphere may be provided by biased sources. and complicated academic research is often misinterpreted by media sources. The goal of this review is to provide an open-access source for a non-technical audience that facilitates a balanced discussion on the complex topics related to hydraulic fracturing and its impact on water resources. The limited information available suggests that many of the environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing activities may be similar to those experienced from other industrial practices. Two examples of concerns that are not unique to hydraulic fracturing include water use and chemical non-disclosure. Hydraulic fracturing well completions use similar amounts of water when compared to other energy and mining activities and undisclosed chemical additives may also be present in food and cosmetic products. The point here is not to say that water consumption and non-disclosure of proprietary chemical additives are not issues that warrant closer consideration as we continue to utilize hydraulic fracturing to pursue our domestic shale gas reserves. but instead. to highlight similar environmental challenges presented by other industrial activities. Many research and knowledge gaps remain regarding the ultimate impact of high volume hydraulic fracturing on the environment. however. the high profile nature of the fracking debate can help raise public awareness to the broader sustainability challenges associated with the efficient utilization of our water and energy resources.,True,EV-at3YAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,12,http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjs/12333712.0001.009?view=text;rgn=main,13233121755438052784,/scholar?cites=13233121755438052784,,http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mjs/12333712.0001.009?view=text;rgn=main,0,0,0

Average consumption of meal types (breakfast. lunch. dinner) were assessed using life cycle assessment. Retail and consumer wastes. and weight losses and gains through cooking. were used to adjust the consumption quantities to production quantities. On average. meatless meals had more than a 40% reduction in environmental impacts than meat-containing meals for any of the assessed indicators (carbon footprint. water use. resource consumption. health impacts of pollution. and ecosystem quality). At maximum and minimum for carbon footprint. meat-containing dinners were associated with 5 kgCO 2 e and meatless lunches 1 kg CO 2 e. Results indicate that. on average in the US. meatless meals lessen environmental impacts in comparison to meat-containing meals; however. animal products (ie. dairy) in meatless meals also had a substantial impact. Findings suggest that industrial interventions focusing on low-impact meat substitutes for dinners and thereafter lunches. and low-impact dairy substitutes for breakfasts. offer large opportunities for improving the environmental performance of the average diet.

The exposures through product use as well as post-use emissions and environmental media were quantified based on the chemical mass originally applied via a product. multiplied by the product intake fractions (PiF. the fraction of a chemical in a product that is taken in by exposed persons) to yield intake rates. The average PiFs for the evaluated chemicals in shampoo ranged from 3× 10− 4 up to 0.3 for rapidly absorbed ingredients. Average intake rates ranged between nano-and micrograms per kilogram bodyweight per day; the order of chemical prioritization was strongly affected by the ingredient concentration in shampoo. Dermal intake and inhalation (for 20% of the evaluated chemicals) during use dominated exposure. while the skin permeation coefficient dominated the estimated uncertainties. The fraction of chemical taken in by a shampoo user often exceeded. by orders of magnitude. the aggregated fraction taken in by the population through post-use environmental emissions. Chemicals with relatively high octanol-water partitioning and/or volatility. and low molecular weight tended to have higher use stage exposure.

The Health Nutritional Index (HENI). a novel disease burden-based nutritional index built on the Global Burden of Disease studies. was used to indicate healthiness using comparable. relative disease burden scores. Low whole grain consumption and high processed meat consumption are priority risk factors. Non-processed red meat and dairy make a nearly negligible contribution to disease burden scores. yet are key drivers of diet-related GHGs. Swiss diets. including vegetarian. ranged between 1.1–2.6 tons of CO 2 e/person/year. above the Swiss federal recommendation 0.6 ton CO 2 e/person/year for all consumption categories. This suggests that only changing food consumption practices will not suffice towards achieving carbon reduction targets: Systemic changes to food provisioning processes are also necessary. Finally. men with higher education had the highest dietary GHG emissions per gram of food. and the highest disease burden scores. Win–win policies to improve health and sustainability of Swiss diets would increase whole grain consumption for all. and decrease alcohol and processed meat consumption especially for men of higher education levels.

1090842,Integral analysis of laboratory and field electrical resistivity for soil density prediction,2015,ZAM Hazreek and S Azhar and A Madun and R Saad,,3rd Int. Conf. Applied Geophysics,,,,In the past. conventional technique to determine soil properties have faced serious problem in large scale project which related to the time and cost. Some alternative approach need to be used in order to solve or minimized those problem. Hence. this study was performed using integral analysis of laboratory and field electrical resistivity to determine basic properties of soil with particular reference to soil density. The electrical resistivity property of Clayey SILT was established using soil box test together with its density. Field electrical resistivity test was performed on site for Clayey SILT in order to determine its electrical resistivity and density properties. This study used pole-dipole array for field electrical resistivity test which supplied from ABEM SAS 4000 equipment. There was no similarity found of the resistivity value obtained from the laboratory with that of the field scale due to several reasons. Theoretically. the dissimilarity of resistivity array geometry factor. K used from laboratory and field test has strongly influenced the Electrical Resistivity Value (ERV) obtained from both different scales of experiment. The study aimed to establish a correction factor. c from lab and field scales based on ERV and soil density data was established at 1.94 Ωm. These c values were established to correct the field ERV based on laboratory data in order to reliably predict field soil density numerically using the equation derived through statistical analysis given by ρBulk= 1.9008 ρ− 0.072. Hence. the mechanism of ERV from both scales has been investigated. presented and explained.

Initially sugarcane bagasse was subjected to a pre-treatment process with hydrolyzed acid to eliminate hemicellulose. Whole cellulosic fibers thus obtained were then subjected to a two-stage delignification process and finally to a bleaching process. The chemical structure of the resulting cellulose fibers was studied by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to analyze the effects of hydrolysis. delignification. and bleaching on the structure of the fibers. Two different thermal analysis techniques were used to study the bleaching cellulose fibers. These techniques confirmed that cellulose fibers were isolated from sugarcane bagasse.

Washed banana fibers were mixed with high density polyethylene (HDPE) and placed in an injector chamber to produce specimens for tensile tests. Samples of washed banana fibers/HDPE composites were characterized by tensile tests and thermal analysis. The chemical composition of unwashed and washed banana fibers was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis. scanning electron microscopy. and X-ray diffraction. The treatment with water was effective at removing extractives and increasing the surface roughness. thereby increasing the thermal stability of the fibers. However. results showed that the addition of washed banana fibers decreased the thermal stability of composites. while increasing the melting and crystallization temperatures of composites. The addition of 5 wt% fibers also provided an improvement in mechanical properties of composites in comparison with pure HDPE.,True,5GkmW8cAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,25,http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/3465,13087100666688532115,/scholar?cites=13087100666688532115,,https://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/viewFile/BioRes_08_2_2351_High_Density_Polyethylene/2054,0,0,0

Considering the abundant availability of such lignocellulosic materials. relatively few attempts have been made regarding their utilization. Studies about properties and morphology. heavy metal adsorption. and membranes preparation have been conduced by this research group in order to use these materials. In this paper. cellulose fibers obtained from sugarcane bagasse were bleached and modified by hydrous niobium phosphate. Hybrids (cellulose/NbOPO4. nH2O) were prepared from metallic niobium dissolved in a fluoridric/nitric (10: 1) mixture. to which cellulose sugarcane bagasse was added. Afterwards a concentrated orthophosphoric acid (85mL. 85% w/w) was added to precipitate hydrous niobium phosphate particles. This material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). thermogravimetry (TG/DTG). and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses. as well as scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) coupled to an energy dispersive spectrophotometer (EDS). Morphological studies of bleached cellulose revealed different sizes and arrangement of cells. showing that NbOPO4. nH2O was present in the cellulose structure.

In this work a cellulose/NbOPO 4.nH 2O hybrid using cellulose from surgacane bagasse was prepared and characterized in order to test for adsorption applications. The preparation process was conducted by carrying out metallic niobium dilution in hydrofluoric acid in the presence of nitric acid. then adding boric acid to form the complex and. finally. the cellulose sugar cane bagasse was added. Concentrated phosphoric acid was also inserted to precipitate hydrous niobium phosphate particles in the cellulose fiber. This material was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). thermogravimetry (TG/DTG). and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) connected to an energy dispersive spectrophotometer (EDS).

In order to be more economically viable. wind power projects are urged to increase their scale. To overcome the technical challenges as a result of such increase. it became necessary for System Operators to modify Grid Codes to facilitate a securer wind power penetration into the networks.

Ebel,,,,,,A method for cleaning and conditioning a plasma processing chamber wherein oxide residues have been previously formed on interior surfaces of the chamber. The method includes introducing a cleaning gas including a fluorine-based gas into the chamber followed by performing a plasma cleaning step. The plasma cleaning step is performed by activating the cleaning gas mixture and forming a plasma cleaning gas. contacting interior surfaces of the chamber with the plasma cleaning gas and removing oxide residues on the interior surfaces. The cleaning step is followed by coating the interior surfaces with silicon dioxide to adhere loose particles to the interior surfaces and a conditioning step wherein uncoated interior surfaces are treated to remove fluorine therefrom.

Due· to its unusually high dielectric constant. titanium dioxide thin films have been investigated for use in f~ bricating capacitors in microelectronic devices (2. 11). Titanium· dioxide has also been found capable of supporting the photoelectrolysis of water and thus has been investigated for possible solar energy conversion schemes (6. 12-23). For the above applications. films of titanium dioxide have been made by techiques such as oxidation of titanium (6. 10). sputter deposition (9. 49). chemical vapor deposition (1. 3. 4). and vacuum evaporation (2). These methods usually do not offer much versatility in selecting and controlling the properties of the films. For instance. oxidation requires high temperatures and titanium substrates. Chemical vapor deposition(CVD) also requires high temperatures to react titanium tetrachloride and oxygen. Lower temperatures can be used if water vapor is used as the oxidant and if an organo-titanium compound is used instead of the halide (27. 28). These reactions. however. may cause carbon and I or hydrogen incorporation into the films which,True,_RFXzUMAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,3,https://escholarship.org/content/qt49r665xx/qt49r665xx.pdf,8108308136539929994,/scholar?cites=8108308136539929994,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt49r665xx/qt49r665xx.pdf,0,0,0

CA (USA),A glow discharge was used to enhance the reaction rate between TiCl/sub 4/and oxygen to deposit thin TiO/sub 2/films. Film structural. optical. electronic. and photoelectrochemical properties were examined as functions of deposition parameters. Films deposited onto glass substrates were amorphous below 300/sup 0/C. anatase at 300 and 400/sup 0/C. mixed anatase-rutile at 500/sup 0/C. and only rutile at greater than or equal to 600/sup 0/C. Films deposited on other substrates showed similar behavior. Largest crystallites were obtained using low rf powers (5 to 10 watts) and sapphire substrates. ESCA and AES showed chlorine present in films deposited at less than or equal to 200/sup 0/C. Chlorine was undetectable in films deposited at greater than or equal to 400/sup 0/C. Presence of chlorine in the films affected the electronic properties by acting as an electron acceptor. Dielectric constants for the films ranged from 25 to 166. Plasma-deposited TiO/sub 2/photoanodes were fabricated with quantum efficiencies of 60 to 80% for the photoelectrolysis of water.

Inc.,Pyrolysis is one of the thermochemical methods of conversion which convert biomass into solid. liquid and gaseous fuel. The yield of liquid is comparably more than others. The yield of pyrolytic liquid varies with the feedstock types. Literature revealed that non-edible oil seeds. seed press cakes produced high yield of biooil compared to other biomasses. The low crystallinity index of seeds and seed press cake favours for low temperature degradation. Due to the presence of high extractive content. the biomass resulted in high yield of bio-oil containing more organic liquid with less aqueous liquid. The organic liquid is the oil (bio-oil) which can be used as fuel. However. the bio-oil has various disadvantages such as high viscosity. high pH. high oxygen content and low calorific value. Due to these drawbacks. it cannot be used directly as it is.

1090918,THERMAL AND CATALYTIC CRACKING OF NON-EDIBLE OIL SEEDS TO LIQUID FUEL,2014,Krushna Prasad Shadangi and Kaustubha Mohanty,,Recent Advances in Bioenergy Research,,49,,Verities of edible and non-edible oil containing seeds are available in nature. Out of these. the seeds containing edible oil habitually fulfill our food requirements. Hence edible seeds should not be use as a feedstock for production of fuel as it will directly affect the food chain. The seeds that are less edible or totally non-edible can be a considered as a feed stock for pyrolysis for the production of bio-oil. The quality and yield of pyrolytic product depends on biomass composition which include cellulose. hemicelluloses and lignin. oil and extractives. Higher amount of cellulose and extractive content enhances the yield of oil whereas the presence of lignin results in char during pyrolysis. The product yield and its quality is a function of reactor type. physical and chemical properties of biomass. final pyrolysis temperature. gas residence time in the reactor. pressure. ambient gas composition and catalyst types. The high viscosity. acid and water content of the thermal pyrolytic oil as well as low stability retards its use as an alternative fuel which can be overcome by cracking in presence of a suitable catalyst. Literatures revealed that catalytic cracking of non-edible oil seeds such as mahua. karanja. castor in presence of zeolite. Al2O3. CaO. Kaolin. Criterion-424 and BP 3189 enhanced the yield of pyrolytic oil and the fuel quality by altering the pH. reducing the water content and viscosity. It has been observed that the catalytic activity varies with the types of feedstock and its composition.

A probable carbonation mechanism from brucite to magnesite is proposed via a couple of gas–solid reaction pathways. Experimental results demonstrate that the reactions undergo transitional basic magnesium carbonate carnations constructed by microflakes and then development of rhombohedral magnesium carbonate microstructured crystals with further incorporation of carbon dioxide. Furthermore. the carbonation parameters of brucite are also studied in detail.

Improved industrial hygiene allowed airborne concentrations close to the environmental context (1–1000 µg/m3). Conversely. new limits for benzene levels in urban air were set (5 µg/m3). The biomonitoring of exposure to such low benzene concentrations are performed measuring specific and sensitive biomarkers such as S-phenylmercapturic acid. trans. trans-muconic acid and urinary benzene: many studies referred high variability in the levels of these biomarkers. suggesting the involvement of polymorphic metabolic genes in the individual susceptibility to benzene toxicity.

The quantitative determination of the metabolites was carried out by HPLC-MS/MS with isotopic dilution from 70 pregnant volunteers. Detectable concentrations of phthalates metabolites were found in amniotic fluids. As phthalate monoesters are excreted in the urine conjugated with glucuronic acid. an enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out before analysis. Amniotic fluids were tested with and without hydrolysis and only the free phthalate metabolites. not conjugated with glucuronic acid. were found. The concentration of metabolites after enzymatic hydrolysis in maternal urine is not correlated to those of amniotic fluids. but the free form concentrations are. These results suggest that only the free forms can cross the placenta.

Some phthalates have shown reproductive toxicity in humans. acting as endocrine disruptors. so they were included in the authorization process defined in Reg. CE 1907/2006 (REACH). Two groups of population were recruited. before and after the inclusion of some phthalates in the authorization list in REACH: the first group of 157 volunteers was studied in 2011 and the second. 171 volunteers. in 2016. Each subject completed a questionnaire about personal lifestyle. working activities and use of chemical products. The main urinary metabolites of five phthalates were analyzed by HPLC/MS/MS: mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) for di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure; monoethylphthalate (MEP) for diethylphtahate (DEP); monobenzylphthalate (MBzP) for butylbenzylphtahalate (BBP) and dibenzylphthalate (DBzP). mono-n-butylphthalate (MnBP) for butylbenzylphtahalate (BBP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DnBP). The results show a significant difference for all metabolites between the two periods. with the exception of MEP in women. The comparison of the two sets of results shows a decrease in urinary metabolites excretion from 2011 to 2016. statistically significant for the three phthalates included in Annex XIV of REACH. DEP. not currently included in the list for authorization. maintains a constant presence in the daily life of the population. particularly for women.

A cutoff value for cotinine concentration can be set to distinguish smokers from non-smokers. independently from self-declared status. Method: Cotinine was determined by isotopic dilution High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) between 2013 and 2014 on urine samples of a population of 1075 subjects. Results: 296 subjects have a cotinine level higher than 100 μg/g of creatinine (cutoff). with a median cotinine concentration of 1504.70 μg/g of creatinine. The mean is 27.5% of smokers and 60.5% in this group are females. The median value for non-smokers is 5.6 μg/g of creatinine. Two hundred and seventy-five subjects declared to be smokers in the questionnaire. but 6 (2.2%) present urinary cotinine levels lower than cutoff; 800 subjects declared to be non-smokers. but 26 of them presented urinary cotinine levels that were higher than the cutoff (3.3%). Conclusion: Using the cutoff of 100 μg/g. the misclassification of smokers resulted to be 2.2%. indicating that the selected value is suitable for studying the human exposures to environmental and occupational pollutants. including those produced by smoking.

The study presents the broad-based model hypothesis that a single FT-NIR predictive model can be developed to analyze multiple types of biomass feedstock. The two most important biomass feedstocks – corn stover and switchgrass – were evaluated for the variability in their concentrations of the following components: glucan. xylan. galactan. arabinan. mannan. lignin. and ash. A hypothesis test was developed based upon these two species.

Public Health,7,826,MDPI,The impact of pesticide residues on human health is a worldwide problem. as human exposure to pesticides can occur through ingestion. inhalation. and dermal contact. Regulatory jurisdictions have promulgated the standard values for pesticides in residential soil. air. drinking water. and agricultural commodity for years. Until now. more than 19.400 pesticide soil regulatory guidance values (RGVs) and 5400 pesticide drinking water maximum concentration levels (MCLs) have been regulated by 54 and 102 nations. respectively. Over 90 nations have provided pesticide agricultural commodity maximum residue limits (MRLs) for at least one of the 12 most commonly consumed agricultural foods. A total of 22 pesticides have been regulated with more than 100 soil RGVs. and 25 pesticides have more than 100 drinking water MCLs. This research indicates that those RGVs and MCLs for an individual pesticide could vary over seven (DDT drinking water MCLs). eight (Lindane soil RGVs). or even nine (Dieldrin soil RGVs) orders of magnitude. Human health risk uncertainty bounds and the implied total exposure mass burden model were applied to analyze the most commonly regulated and used pesticides for human health risk control. For the top 27 commonly regulated pesticides in soil. there are at least 300 RGVs (8% of the total) that are above all of the computed upper bounds for human health risk uncertainty.

1091003,Global variations in pesticide regulations and health risk assessment of maximum concentration levels in drinking water,2018,Zijian Li and Aaron Jennings,212,Journal of Environmental Management,,384-394,ELSEVIER,Pesticides are used worldwide in agricultural. residential garden. and commercial applications. The control of pesticide exposure is a worldwide problem since pesticide can enter human body via ingestion. inhalation. and dermal contact. For drinking water. many regulatory jurisdictions respond by specifying the maximum concentration level (MCL) of a pesticide that may occur. At least 145 regulatory jurisdictions in 103 nations have specified at least 5474 pesticide MCLs in drinking water. Unfortunately. regulatory agencies often disagree on the magnitude of MCLs. For individual pesticides. MCLs often vary five. six. or even seven orders of magnitude. An analysis of the drinking water MCL distributions of the 25 most commonly regulated pesticides (N> 100 MCLs each) is presented in this study. Health risk uncertainty models are applied to compute uncertainty bounds around realistic MCL values for each pesticide and to help examine whether these MCLs can protect human health or not. Results indicated that at least 162 MCLs for 23 of the 25 pesticides considered were found to exceed upper human health risk uncertainty bounds indicating that these MCLs may not be adequate to protect human health. Also. health risk characterization factors were computed based on the estimation of maximum legal exposures to quantify human health damage caused by drinking water pesticide MCLs. and results indicated that some pesticide MCLs could cause over 19.000 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per million population.

1091006,Evaluation of regulatory variation and theoretical health risk for pesticide maximum residue limits in food,2018,Zijian Li,219,Journal of Environmental Management,,153–167,Elsevier,To evaluate whether pesticide maximum residue limits (MRLs) can protect public health. a deterministic dietary risk assessment of maximum pesticide legal exposure was conducted to convert global MRLs to theoretical maximum dose intake (TMDI) values by estimating the average food intake rate and human body weight for each country. A total of 114 nations (58% of the total nations in the world) and two international organizations. including the European Union (EU) and Codex (WHO) have regulated at least one of the most currently used pesticides in at least one of the most consumed agricultural commodities. In this study. 14 of the most commonly used pesticides and 12 of the most commonly consumed agricultural commodities were identified and selected for analysis.

Because human may exposure to pesticides from many ways. such as ingestion. inhalation. and dermal contact. it is important to examine pesticide standards by considering all major exposure pathways. Analysis of implied maximum dose limits for commonly historical and current used pesticides was adopted in this study to examine whether worldwide pesticide standard values are enough to prevent human health impact or not. Studies show that only US has regulated pesticides standard in the air. Only 4% of the total number of implied maximum dose limits is based on three major exposures. For Chlorpyrifos. at least 77.5% of the total implied maximum dose limits are above the acceptable daily intake.

However. only 23 countries have soil standard values for organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. and most regulatory jurisdictions do not consider the cumulative exposure. This study derived proposed soil standards for organophosphates and carbamates by introducing the relative potency quotient approach (RPQ). The probabilistic cumulative risk assessment was also applied to evaluate current soil standards of pesticide mixtures. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have soil standards of 19 organophosphates and five carbamates.

In this study. the disability-adjusted life-year. a uniform metric used to express the human health impact and damage. was used to measure theoretical health damage resulting from maximum exposure as permitted by law to the most widely used pesticides. The total human risk characterization factors computed from chlorpyrifos and diazinon standard values through main exposure routes are generally larger than that of other widely used pesticides. and most factors of chlorpyrifos exceed the upper bounds of health risk.

Aldicarb. Atrazine. Diuron. Glyphosate. and MCPA are the five most widely used pesticides in the world. Many international jurisdictions have been working on regulating PSVs for these five pesticides. However. there is little agreement on PSVs among regulatory jurisdictions so far and most nations developed their PSVs without considering all the major exposure pathways. To make the PSVs more efficient in the protection of human health. theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI) was introduced in this research to convert the PSVs into maximum mass loadings and evaluate the PSVs in a more comprehensive way.

1091024,An equivalency iterative algorithm for cancer risk assessment of chemical mixtures with additive effects,2021,Zijian Li,263,Chemosphere,,128131,Pergamon,To better estimate cumulative cancer risks and avoid the overestimated risk from the linear extrapolation. an equivalency iterative algorithm associated with a carcinogenesis hypothesis was introduced for a mixture of chemicals with the same mode of action (MOA). A lognormal dose-response function was applied for carcinogenic chemicals. Under some circumstances. the repetitive random iterative algorithm could be transformed into the nonrepetitive one. It was also demonstrated that the equivalent value for a lognormal-based equivalency iterative algorithm with the same shape parameter was independent of the operation order. Based on the theorems of the algorithm and Plackett and Hewlett’s minimum effective dose assumption. the sum of toxicity-weighted dose for a mixture of chemicals was mathematically derived.

Virulence of the whitebacked planthopper. Sogatella furcifera. in Taiwan and the Philippines was also assessed. Phylogenetic analysis of the varieties using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indicated a clade of highly resistant varieties from South Asia with two further South Asian clades of moderate resistance. Greenhouse bioassays indicated that planthoppers can develop virulence against multiple resistance genes including genes introgressed from wild rice species. Nilaparvata lugens populations from Punjab (India) and the Mekong Delta (Vietnam) were highly virulent to a range of key resistance donors irrespective of variety origin. Sogatella furcifera populations were less virulent to donors than N. lugens; however. several genes for resistance to S. furcifera are now ineffective in East Asia. A clade of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)-bred varieties and breeding lines. without identified leafhopper-resistance genes. were highly resistant to the green leafhopper.

1091044,Advances in breeding for resistance to hoppers in rice,2017,PS Sarao and Dharminder Bhatia and DS Brar,,,,101-130,Springer. Singapore,Rice productivity is hampered by a number of diseases and insects. Among the insects. hoppers including planthoppers and leafhoppers are typical phloem-sap feeders. which are very serious and damaging insect pests of rice in Asia. Many chemicals have been recommended for the control of planthoppers. but due to their feeding habit at the base of the plant. the farmers are unable to notice and effectively control these pests. Exploiting host plant resistance to hoppers and incorporating resistant genes in commercial cultivars are an alternative. economical and environment-friendly approach. To date. approximately 70 resistance genes against hoppers have been identified. and most of these genes have been tagged with molecular markers. Recently six genes for resistance to brown planthopper (BPH) in different lines have been cloned using map-based cloning.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Poly(epoxy imide)s were prepared by a reaction between a hydroxyl‐group‐containing soluble copolyimide and commercial epoxy resins at 220 °C for 2 h. Poly(epoxy imide) thin films exhibited higher thermal stability and lower dielectric constants than a commercial flip‐chip package material (U300). The thermal stabilities of the poly(epoxy imide)s were 1.4–2.0 times higher than that of U300. The thermal stability increased with increasing crosslink density and with decreasing bulky CF3 groups (which were easily decomposable).

The presence of heavy metals in the environment is of major concern because of their toxicity. bio-accumulating tendency. threat to human life and the environment. Traditional methods have been used to remove heavy metals from effluent include chemical precipitation. chemical oxidation/reduction. ion exchange. electrochemical treatment. evaporation and filtration. Many of these methods are ineffective; resulting in low levels of metal ion removal and can also be economically inefficient. Biomass of brown marine macro algae is a renewable biological resource. which is available in large quantities and can form a good base for the development of biosorbent material.

LBS provide information related to resources based on the user's current query location. Offering services to the travelers based on queries is one of the salient applications of LBS. Range queries are kind of mobile queries. which may involve distance and/or time parameters. Most of the LBS focus on destination based range queries to be addressed for identifying and suggesting resources. Identifying resources in the traveling path where `destination unknown' is an interesting area of LBS. More specifically. when there are deviated paths. suggesting resources for `distance based range queries' is still a challenging task.

Transparent alumina can be achieved at lower sintering temperature and shorter sintering time by microwave sintering. Transmittance is optical property which is highly dependent on the grain size and residual porosity which lead to real in line transmittance. A systematic experimental design is used to study transmittance of alumina. The following work was carried out using MgO as sintering aid for all Al2O3 samples. By using optimized parameters. the transmittance of single crystal alumina was obtained about 35%-20% in visible wavelength for 2 mm thick samples.

A loss of cellular and functional continuity of living tissue termed as wound. The infection causing microbes at the wounded site develop resistance against the targeted antibiotics used in controlling microbes and curing wounds. Extraction of novel biologically active compounds from plant species is thereby necessary to cure human ailments especially controlling microbes and curing wounds. This can be achieved by topically applying the compounds with free radical scavenging properties. On considering the above importance. the present study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-oxidant and wound healing activity of medicinal plant Anisomeles malabarica. The leaf extracts of Anisomeles malabarica exhibited antioxidant activity which was assayed using DPPH free radical scavenging assay.

1091141,Macro-Standardization of High Temperature Carbon Capture using Limestone doped with Coal Flyash,,Bolisetty Sreenivasulu and Rohan Singhvi and I Sreedhar and KV Raghavan,,,,,,* Corresponding author. E-mail address: isreedhar2001@ yahoo. co. in (I. Sreedhar). High temperature CO2 capture (CC) has gained industrial significance due to its applications like in-situ CO2 separation from H2 gas by water-gas shift reaction and to address a serious concern of global warming due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. primarily CO2 from industries into atmosphere.[1–3]. The limestone doped with coal fly ash (CFA) could be used as a natural and effective sorbent in calcium looping (CaL) and chemical looping combustion. These technologies also produce by-products of N2. CO2 and H2 gases that could be utilized in fertilizer synthesis as a value added product. In this work. greener synthesis methodologies and process standardization for enhanced CC using the above said sorbent of limestone doped with CFA under high temperature conditions using a well-designed and integrated packed bed reactor are discussed. CC is done through CaL of sorbent in the form of carbonation and calcination looping with gas mixture (CO2+ N2). Design of experiments using well known methods has been done to study the influence of critical parameters viz.. adsorbent and gas composition. sorbent morphology and quantity. adsorption time and inlet gas mixture flow rate and to arrive at the optimal set of parameters to achieve maximum CC. Material characterization studies are also done using analytical tools like XRD. EDX and SEM analysis to understand the physicochemical changes that occur during the process besides evaluating the sorbent stability.,True,lbJC42EAAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sreenivasulu_Bolisetty4/publication/305793237_Macro-Standardization_of_High_Temperature_Carbon_Capture_using_Limestone_doped_with_Coal_Flyash/links/57a1fa7e08aeb1604833ebb1.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

Epling (family Lamiaceae) is endemic to Ecuador. In the present study. we report some major non-volatile secondary metabolites from the leaves and the chemistry of the essential oil distilled from the flowers. The main identified compounds were carnosol. viridiflorol. ursolic acid. oleanolic acid. chrysothol. and 5-hydroxy-4′. 7-dimethoxy flavone. Their structures were determined by X-ray diffraction and NMR and MS techniques. The essential oil showed a chemical composition similar to that distilled from the leaves. but with some qualitative and quantitative differences regarding several minor compounds. The main constituents (> 4%) were: δ-3-carene (24.23%). eudesm-7 (11)-en-4-ol (13.02%). thujopsan-2-α-ol (11.90%). β-pinene (7.96%). valerianol (5.19%). and co-eluting limonene and β-phellandrene (4.47%). The volatile fraction was also submitted to enantioselective analysis on a β-cyclodextrin column. obtaining the separation and identification of the enantiomers for α-thujene. β-pinene. sabinene. α-phellandrene. limonene and β-phellandrene. Furthermore. the anti-fungal activity of non-volatile secondary metabolites was tested in vitro. with carnosol resulting in being very active against the “blast disease” caused by the fungus Pyricularia oryzae.

1091171,Development of Geopolymer-Based Materials from Coal Bottom Ash and Rice Husk Ash with Sodium Silicate Solutions,2017,Hoc Thang Nguyen and Trung Kien Pham and Michael A. B. Promentilla,8,,978-981-10-6713-6,402-410,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-6713-6_40,The coal bottom ash is a solid waste generated from coal-fired thermal power plants that contains high alumino-silicates resources. Rice husk ash was burned from rice husk which has over 80% silica in its chemical composition. The alumino silicates resources in these materials have high reactivity in various conditions such as that of alkaline reactions and thermal reactions. Therefore. both coal bottom ash (CBA) and rice husk ash (RHA) are promising raw materials for synthesizing alkali activated materials through geopolymerization.

Geopolymer technology is one promising solution to produce an alternative cementitious material with lower carbon footprint. and reduce the global consumption of Portland cement. Geopolymer can use waste such as red mud. coal ash. rice hull ash. among others. as raw materials for reactive alumina-silicates. At high alkaline condition. these alumina-silicates form a geopolymer cement binder system that hardens at room temperature like Portland cement. However. optimal mix formulation of these raw materials is necessary to produce materials with desired specification for a specific application. This work thus presents a systematic method that integrates the statistical design of experiment. multiple response optimization technique and analytic hierarchy process for product design of geopolymer-based materials.

1091208,Assessment of movement quality in robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation after stroke: a review,2014,Nurdiana Nordin and Sheng Quan Xie and Burkhard Wünsche,11,,1,1-23,BioMed Central,Studies of stroke patients undergoing robot-assisted rehabilitation have revealed various kinematic parameters describing movement quality of the upper limb. However. due to the different level of stroke impairment and different assessment criteria and interventions. the evaluation of the effectiveness of rehabilitation program is undermined. This paper presents a systematic review of kinematic assessments of movement quality of the upper limb and identifies the suitable parameters describing impairments in stroke patients. A total of 41 different clinical and pilot studies on different phases of stroke recovery utilizing kinematic parameters are evaluated. Kinematic parameters describing movement accuracy are mostly reported for chronic patients with statistically significant outcomes and correlate strongly with clinical assessments. Meanwhile. parameters describing feed-forward sensorimotor control are the most frequently reported in studies on sub-acute patients with significant outcomes albeit without correlation to any clinical assessments. However. lack of measures in coordinated movement and proximal component of upper limb enunciate the difficulties to distinguish the exploitation of joint redundancies exhibited by stroke patients in completing the movement. A further study on overall measures of coordinated movement is recommended.,True,pM1gj4sAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,169,https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-0003-11-137,466443431118526046,/scholar?cites=466443431118526046,,https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-0003-11-137,0,0,0

1091209,Simple torso model for upper limb compensatory assessment after stroke,2016,Nurdiana Nordin and Sheng-Quan Xie and Burkhard Wünsche,,,,775-780,IEEE,Stroke patients commonly incorporate the use of compensatory strategies to aid arm transport to achieve better functions and positioning in the absence of distal voluntary movement. During assessment of voluntary movement. the presence of compensatory strategies may suggest that the patient has not attained a natural neurologic recovery and that the patient has acquired a pattern of learned non-use. Various research has been conducted to provide patients with more freedom and frequency to perform their rehabilitation program. such as game-based rehabilitation as well as rehabilitation robotics. Inline with the automation. the need for automated assessment is also prevalent to accommodate the minimal presence of therapist during the automated rehabilitation program. While several research has been done to automate the assessment of hand movement quality. less emphasis has been taken to automate …,True,pM1gj4sAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7576862/,3236382945416881143,/scholar?cites=3236382945416881143,,,0,0,0

1091219,Towards automated disability assessment of upper limb movement after stroke,2019,Nurdiana Binti Nordin,,,,,,Movement quality assessment has been integral to appraise physical therapy in upper limb rehabilitation after stroke. The outlook is attractive because it provides a non-invasive insight to movement quality for the purpose of benchmarking the level of impairment before the rehabilitation begins and measuring the extent of recovery afterwards. However. a clinically acceptable measurement technique has been limited to laboratory setup with complex subject preparation. The attachment of numerous retro-reflective markers is time consuming and requires careful palpation on bare skin to record movements. The recorded marker positions need to be manually labeled in post-processing to interpret the movements according to accepted clinical model. This laboratory setup would require a highly skilled bio-mechanics' scientist and therapist to locate the anatomical landmarks and to analyze the kinematics data. Furthermore. the cost and complexity of the setup limits the amount of assessment replication. Recently. off-the-shelf marker-less motion capture becomes available and provides plausible joint estimation in form of skeletal data in real-time. This feature is particularly attractive especially for upper limb assessment due to multiple joints required to be monitored over time. Moreover. it trades off cost. complexity and accuracy of the assessment. Multiple researches have reported acceptable accuracy in joint angles estimation in various task similar to the existing stroke assessment task. These reports had inspired this research towards automating the kinematic disability assessment for stroke patients.

1091220,Development of Ultrasonic Tomographic Instrumentation System Monitoring Flaws on Pipeline,2016,Norsuhadat Nordin,,,,,,Online inspection and in situ monitoring for natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline is significant to prevent any fatal incident and to maintain pipe integrity. Most inspection technique conducted in industry is for the localized flaws detection. It is important to have an inspection system that is capable of producing an overall image of pipe profile (circumferentially) which can show the actual location of the flaws. Therefore. an ultrasonic tomographic instrumentation system was designed and fabricated for this study to monitor the existence of flaws circumferentially on pipeline. It consists of an ultrasonic sensing system. a data acquisition system and an image reconstruction system (software development). There were twenty-eight ultrasonic sensors arranged on a sensing ring that surrounded a carbon steel pipe NPS 8 (219 mm external diameter). The sensors were contactless to the pipe at a distance of 50 mm. Several testings were conducted to identify the ultrasonic beam pattern. the uniformity of ultrasonic beam intensity and the image grid covered by each sensor. A calibration test on distance measurement was conducted based on 40 mm to 60 mm range of distance. and the result showed±0.3 mm maximum error with the average accuracy of 99.82%. Three experiments on flaws detection around the pipe were carried out. which were the external flaws. internal flaws and a combination of external and internal flaws.

The ability to monitor compensatory strategies in terms of abnormal torso and shoulder movements through Kinect is attractive due to its portability and cost. However. Kinect’s joint proposals can be undermined with the occluded pose typical of stroke pa ti ents. This study inve stigated these discre pancies through test-retest procedures of s ta tic pose typical to stroke patients. It was found that at the distance of approximately 2.5 meters. all the joint proposals were reliable for normal pose. However. only joints attributed to the torso were reliable when stroke pose is prevalent.

Agbada Formation Niger-Delta Region. between March 2011 and August 2012.Methodology: This study includes the determination of shale properties such as mineralogy. cation exchange capacity. native moisture content and total organic carbon content of the shale samples collected from two wells in Agbada Field. It also involves the establishment of an adsorption isotherm for the shale and the modeling of these isotherms using the Guggenheim. Anderson and Deboer model.Results: Based on the results of the dispersion and swelling tests. 3% Bentonite+ 1% Potassium Chloride (KCl) were selected as the promising fluid. Well A exhibited the Type II isotherm which is common to most shale while Well B showed the Type V isotherm. Adsorption isotherm model predictions were in agreement with experimental observations. The samples from the wells exhibited dispersion after testing with deionized water. For Well A and B. 3% Bentonite+ 1% Potassium Chloride (KCl) inhibits and yielded higher shale percent recovery values from dispersion tests.Conclusion: It was observed from adsorption isotherm models that the total organic carbon content is not a significant factor in the adsorptive and dispersive behaviors exhibited by the shale samples.,True,nD0n6LQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,13,https://www.journalcjast.com/index.php/CJAST/article/view/6271,3297111388579108955,/scholar?cites=3297111388579108955,,https://www.journalcjast.com/index.php/CJAST/article/download/6271/11132,0,0,0

The various methods developed and published in various journals on how to estimate reserves range from material balance techniques to decline curve analysis. Among the various techniques. decline curves are found quite accurate in predicting good gas performance in the absence of well-known reservoir parameters. There are basically two issues that practically arise in applying decline curve analysis. particularly in boundary-dominated flow dry gas wells. First. it has been noted that it is difficult to match a decline exponent. especially at an early stage of well depletion. even with worthy quality data. Secondly. decline exponent is not constant from observation. but changes with declining production.

Based on the importance of this property. many means have been proposed to derive the Z factor parameter such as through Experimental analysis. Equation of state and Empirical correlations. For correlations. both implicit correlations and explicit correlations have been modelled in order to best measure this deviation. However. the explicit correlation has not considered pseudo reduced temperature of less than 1.

For optimum well performance for new wells. drillers are to make a choice between drilling with pseudo oil based mud to achieve stability in difficult trajectories and risk permeability impairment; or drill with water based drilling fluid and risk possible drilling instability. Reversible emulsion based muds which can be converted using an acid-base chemical switch from water-in-oil (W/O) to oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion have been suggested as solution in literature. The effect of this acid-base chemical-switch reaction with drilling equipment and personnel prompted this study.

Petroleum refineries are put in place to convert or refine unprocessed crude oil into more useful products using both physical separation and chemical conversion processes. Albeit. different refining unit are subsets of the physical separation category. The atmospheric and vacuum distillation unit seems to be more prominent. Conventionally. the crude atmospheric residue cannot be further heated in an atmospheric condition due to: coke formation. pipes plugging. thermal cracking and straining of the furnace. A vacuum distillation column is therefore required.Methods:This study. therefore. focuses on the limitations.“over straining of the furnace to provide the necessary heat” and “non-reliance on the additional re-boiler since it only acts as a heat exchanger”. An integrated distillation column with a capacity of 10.000 barrel per day was therefore designed for the concurrent production of all distillate cuts.Results:This was achieved through the introduction of a submerged combustion zone at the stripping section of the column where Naphtha was utilized as the source of fuel. Verification of this approach was also conducted using Autodesk invention software and a finite element analysis tool to evaluate both thermal and computational fluid analysis impact.

A novel process scheme for the synthesis of bio-lube from used tires has been highlighted in this work. The methods involved in the different stages of production have also been itemized with used-tire-oil seen as a potential intermediate product. The intermediate material is then expected to undergo fast pyrolysis and esterification/transesterification to obtain the final lube oil which requires appropriate blending with sufficient additives to achieve the desired specification for a particular application. The general feature of fast pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of the solid fuel in short reaction time which is an advantage for the quality of oil produced in absence of oxygen. The study has shown that fast pyrolysis is a very efficient way of processing used tires and there is need to further develop lube oil from tire-pyrolysis.,True,nD0n6LQAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978919307565,6687569733124161196,/scholar?cites=6687569733124161196,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978919307565/pdf?md5=0b82554b6c613cf052d43b7f857c14e9&pid=1-s2.0-S2351978919307565-main.pdf,0,0,0

This poses a big concern regarding the costs that to be incurred for separation and equipment capacity. Coning is the production of an unwanted phase with a desired phase. Over the years. many techniques and control methods has been birthed. however. the issue of coning can only be mitigated and not completely discharged. Reservoir and production engineers need to understand the basic framework; the parameters that greatly influence coning and how effective manipulation of it can deal with it. With the introduction of horizontal wells. the production rate is two to four times that of vertical wells. and coning is reduced and the breakthrough time is increased. Numerous papers has been written regarding to coning and vertical wells. only a few emphasize on horizontal wells and simultaneous water coning and gas coning. The objective of this research is to study the post breakthrough performance in simultaneous coning and a black oil simulator was use for the research. Sensitivity analysis was carried out on: the production rate of oil (qt). horizontal permeability. vertical permeability. perforation length. the height above perforation. extent of reservoir area and the formation porosity.

1091242,Modelling of Sub-Sea Gas Transmission Pipeline to Predict Insulation Failure,2018,Ekeinde Evelyn Bose and Dosunmu Adewale Ode Samson Chinedu and Okoro Emeka Emmanuel,11,The Open Petroleum Engineering Journal,,67-83,Bentham Open,Background:Thermally insulated subsea production and transmission systems are becoming more common in deep-water/offshore operations. Premature failures of the insulation materials for these gas transmission pipelines have had significant operational impacts. The ability to timely detect these failures within these systems has been a very difficult task for the oil and gas industries. Thus. periodic survey of the subsea transmission systems is the present practice. In addition. a new technology called optic-fibre Distributed Temperature Sensing system (DTS) is now being used to monitor subsea transmission pipeline temperatures; but this technology is rather very expensive.Objective:However. this study proposed a model which will not only predict premature insulation failure in these transmission pipelines; but will also predict the section of the transmission line where the failure had occurred.Methods:From this study. we deduced that in gas pipeline flow. exit temperature for the system increases exponentially with the distance of insulation failure and approaches the normal operation if the failure occurs towards the exit of the gas pipe. This model can also be used to check the readings of an optic-fibre distributed temperature sensors.Result and Conclusion:After developing this model using classical visual basic and excel package. the model was validated by cross plotting the normal temperature profiles of the model and field data; and R-factor of 0.967 was obtained. Analysis of the results obtained from the model showed that insulation failure in subsea gas transmission pipeline can be predicted on a real-time basis by mere reading of the …,True,nD0n6LQAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,3,https://www.openpetroleumengineeringjournal.com/VOLUME/11/PAGE/67/FULLTEXT/,17196204893846821356,/scholar?cites=17196204893846821356,,https://www.openpetroleumengineeringjournal.com/VOLUME/11/PAGE/67/FULLTEXT/,0,0,0

1091243,Economic Advantage of In-Country Utilization of Nigeria Crude Oil,2017,Paul A. L. Anawe and Angela Mamudu Emeka Emmanuel Okoro and Adewale Dosunmu and Kevin Igwilo,2,Open Journal of Yangtze Gas and Oil,,226-236,,Crude oil refining is a unique and important link in the supply chain of petroleum products from the wellhead to the end user. Refining adds value through conversion of crude oil and other flows into dozens of co-refined products. Nigeria is probably the largest importer of refined petroleum products on the continent. creating a lucrative refinery market in Europe and the United States. Subsidies have also contributed to the low capacity utilization in our refineries. The current situation of the four National refineries and high dependency on crude oil proceeds has made Nigeria government a full time exporter of crude oil. Because of our population. the demand for refined products which are imported in foreign currency have induced pressure on our local currency; thus. presenting a large cost to the economy. Instead of looking for international crude oil traders or embarking on discounted sales of our sweet crude in this era of low crude oil price. it will be profitable to utilize this crude oil in Nigeria. We will not only export the raw crude but also enrich our petrochemical industries and agricultural sector with the byproducts or co-products from its refining. Investment in petrochemical industry will really bring about an astounding effect in our economy because of enlargement of private domain which will usher new phase of life by reducing inequalities in the nation’s income. There has never been a doubt about the large size of the Nigerian market for refined crude oil and petrochemical products. As more countries are discovering crude oil. Nigeria’s crude oil export will gradually drop leaving us with excess crude oil instead of excess crude account.

1091244,Effect of Reversible Invert Emulsion Fluid Additives on the Environment – An Environmental Concern during Drilling Operation,2016,and Oriji B Okoro E.E. and Dosunmu A.,3,International Journal of Advanced Research in Education & Technology,2,230-233,,The effect of reversible invert emulsion drilling fluid additives on the soil has been examined in order to evaluate their toxicity and possible environmental impacts that may result from their indiscriminate disposal. Development of effective policies for discharges depends on consideration of the specific local environmental conditions that govern the fate of discharge materials. the scientific basis for assessing the potential for effects in that environment. and balanced consideration of the environmental effects and relative costs of discharge versus other disposal options. This paper reviews the framework that will help achieve general regulatory acceptance of the discharge of reversible invert emulsion mud. In this study. the contaminated soil samples were collected and analysed for metals (iron. copper. zinc. lead. nickel. chromium. manganese. calcium and magnesium) using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) method. The results showed that Calcium (Ca) has the highest concentration followed by Iron (Fe). Copper (Cu) with varying level of toxic metals like lead (Pb). Nickel (Ni). Manganese (Mn) and Chromium (Cr) in the soil sample. Metals like Fe. Mn and Cu generally have values higher than that of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization Standards thereby implying possible negative impacts on the immediate environments. It is therefore recommended that wastes resulting from oil cuttings and drilling muds should be properly treated before it is disposed into the environment by oil exploration companies.,True,nD0n6LQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,3,http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/10869/,298632597921893243,/scholar?cites=298632597921893243,,http://eprints.covenantuniversity.edu.ng/10869/1/emeka2.pdf,0,0,0

Optimum removal was found at pH 5. contact time 30 minutes and 60 minutes for Fly Ash 1 and Fly Ash 2. respectively. and dosage 10 g/l. The difference in adsorption capacity between both fly ashes may be due to their carbon fraction and CaO content. The removal of Cu (II) ions was caused by both adsorption and/or precipitation. Precipitation is enhanced by lowering the carbon fraction and increasing the CaO content. The adsorption isotherm showed that the Langmuir model fitted well to the experimental data of both fly ashes.

Boris Volodarsky. who was consulted by the Metropolitan Police during the investigation and remains in close contact with Litvinenko s widow. is a former Russian military intelligence officer and an international expert in special operations. His narrative reveals that since 1917 beginning with Lenin and his Cheka the Russian security services have regularly carried out bespoke poisoning operations all over the world to eliminate the enemies of the Kremlin. The author proves that the Litvinenko s poisoning is just one episode in the chain of murders that continues until the present day. Some of these assassinations or attempted assassinations are already known. others are revealed here for the first time. Uniquely Volodarsky has had a personal involvement in almost every each of the 20 cases. from the radioactive thallium poisoning of the Soviet defector Nikolai Khokhlov in Frankfurt in September 1957 to the ricin umbrella murder of the Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov in London in 1978."" Here. for the fan of murder thrillers and modern history alike. is a cracking good read. In brilliant light we see what lay for nearly a century behind the London polonium poisoning of British citizen Alexander Litvinenko. former Russian.

1091295,Oxo Ether Alcohols. Promising Detergent Compounds,1959,Jeffrey Bartlett and Isidor Kirshenbaum and Clifford Muessig,51,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry,3,257-258,American Chemical Society,Over 90.000.000 pounds of synthetic alcohols are produced annually by the oxo or hydroformylation reaction (3). This reaction. discovered in the 1930’s (16. 17). involves the addition of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to an olefin to form a saturated aldehyde. which is readily hydrogenated to the corresponding alcohol. More than one isomer is usually formed. and isomer distribution depends upon reaction conditions (7). Commercially available oxo alcohols include those in the C4to C13 range; two principal alcohols are the Cs and C10. Both are mixtures of isomers. produced from branched C7 and C9 olefins. A typical analysis of an oxo C8 alcohol is shown in Table I. Many laboratorieshave studied the mechanism and kinetics of this reaction (7. 2. 4.6-15. 19-21).

1091330,Aerosol-assisted fast formulating uniform pharmaceutical polymer microparticles with variable properties toward pH-sensitive controlled drug release,2016,Hong Lei and Xingmin Gao and Winston Duo Wu and Zhangxiong Wu and Xiao Dong Chen,8,Polymers,5,195,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Microencapsulation is highly attractive for oral drug delivery. Microparticles are a common form of drug carrier for this purpose. There is still a high demand on efficient methods to fabricate microparticles with uniform sizes and well-controlled particle properties. In this paper. uniform hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP)-based pharmaceutical microparticles loaded with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic model drugs have been directly formulated by using a unique aerosol technique. ie. the microfluidic spray drying technology. A series of microparticles of controllable particle sizes. shapes. and structures are fabricated by tuning the solvent composition and drying temperature. It is found that a more volatile solvent and a higher drying temperature can result in fast evaporation rates to form microparticles of larger lateral size. more irregular shape. and denser matrix. The nature of the model drugs also plays an important role in determining particle properties. The drug release behaviors of the pharmaceutical microparticles are dependent on their structural properties and the nature of a specific drug. as well as sensitive to the pH value of the release medium. Most importantly. drugs in the microparticles obtained by using a more volatile solvent or a higher drying temperature can be well protected from degradation in harsh simulated gastric fluids due to the dense structures of the microparticles. while they can be fast-released in simulated intestinal fluids through particle dissolution. These pharmaceutical microparticles are potentially useful for site-specific (enteric) delivery of orally-administered drugs.

Doping of heteroatoms. especially N. in carbons have attracted enormous interests owing to its capability in enhancing or expanding their applicability in separation. energy conversion and catalysis. In addition. N-doping can further boost dually doped carbons. such as with S and metal as the second dopant. Such a dual doping could possibly optimize material property and maximize performance through synergistic effects. In this talk. several synthetic methods. such as post modification [1-2]. one-step solvent-free nano-confining synthesis [3-4] and spray-drying-assisted assembly [5]. for the synthesis of heteroatom (singly or dually) porous carbon materials with different porosities and structures will be introduced and discussed. Furthermore. the controllable synthesis of metal/heteroatom dually doped mesoporous carbons with desirable fascinating properties will be introduced.

Composite microcapsules consisting of polymer-coated red phosphorous were prepared by interfacial polymerization of isocyanate and ethylenediamine in hydrothermal synthesis vessel. The morphology and magnetic property of microcapsules were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Meanwhile. the water absorption and particle size distribution were examined. The relationship between the content of dispersants and the particle size of microencapsulated red phosphorus was investigated.

The morphology. crystal structure. optical and photocurrent responses. as well as the photocatalytic performance of the obtained photocatalysts were characterized and investigated in detail. The results suggest that the modified TiO2 porous nanofibers show significantly enhanced visible light photocatalytic activity. as Bi nanoparticles would largely extend the visible light absorption of TiO2 because of its surface plasmon resonance. The co-existence of the semiconductor behavior of Bi nanoparticles could further prevent the recombination of electrons in the conduction band with holes.

The large amount of surfactant required in microemulsion polymerization causes a peculiar kinetic behavior (ie only two reaction rate periods. continuous generation of particles through the entire reaction and the production of nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution). which needs to be understood. These key distinctive features of microemulsion polymerization are explained in terms of the existing framework for the modeling of emulsion polymerization.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In this work. the kinetics of microemulsion copolymerization of styrene (St) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) at 60°C using dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) as the surfactant was followed on line by low‐resolution Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra were taken every 30 s. Because the spectrophotometer has low resolution. the CC peak overlaps with the St aromatic ring stretch vibration and curve deconvolution was necessary. Overall conversion obtained by Raman spectroscopy agrees with that obtained by gravimetry. Copolymer composition was determined by following the area changes of the COC bending mode peak of MMA. Compositions determined by this method agree with those measured by NMR spectroscopy. POLYM. ENG.

1091381,Tetracycline: production. waste treatment and environmental impact assessment,2014,Alexandre Augusto Borghi and Mauri Sergio Alves Palma,50,,1,25-40,Faculdade de Ciências Farmacêuticas da Universidade de São Paulo,The frequent occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment requires an assessment of their environmental impact and their negative effects in humans. Among the drugs with high harmful potential to the environment are the antibiotics that reach the environment not only. as may be expected. through the effluents from chemical and pharmaceutical industries. but mainly through the sewage and livestock; because around 25 to 75% of the ingested drugs are excreted in unchanged form after the passage through the Gastro-Intestinal Tract. Tetracycline has high world consumption. representing a human consumption of about 23 kg/day in Brazil in 2007. At the moment. researches are being made to develop new tetracycline that incorporate heavy metals (Hg. Cd. Re. Pt. Pd) to their structures in order to increase their bactericidal effect. The conventional wastewater treatment plants are not able to degrade complex organic molecules to reduce their toxicity and improve their biodegradability. For this reason new technologies. i.e.. the advanced oxidation processes. are being developed to handle this demand. The objectives of this study are to review the literature on the processes of obtaining tetracycline. presenting its waste treatment methods and evaluation of their environmental impact.,True,r_E2kC8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,89,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1984-82502014000100003&script=sci_arttext,12020053812160354521,/scholar?cites=12020053812160354521,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1984-82502014000100003&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

1091382,Doxycycline degradation by the oxidative Fenton process,2015,Alexandre A Borghi and Milena F Silva and Saleh Al Arni and Attilio Converti and Mauri SA Palma,2015,Journal of Chemistry,,,Hindawi,Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum tetracycline occurring in domestic. industrial. and rural effluents. whose main drawback is the increasing emergence of resistant bacteria. This antibiotic could be degraded by the so-called Fenton process. consisting in the oxidation of organic pollutants by oxygen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of Fe2+. Experiments were performed according to an experimental Rotational Central Composite Design to investigate the influence of temperature (0–40.0°C). H2O2 concentration (100–900 mg/L). and Fe2+ concentration (5–120 mg/L) on residual doxycycline and total organic carbon concentrations. Whereas the final residual doxycycline concentration ranged from 0 to 55.8 mg/L. the oxidation process proved unable to reduce the total organic carbon by more than 30%. The best operating conditions were concentrations of H2O2 and Fe2+ of 611 and 25 mg/L. respectively. and temperature of 35.0°C. but the analysis of variance revealed that only the first variable exerted a statistically significant effect on the residual doxycycline concentration. These results suggest possible application of this process in the treatment of doxycycline-containing effluents and may be used as starting basis to treat tetracycline-contaminated effluents.,True,r_E2kC8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,17,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jchem/2015/492030/abs/,3946257621894936699,/scholar?cites=3946257621894936699,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jchem/2015/492030/abs/,0,0,0

Bip. ex Baker. Asteraceae. popularly known as guaco. have been widely used by traditional medicine to treat some diseases. Studies showed some actions: bronchodilator. anti-allergic. anti-asthmatic. anti-ulcerogenic. anti-inflammatory and smooth muscle relaxant. Objective: To evaluate neuropharmacological potential of aqueous extract obtained from M. glomerata and M. laevigata in Marble Burying (MBT) and Forced Swimming (FST) tests performed with C57BL6 mice. Materials and Methods: For MBT. one hour after drug administration (200 mg/kg. po). each mouse was placed individually in a propylene cage (26 cm× 14 cm× 12 cm) containing 5 cm deep sawdust and eighteen glass marbles equally spaced (3 cm from one another). After 30 minutes. mice were removed and the number of marbles covered with sawdust (at least two-thirds) was counted. For FST. mice were forced to swim individually for 5 minutes in a glass cylinder containing 20 cm of water at room temperature after one hour of drug administration (200 mg/kg. po). During these 5 minutes immobility time was considered when a mouse made no effort to escape/swim and was registered. Results and Discussion: MBT can be used both as an indicator of anxiety-like behavior and/or obsessive compulsive-like behavior. Our tests showed that group treated with M. laevigata extract decreased significantly the number of buried marbles (6.3±1.3) when compared to control group (12±2). M. glomerata group showed no statistical difference.

Benfield process uses hot potassium carbonate solution to absorb CO 2 from the flue gas. It is carried out in a packed absorption column. the absorbed CO 2 in potassium carbonate solution is then removed by distillation and the recovered potassium carbonate solution is recycled. The Benfield process for CO 2 removal has been modeled and simulated using CHEMCAD software package (version 5.1. 0 release 2000). The simulation result shows that the CO 2 in the feed stream was almost entirely absorbed in the absorption column with the help of potassium carbonate. The amount of CO 2 was reduced from 117.59 kmol/h (feed stream) to 0.07 kmol/h (purified gas stream). The evolutions of the process parameters were studied during the process. The mathematical model and the simulation results. using CHEMCAD. proved to be a reliable tool for analyzing the process of removing CO 2 from the feed gas.,True,53OhNcsAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,0,https://rjstonline.com/HTML_Papers/Research%20Journal%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology__PID__2009-1-2-7.html,,,,https://rjstonline.com/HTML_Papers/Research%20Journal%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology__PID__2009-1-2-7.html,0,0,0

To utilize and optimize chemical or physical properties of nano-sized metal particles. a large spectrum of research has been focused to control the size and shape. which is crucial in tuning their physical. chemical and optical properties (Bar et al.. 2009; Coe et al.. 2002; Bruchez et al.. 1998). Various techniques. including chemical and physical means have been developed to prepare metal nanoparticles. such as chemical reduction (Tan et al.. 2002; Petit et al.. 1993; Vorobyova. AI Lesnikovich. 1999). electrochemical reduction (Liu and Lin. 2004; Sandmann et al.. 2002). photochemical reduction (Keki et al.. 2000; Mallick et al.. 2005). heat evaporation (Bae et al.. 2002; Smetana et al.. 2005) and so on. In most cases. the surface passivator reagents are needed to prevent nanoparticles from aggregation. Unfortunately many organic passivators such as thiophenol. thiourea (Pattabi and Uchil. 2000; Ravindran et al.. 1999). marcapto acetate (Lin et al.. 2000) etc. are toxic enough to pollute the environment if large scale nanoparticles are produced. An array of physical. chemical and biological methods has been used to synthesize nanomaterials. Specific methodologies have been used to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles of particular size and shape. Although ultraviolet irradiation. aerosol technologies. lithography. laser ablation. ultrasonic fields. and photochemical reduction techniques have been used successfully to produce nanoparticles. they remain expensive and involve the use of hazardous chemicals. Therefore. there is a growing …,True,9K5n7WYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,52,https://arabixiv.org/v8wgf/download,760295664487521740,/scholar?cites=760295664487521740,,https://arabixiv.org/v8wgf/download,0,0,0

1091434,Simulating the Production Strategies for Optimization of the Gas Recovery from a Water Drive Dry Gas Reservoir,2016,Asadullah Memon and FUR Awan and Z Lashari and HUR Memon and BS Memon,1,Australian Journal of Engineering and Technology Research (AJMFR),2,5-13,,The water drive is the most economical natural drive mechanism. The recovery factor of water drive dry gas reservoir is about 45-70% when produced under conventional restricted approach. The reason for this is that the water encroaches into the gas zone and traps the gas.

Although field experiments are the ultimate test of any oil recovery process. they are costly. time consuming and difficult to analyze quantitatively. Laboratory CC (Combustion Cell) experiments are cost effective and less time consuming. but are subject to scaling and interpretation challenges. Experimental set up has been developed to understand air injection process for improving oil recovery from light oil reservoirs taking into account the sand pack petro physical and fluid properties. Some important design problems; operational criteria and considerations important to interpretation of results are pointed out. To replicate subsurface reservoir conditions or pressure and temperature. experiments up to 6895 KPa. at non-isothermal conditions with 5oC/min ramp-up are performed on unconsolidated cores with reservoir oil samples. Correlations were obtained for low temperature oxidation rate of oil. the fuel deposition rate and the rate of burning fuel as a fuel concentration.Various parameters such as (sand pack. pressure. oil saturation and flow rate/air flux) were changed to investigate their impact on reaction and chemical nature of the fuel burned. To determine the importance of distribution and pyrolysis on these reactions. the hydrogen-carbon ratio and m-ratio was calculated. For further confirmation Arrhenius graphs were drawn by assuming 1.0 order of reaction with carbon concentration which is also confirmed.,True,6iRBtFEAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,http://publications.muet.edu.pk/research_papers/pdf/pdf69.pdf,,,,http://publications.muet.edu.pk/research_papers/pdf/pdf69.pdf,0,0,0

A total of 20 runs were made where in a stationary thin layer of unconsolidated sand was burned at non isothermal condition with a ramp of 5 degree C per min from room temperature (40 degree C) to 500 degree C in the combustion cell. Individual runs were made by changing various sand pack properties to permit determination of the effect of matrix upon the oxidation reaction. An expression was obtained for the burning rate of carbon as a carbon concentration. combustion temperature with 21% oxygen concentration. The carbon-burning rate for four types of sand pack indicated in a first order reaction with respect to carbon concentration. The effect of combustion temperature on the reaction rate constant matched the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy was not similar for these four types of sand pack examined. The activation energy decreased for porous media containing fine sand.

1091443,Impact of greenhouse gases on agricultural productivity in Pakistan,2005,GD Valasai and K Harijan and MS Uqaili and HR Memon,,,,,,[en] Pakistan is an agricultural developing country. About 68% of the country's population resides in rural areas and is mostly linked with agriculture. Agricultural sector contributes more than 25% to GDP. employees about 45% of the labour force and contributes significantly to export earnings of the country. Energy sector is the major source (80%) of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). Agriculture and livestock sectors are also responsible for GHGs emissions. The emissions of GHGs results in acid rain and earth's temperature rise (global warming). The destabilization of the global climate destroys natural ecosystem and increases natural disasters. such as violent storms. floods. droughts etc. The acid rain and these natural disasters affect the agricultural productivity. The study indicates that the agricultural productivity per capita in Pakistan decreased continuously during the last two decades. The paper concludes that due to emissions of GHGs. the agricultural productivity is significantly affected in the country. The government should take concrete measures to minimize the emissions of GHGs for increasing the agricultural productivity and reducing other harmful impacts in the country. This paper presents the review and analysis of the effects of GHGs emissions on the agricultural productivity in Pakistan.(author),True,6iRBtFEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:36106645,,,,,0,0,0

The results showed that CuO can be completely reduced into Cu and guaiacol selectively converted to carboxylic acids such as fumaric. maleic. acetic. and formic acids at a mild temperature of 250 °C. The presence of NaOH has a significant effect on enhancing the reduction of CuO and the selective yield of carboxylic acids. Two possible reaction pathways were proposed for the reduction of CuO with guaiacol. One pathway involves the oxidative decomposition of guaiacol into carboxylic acids. The other reaction pathway proceeds with the polymerization of guaiacol into oligomers. which can be reused for CuO reduction due to their easy hydrolyzation to monomers under hydrothermal conditions.,True,lOY_h_gAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,9,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie5007239,8300831666413280529,/scholar?cites=8300831666413280529,,http://pstorage-acs-6854636.s3.amazonaws.com/3933874/ie5007239_si_001.pdf,0,0,0

A comparative study of xylitol production using corn husk. switchgrass. their mixture (corn husk and switchgrass) and pure xylose was done. Yield of xylitol after 72 h of fermentation at 32 C and pH 5.7 using corn husk. switchgrass. their mixture and pure xylose was found to be 0.62 g. 0.48 g. 0.59 g and 0.73 g respectively per g of xylose initially present. Xylose consumption efficiency was 63.4%. 52%. 60% and 73% in corn husk. switchgrass. their mixture and pure xylose hydrolysates respectively under optimal condition. Therefore production was efficient using pure xylose and corn husk in comparison to switchgrass and mixture of corn husk and switchgrass under optimal condition.,True,Dfx0TaQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,9,http://isca.me/rjcs/Archives/vol3/i3/11.ISCA-RJCS-2013-014.pdf,2397091946636707000,/scholar?cites=2397091946636707000,,http://isca.me/rjcs/Archives/vol3/i3/11.ISCA-RJCS-2013-014.pdf,0,0,0

For the four most favorable adsorption sites. we find that the adsorption energy of phenol decreases linearly as a function of coverage. As such. the repulsive phenol–phenol lateral interactions are strongest near saturation when the intermolecular distances are less than ∼4.5 Å. manifesting in a decrease of the C–O dihedral bond angle of ∼4°. The linear dependence of the adsorption energy on coverage allows for the construction of a mean-field model. We validate our mean-field model for phenol adsorption by comparing the theoretically predicted differential heat of adsorption to the experimental data. where a maximum deviation of 0.11 eV is found. This compares well to earlier reported results that used a similar mean-field approach for the adsorption of …,True,Dfx0TaQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,3,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b07517,9278529366300504134,/scholar?cites=9278529366300504134,,https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1656774,0,0,0

1091501,Studies in organized assemblies,2010,Suraiya Khatoon,,,,,,"The term"" organized"" is applied broadly to any situation where some part of the system aggregates or organizes itself in deference to the bulk of the system. which could be a molecular liquid or solvent. The degree of organization can vary quite markedly from one type of system to another. For the most part. interest will center aroimd colloidal systems in water. The interest in this area of research is immediate as the organized assemblies may be looked upon as models for various processes in biology. The concept in general is to utilize an organized molecular assembly to influence and direct a system incorporated in or near the assembly. Chemists have long recognized the important role the reaction media play in controlling rates. products distribution and stereochemistry. Recently. much effort has been directed toward the use of organized media to modify reactivity. as compared to that in isotropic liquids. A major goal of such studies is to utilize the order of the medium so as to increase the rate and selectivity of the chemical process involved in much the same way that enzymes modify the reactivity of the substrates to which they are bound. Among the many ordered or constrained systems utilized to organize the reactants. the notable ones are micelles. microemulsions. liquid crystals. inclusion complexes. monolayers and solid phases such as adsorbed surfaces and crystals. Judicious selection of a given organized assembly for a given application requires a sufficient understanding and properties of the organized assembly themselves and those of the substrate interactions therein.",True,vLuixvgAAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C,0,http://ir.amu.ac.in/8489/1/T%208202.pdf,,,,http://ir.amu.ac.in/8489/1/T%208202.pdf,0,0,0

Due to its almost no expression in normal tissues and its tumor-promoting effects. FAPα has been studied as a novel potential target for antitumor therapy.

In this study. we found that overexpression of snail significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of FAPα in malignant melanoma B16 and SK-MEL-28 cells. Overexpression of snail increased FAPα promoter activity remarkably. Snail could directly bind to FAPα promoter to regulate FAPα expression.

Pakistan,2018,M Fazal-ur-Rehman and HZ Haider,9,Chem Sci J,179,2,,The drinking water in University of Education Vehari (UEV) was analyzed to monitor its Chloride hardness. This project was performed in chemistry Lab of UEV. The chemical/analytical test used to analyze the water Chloride hardness was Argentometric Titration or Mohr Method of analysis. In this test. a water sample was tested properly in chemistry lab. From the results. the molarity of Chloride content was calculated. The molarity of resulted Chloride was 0.0133. showing the most hardness of water. It is declared that due to hardness of Chloride amounts in drinking water. the water of university is unfit for drinking. This concentration of Chloride ions in very small water sample is too much. In normal. we daily intake 6-8 glasses of water which means 800-1000 ml or 1 L daily. If we calculate this concentration for 1 L. it will be most dangerous especially for human health. Chloride hardness causes various typical issues. for example. evaporator scaling. washing. spots on sink. sturdiness of hair and skin. It is also said that hard water causes diverse therapeutic problems; for example. urolithiasis. cardiovascular confusion. kidney problems. anencephaly.

The main goal to perform this project was to determine the changes in temperature of solution when an acid and a base were mixed together inside the cups of handmade calorimeter and their reaction was proceeded under the lab conditions and to determine either reaction would be exothermic or endothermic. Basically. from these changes in temperature of solution. the specific Heat of solution or Heat of reaction was determining. Temperature changes were observed using analytical thermometer with stop watch and all changes were noted on datasheet. while after completion of the whole experimental work. a thermodynamic equation of specific Heat was applied to calculate the Specific Heat of solution mathematically in numeric value which was 3214.72476 J or 3.21472 KJ. It was seen that as the base was mixed into acid. the temperature of solution was increased to maximum rapidly showing the exothermic reaction. After reaching to maximum range. the temperature decreased gradually to its minimum range being constant and consistent. The consistent temperature range terminated the reaction. All variations in temperature ranges were recorded very carefully and a table with a graph showing all ups and downs in temperature ranges was drawn on MS Excel Data Sheet.,True,3qdd_t4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,http://www.repository.embuni.ac.ke/handle/123456789/1875,,,,http://www.repository.embuni.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/123456789/1875/Specific%20Heat%20of%20Solution%20of%20HCl-NaOH%20Reaction%20by%20a%20Simple%20Handmade%20Calorimeter.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

1091533,Application of ionic liquid [DMIM] DMP pretreatment in the hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse for biofuel production,2015,Arief Widjaja and Silvya Yusnica Agnesty and Hanny F Sangian and Setiyo Gunawan,10,Bulletin of Chemical Reaction Engineering & Catalysis,1,70,Department of Chemical Engineering. Diponegoro University,Sugarcane bagasse is one of lignocellulose materials that can be converted to biofuel. This work was aimed to develop new pretreatment combination methods to process sugarcane bagasse lignocellulose into biofuel (bio-hydrogen). Pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse using NaOH solution in combination with ionic liquid [DMIM] DMP enhanced the enzymatic hydrolysis significantly. After the pretreatment. the content of cellulose and hemicellulose increased by 29.31% compared to the untreated one. Cellulose and hemicelluloses were used as raw materials to produce reducing sugars. that can be converted to bio-hydrogen via fermentation. After being subjected to combined pretreatment processes. the crystalline index of sugarcane bagasse decreased significantly compared to solely NaOH pretratment. This indicates a more amorphous structure of the sugarcane bagasse. which makes it is easier to be hydrolyzed into reducing sugars. The recovery of cellulose+ hemicellulose after pretreatment for 20 min and 120 C was 92%. and the yield obtained was 0.556 g sugars/g (cellulose+ hemicellulose) after 12 h and the bio-hydrogen yield was 0.46 mol H2/mol sugars consumed after 48 h fermentation. The use of recycled of ionic liquid showed similar performance compared to the use of fresh ionic liquid.© 2015 BCREC UNDIP.

Diponegoro University,This study aims to produce reducing sugar hydrolyzed from substrate. coconut coir dust pretreated by recycled ionic liquid and its combination with alkaline. The 1H NMR and FTIR were performed to ver-ify the synthesized ionic liquid methylmethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate ([mmim][dmp]). The structure of pretreated substrates was analyzed by XRD measurement. The used ionic liquid was recy-cled twice to re-employ for substrate pretreatment. The treated- and untreated-coconut coir dust were hydrolyzed into sugars using pure cellulase. The reaction. which called an enzymatic hydrolysis. was conducted at 60 °C. pH 3. for 48 h. The yields of sugar hydrolyzed from fresh IL-pretreated. 1R*IL-pretreated and 2R*IL-pretreated substrates were of 0.19. 0.15 and 0.15 g sugar / g cellu-lose+hemicellulose. respectively. Pretreatment with NaOH or the combination of NaOH+IL resulted in yields of reducing sugars of 0.25. 0.28 g/g. respectively. When alkaline combined with the recycled ionic liquids. NaOH+1R*IL. NaOH+2R*IL in the pretreatment. the yields of sugar were relatively similar to those obtained using alkaline followed by fresh ionic liquid. If the mixture enzymes. cellu-lase+xylanase. used to liberate sugars from fresh IL-pretreated. or recycled IL-pretreated substrates. the amount of sugar (concentration or yield) increased slightly compared to that employing a single cel-lulase. These findings showed that recycled IL pretreatment of the high-lignin lignocellulose. coconut coir dust. is a new prospect for the economical manufacture of fermentable sugars and biofuel in the coming years. © 2015 BCREC UNDIP.

Bilateral agreements require fair transmission loss costs compared with the integrated power system. This paper proposes a new algorithm in determining the optimal allocation of transmission loss costs for bilateral contracts based on the direct method in economic load dispatch. The calculation for an optimal power flow applies fast decoupled methods. At the same time. the determination of a fair allocation of transmission losses uses the decomposition method. The simulation results of the optimal allocation of power flow provide comparable results with previous studies. This method produces a fair allocation of optimal transmission loss costs for both integrated and bilateral parties. The proportion allocation of the transmission lines loss incurred by the integrated system and bilateral contracts reflects a fair allocation of R. 852.589 and R. 805.193. respectively.,True,POzOIicAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,1,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/295538674.pdf,18210397695249860653,/scholar?cites=18210397695249860653,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/295538674.pdf,0,0,0

Liquid smokes can be used as natural food preservation because of the presence of antibacterial substance. there are two important compounds ie. phenol and acetic acid. There are several factors influencing the concentration of an antimicrobial substance in liquid smoke. one of them is the temperature of the pyrolysis. as well as the type of wood used to generate the smoke. The type of wood defines the biomass content of lignin. cellulose. and hemicellulose. and this has been proven through two-way ANOVA analysis to be a significant factor in the concentration of phenol and acetic acid in liquid smoke. Meanwhile. temperature is not a significant factor in the generation of phenol and acetic acid. Durian husk has low lignin and hemicellulose content so coconut shell is added to increase the lignin and hemicellulose in the feed. This study aimed to obtain the best composition of durian husk and coconut shell in the liquid smoke generation based on phenol and acetic acid. Reviewing the literature through systematic review and meta-analysis was chosen as the method to determine the best variation of composition.

Efforts to reduce emissions have been made. but still focus on improving the transportation mode which are still less optimal. Some researchers have proposed ideas that the design of road infrastructure could also contribute in reducing vehicle emissions. This was confirmed by some correlation models that show the impact of the road geometric on vehicle emissions. This study aims to estimate the value of vehicle emission based on the geometric conditions of urban roads in Indonesia. The estimation of vehicle emission is conducted using a correlation model that has been developed by other researcher in other country which then compared with emission standards in Indonesia. Road geometric data are obtained by remote sensing method from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) database. The analysis conducted are evaluation of vehicle emission compliance and conformity of road geometric to some regulations. The results of the analysis indicate that the geometric conditions of urban roads in Bandung also affect the production of CO2 and PM2. 5 vehicle emissions and have the same pattern as previous studies. Some of the results and the reviewed road samples exceed the applicable standards. The results of this study can be used as a basic idea about the importance of establishing the road technical provisions on environmental impacts in urban roads geometric planning guidelines in Indonesia and to contribute on government program to reduce GHG emissions by 41% in 2030.,True,POzOIicAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/issat-20/125949843,,,,https://download.atlantis-press.com/article/125949843.pdf,0,0,0

1091598,Nanostructure Materials as Catalysts for the Degradation of Polyolefins,2018,Everton Ranny Ferreira dos Santos,,,,,,This study focuses on the development of a reactor system for the production of light gaseous hydrocarbons and/or liquid fuels from the pyrolysis of a polyethylene-based plastic waste. An evaluation of the thermal and catalytic behavior of fresh high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). and electric cable waste (ECW) has been performed by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). and thermogravimetric (TG) analyzes. The catalytic experiments use a commercially available acidic ZSM-5 zeolite. The temperature peak of melting and degradation of the samples has been extracted from the data at different heating rates (5. 10. 20. 30 e 50 ºC min-1). The analytical techniques also provide the data to estimate the kinetic parameters of the reactions by different methods. such as the isoconversional methods and the modelfitting method. The isoconversional methods of Kissinger. Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS). Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO). and Starink. have provided satisfactory linear regression coefficients for the experiments of thermic and catalytic pyrolysis. The data adjustment by the model-fitting method of weight allows the estimation of the activation energy as the isoconversional methods with satisfactory regression coefficients. Two reactor systems. based on a reactive distillation approach. were developed and tested. The first was used to evaluate the effect of the catalyst and temperature and was aimed at the production of light weight hydrocarbons; the design did not allow the collection of liquid phase of products.

1091614,Synthesis of Ni-Pt catalysts and characterization,2009,Everton RF dos Santos and Bianca Viana de Sousa and Antonielly dos Santos Barbosa and Romulo CN Leite and Meiry GF Rodrigues,,,,,,In this work. bifunctionals catalysts using the MCM-22 zeolite as support and the nickel and platinum metal as hydrogenation/deydrogenation sites were prepared. The method used for metal dispersion on the zeolite was the competitive ion exchange. using the amine complex [Pt (NH3) 4] Cl2 and [Ni (NH3) 6] Cl2. After the exchange reactions. the samples were calcinated at 500º C for 2 hours and reduced at this same temperature under hydrogen flow. The MCM-22 zeolite and samples containing the metal were characterized by the techniques of: EDX. XRD. DTA/TGA. The diffractions of the precursor MCM-22 (P) presented typical peaks of the MWW topology composed by intercalated lamellar layers with organic molecules that are constituents of the template (HMI). According to the XRD pattern of the calcinated sample. no peaks related to the organic material which is responsible to produce the MCM-22 zeolite were detected. By thermogravimetry it was verified that the removal of the template took place between 500 and 650 ºC proving the effectiveness of the removal process. The chemical analysis by X ray espectrometric was evidenced this the incorporation in the zeolites of platinum and nickel for all the texts in study.

The influence of three parameters (methanol-to-oil molar ratio. catalyst concentration and reaction temperature) on fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) production was investigated. The optimization was determined by response surface methodology (RSM) and the interaction of these parameters was described by a quadratic model. The results revealed that catalyst concentration had the greatest influence in FAME yield among the investigated conditions. The highest content of FAME was achieved up to 97.8 wt% at the optimized conditions (methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6. reaction temperature of 60°C. and 1.0 wt% of catalyst).

1091621,Evaluation on engineering properties of geopolymers from bottom ash and rice husk ash,2017,Nguyen Hoc Thang and Nguyen Van Phuc,,Journal of science technology & food,,,,Geopolymerization is the process of reactions among alumino-silicate resources in high alkaline conditions developed by Joseph Davidovits in 1970s. The reactions form chains and rings of alumino-silicate networks in geopolymeric structures. The raw materials used for geopolymerization normally contain high SiO2 and Al2O3 in the chemical compositions such as meta-kaoline. rice husk ash. fly ash. bottom ash. blast furnace slag. red mud. and others. The geopolymer-based material has potentials to replace Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)-based materials in the future because of its lower energy consumption. minimal CO2 emissions and lower production cost as it utilizes industrial waste resources. Moreover. in this paper. coal bottom ash (CBA) and rice husk ash (RHA). which are industrial and agricultural wastes. were used as raw materials with high alumino-silicate resources. Both CBA and RHA were mixed with sodium silicate (water glass) solution for 20 minutes to form geopolymer materials. The specimens were molded in 5-cm cube molds according to ASTM C109/C109M 99. and then cured at room temperature. These products were then tested for 3 engineering properties such as compressive strength (MPa) and volumetric weight (kg/m). 3 and water absorption (kg/m). The results indicated that the material can be considered 3 3 lightweight with volumetric weight from 1394 kg/m to 1655 kg/m; compressive strength at 3 28 days is in the range of 2.38 MPa to 17.41 MPa; and water absorption is at 259.94 kg/m.,True,LAvgK9MAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17668599620263610739&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Formation de composés organo-soufrés et effets cinétiques en gisement,2012,Van Phuc Nguyen,,,,,,H2S peut être un gaz dominant dans les réservoirs pétroliers carbonatés. Cependant. les recherches sur l'influence de H2S sur la composition et la stabilité thermique du pétrole restent limitées. Dans cette thèse. les interactions entre les hydrocarbures et H2S ont été étudiées de 310 à 350 C. à 700 bar. par pyrolyse confinée en tubes d'or scellés. La pyrolyse d'une huile non soufrée en présence de H2S ont permis de mettre en évidence une nouvelle voie de formation des composés organiques soufrés dans les pétroles. Les pyrolyses des mélanges n-octane/H2S et alkylbenzène/H2S ont permis de proposer les différentes réactions radicalaires pour la formation des produits soufrés principaux: les thiophène. thiols. thiacycloalcanes. alkyl-thiophènes dans le premier cas; les thiols aromatiques. alkyl-benzothiophènes dans le second. Les résultats obtenus dans le mélange n-octane/H2S ont permis d'établir et valider un modèle cinétique détaillé. Ce mécanisme a permis de montrer que la pyrolyse n-octane/H2S se déroule en chaînes longues et que H2S a un effet inhibiteur sur la consommation du n-octane aux températures supérieures à 320 C. mais accélère fortement la réaction aux basses températures. Des extrapolations du modèle aux conditions géologiques (150-200 C. 700 bar) montrent que H2S a un effet important sur la composition chimique et la stabilité thermique des hydrocarbures. Le modèle permet aussi d'explorer la réactivité de H2S aux conditions de récupération assistée d'huiles lourdes soufrées (injection vapeur. pyrolyse) ou aux conditions de stockages en réservoir pétroliers déplétés,True,LAvgK9MAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.theses.fr/2012LORR0292,,,,,0,0,0

Copper (Cu) and non-metal: Nitrogen (N) doping to produce Hydrogen (H2) from a glycerol-water mixture have been investigated. The metals (Cu and Pt) were loaded into Titanium Dioxide (TiO 2) surface by employing an impregnation and Photo-Assisted Deposition (PAD) method. respectively. As prepared the metal doped TiO 2 photocatalyst was then dispersed into an ammonia solution to obtain N-doped photocatalysts. The modified photocatalysts were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). and Ultraviolet-Visible Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS). XRD patterns indicated that the modified TiO 2 photocatalysts have a nano-size crystallite range of 16-23 nm. while the DRS analysis showed that the doping of both metal and non-metal into TiO 2 photocatalysts could effectively shift photon absorption to the visible light region. The optimum Cu loading of Cu-N-TiO 2 was found to be 5%. resulting in a 10 times higher H2 production improvement level when compared to unloaded TiO 2. even though this is still considered to be inferior compared to that of a 1% Pt loading. which results in a 34 times higher level than an unmodified TiO 2 photocatalyst.

1091632,Waste treatment by photocatalytic using Fe-TiO2-C,2018,Salim A Agus and Rachminisari Auring and Nana S Asep,,,,,,[en] Several studies have been conducted to reduce the danger of pollution by separating dyes from waste using various methods. including using photocatalysts. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of addition of Fe metal and activated carbon dopants on TiO 2 photocatalyst activity in the treatment of methylene blue waste. The precursor used is TiO 2 98% Anatase. The addition of Fe and C dopants is done by impregnation. The Fe composition in the catalyst is 3% by weight of TiO 2. whereas the concentration C is 1%. 3% and 5% by weight of TiO 2. The results of X-Ray Diffractometer characterization showed the addition of Fe and C dopant on TiO 2 increased the crystal size from 31.25 nm to 38.7-54.2 nm. The BET characterization results showed that the addition of Fe and C dopant increased the surface area of TiO 2 with the highest increment was obtained in the addition of Fe and C 5% at 3.175% and the pore volume also increased with the highest increase of 2.711.2% in the addition of Fe and C 5%. The Uvi-Vis test results show that the addition of Fe to TiO 2 actually decreases the activity of methylene blue waste treatment. The addition of Fe with 3% concentration. which will cover the active surface of TiO 2 catalyst and initially could prevent electron-hole recombination. will contrarily act as a barrier to the reaction of degradation of methylene blue. The addition of Fe 3% and C 1%. 3% and 5% on TiO 2 increased the activity of methylene blue waste treatment with the highest activity on the addition of C5%.(author),True,uND81W0AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:50062847,,,,https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/50/062/50062847.pdf,0,0,0

1091636,The addition of N to TiO2 and its effect on the energy gap band TiO2 as waste treatment material,2016,Salim A Agus,,,,,,[en] TiO 2 is widely used as a waste facility. One disadvantage of TiO 2 is the amount of energy band gap is 3.28 eV so that TiO 2 is only able to work in the UV spectrum. Various attempts were made to reduce the energy bond gap of TiO 2 so as to work in the visible light spectrum. One method of lowering the energy band gap of TiO 2 is the addition of certain dopants. In this research. the addition of N in TiO 2 has been done by the method of gas and soaking method. Precursors used is TiO 2 Degussa P25 TiO 2. Methods of gas performed by flowing nitrogen gas to a solution of 0.5 M NH 3 at a flow rate of 35 ml/min then poured on the TiO 2 Degussa P25 is placed in the U tube and heated at a temperature of 500 C. Soaking method is done by immersing the TiO 2 Degussa P25 in 0.5 M NH 3 solution. then stirred with a stirrer and ultrasonication. The solution was left for 24 hours. the precipitate obtained is then calcined at a temperature of 500 C for 1 hour. XRD analysis results showed the addition of N with gas flowing or immersion method does not affect the crystal size of TiO 2 in the range of 17-21 nm. while the results of SEM and EDS seen the highest concentration of the addition of N obtained in the method of gas of 1.07%. DRS results show the addition of N in TiO 2 decrease energy band gap of TiO 2 is from 3.28 eV to 2.79 eV and resulting shift working area TiO 2 photo catalyst in treating waste from the area of UV light into the visible light region.(author),True,uND81W0AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:49084034,,,,https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/49/084/49084034.pdf,0,0,0

Emboli is the most common cause of acute arterial occlusion. which is treated by perforating embolectomy using fogarty catheter. Some of these cases that are not diagnosed in early phase of the disease (within the first month). should be treated using open surgical techniques. since embolectomy via fogarty catheter is not effective in such instances. Case report: In this study we reported a 55 years old lady with subclavian-axillary artery occlusion who was suffered from critical limb ischemia.

DLS. electrokinetic potential. and TEM. We found that. on the time scale of several weeks. the colloidal system is stable up to CFe3O4⿿0.025vol.% and CV2O5⿿0.1⿿1.1vol.%. Such concentrations are indeed suitable for applications and the high sensitivity to the magnetic field of the suspension in a stable concentration region is demonstrated. However. the system lacks chemical stability at long-term (several months) as VV eventually oxidizes FeII. resulting in flocculation of the dispersion.,True,FhurRdoAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5529750,,,,,0,0,0

1091687,Photochemical reaction mechanisms in solutions of aryl esters,2000,LN Bugaeva and PA Kondratenko,,,,,Institute for Single Crystals,The primary photochemical processes have been studied in solutions of esters Ar 2 &2 &+ 5 where Ar is an aryl. 5+. alkyl or aryl. For such compounds. rearrangement reactions in the presence of $ O&O are characteristic resulting in formation of orthoƅ or paraƅoxyketones+ 2 Ar &2 &+ 5 (the Fries reaction). Since there is no conjugation beween the acidic and alcoholic molecular fragments in the esters. their absorption spectra correspond to the s um of those of the molecule fragments. The molecule excitation has been shown to result in that a) either the Ar2 & bond is broken in polar solvents due to preƅdissociation under formation of Ar2• and 5 &+ &2•. or b) the decarboxylation occurs under formation of Ar• and 5 &+• radicals. or c) an intramolecular rearrangement takes place from the ππ state. Oxygen has been found to do not influence the rearrangement product yield. thus eviƅ dences the reaction run without radical formation. In polar solvents. the photorearrangeƅ ment reaction yield is higher. The results obtained allow to conclude that the photorearƅ rangement reaction runs from the lower excited singlet state without the ester bond dissociation accompanied by (1. 3) or (1. 5) displacement of the acyl group. The probability of the rearrangement reactions from higher excited states via homolytic breakƅup of the ester bond followed by recombination in the solvent cluster into final product has been considered. The contribution of that reaction pathway has been shown to be insignificant. The photodissociation and photorearrangement processes in the molecules have been disƅ cussed in detail.

In was shown that the photoinduced adhesiveness of the layer appears only when the multicomponent diazonium salt is fully crystallized and localized close to the surface of the photoadhesive layer. The exposure of this layer causes photolysis of the diazo component and formation of the free aqua complex of zince chloride; the last effect is responsible for the photoadhesiveness. Increasing layer humidity causes an alternative photochemical reaction forming phenol so that the yield of ZnCl2 and. correspondingly. the photoadhesiveness decrease.

The original ANN is combined with analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Monte Carlo simulation (MC). and geometric random distribution at the parts of the input weight and input bias from the ANN. The variation of forecast signal demands from the hybrid models are used to reduce the variance from the signal customer demands. The results from this study. AHP(iw)ANN(b) has the smallest mean square error (MSE) from signal demands. it implys that the variance signal demands should reduce the bullwhip effect (BWE) in the supply chain. It can be concluded that the small variance signal demand should reduce the bullwhip effect in the supply chain.

The standard two-diode equivalent-circuit model with constant luminescent coupling efficiency has limited accuracy because it does not include the recombination current from photogenerated carriers. Therefore. we propose an alternative analytical method with bias-dependent luminescent coupling efficiency to model multijunction cell behavior.

In this case the absence of available electrons causes high concentrations of cytotoxic gases (NO and/or N2O) for denitrifying bacteria. The individual adaptive behavior to environmental conditions through different behavior-rules is one of the most powerful aspects of microbial individual-based models.

The aim of this study was to improve the metabolism sub-model with the introduction of a new individual behavior-rule for this bacterium in order to reduce cytotoxic products with individual mass degradation. A sensitivity analysis for two parameters involved in this behavior-rule. individual cellular maintenance energy and individual mass degradation coefficient. was performed.

1091776,Developing an individual-based model to study the bacterial denitrification process,2017,Pablo Alejandro Araujo Granda,,,,,Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,It is crucial to study the denitrification process driven by bacteria as it is one of the most important environmental processes for several reasons: i) it has an application in the removal of nitrogen (N) from high-N waste materials ii). it is one of the mechanisms to N-fertilizer¿s loss. iii) it contributes to the emissions of gasses with large global warming potential. and iv) it is the mechanism by which the global nitrogen cycle is balanced.  Many models have been developed in the framework of continuous models to deal with the complexity of the denitrification process in order to become predictive models. but some of the assumptions contained in them are not realistic enough in those contexts. and also they have their own constraints and limitations. On the other hand. the researchers have paid more attention to the role of microbial activity with the advance of experimental techniques.  Discrete models. such as individual-based models (IBMs). can be developed and applied to microbial systems due to the fact that they allow representation of some intracellular characteristics regarding the complexity of the micro-organisms. which constitutes a key advantage of this modelling approach in the study of the different biotechnological processes. The IBM is able to incorporate and accommodate the behaviour of denitrifying bacteria. and investigate their metabolism from different and attractive perspectives. A key factor in modelling the microbial activity is the methodology followed to represent metabolic pathways. A cellular metabolic model could be based on a non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach such as the Thermodynamic Electron Equivalents Model …,True,e8GTfmoAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,1,https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/107716,4715852245886160373,/scholar?cites=4715852245886160373,,https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/107716/TPAAG1de1.pdf,0,0,0

It is an advantage for the process with the aid of microwave radiation to the system due to the high affinity of water in the automotive paint sludge which acts as the medium of heating in the microwave pyrolysis reaction. By having such process. not only it is good to dispose the automotive paint sludge but three different products have been recovered from that process such as solid char. liquid oil and gas. With the high hydrocarbon content in the automotive paint sludge. it was estimated that high valuable hydrocarbon might be recovered in the liquid product. From this research. three parameters were studied and analyzed for the product distribution and liquid oil recovered which are sample weight loading. microwave power level and radiation time. It was observed that best sample weight loading. microwave power level and radiation time to produce high liquid hydrocarbon oil were 200g. 1000W and 30 minutes respectively in which 0.1 g or 0.27% was liquid oil recovered from overall sample weight loading.

High production of POME makes it impossible to dispose at the disposal company. therefore. in-situ treatment has been developed. Current disposal method implemented by palm oil industries is through biodegradable pond. This method is applied due to high water content in POME about 90% of water. Microwave assisted pyrolysis would be an alternative method to deal with the POME since not only can disposed but also can convert to valuable material such as solid char and pyrolytic oil. In this paper. effect of mass loading of POME at a range of 100 to 500 grams with additional activated carbon (AC) was studied. Microwave power level. radiation time and mixing ratio of AC were set constant at 1000 W. 30 minutes and 5%. respectively.

High proportions of solid waste were contributed by the kitchen/food waste. Currently. conventional method used for final disposal of these wastes was through landfilling or through direct incineration. However. high moisture content at 90% stretched a dilemma for both disposal method which leachate was generated from the landfill and furthermore. it cannot be achieved or limited by using incineration due to the humidity limitation of the incinerator. In this research. microwave assisted pyrolysis introduced was not only to dispose the waste. at the same time can recover valuable material from the kitchen waste. Effect of radiation time was studied at range 10 min to 60 min in the process in order to get optimum process condition. Meanwhile. other parameter such as microwave power level. sample weight loading and microwave absorber ratio were set constant at 1000W. 200g. and 20% wt/wt respectively. High conversion of kitchen waste was transformed into solid char was obtained at low radiation time with conversion> 80%.

Calorific value of APS pyrolytic oil achieved almost 35MJ/kg and enriched with monoaromatic hydrocarbon which is not achievable in previous study by past researchers due to the volatile released during drying process which is required by the pyrolysis equipment. However. high oxygenated hydrocarbon compound in the APS pyrolytic oil makes the pyrolytic oil still not achieve the standard requirement of commercial fuel. which the density and viscosity of APS pyrolytic oil is far from the standard due to high oxygenated hydrocarbon. Optimization is done on the process but only permits slightly increased on the pyrolytic oil yield. In addition. it reduced the quality of pyrolytic oil in terms of physical and chemical properties. Oxygenated hydrocarbon was increased to 53.1% of percentage area concentration. This is due to high radiation time need in the optimization method which the formation of more oxygenated and polycyclic aromatic compound. In order to meet the requirement of standard commercial fuel. improvement has been made by introducing catalyst ZSM-5 during the microwave pyrolysis process. As a result. calorific value of APS pyrolytic oil increased to 41 - 46 MJ/kg. which is higher than non-catalytic APS pyrolytic oil.

1091818,Asap Cair Hasil Pirolisis Cangkang Pala Dan Cangkang Kemiri,2017,Netty Salindeho and Christine F Mamuaja and Engel Victor Pandey,,,,,Unsrat Press,Kelebihan penggunaan asap cair dalam pengasapan antara lain : lebih hemat dalam pemakaian kayu sebagai sumber asap. polusi lingkungan dapat diperkecil dan flavor produk asap yang dihasilkan dapat dikendalikan dan konsisten. Penggunaan asap cair mempunyai beberapa keuntungan antara lain : aman karena dapat mengurangi kandungan senyawa PAH (Polisiklik Aromatik Hidrokarbon) yang tidak diinginkan seperti benzo(a)piren yang bersifat karsinogenik. mempunyai aktifitas antioksidan. dan dapat menghambat pertumbuhan bakteri. Kandungan beberapa senyawa fenol. formaldehid. dan senyawa lainnya yang berasal dari asap meresap ke daging dan berfungsi sebagai pengawet untuk memperpanjang umur simpan produk akhir serta memberikan cita rasa tersendiri yang lezat. gurih. dengan aroma yang khas disebabkan oleh proses pengasapan (Daramola et al.. 2007; Ahmed et al.. 2010 dan Daramola et al.. 2013). Proses pengasapan umumnya masih menggunakan bahan bakar sabut kelapa. tempurung serta beberapa jenis kayu sebagai pengasap. Selain bahan bakar tersebut di Sulawesi Utara juga terdapat cangkang kemiri dan cangkang pala yang dianggap sebagai limbah karena dihasilkan dari pengupasan kemiri dan buah pala yang kering dan yang telah matang. Oleh sebab itu salah satu potensi pemanfaatan cangkang kemiri dan cangkang pala tersebut dapat dilakukan dengan jalan digunakan sebagai bahan pengasap untuk menghasilkan produk asap yang spesifik.

1091834,Analysis of the Amount of Mold towards the Smoked Skipjack Coated by Kakatua Fish Scale’s Nanochitosan during Room Temperature Storage,2018,Falen Billy Sandana and Dekie Rawung and Netty Salindeho,5,Jurnal Ilmu dan Teknologi Pangan,2,26-30,,North Sulawesi has a well-known product of smoked fish that is smoked Skipjack or commonly called cakalang fufu. Smoking is a way of processing or preserving by utilizing a combination of drying treatment and giving of chemical compounds such as fenol and organic acid from the natural fuel. In general. the method of smoked fish processing is heat smoking with a temperature about 70-80 for 3-5 hours. Less sanitary and hygienic processing and bad storage conditions will cause the microbiological damage towards the smoked skipjack products. To solve this problems. it is necessary to do edible coating in order to produce a durable product. Edible coating is a coating that is able to maintain the quality and extend the shelf life. one of the edible coating that can be used is chitosan. Fish scales can also be used as the basic ingredients of making chitosan. Nanochitosan is a nanoparticle of chitosan that has better absorption and better ability as antibacterial and antifungal than chitosan with regular size. This study aims to analyze amount of mold in smoked skipjack with nanochitosan of kakatua fish scales during storage at room temperature. Based on the result. the amount of mold on smoked skipjack that coated by nanochitosan before smoked less than the treatment after smoked. before and after smoked and control that is 2.48 x 10 3 for 4 days storage.,True,n_SVgJwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://ejournal.unsrat.ac.id/index.php/itp/article/view/19714,,,,https://ejournal.unsrat.ac.id/index.php/itp/article/download/19714/19297,0,0,0

The comprehensive utilization of beneficiation sludge will increase the profitability of production and solve the environmental problems of the region. The importance of solving the problem of involving in processing tailings is connected not only with the environment but also with the need to increase the production of chromium. Modern gravity enrichment technologies make it possible to efficiently produce chromium concentrates from large and medium fractions of chromite-containing ores. while finely divided sludge is practically not extracted due to the difficulty of separating complex minerals into concentrates and waste rock. This paper presents the results of studies on the gravity processing of tailings. The technology includes the enrichment of the fine fraction-0.2+0 mm of tailings of the dressing plant of chromite-containing ores by gravity methods using a KNELSON centrifugal separator. In technology. the efficiency of the operation of gravity enrichment is provided by the preliminary activation of the fine fraction in a solution of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). With gravitational enrichment. the total chromite concentrate was obtained containing 51.3% Cr2O3. The output of concentrate was 41.7%.

Surfactant adsorption reduces the performance of the chemical injection slug and makes the process uneconomical. In this research. a new surfactant delivery system SDS:-CD inclusion complex. was evaluated as an approach to decrease surfactant adsorption.

1091895,PHENOL REMOVAL FROM SYNTHETIC WASTEWATER USING BATCH ADSORPTION SCHEME,2019,Muzher Mahdi Ibrahem Al-Doury1* Maadh Hasan Alwan2,26,Tikrit Journal of Engineering Sciences,3,31-36,tikrit university,Phenol is one of the most dangerous pollutant of petroleum industry. Thus its removal is very essential. One of the most popular method used to remove phenol is through adsorption by activated carbon. In the present work. batch adsorption experiments are carried out under various operating parameters: pollutant concentration (CO)(10. 30. and 50mg/L). and activated carbon dose (CD)(250-1500mg/1.25 L with an increment of 250). All experiments are performed at laboratory temperature (19ºC) and pH of 7±0.1 while a full factorial mode is applied. Many adsorption models are used to fit experimental data and find out adsorption capacity (ADC) which is a widely used term. The results show that phenol can be completely removed and the adsorption capacity depends on the pollutant concentration (CO) and adsorbent dose (CD). The actual adsorption capacity (AADC) is calculated and found to be highly different from adsorption capacity.,True,XVBn3rAAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,0,http://tj-es.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/vol26/no3/vol26no3p4.pdf,,,,http://tj-es.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/vol26/no3/vol26no3p4.pdf,0,0,0

Manganese and Zinc) from Industrial Wastewater of Baiji Refinery by Granular Activated Carbon,2012,Muzher M Ibrahem AlDoury and Abbas Ali Kanoosh,6,Journal of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,9,789,David Publishing Company. Inc.,The aim of the present work is to remove heavy metals (copper. manganese. and zinc) from industrial wastewater of Baiji refinery using GAC (granular activated carbon). The most important factors affecting adsorption process have been studied. which are granular activated carbon thickness. H. inlet pollutant concentration. Co. and liquid hourly space velocity. LHSV. All experiments were performed under constant temperature at 25 C and pH= 7. The experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to enable controlling of the operating conditions. Employing five levels for each of H and LHSV and three levels for Co required 75 runs for each metal. Box-Wilson method was used to reduce the number of experiments to 15 for each metal. The results indicated that copper. manganese. and zinc can be completely removed from wastewater using activated carbon. However. breakthrough time for zinc is low. It is also shown that breakthrough time (TB) and exhaustion time (TE) are inversely proportional with pollutant concentration and LHSV (liquid hour space velocity) while it is directly proportional with the thickness of activated carbon column.,True,XVBn3rAAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/58910157/605552012110105703562%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%87%D8%B1_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/58910157/605552012110105703562%D9%85%D8%B2%D9%87%D8%B1_%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B3.pdf,0,0,0

1091944,Effect of alkali addition on sulfur transformation during low temperature pyrolysis of sewage sludge,2017,Shan Cheng and Yu Qiao and Jingchun Huang and Liwen Cao and Huaizhou Yang and Huan Liu and Yun Yu and Minghou Xu,36,Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,2,2253-2261,Elsevier,Odorous sulfur-containing gases released during sewage sludge processing cause significant environmental pollution. This study investigates the effect of alkali addition on sulfur transformation as well as the release of the sulfur-containing gases during sewage sludge pyrolysis at 150−450 °C. The presence of alkali can promote the transformation of unstable organic aliphatic and aromatic sulfurs into more stable sulfoxides and sulphonic acid at low temperatures (i.e.. 250 °C). Alkalis also fix the inorganic sulfide and sulphate in char. Therefore. the release of the sulfur-containing gases can be greatly reduced with alkali addition. Stronger alkalis show more significant effect on the reduction of sulfur-containing gases. likely because of more OH radicals generated for the transformation of organic sulfurs.,True,_9rWTLMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748916301821,6794729311960008369,/scholar?cites=6794729311960008369,,,0,0,0

Biological AMD treatment is one alternative to couple environmental amelioration for valuable dissolved metals recovery. as a new source of raw materials. Covellite (CuS) particles were synthetized from an AMD sample collected in a Brazilian copper mine. after 48 and 96 h of exposure to hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) produced in a bioreactor containing acidophilic sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). The time of exposure affected the morphology. nucleation. and size of CuS crystals. CuS crystals synthetized after 96 h of H 2 S exposure showed better ordination as indicated by sharp and intense diffractograms obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD). and the predominance of placoid sheets with hexagonal habit structure as observed by scanning electrons microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectrometry indicated a Cu: S molar ratio in agreement with CuS. Granulometric analysis demonstrated that 90% of CuS particles were less than 22 µm size.

HT became very important in catalytic processes due to their high thermal stability structural. chemical. and morphological properties. Hydroxyapatites (HA) are cation exchangers with chemistry formula Ca10 (PO4) 6 (OH) 2 and molar ratio 1.67. An association between Hydrotalcites and Hydroxyapatites are very desirable to catalytic process by reason of their acid-base behavior. HT-HA composite was synthesized by co-precipitation [1]. leading up to an ultrasonic bath (2h) and flat pH (10). followed by 24h/80 C aging and oven-dried at 100 C/24h. HT-HA composite was characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). The aim of this study is evaluate HT-HA composite synthesis parameters to produce a designed material with further applications on catalysis. Diffraction patterns confirmed HTHA composite crystallization by presence of characteristic planes: HT (003)(006)(101)(110)(113) and HA (002)(211)(112)(212)(312). A secondary phase (NaNO3) was also observed. probable due an ineffective leach process (Fig 1). SEM images exhibited a high variation on crystal size; from 2µm to 10 µm.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a eficiência da biolixiviação em colunas. por A. ferrooxidans. de um sulfeto mineral proveniente de Carajás (PA). com granulometrias de 2. 00 e 4. 75 mm. Caracterizações mineralógica e química foram realizadas por DRX e FRX. O pH. potencial redox (Eh). extração do cobre. densidade e viabilidade bacteriana na solução lixiviadora foram medidos. A colonização bacteriana nas partículas foi determinada por MEV. Os minerais calcopirita. quartzo. magnetita e magnesiohornblenda ferrosaforam identificados. com o predomínio dos elementos S. Fe. Cu e Si na amostra mineral. Após 54 dias. foram extraídos 1. 07% e 0. 95% de cobre para as granulometrias de 2. 00 e 4. 75 mm. respectivamente. As bactérias permaneceram viáveis na forma planctônica e formaram biofilmes nas partículas. Os resultados indicam que a menor granulometria do minério favoreceu a extração. apesar da refração da calcopirita à biolixiviação.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,We report on the direct measurement of the molecular diffusion coefficients of water confined to purified bovine nuchal ligament elastin by high resolution q‐space NMR imaging. The experimental data indicate that water trapped within an elastin fiber has two distinguishable molecular diffusion coefficients. The component with the slowest mobility has a diffusion coefficient on the order of 10−6 cm2/s that varies inversely with the diffusion time and is seen to reduce near 37°C. The component with higher mobility has a diffusion coefficient reminiscent of free water but is observed to also behave similarly at 37°C. From our experimental data we extract the surface‐to‐volume ratio of pores within elastin and associated changes as a function of temperature. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

Angled discs arranged on a central rod with different pitches placed coaxially in the test section was used as turbulent promoter. The mass transfer coefficient data were found to increase with increase in disc diameter. An increase in disc angle caused a decrease in mass transfer coefficient value. No significant effect on mass transfer coefficient has been observed with rod diameter and pitch. A correlation in the jD-Re format has been obtained for mass transfer data by regression analysis. Pressure drop data were also obtained simultaneously. The friction factor has been obtained from the pressure drop data and were analyzed against Reynolds number.

However. these sources are limited and will be exhausted by the end of the next century. Thus. looking for alternative sources of energy is of vital importance. Vegetable oils are renewable and inexhaustible source of energy with energy content close to fuel. Historically it is believed that Rudolf Diesel himself started research with respect to the use of vegetable oils as fuel for diesel engines. Due to the high viscosity and low volatility of vegetable oils. they do not burn completely and deposits in fuel injector of diesel engine. Further. acrolene (a toxic substance) is formed the rough thermal decomposition of glycerol. Among different ways that have been considered to reduce the high viscosity of vegetable oils. the transesterification of oils with methanol or ethanol is …,True,00KV16EAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16518745114726860258&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Therefore the experiment was carried out at Cereal Crop Research Institute (CCRI) Pirsabak. Distract Nowshera KP. Pakistan during Kharif 2016. To study the effect of different phosphorus (P) sources and their ratios on maize yield and yield components. an experiment was carried out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replication. The treatments consisted of sole application of Farmyard Manure (FYM). Poultry Manure (PM) and Diammonium Phosphate (DAP). 75% FYM+ 25% DAP. 50% FYM+ 50% DAP. 75% PM+ 25% DAP. 50% PM+ 50% DAP and a control treatment with no P fertilizer. Phosphorus was applied at the rate of 100 kg ha-1 from different sources in different ratios. The results indicated a significant effect of different phosphorus sources on days to tasselling. days to silking. days to maturity. plant height. grains ear-1. grain yield. biological yield. and harvest index. whereas the emergence m-2 was found non-significant with different P sources. The combined use of organic and inorganic P sources delayed tasselling. silking and maturity. Plant height. grains ear-1. biological yield. grain yield. and harvest index was also higher with the addition of P from both sources as compared with the sole application of organic or inorganic fertilizer. The combined application of organic manures 50: 50 (FYM or PM) and inorganic fertilizer (DAP) performed better as compared to the rest of the ratios and produced higher yield and yield components.,True,scPqmA0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mussaddiq_Khalil/publication/338157187_Maize_Yield_Response_under_Various_Phosphorus_Sources_and_their_Ratios/links/5e14971b4585159aa4b9d83e/Maize-Yield-Response-under-Various-Phosphorus-Sources-and-their-Ratios.pdf,4084784608145086398,/scholar?cites=4084784608145086398,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mussaddiq_Khalil/publication/338157187_Maize_Yield_Response_under_Various_Phosphorus_Sources_and_their_Ratios/links/5e14971b4585159aa4b9d83e/Maize-Yield-Response-under-Various-Phosphorus-Sources-and-their-Ratios.pdf,0,0,0

Untuk memprediksi kecenderungan terbentuknya scale pada air formasi. dilakukan pengujian terhadap air formasi di laboratorium. Analisa air formasi dilakukan dengan dua metode. yaitu Stiff & Davis. dan Skillman. McDonald. & Stiff. Terdapat empat sampel air formasi yang diuji dalam pegukuran pembentukkan scale. Dari hasil analisa dan perhitungan dengan metode Stiff dan Davis. air formasi pada sampel SAF-1. dan SAF-3 memungkinkan terbentuknya scale Calcium Carbonate () sangat besar dimana harga SI masing-masing adalah 2. 0588 dan 1. 9451. Sedangkan pada air formasi sampel SAF-2 dan SAF-4 harga SI adalah 0. 1922 dan 0. 6418. menunjukkan bahwa air formasi berada pada posisi sangat jenuh terhadap.

1092062,Performance of Nonionic Surfactant for EOR on Various Salinity and Hardness of Water,,Reno Pratiwi and Abdiah Marina Saputri and Lestari Said,,,,,,Water as a surfactant’s solvent media that will be mixed with petroleum has salinity and hardness that affects the performance of the surfactant. Generally. nonionic surfactants are used as co-surfactants since they are relatively more resistant to dissolved salt and minerals in the water. The purpose of this study therefore was to analyzes the process conditions for non-ionic surfactants to achieve the best performance. Compatibility. interfacial tension of oil-water. phase behavior. and thermal resistance are parameters considered. Field observations were made on variations of salinity and hardness of water. Additionally Ca2+ ions were chosen as electrolytes which are widely found in surfactant solvent water. From this work. the results of nonionic surfactant have excellent compatibility in all types of solutions observed. The use of 0.5% surfactant in a solution with a salinity of 50.000 ppm and Ca2+ 500 ppm ion content was the best in reducing interfacial tension with a value of 2. 39.10-4 dyne/cm. The phase behavior test for seven days observation shows there are similarities with type I emulsion Winsor.

In reality. heterogeneity is observed in a wide range of scales from microns to kilometers. A reasonable approach to study this multi-scale variations is through fractals. Fractal statistics provide a simple way of relating variations on larger scales to those on smaller scales and vice versa. Simple statistical fractal models (fBm and fGn) can be useful to understand the model construction and help the reservoir structure characterization. In this paper. the fractal methods (fGn and fBm) have been applied to characterize and to estimate of reservoir properties. Three methods. namely box-counting. variogram. and R/S analysis. were carried out on log and core data for porosity and permeability data to estimate fractal dimension; a high fractal dimension estimated in this study reveals a high …,True,QNTqp6oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,6,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13202-017-0358-7,8372385128536106401,/scholar?cites=8372385128536106401,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13202-017-0358-7,0,0,0

One IOR method is infill drilling. which improves hydrocarbon recovery from virgin zones of the reservoir. Determining the appropriate location for the infill wells is very challenging and greatly depends on different factors such as the reservoir heterogeneity. This study aims to investigate the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on the location of infill well. In order to characterize the effect of heterogeneity on infill well locations. some geostatistical methods. e.g.. sequential gaussian simulation. have been applied to generate various heterogeneity models. In particular. different correlation ranges (R) were used to observe the effect of heterogeneity. Results revealed that an increase in correlation ranges will lead to (1) a higher field oil production total. and (2) a faster expansion of the drainage radius which …,True,QNTqp6oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13202-015-0204-8,574613790164198709,/scholar?cites=574613790164198709,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13202-015-0204-8,0,0,0

Seiring dengan permintaan minyak yang terus meningkat. masalah terkait kurangnya cadangan baru dan penurunan cadangan masih membutuhkan penyelesaian. Salah satu solusi untuk masalah ini adalah Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) yang dapat mempertahankan produksi minyak di Indonesia. Setelah melewati proses pemilihan metode EOR. metode injeksi kimia merupakan salah satu metode terbaik yang dapat diaplikasikan pada lapangan “K” yang terdapat di Sumatera Selatan. Jenis larutan kimia yang dipilih merupakan larutan surfaktan yang diharapkan dapat menurunkan tegangan antarmuka dan membebaskan minyak yang terperangkap. Larutan surfaktan tersebut diformulasi dengan menggunakan air injeksi yang didapatkan melalui lapangan “K” dalam berbagai konsentrasi yaitu 0.05%. 0.1%. 0.3%. 0.5% dan 1%.

1092080,New Innovation Using Sodium LignoSulfonate Surfactant Synthesized from Bagasse to Enhanced Oil Recovery for Light Crude Oil,2019,Rini Setiati and Septoratno Siregar and Taufan Marhaendrajana and Deana Wahyuningrum and Aqlyna Fattah Annisa,,,,,Indonesian Petroleum Association,Surfactant injection using sodium ligno-sulfonate (SLS) from bagasse is one of the innovative efforts with a green chemical process. This surfactant is made from bagasse. With the green chemical process. the bagasse waste is used as an SLS surfactant. Surfactant injection is carried out in an effort to increase the oil recovery to produce the remaining oil. with the mechanism of reducing the interfacial tension (IFT) in the reservoir.There are three types of crude oil used in the surfactant injection test. light crude oil. intermediate crude oil and heavy crude oil. Light crude oil has Carbon number 1-15 (±40-50 oAPI). intermediate crude oil has a Carbon from 15-50 (±15-40 oAPI) while heavy crude oil has a Carbon number of more than 50 (±9-15 oAPI).

EXSY studies enabled residence times of carbon dioxide molecules to be obtained in the two states. whereas PFG NMR revealed time-dependent effective diffusivities for diffusion times comparable with and larger than the residence times. Analytical treatment of the PFG NMR attenuation curves as well as fitting of the PFG NMR effective diffusivities by KMC simulations enabled determination of diffusivities of carbon dioxide in the reacted and unreacted states.

One of the approaches is the combination of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle as nanocomposite for their fascinating nanostructures. Previous studies have addressed their remarkable synergistic effects on mechanical. thermal and antimicrobial properties of composites. however. the relationship between GO and ZnO concentration on antimicrobial activity is in the lack of knowledge. Therefore. this study aims to investigate the effect of different GO and ZnO concentrations on the synergistic antimicrobial activity of GO/ZnO nanocomposite. The GO nanosheets are firstly synthesized from graphite using modified Hummer’s method. then added into ZnO nanoparticle suspension to form GO/ZnO nanocomposite via ultrasonication. The concentrations of GO/ZnO are varied at 1: 4. 2: 3. 3: 2. 4: 1 wt% while neat GO nanosheet as control. The chemical properties of synthesized GO/ZnO nanocomposites are examined with FTIR.

1092095,Improve of Direct Dye (Direct Orange 46) Sorption on Pretreated Cotton Fabric by Cationic Agent,2011,Y Khanjani and K Farizadeh and S Ahmadi,11,Journal of Applied Chemical Research,,8,,The sorption properties of direct dye on bleached cotton and cationized cotton (treated with Cibafix WFF) was studied. Cationization of cotton fabric at different conditions (time and cationic agent concentration) wasinvestigated. Nitrogen content of cotton samples pretreated with cationic agent were determined by Kjeldahl method. The results showed that at higher cationizing treatment time and initial cationic agent concentration lead to higher nitrogen content on cotton fabric. The adsorption isotherm of Direct Orange 46 (DO46) on cationized cotton was tested by fitting the adsorption data with Langmuir and Frendlich. Standard adsorption affinity of direct dyes on cationized cotton was measured. The results showed that standard affinity value is negative. This indicated that the adsorption of DO46 on cationized cotton is an exothermic process. According to results. the adsorption of direct dye on cationized cotton is more than bleached cotton. It is clear that the present of cationic group on cationized cotton fabric causes more attractionf or sorption of inionic dyes.,True,T5Sk8fwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=251875,14678253590335733626,/scholar?cites=14678253590335733626,,https://www.sid.ir/en/VEWSSID/J_pdf/1010820111801.pdf,0,0,0

Firas Taher Maher. Nazar Ahmed Naji,Background: Obesity is a multifaceted condition and represents a pandemic that needs urgent attention. Obesity. both directly and indirectly. increases the risk for a variety of disease conditions including diabetes. hypertension. liver disease. and certain cancers. which in turn. decreases the overall lifespan in both men and women. Leptin most likely indicates satiety and fullness of energy stores under physiological conditions. but obesity is characterized by hyperleptinemia and hypothalamic leptin resistance. Many studies have found association between obesity leading to oxidative stress and diabetes mellitus type 2. and many others have shown that the level of ROS increase in obesity.Methods: In this study conducted on 176 individuals in the age group from (20-55) years. from Tikrit and Kirkuk Governorates. Blood samples were divided into three groups according to BMI: Group One: Control group (Normal Weight): 66 individual (32 male. 34 female). BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m2).

It is found that the prepared photocatalyst material is well keeping the mix crystal structure with mass fraction ratio 79: 21 of anatase to rutile. The photocatalytic degradation capability of the photocatalyst material on methylene blue was investigated. The results show that when the mass concentration of binder in the dipping solution is 5 g/L. the weight loss rate of TiO2/ACF is low. which indicates that the loading intensity of TiO2 is high. When the mass concentration of binder in the dipping solution is 15 g/L. the highest TiO2 loading intensity is 65%. When the mass concentration of the binder in the dipping solution is 25 g/L. the degradation rate of methylene blue on TiO2/ACF is the highest.

Increased High Mobility Group Protein 1 (HMGB1). an inflammatory mediator. and Dickkopf-Related Protein (DKK1). a Wnt/β-catenin signaling antagonist. affect the blood-brain-barrier and induce neurotoxic effects and neurocognitive deficits. Aim of the study: The present study aims to examine HMGB1 and DDK1 in non-responders to treatments with antipsychotics (NRTT. n= 60). partial RTT (PRTT. n= 55) and healthy controls (n= 43) in relation to established markers of schizophrenia including IL-6. IL-10 and CLL11 (eotaxin); and to delineate whether these proteins are associated with the schizophrenia symptom subdomains and neurocognitive impairments. Results: HMGB1. DKK1. IL-6 and CCL11 were significantly higher in schizophrenia patients than in controls. DKK1 and IL-6 were significantly higher in NRTT than in PRTT and controls while IL-10 was higher in NRTT than in controls. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that schizophrenia was best predicted by increased DDK1 and HMGB1 while NRTT (versus PRTT) was best predicted by increased IL-6 and CCL11 levels. A large part of the variance in psychosis. hostility. excitation. mannerism and negative (PHEMN) symptoms. and formal thought disorders was explained by HMGB1.

Since AISI 304 consists of chromium. nickel. and other materials. understanding the performance of this material is different from its parent material (ie. iron oxide). Here. the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of AISI 304 on various electrolyte solutions (ie. KOH. NaOH. and NaCl). The electrolyte solution selection is an important parameter for getting high efficiency in the electrolysis process. To precisely investigate the effect of the electrolyte solution on the performance of AISI 304. several analyses were conducted: weight loss method measurement and scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The result showed that the AISI 304 had low corrosion rate in all electrolyte solution variations. The low corrosion rate of AISI 304 can be obtained due to the existence of chromium oxide which can be identified by EDS. During the immersion of AISI 304 into electrolyte solution. pitting corrosion in the microstructure level was formed. detected by the SEM analysis.

The physical and the thermal properties of the PBAT/MWCNT nanocomposites were investigated using various techniques. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements revealed that the MWCNTs were efficiently modified with DEA. Scanning electron micrographs of the nanocomposites indicated that the modified MWCNTs were dispersed homogeneously in PBAT. The thermal stability of the nanocomposite decreased with increase in the content of epoxy-MWCNT-DEA due to the poor thermal stabilities of epoxy and amino silane DEA. However. the surface hydrophobicity of the nanocomposite increased. The highest stress (170% of PBAT) was observed when the content of epoxy-MWCNT-DEA in the nanocomposite was 2 wt%.,True,i0wb8YgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201711656708226.page,,,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201711656708226.pdf,0,0,0

1092128,Pb (II) removal from aqueous solution by adsorption on activated carbon from kiwi peel.,2018,Mostafa Rahimnejad and Kasra Pirzadeh and Iman Mahdavi and Seyed Mohsen Peyghambarzadeh,17,Environmental Engineering & Management Journal (EEMJ),6,,,A new low-cost activated carbon was developed from kiwi peel for removing Pb (II) from aqueous solution. The adsorbent characteristics were determined by different analyses such as BET. FTIR and SEM. The adsorbent demonstrated remarkable characteristics such as high surface area (306.18 m2. g-1) and large total pore volume (0.4810 cm3. g-1). The effect of pH. contact time. initial concentration. shaking rate and adsorbent dosage on the Pb removal efficiency was investigated. It was found that the optimum pH for removing Pb (II) was 6. The equilibrium experimental data were analyzed by several model isotherms. The adsorption models were found to fit the experimental data in the order of Freundlich> Langmuir> Tempkin. The maximum adsorption capacity of Pb (II) adsorbed by kiwi peel-based activated carbon. was 158.82 µg. g-1. The kinetics of Pb (II) adsorption was investigated using different kinetics models. Experimental results were well fitted with pseudo-second-order model. It could be inferred from the results that kiwi peel is a promising and cost effective raw material for the removal of contaminants from wastewaters.,True,-cgiZQ8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mostafa_Rahimnejad/publication/281998716_Pb_II_removal_from_aqueous_solution_by_adsorption_on_activated_carbon_from_kiwi_peel/links/5c88904d45851564fad9d549/Pb-II-removal-from-aqueous-solution-by-adsorption-on-activated-carbon-from-kiwi-peel.pdf,5518744150288104848,/scholar?cites=5518744150288104848,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mostafa_Rahimnejad/publication/281998716_Pb_II_removal_from_aqueous_solution_by_adsorption_on_activated_carbon_from_kiwi_peel/links/5c88904d45851564fad9d549/Pb-II-removal-from-aqueous-solution-by-adsorption-on-activated-carbon-from-kiwi-peel.pdf,0,0,0

Beragam jenis tanaman dapat dikembangkan sebagai sumber karbohidrat. antara lain tanaman umbi-umbian. yang salah satunya adalah famili Dioscoreaceae. Tanaman uwi memiliki berpotensi sangat besar sebagai pangan alternatif. Budidaya tanaman uwi cukup mudah dan tidak memerlukan perawatan khusus. namun bila dilakukan dengan budidaya yang tepat. tentu akan menambahkan keuntungan bagi petani karena akan menghasilkan umbi yang besar-besar. Namun. saat ini keberadaan uwi lokal di Indonesia mulai tergusur. Keengganan petani untuk menanam uwi disebabkan nilai ekonomi yang rendah dan belum tereksplorasinya manfaat dari uwi. Oleh karena itu. sangat diperlukan dukungan ketersediaan bahan baku berupa teknologi budidaya uwi yang baik dan benar. serta teknologi pengolahan uwi sebagai bahan pangan fungsional dan diversifikasi pangan. Prospek uwi sebagai bahan diversifikasi pangan dapat dilakukan dengan mengembangkan produk olahan uwi menjadi produk setengah jadi seperti tepung. yang dapat digunakan untuk diversifikasi menjadi bentuk olahan makanan lain. Pengolahan tepung uwi menjadi makanan modern seperti cake. flakes. muffin. bihun atau mie. atau sebagai pengental pudding. saus dan vla.,True,FmKPvfwAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,https://baristandsamarinda.kemenperin.go.id/download/proceeding/2017_semnas1/Hal_132-141_Ok.pdf,8676799786828192493,/scholar?cites=8676799786828192493,,https://baristandsamarinda.kemenperin.go.id/download/proceeding/2017_semnas1/Hal_132-141_Ok.pdf,0,0,0

Pérez-Gómez,,Journal of Chemistry,,1-13,Hindawi,This article reports on the preparation of iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) supported in chitosan beads (Chi-EDGE-Fe) for removing aldrin from aqueous solutions. The FeNPs and Chi-EDGE-Fe beads were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). and the Mössbauer spectroscopy (MS) techniques. TEM. XRD. and MS showed that the FeNPs had core-shell structures consisting of a core of either Fe0 or Fe2B and a shell of magnetite. Furthermore. SEM images showed that Chi-EDGE-Fe beads were spherical with irregular surfaces and certain degrees of roughness and porosity. whilst the sorbent mean pore size was 204 nm. and the occluded iron nanoparticles in the chitosan material had diameters of 70 nm and formed agglomerates. The sorbent beads consisted of carbon. oxygen. chlorine. aluminum. silicon. and iron according to the SEM-EDS analysis. Functional groups such as O-H. C-H. -CH2. N-H. C-O. C-OH. and Fe-OH were detected in the FTIR spectra. In addition. a characteristic band appeared at about 1700 cm−1 after the sorption process involving aldrin.
