105501,Identification of DIABLO. a mammalian protein that promotes apoptosis by binding to and antagonizing IAP proteins,2000,Anne M Verhagen and Paul G Ekert and Miha Pakusch and John Silke and Lisa M Connolly and Gavin E Reid and Robert L Moritz and Richard J Simpson and David L Vaux,102,cell,1,43-53,Cell Press,To identify proteins that bind mammalian IAP homolog A (MIHA. also known as XIAP). we used coimmunoprecipitation and 2D immobilized pH gradient/SDS PAGE. followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. DIABLO (direct IAP binding protein with low pI) is a novel protein that can bind MIHA and can also interact with MIHB and MIHC and the baculoviral IAP. OpIAP. The N-terminally processed. IAP-interacting form of DIABLO is concentrated in membrane fractions in healthy cells but released into the MIHA-containing cytosolic fractions upon UV irradiation. As transfection of cells with DIABLO was able to counter the protection afforded by MIHA against UV irradiation.

Their expression is induced by cytokine activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway and they act as a negative feedback loop by subsequently inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway either by direct interaction with activated JAKs or with the receptors. These interactions are mediated at least in part by the SH2 domain of SOCS proteins but these proteins also contain a highly conserved C-terminal homology domain termed the SOCS box. Here we show that the SOCS box mediates interactions with elongins B and C. which in turn may couple SOCS proteins and their substrates to the proteasomal protein degradation pathway.

Most exported proteins require a conserved motif (RxLxE/Q/D). termed the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL) or vacuolar targeting sequence (VTS). for targeting beyond the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and into the host cell; however. the precise role of this motif in export is poorly defined. We used transgenic P. falciparum expressing chimeric proteins to investigate the function of the PEXEL motif for export. The PEXEL constitutes a bifunctional export motif comprising a protease recognition sequence that is cleaved. in the endoplasmic reticulum. from proteins destined for export. in a PEXEL arginine‐ and leucine‐dependent manner.

Each mass spectrometer can generate data at an astonishingly high rate. and the scope of what is searched for is continually increasing. Therefore solutions for improving our ability to perform these searches are needed. We present a sequence database search engine that is specifically designed to run efficiently on the Hadoop MapReduce distributed computing framework. The search engine implements the K-score algorithm. generating comparable output for the same input files as the original implementation. The scalability of the system is shown. and the architecture required for the development of such distributed processing is discussed.

Although formerly regarded as extracellular pathogen. it has been shown that S. aureus can also be internalized by host cells and persist within these cells. In the present study. we comparatively analyzed survival and physiological adaptation of S. aureus HG001 after internalization by two human lung epithelial cell lines (S9 and A549). and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). Combining enrichment of bacteria from host-pathogen assays by cell sorting and quantitation of the pathogen´s proteome by mass spectrometry we characterized S. aureus adaptation during the initial phase between 2.5 h and 6.5 h post-infection. Starting with about 2x106 bacteria. roughly 1.450 S. aureus proteins. including virulence factors and metabolic enzymes were identified by spectral comparison and classical database searches. Most of the bacterial adaptation reactions. such as decreases in levels of ribosomal proteins and metabolic enzymes or increases in amounts of proteins involved in arginine and lysine biosynthesis. coding for terminal oxidases and stress responsive genes or activation of the sigma factor SigB were observed after internalization into any of the three cell lines studied. However. differences were noted in central carbon metabolism including regulation of fermentation and threonine degradation.

Research efforts predominantly focus on P. falciparum because of the clinical severity of infection and associated mortality rates. However. P. vivax malaria affects more people in a wider global range. Furthermore. unlike P. falciparum. P. vivax can persist in the liver as dormant hypnozoites that can be activated weeks to years after primary infection. causing relapse of symptomatic blood stages. This feature makes P. vivax unique and difficult to eliminate with the standard tools of vector control and treatment of symptomatic blood stage infection with antimalarial drugs. Infection by Plasmodium is initiated by the mosquito-transmitted sporozoite stage. a highly motile invasive cell that targets hepatocytes in the liver. The most advanced malaria vaccine for P. falciparum (RTS.S. a subunit vaccine containing of a portion of the major sporozoite surface protein) conferred limited protection in Phase III trials. falling short of WHO-established vaccine efficacy goals. However. blocking the sporozoite stage of infection in P. vivax. before the establishment of the chronic liver infection. might be an effective malaria vaccine strategy to reduce the occurrence of relapsing blood stages. It is also thought that a multivalent vaccine comprising multiple sporozoite surface antigens will provide better protection. but a comprehensive analysis of proteins in P. vivax sporozoites is not available.

HIV-1 binding and fusion with the DC membrane results in low level de novo infection that can also be transferred to T lymphocytes at a later stage.

Here we show that CD45+ microvesicles (MV) which contaminate purified HIV-1 inocula due to similar size and density. affect DC maturation. de novo HIV-1 infection and transfer to T lymphocytes. Comparing iMDDCs infected with CD45-depleted HIV-1BaL or matched non-depleted preparations. the presence of CD45+ MVs was shown to enhance DC maturation and ICAM-1 (CD54) expression. which is involved in DC∶T lymphocyte interactions. while restricting HIV-1 infection of MDDCs. Furthermore. in the DC culture HIV-1 infected (p24+) MDDCs were more mature than bystander cells. Depletion of MVs from the HIV-1 inoculum markedly inhibited DC∶T lymphocyte clustering and the induction of alloproliferation as well as limiting HIV-1 transfer from DCs to T lymphocytes.

Sequence analysis was performed on six peptides yielding 78 unique amino acid assignments. this corresponds to approximately 10% of the molecule. These peptides share sequence similarities with three heat shock proteins. Drosophila hsp 83 (83% homologous). yeast hsp 90 (55%) and chicken hsp 108 (32%).

This is particularly true for the equine species. Here we present a first Equine PeptideAtlas encompassing high‐resolution tandem MS analyses of 51 samples representing a selection of equine tissues and body fluids from healthy and diseased animals. The raw data were processed through the Trans‐Proteomic Pipeline to yield high quality identification of proteins and peptides. The current release comprises 24 131 distinct peptides representing 2636 canonical proteins observed at false discovery rates of 0.2% at the peptide level and 1.4% at the protein level.

The Proteomics Research Group (PRG) of the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) has sponsored a number of research studies designed to enable participants to try new techniques and assess their capabilities relative to other laboratories analyzing the same samples. Presented here are results from three PRG studies representing different samples that are typically analyzed in a core facility. ranging from simple protein identification to targeted analyses. and include intentional challenges to reflect realistic studies.

Although the MHC class I immunopeptidome is ubiquitous in mammals and represents a critical component of the immune system. very little is known. in any species. about its composition across most tissues and organs in vivo. We applied mass spectrometry (MS) technologies to draft the first tissue-based atlas of the murine MHC class I immunopeptidome in health.
