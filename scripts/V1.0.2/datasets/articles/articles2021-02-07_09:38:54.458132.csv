69203,[30] Microsomal lipid peroxidation,1978,John A Buege and Steven D Aust,52,,,302-310,Academic press,This chapter discusses microsomal lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a complex process known to occur in both plants and animals. It involves the formation and propagation of lipid radicals. the uptake of oxygen. a rearrangement of the double bonds in unsaturated lipids. and the eventual destruction of membrane lipids. producing a variety of breakdown products. including alcohols. ketones. aldehydes. and ethers. Biological membranes are often rich in unsaturated fatty acids and bathed in an oxygen-rich. metal-containing fluid. Lipid peroxidation begins with the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from an unsaturated fatty acid. resulting in the formation of a lipid radical. The formation of lipid endoperoxides in unsaturated fatty acids containing at least 3 methylene interrupted double bonds can lead to the formation of malondialdehyde as a breakdown product.

69205,Role of metals in oxygen radical reactions,1985,Steven D Aust and Lee A Morehouse and Craig E Thomas,1,,1,3-25,Pergamon,Partially-reduced forms of dioxygen or “oxy-radicals”(superoxide. O 2⨪ HO 2·; hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2; hydroxyl radical· OH) and oxidants of comparable reactivity are implicated in an increasing number of physiological. toxicological. and pathological states. Transition metal catalysis is recognized as being integral to the generation and the reactions of these activated oxygen species. Factors such as pH and chelation govern the reactivity of the transition metals with dioxygen and “oxy-radicals” and therefore influence the apparent mechanisms by which oxidative damage to phospholipids. DNA. and other biomolecules is initiated. In biological systems the concentrations of redox-active transition metals capable of catalyzing these reactions appears to be relatively low.

69207,Transition metals as catalysts of “autoxidation” reactions,1990,Dennis M Miller and Garry R Buettner and Steven D Aust,8,,1,95-108,Pergamon,Superoxide (O 2− ̇. hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). and hydroxyl radical (· OH) produced from the “autoxidation” of biomolecules. such as ascorbate. catecholamines. or thiols. have been implicated in numerous toxicities. However. the direct reaction of dioxygen with the vast majority of biomolecules. including those listed above. is spin forbidden. a condition which imposes a severe kinetic limitation on this reaction pathway. Therefore. an alternate mechanism must be invoked to explain the “autoxidations” reactions frequently reported. Transition metals are efficient catalysts of redox reactions and their reactons with dioxygen are not spin restricted. Therefore it is likely that the “autoxidation” observed for many biomolecules is. in fact. metal catalyzed. In this paper we discuss: 1) the quantum mechanic. thermodynamic. and kinetic aspects of the reaction of dioxygen with biomolecules; 2) the involvement of …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:sA9dB-pw3HoC,900,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089158499090148C,15916353594321900477,/scholar?cites=15916353594321900477,,,0,0,0
69208,Mechanisms white rot fungi use to degrade pollutants,1994,David P Barr and Steven D Aust,28,Environmental science & technology,2,78A-87A,American Chemical Society,In recent years the possibility of using white rot fungi for bioremediation strategies has initiated considerable re-search effort in academic. industrial. and government in-stitutions. The interest in this subject arises from the ability of white rot fungi to degrade an ex-tremely diverserange of very persistent or toxic environmental pollut-ants. This ability sets the use of white rot fungi apart from many of the ex-isting methods of bioremediation. Perhaps the easiest way to under-stand the nonspecific ability of these fungi to degrade pollutants is to consider their ecological“niche.” White rot fungi are those organisms that are able to degrade lignin. the structural polymer found in woody plants. Lignin is a very complex three-dimensional poly-mer consisting of nonrepeating phenyl propanoid units linked by various carbon-carbon and ether bonds (Figure 1)(I).

69209,The requirement for iron (III) in the initiation of lipid peroxidation by iron (II) and hydrogen peroxide.,1987,Giorgio Minotti and SD Aust,262,Journal of Biological Chemistry,3,1098-1104,Elsevier,The initiation of lipid peroxidation by Fe2+ and H2O2 (Fenton's reagent) is often proposed to be mediated by the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Using Fe2+. H2O2. and phospholipid liposomes as a model system. we have found that lipid peroxidation. as assessed by malondialdehyde formation. is not initiated by the hydroxyl radical. but rather requires Fe3+ and Fe2+. EPR spin trapping with 5.5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide and the bleaching of para-nitrosodimethylaniline confirmed the generation of the hydroxyl radical in this system. Accordingly. catalase and the hydroxyl radical scavengers mannitol and benzoate efficiently inhibited the generation and the detection of hydroxyl radical. However. catalase. mannitol. and benzoate could either stimulate or inhibit lipid peroxidation.

69210,Superoxide-and singlet oxygen-catalyzed lipid peroxidation as a possible mechanism for paraquat (methyl viologen) toxicity,1974,JS Bus and SD Aust and JE Gibson,58,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,3,749-755,Academic Press,Paraquat was reduced by mouse lung microsome when incubated anaerobically with NADPH. The reaction was inhibited by the addition of antibody to rat liver NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. In the presence of NADPH and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. paraquat increased the invitro peroxidation of rat liver microsomal lipid. The peroxidation was inhibited by superoxide dismutase and the singlet oxygen trapping agent 1.3-diphenylisobenzofuran. It is suggested that paraquat toxicity may be mediated through the transfer of a single electron from reduced paraquat to oxygen and thus form superoxide ion. Singlet oxygen may form from superoxide and subsequently react with lipids to form fatty acid hydroperoxides.,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:yxmsSjX2EkcC,640,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X7480481X,12983920230751567049,/scholar?cites=12983920230751567049,,,0,0,0

Activity was inhibited by superoxide dismutase but markedly stimulated by the addition of catalase. Xanthine oxidase-dependent iron release from ferritin. measured spectrophotometrically using the ferrous iron chelator 2.2'-dipyridyl. was also inhibited by superoxide dismutase. suggesting that superoxide can mediate the reductive release of iron from ferritin. Potassium superoxide in crown ether also promoted superoxide dismutase-inhibitable release of iron from ferritin. Catalase had little effect on the rate of iron release from ferritin; thus hydrogen peroxide appears to inhibit lipid peroxidation by preventing the formation of an initiating species rather than by inhibiting iron release from ferritin.

Preformed LOOH are decomposed by Fe(II) to highly reactive lipid alkoxyl radicals. which in turn promote the formation of new LOOH. However. in the absence of LOOH. both Fe2+ and Fe3+ must be available to initiate lipid peroxidation. with optimum activity occurring as the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio approaches unity. The simultaneous availability of Fe2+ and Fe3+ can be achieved by oxidizing some Fe2+ with hydrogen peroxide or with chelators that favor autoxidation of Fe2+ by molecular oxygen. Alternatively. one can use Fe3+ and reductants like superoxide. ascorbate or thiols. In either case excess Fe2+ oxidation or Fe3+ reduction will inhibit lipid peroxidation by converting all the iron to the Fe3+ or Fe2+ form. respectively.

P. chrysosporium is able to degrade toxic or insoluble chemicals more efficiently than other microorganisms. P. chrysosporium has a range of oxidative and reductive mechanisms and uses highly reactive. nonspecific redox mediators which increase the number of chemicals that can be effectively degraded.

The autoxidation of citrate2+ could in turn promote the peroxidation of microsomal phospholipid liposomes. as judged by malondialdehyde formation. At low citrateFe2+ ratios the autoxidation of Fe2+ was slow and the formation of malondialdehyde was preceded by a lag phase. The lag phase evidence of this. linear initial rates of lipid peroxidation were obtained via the combination of citrateFe2+ and citrateFe3+. optimum activity occurring at a Fe3+Fe2+ ratio of 1:1. Evidence is also presented to suggest that the superoxide and the hydrogen peroxide that are formed during the autoxidation of citrateFe2+ can either stimulate or inhibit lipid peroxidation by affecting the yield of citrateFe3+ from citrateFe2+.

This suggests that a product of ferrous autoxidation is required to initiate lipid peroxidation. This autoxidation product is apparently ferric iron. rather than the oxygen radicals which also result from ferrous autoxidation.

69228,Degradation of environmental pollutants byPhanerochaete chrysosporium,1990,Steven D Aust,20,Microbial ecology,1,197-209,Springer-Verlag,The white rot fungi appear to be unique in their ability to degrade lignin by the secretion of hydrogen peroxide and a family of peroxidases now referred to as lignin peroxidases or simply ligninases. The fact that these enzymes are naturally secreted and seem to be capable of initiating the oxidation of lignin by a free-radical mechanism led to the proposal and demonstration that the white rot fungi are able to degrade a wide variety of normally very recalcitrant environmental pollutants. The mineralization of chemicals byPhanerochaete chrysosporium does seem to be dependent upon the lignin degrading system. Thus it should be possible to at least initiate degradation extracellularly. eliminating the need for absorption of the chemical.

The reaction is inhibited by the superoxide dismutase activity of erythrocuprein. The reaction is also inhibited by 1.3-diphenylisobenzofuran. which reacts with singlet oxygen to yield dibenzoylbenzene. During inhibition of the lipid peroxidation reaction by 1.3-diphenylisobenzofuran. o-dibenzoylbenzene was produced. The rate of superoxide production by xanthine oxidase was not affected by 1.3-diphenylisobenzofuran. Lipid peroxidation promoted by ascorbic acid is not inhibited by either erythrocuprein or 1.3-diphenylisobenzofuran.

69233,Free radicals in toxicology,1993,SD Aust and CF Chignell and TM Bray and B Kalyanaraman and RP Mason,120,,2,168-178,Academic Press,Free radicals are recognized more and more frequently as being involved in the mechanism of toxicity of chemicals. In some cases. the organic radicals are involved. but often oxygen radicals result from redox cycling chemicals. Free radicals are usually very reactive. which. in addition to causing toxicities. can make them difficult to detect. Electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques are frequently used. but generally the radicals must be trapped to form a more stable radical for detection. Quantitation is therefore often very difficult. Free radicals of many xenobiotics are formed during their metabolism by enzymes such as cytochrome P450 or peroxidases. In some cases. chemicals can redox cycle using reductases. such as cytochrome P450 reductase. which can catalyze one-electron reductions.

69237,The role of iron in oxygen radical mediated lipid peroxidation,1989,Giorgio Minotti and Steven D Aust,71,,1,1-19,Elsevier,The role of iron in the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids is reviewed. especially with respect to the involvement of oxygen radicals. The hydroxyl radical can be generated by a superoxide-driven Haber-Weiss reaction or by Fenton's reaction; and the hydroxyl radical can initiate lipid peroxidation. However. lipid peroxidation is frequently insensitive to hydroxyl radical scavengers or superoxide dismutase. We propose that the hydroxyl radical may not be involved in the peroxidation of membrane lipids. but instead lipid peroxidation requires both Fe2+ and Fe3+. The inability of superoxide dismutase to affect lipid peroxidation can be explained by the fact that the direct reduction of iron can occur. exemplified by rat liver microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation.

Unfortunately. the transient nature of lipid hydroperoxides and their decomposition products makes quantitative detection very difficult. There is a big difference between obtaining evidence for the existence of in vivo lipid peroxidation and determining its relative severity or rate of reaction. Similarly. there is a major difference between determining the susceptibility of a tissue or preparation to lipid peroxidation vs. its capacity to catalyze (or initiate) that process. Lipid peroxidation involves reactions of radicals where each step may have initiation propagation and/or termination phases. each of which can be influenced by a wide variety of factors. These factors include the nature of the lipid. the presence of antioxidants or antioxidant systems. the mechanism of initiation. etc. Lipid peroxidation can be initiated by enzymes which catalyze the formation of lipid hydroperoxides such as soybean lipoxygenase. by other radicals or by substances which secondarily give rise to radicals. as well as by certain types of chelated iron-oxygen com-plexes. Initiation of lipid peroxidation by an iron-oxygen complex requires reduction of the iron. Many chemicals. enzymes. and enzyme systems can directly or indirectly reduce iron and can therefore initiate lipid peroxidation.

In the absence of ADP‐Fe3+ or in the presence of superoxide dismutase there is complete inhibition of enzymatic peroxidation. Initiation of peroxidation likely occurs through an ADP‐perferryl ion complex formed by ADP‐Fe3+ and superoxide. Use of the singlet oxygen trapping agent 2.5‐diphenylfuran showed that singlet oxygen does not participate in the initiation of peroxidation but rather in the propagation of peroxidation. The mechanisms of NADPH‐cytochrome P450 reductase‐catalyzed and ADP‐Fe2+ catalyzed lipid peroxidation parallel that of xanthine oxidase in that initiation occurs through a superoxide dismutase‐sensitive reaction and that singlet oxygen is present during propagation of lipid …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:j8SEvjWlNXcC,176,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1978.tb07022.x,6455367745429106455,/scholar?cites=6455367745429106455,,,0,0,0

These systems were also compared to hydroxyl radical-dependent lipid peroxidation in order to determine the physiological significance of the different mechanisms of lipid peroxidation. Fenton's reagent very readily promotes lipid peroxidation. which is inhibited by catalase and hydroxyl radical traps but not by superoxide dismutase. However. the addition of ADP to Fenton's reagent results in a type of lipid peroxidation that is not inhibited by hydroxyl radical traps and the amount of hydroxyl radical spin trap adducts formed is much less. Xanthine oxidase-promoted lipid peroxidation is not inhibited by catalase and is greatly stimulated by ADP. Microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation is also dramatically stimulated by ADP in Tris buffer but not in phosphate buffer. Hydroxyl radical traps are without effect in both microsomes and xanthine oxidase-promoted lipid peroxidation.

This damage is apparently oxidative in nature and is generally considered to be the result of excessive superoxide (O2− and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Since neither O2− nor H2O2 cause oxidative damage in the absence of iron. we proposed that the oxidative processes are caused by the released of iron during reperfusion.

From a historical perspective. many have proposed that iron functions as a Fenton’s reagent in the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction. the hydroxyl radical (-OH) serving as the initiator [l-31. However. it now appears that. OH is not the actual initiator; rather. iron complexes. involving both Fe (I1) and Fe (III). are generated that initiate lipid peroxidation or are intermediates in formation of the ultimate initiator [2. 31. In addition. certain ferrous complexes or hematin reductively homolyze endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides. yielding alkoxyl and/or peroxyl radicals.

TNT wastes generated during TNT production and munitions manufacturing. as well as improper storage. use. and disposal have led to contamination of the environment (67. 94).

Hydrazines are often oxidized slowly by peroxidases due. in part. to hydrazine-dependent inactivation of these enzymes. Peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of hydrazines may be dramatically affected by an efficient peroxidase substrate. We investigated this hypothesis in a model system using the well-known peroxidase substrate chlorpromazine (CPZ) and the hydrazine derivative isoniazid. CPZ stimulated isoniazid oxidation as measured by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and O2 consumption. The kinetics of isoniazid and CPZ oxidation by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of both compounds suggested CPZ was acting as an electron transfer mediator between HRP and isoniazid.

Native LiP was a pentacoordinate. high-spin ferric iron with a high-spin absorption band at 634 nm and g values at 5.86 and 2.07 in the EPR spectrum. Upon thermal inactivation. calcium ions were released from the enzyme and the Soret absorption decreased and red-shifted about 2 nm. the high-spin absorption band at 634 nm disappeared. and a low-spin absorption band appeared at 532 nm. The EPR spectrum and the temperature dependence of electronic absorption spectra revealed that the heme iron of the thermally inactivated enzyme was a mixture of high- and low-spin states. which was further supported by the changes in the electronic absorption and EPR spectra when cyanide was added to the thermally inactivated enzyme.

This study examined the variations in phosphate found in ferritins from horse spleen. rat liver. and bovine liver. The amount of phosphate varied inversely with the amount of iron present in the core. Theoretical extrapolation showed that in the absence of phosphate approximately 4400 atoms of iron could be incorporated into ferritin. Reconstitution of ferritin with iron and ceruloplasmin followed by prolonged incubation with phosphate produced cores similar to native ferritin in terms of iron to phosphate ratios and rates of iron release. However. ferritin reconstituted in the presence of phosphate differed markedly from native ferritins. The data suggest that phosphate is an integral part of mammalian ferritin cores and influences both core formation and the ease by which iron is released from ferritin.,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:mNrWkgRL2YcC,42,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986183713081,9548327620032361660,/scholar?cites=9548327620032361660,,,0,0,0

Ascorbate will reduce many substrate radicals as rapidly as they are generated by a peroxidase. This ensures a constant substrate concentration during the peroxidase reaction.

The rate of reaction of CPZ with HRP-I is slow enough that it can be measured using pseudo-first-order conditions maintained by a minimum 10-fold excess of CPZ. or by the addition of ascorbate at very low CPZ concentrations.

Rat ceruloplasmin was found to be more resistant to plasmin-mediated proteolysis than was human ceruloplasmin. Although both proteins were cleaved initially to products with apparent molecular weights of 116.000 and 20.000 Da. rat ceruloplasmin was resistant to further proteolysis. whereas the human enzyme was cleaved to smaller fragments. Primary structure differences could account for the different relative stabilities between the two enzymes.

69359,Lipid peroxidation as a proposed mechanism for paraquat toxicity,1977,JAMES S Bus and STEVEN D Aust and JAMES E Gibson,,Biochemical mechanisms of paraquat toxicity,,157-174,Academic Press New York,A specific mechanism is proposed for paraquat pulmonary toxi—city which involves a cyclic single electron reduction-oxida—tion of paraquat with subsequent sequential generation of superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen and initiation of membrane lipid peroxidation. In vitro. mouse lung microsomes catalyzed an NADPH—dependent paraquat reduction. Incubation of paraquat in a system which promoted its reduction—oxidation stimulated peroxidation of microsomal lipid. which was inhibited by addition of superoxide dismutase or a singlet oxygen trapping agent. In vivo pretreatment of mice with phenobarbital decreased paraquat toxicity. possibly by competing for NADPH—supplied electrons which might otherwise reduce para—quat. In contrast. paraquat toxicity in mice was increased by exposure to 100% oxygen and by deficiencies of the antioxi—dants vitamin E and reduced glutathione (GSH). Inhibition of GSH peroxidase. an enzyme which prevents peroxidative reactions. by selenium deficiency or administration of tri—o—cresyl phosphate also enhanced paraquat toxicity. In addition. paraquat administration to mice decreased concentrations of the water soluble antioxidant GSH in liver and of lipid soluble antioxidants in lung. Oxygen tolerant rats. which have increased activities of pulmonary enzymes which combat lipid peroxidation. were also tolerant to lethal doses of paraquat. Furthermore. rats chronically exposed to 100 ppm paraquat in the water had elevated pulmonary activities of glucose—6—phosphate dehydrogenase and GSH reductase.

Iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation has been studied in many in vitro model systems. While the mechanism of iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation is not completely understood. it is well established that the redox chemistry of iron influences both the occurrence and the rate of lipid peroxidation. For example. iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation in systems comprises initially of Fe(II) and phospholipid liposomes requires some Fe(II) oxidation. Conversely. iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation in systems containing Fe(III) and phospholipid liposomes requires some Fe(III) reduction. However. complete Fe(II) oxidation or complete Fe(III) reduction results in conditions that do not promote lipid peroxidation.

The catalytic activity of citrate-Fe3+ corresponds. on a molar basis. to 0.03% of that of copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase. Although weak. this activity enables citrate-Fe3+ to inhibit superoxide and ADP-Fe3+-dependent peroxidation of extracted microsomal lipids.

69372,Thiobarbituric acid assay reactants,1994,Steven D Aust,1,Methods in Toxicology,,367-376,,Numerous toxins are thought to be toxic through their ability to cause lipid per-Oxidation. Chemicals such as paraquat. Adriamycin (Adria. Chicago. IL). and carbon tetrachloride can cause lipid peroxidation. and as such lipid peroxidation is often referred to as the “mechanism of toxicity.” Lipid peroxidation is also thought to occur. and perhaps cause. cell death by toxins that indirectly affect some biochemical function or activity that in turn affects lipid peroxidation. An example of a more indirect mechanism would be by toxins that affect glutathione (GSH) metabolism. as GSH is required for the metabolism of hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides by glutathione peroxidase and for the maintenance of protein thiols (1). Upon depletion of GSH. protection from lipid peroxidation is lost (2). Bromobenzene (3) and paracetamol (4) are toxins that can cause liver necrosis by depleting tissue GSH levels. and their toxicity can be decreased by N-acetylcysteine. a precursor to cysteine which is required for the synthesis of GSH (5–7). Lipid peroxidation can also occur as a consequence of tissue damage. perhaps contributing to cell death. There is considerable interest lately in the role of iron in lipid peroxidation (8). Therefore. chemicals that may affect the chemistry or biochemistry of cellular iron may in turn cause lipid peroxidation. Iron metabolism might be affected either directly or indirectly. For example. chemicals that enter redox reactions to generate superoxide and their respective organic radicals. both of which will release iron from ferritin. although the organic radicals are much more efficient than superoxide. can cause lipid peroxidation (9. 10 …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:q3CdL3IzO_QC,35,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NvEkBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA367&dq=info:DeutkGbScXEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=fivvr1ugQN&sig=TFwwHvkB7ugzmiQGx0l2HdtF9yw,8174546136609975053,/scholar?cites=8174546136609975053,,,0,0,0

Incubation of glutathione (GSH) and alloxan with rat liver ferritin resulted in release of ferrous iron as assayed by spectrophotometric detection of ferrous-bathophenanthroline complex formation. Neither GSH nor alloxan alone mediated iron release from ferritin. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase did not affect initial rates of iron release whereas ceruloplasmin was an effective inhibitor of iron release. The reaction of GSH with alloxan resulted in the formation of the alloxan radical which was detected by ESR spectroscopy and by following the increase in absorbance at 310 nm. In both instances. the addition of ferritin resulted in diminished alloxan radical detection. Incubation of GSH. alloxan. and ferritin with phospholipid liposomes also resulted in lipid peroxidation.

The I50 was estimated to be about 2–3 μm. In contrast. sodium cyanide binds to the native enzyme with an apparent sodium cyanide dissociation constant Kd of about 10 μm. Inhibition of the veratryl alcohol oxidase activity of LiP H2 by cyanide was reversible. Ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium mineralized cyanide at a rate that was proportional to the concentration of cyanide to 2 mm. The N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone—cyanyl radical adduct was observed by ESR spin trapping upon incubation of LiP H2 with H2O2 and sodium cyanide.

TNT is first reduced by the fungal mycelium to aminodinitrotoluenes and diaminonitrotoluenes. In a second phase. reduced TNT metabolites are oxidatively transformed and mineralized. The extracellular oxidative enzyme of the ligninolytic system of these fungi includes the lignin peroxidases (LiP) and the manganese-dependent peroxidases (MnP).

Inhibition was competitive with respect to veratryl alcohol (Ki = 1–2 μM) and uncompetitive with respect to H2O2.

Lipid peroxidation in this system was dependent upon transferrin as the source of iron; increasing the transferrin concentration resulted in increased rates of lipid peroxidation. Increasing the xanthine oxidase activity also caused increased rates of peroxidation. Catalase stimulated rates of peroxidation at all xanthine oxidase activities tested. Conditions resulting in the most rapid release of iron from transferrin (low pH. high ADP) did not promote the greatest rates of lipid peroxidation. indicating that at neutral pH. rates of lipid peroxidation may be limited by the availability of iron.

However. it has been impossible to show that either liver microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation or xanthine oxidase-dependent lipid peroxidation involves the hydroxyl radical. despite the fact that the hydroxyl radical is quite capable of promoting lipid peroxidation1. Catalase has no effect on microsomal lipid peroxidation2 and xanthine oxidase-dependent lipid peroxidation is often stimulated by catalase1. Lipid peroxidation can be initiated simply by the addition of Fe(II). If the iron does not oxidize rapidly. lipid peroxidation only occurs after a lag period.

69469,Microsomal oxygen radical generation-relationship to the initiation of lipid peroxidation,1988,Lee A Morehouse and Steven D Aust,1,Cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms,,2-19,CRC Press Boca Raton. FL,There is a growing body of literature implicating partially reduced forms of oxygen in numerous nutritional deficiencies. pathological and abnormal physiological states. and toxicities associated with various xenobiotics. These phenomena are often proposed to have a common etiology. the superoxide theory of oxygen toxicity. 1 Simply expressed. the theory states that the overproduction of oxygen radicals. or a compromised ability to scavenge them. results in oxidative damage to biomolecules and ultimately to cell death. However. overproduction of oxygen radicals or decreased scavenging has been mostly inferred from numerous in vitro studies. As of yet. it has not been possible to determine the absolute scavenging potential of cells. or what fraction of this potential is necessary to protect the cell from the normal intracellular fluxes of oxygen radicals it generates. Likewise. no threshold values for “toxic” fluxes of oxygen radicals have been established. Thus. careful quantitation of oxygen radical production by microsomes and. indeed. by other subcellular fractions and purified enzymes. is a crucial first step towards our eventual understanding of the potential significance of oxygen radical production in vivo. Another important aspect of research on oxygen radicals is the characterization of the conditions under which oxygen radical production can result in oxidative damage to biomolecules. The molecules of particular interest to many researchers in this field are phospholipids since. as the major components of biological membranes. they serve an important function in maintaining cellular integrity.

NJ,Chelated ferrous iron will initiate lipid peroxidation when added to aerobic incubations of lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. The efficiency and apparent mechanism of initiation is dependent upon the nature of the iron chelator (1. 2). For example. ferrous chelates of EDTA undergo rapid autoxidation. and generate the· 0Η (3). This can initiate peroxidation in lipids which are dispersed with detergent. however. EDTA-Fe^+ and other ferrous-chelates which promote* 0H formation during autoxidation do not initiate peroxidation of lipids which are in a liposomal configuration (2). Several lines of evidence indicate that a different mechanism is required to initiate peroxidation in liposomes or microsomes (4. 5).

It will be far more difficult to identify antioxidants which will be effective against aging and diseases as the macromolecules critically involved in many diseases have not been identified.  In addition. the mechanism by which these macromolecules are oxidized in vivo is not known nor do we know how in vitro assays reflect the in vivo situation.,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:4aZ_i-5WJEQC,7,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-2551eb60-494c-32d8-b694-592246349805,17666860597018936313,/scholar?cites=17666860597018936313,,,0,0,0

Aust. Helfried Tuisel. Chwen-wen Chang and John A. Bumpus Biotechnology Center. Utah State University Logan. UT 84322-4430 USA Abstract White rot fungi are able to mineralize a wide variety of environmental pollutants such as DDT and other pesticides. PCB. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. etc. T he ability to degrade these chemicals is due at least in part to the lignin peroxidases these organisms secrete to degrade lignin in woody plants. T he organisms use several carbon sources to produce extracellular hydrogen peroxide to activate the peroxidases. It would appear that there are three major isozymes as well as several minor enzymes that might be forms of other isozymes.

The microsomal cytochrome P-450 content and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity could be decreased by the addition of catechol and increased by the addition of cyanide to the homogenates. Similar results were obtained with rat liver microsomes treated with tyrosinase and catechol. During the inactivation of rat liver microsomal enzymes by tyrosinase and catechol. crosslinking of microsomal proteins occurred. These results suggest that the instability of house fly microsomal mixed-function oxidase may be due in part to the action of contaminating tyrosinase on endogenous substrates.,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048357577900505,8866597150085502990,/scholar?cites=8866597150085502990,,,0,0,0

A double mutation in the L chain. to open the α-helix bundle channel. and R25Y. making the protein more analogous to the H chain. increased the amount of iron incorporated into the core. again suggesting that this Tyr is involved in ligand exchange for core formation.

The fact that the system is quite non-selective in terms of chemicals which can be degraded. suggests its application for the bioremediation of coal tar and coal tar derived products such as creosote. Anthracene oil and creosote have been degraded in the laboratory. Creosote in both soil and water from polluted sites have been degraded in the laboratory. Small. experimental bioremediation plots were only partially successful although growth of the fungus was evident in plots containing several sources of nutrients and at depth up to 100 cm.

Dordrecht,Lupinosis is a hepatotoxicity in livestock grazing on lupin plants contaminated with a fungal parasite and saprophyte Phomopsis leptostromiformis (syn. P. rossiana). The condition is named lupinosis partly for historical reasons because it was originally thought that the disease was caused by alkaloids in the lupins [23]. However. very early work in Germany. where there were frequent outbreaks of the disease in sheep in the latter 1800s [23]. suggested that a toxic fungus growing on the lupins and not lupin alkaloids was responsible for the disease. Subsequently several workers showed that the hepatotoxicity usually observed in the field was not seen in animals given the plant alkaloids. The icterus usually observed in the disease may in fact be caused by an alkaloid but the classic hepatotoxicity has been reproduced with crystalline form toxin [10].,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-4235-6_8,3559272596758756247,/scholar?cites=3559272596758756247,,,0,0,0

69556,The mechanism of NADPH-dependent and 02-dependent lipid peroxidation,1980,Bruce A Svingen and Steven D Aust,,"Ann Arbor Science Publishing, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI",,69-110,,"Lipid peroxidation is the oxidative degradation of unsaturated fatty acids. Because of the radical nature of lipid peroxidation and its toxic implications to aerobic biological organisms. research into the mechanism of lipid peroxidation has been quite intense during the last fifteen years. Enzymatic lipid peroxidation was first demonstrated by the NADPH-dependent peroxidation of microsomal lipid. NADPH-dependent microsomal lipid peroxidation required the addition of nucleotide-chelated iron. 1-10 The most efficient iron chelator was ADP. Investigations into NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation produced the reaction scheme for lipid peroxidation shown following this page."" 1Peroxidation was proposed to be initiated by the abstraction of a methylene hydrogen from an unsaturated fatty acid forming a lipid radical (L'). Reaction of the lipid radical with molecular oxygen led to the formation of a lipid hydroperoxy radical (LOO). The lipid hydroperoxy radical could then react along either of two pathways. It could (1) abstract a methylene hydrogen from a neighboring unsaturated fatty acid forming a lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) and a second lipid radical. or (2) undergo an intermolecular cyclization to form a five-membered lipid endoperoxide radical. The second lipid radical formed and the lipid endoperoxide radical formed could react with molecular oxygen and with other unsaturated lipids resulting in the extraction of methylene hydrogens and continuation of the radical chain reaction.

69564,THE IMPORTANCE OF TISSUE-SPECIFIC BIOCHEMISTRY IN THE DETERMINATION OF TARGET ORGAN TOXICITY,2019,Steven D Aust,,Target Organ Toxicity: Volume 1,,121,CRC Press,In this chapter an attempt will be made to discuss the importance of tissue-specific biochemistry in determining the target organ for a toxic chemical. This will not be a review of the biochemical basis for tissue-specific toxicides for a list of toxins or even one toxin. although examples will be given. Therefore. the list of cited literature is relatively short. Instead. this will be a discussion of how tissue-specific biochemistry can determine the target organ for a toxin. It is. of course. very important to determine the biochemical mechanism of action for all toxins in order to be able to make quick and accurate diagnoses. to be able to estimate risks. to develop therapeutics. etc. Frequently. however. toxins show tissue specificity and it is important to know why. generally for the same reasons given above.The sensitivity of a particular tissue to the toxicity of a chemical can be influenced by the concentration of the toxin in the tissue. the activity of deactivating enzymes or activating enzymes and deactivating enzymes in the case of pro-toxins. the activity of enzymes involved in defense or repair mechanisms. the physical structure of the tissue relative to the mechanism of action of the toxin. or other factors which may be considered tissue-specific biochemistry. With a few exceptions. only the latter will be addressed here. The importance of tissue distribution. activation. deactivation. and other defense mechanisms. as well as excretion will be dealt with in other chapters. However. it might be well to note at this time each of these factors may have a tissue-specific biochemical basis. For example. the tissue distribution of paraquat is so dramatically influenced by the fact that …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5RamDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA121&dq=info:FY_etAWf67cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=EvRfuE4Uia&sig=pOBQECDZLk9ulc6E4HV4_PPo7Z0,,,,,0,0,0

Catalase has no effect on microsomal lipid peroxidation” and xanthine oxidase-dependent lipid peroxidation is often stimulated by catalasel. Lipid peroxidation can be initiated simply by the addition of Fe (II). If the iron does not oxidize rapidly. lipid peroxidation only occurs after a lag period. The lag is not affected by either SOD or catalase but can be abolished by the addition of Fe (III) or oxidants that catalyze oxidation of a portion of the Fe (II).

Examples of toxic chemicals shown to be degraded by white-rot fungi include pentachlorophenol. trinitrotoluene. trichloroethylene. cyanide and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Pentachlorophenol is methylated by a transmembrane methyl transferase. Trinitrotoluene is reduced by a transmembrane redox potential associated with a proton pump that the fungus uses to establish a rather low (4.5) extracellular pH. Trichloroethylene is aerobically dechlorinated by peroxidases using the carboxylate anion radical. The peroxidases oxidize either veratryl alcohol or manganese which oxidize oxalic acid to form the carboxylate anion radical for reductive dechlorinations. Other chemicals can either be directly or indirectly oxidized to radicals by the peroxidases. In all cases the chemicals are detoxified such that relatively high concentrations of these chemicals can be degraded.

The thermal stabilities of recombinant LiPH2. LiPH8. and MnPH4. which were expressed without glycosylation in Escherichia coli. were lower than those of corresponding native peroxidases isolated from P. chrysosporium. Recovery of thermally inactivated recombinant enzyme activities was higher than with that of the thermally inactivated native peroxidases. Removal of N-linked glycans from native LiPH8 and MnPH4 did not affect enzyme activities or thermal stabilities of the enzymes. Although LiPH2. LiPH8. and MnPH4 contained O-linked glycans. only the O-linked glycans from MnPH4 could be removed by O-glycosidase. and the glycan-depleted MnPH4 exhibited essentially the same activity as nondeglycosylated MnPH4. but thermal stability …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11112497497870662609&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The hydroxyl radical was detected in reaction mixtures with and without the addition of exogenous H2O2. The purified reductase and the fungus grown under nonligninolytic conditions that promote the production of the reductase were able to depolymerize an insoluble polyacrylate polymer. When oxalate. a secondary metabolite of P. chrysosporium. was used as the iron chelator. it was oxidized by the hydroxyl radical to form the carboxylate anion radical. a strong reductant.

The fungi secrete a nonspecific free radical based degradation system. consisting of enzymes and small molecular weight metabolites. to degrade these compounds extracellularly. The production of free radicals is dependent on a group of extracellular fungal peroxidase isozymes. consisting of manganese-dependent peroxidases (MnP) and lignin peroxidases (LiP). These enzymes are also able to utilize free radical mediators such as the extracellular metabolite. veratryl alcohol. and manganese to stimulate the oxidation of compounds which may be poor enzyme substrates. The reactions of these mediators can also result in the formation of a strong oxidant. hydroxyl radical. and a strong reductant. carboxyl anion radical (CO2-). Reduction can also occur via quinones produced by the fungus and at the fungal mycelia via a membrane reduction potential. Of particular importance to the degradation of phenols. white rot fungi are able to methylate phenols to reduce the toxicity and the reduction potential of the compounds.

This is a free radical mediated process which uses the organic acid as the electron donor. To correlate the involvement of this mechanism in vivo. mineralization of trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride was studied by ligninolytic cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Both trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride were mineralized by the fungus over a period of nine days. Mineralization of these chemicals did not take place in formaldehyde killed control cultures or nonligninolytic cultures of the fungus indicating that lignin peroxidases play an important role in the process.

69611,Biodegradation of environmental contaminants using white rot fungi,1994,RB White and SD Aust,78,AAPG Bulletin (American Association of Petroleum Geologists);(United States),CONF-940988-,,,White rot fungi are a common. naturally-occurring class of wood-degrading fungi that evolved to degrade lignin. Extensive research conducted since the early 1980s has shown that many of the same mechanisms used by the fungi for lignin degradation also promote the degradation of several carbon-based environmental contaminants. These contaminants include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. pesticides. herbicides. wood preservatives. chlorinated solvents. PCBs. explosives. cyanide. dyes and others. The fungi use an extra-cellular. free-radical. nonspecific mode of degradation. which allows them to degrade both soluble and insoluble contaminants. whether they are absorbed or in solution. The extra-cellular substances secreted by the fungi include several enzymes (which catalyze the initial oxidation of contaminant molecules). hydrogen ions (to maintain a slightly acidic pH). electrons (to maintain a charge balance and to reduce contaminant through the breaking of chemical bonds). and the fungi secrete veratryl alcohol (a free-radical mediator that catalyzes reductions) and oxalate (an organic acid that is a highly effective reductant).

Boston. MA,Vanadate has been shown in numerous experiments to markedly stimulate the oxidation of NAD(P)H in biological membranes. However. explanations of the nature of this stimulation often have been contradictory. Vanadate-catalyzed oxidations have been postulated to be a result of a specific membrane-associated NADH oxidase.1 Liochev and Fridovich2 have reported that this phenomenon reflects a vanadate stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidation by superoxide rather than by vanadate-stimulated NAD(P)H oxidases or dehydrogenases. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the nature of the vanadate stimulation of pyridine nucleotide oxidation in membranes from rat liver and to determine if vanadate is capable of stimulating NADPH oxidation in systems containing purified NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase.,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-5568-7_124,,,,,0,0,0

East Lansing,A single ip dose of 15. 5 or 1 mg/kg 3. 4. 3'. 4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) caused a dose-dependent depression of plasma retinol levels 24 hours after treatment of female Sprague-Dawley rats. The loss of plasma retinol appeared to be a function of depressed levels of the retinol-retinol binding protein (RBP)-transthyretin ternary complex. No free retinol-RBP was observed in plasma from treated animals. Hepatic RPH activity was also depressed. and highly and positively correlated to the plasma retinol levels. TCB was determined to be a non-competitive inhibitor of partially purified RPH with a KI of 91 uM. Metabolism of TCB by microsomes in vitro decreased the inhibition of RPH. Equimolar doses of either 2. 4. 5. 2'. 4'. 5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (HCB) or 3. 4. 5. 3'. 4'. 5'-HCB failed to cause a similar depression of plasma retinol of treated female rats.

They observed that male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of TCDD gained less weight than control rats over a 12 day period. Treated rats showed a progressive loss of hepatic retinyl esters to levels 55% that of control rats. Treated rats accumulated renal vitamin A. with retinyl palmitate levels reaching 5.2 x that of control animals. while retinol levels were elevated to 1.5 x that of control rats. The ratio of retinyl palmitate to retinol was significantly greater in treated rats than in the control rats. Acyl CoA: Retinol Acyl Transferase (ACARART) activity was 2x greater in kidneys from treated rats. and positively correlated with retinyl palmitate concentrations. They suggest that accumulation of retinyl esters in the kidney occurs as a result of retinol esterification. in response to the TCDD-induced vitamin A deficiency.,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6060563,,,,,0,0,0

There appears to be a requirement for both ferrous and ferric such that lipid peroxidation does not occur without a reductant or when all of the iron is reduced. Therefore. rates of iron reduction as well as rates of autooxidation are important in determining the rate of lipid peroxidation. The physiological significance of these results depends upon the physiological source of iron and cellular redox state. We propose that the availability of forms of iron which catalyze lipid peroxidation and the redox state of the cell determine the physiological significance of lipid peroxidation or other deleterious oxidative processes. Ferritin is a major form of cellular iron and the iron stored in ferritin can be released by superoxide. We have demonstrated the peroxidation of phospholipid liposomes using ferritin as the source of iron and xanthine oxidase as the source of superoxide. The addition of catalase to this system greatly stimulates lipid peroxidation by preventing the rapid oxidation of iron by hydrogen peroxide. We have also been able to demonstrate the presence of a low-molecular-weight chelate of iron in brain and cardiac tissue during reperfusion after ischemia and have prevented tissue damage following ischemia by treating the animals with the iron chelator desferrioxamine.,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:mlAyqtXpCwEC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9350322379692236965&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Only in the last 25 years has there begun to be a systematic examination of the pathophysiology and molecular biology attendant to brain ischemia and reperfusion. The present work continues to examine the sequence of critical events in brain ischemia and reperfusion and tests therapies which may be applied during the reperfusion phase to inhibit the development of biochemical and functional markers of irreversible brain injury. The major products of this work are significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of brain ischemia and reperfusion. During this period. flunarizine calcium antagonist and choloropromazine effects in myocardium include inhibition of both phospholipase and of lipid peroxidation for protective effects across the injury parameters were examined. Neither flunarizine nor chloropromazine have so far exhibited marked protective effects.

American Chemical Society.,The organopollutant 2. 3. 7. 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is generally considered to be quite resistant to biodegradation. However. recent studies demonstrate that some bacteria and fungi may slowly degrade this compound under laboratory conditions. Included among the microorganisms reported to degrade TCDD are strains of the bacteria Bacillus megaterium'. Nocardiopsis sp.'. Pseudomonas testosteronia. and the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium3. These studies lend support to the possibility that conditions may be developed which will permit the use of microorganisms for the detoxification of contaminated soils. sediments and waste water. Sites contaminated with TCDD are frequently also contaminated with other organopollutants. Typically. TCDD is present in concentrations that are far less than the primary pollutant. Sites contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP) are examples of such sites. This presents a number of problems; first the microorganism must be capable of degrading TCDD and second. it must be able to tolerate high concentrations of other organopollutants. some of which may be toxic to the microorganism in question. third. because the primary pollutant may also present a health hazard. it too must undergo microbial detoxification and degradation. Because PCP is a priority pollutant in its own right. we have studied the ability of this compound to be degraded by P. chrysosporium. Because it is a fungicide. we have also studied the toxicity of PCP on P. chrysosporium. Our studies showed that mineralization of 14C-PCP was promoted in nitrogen starved cultures and was suppressed in nitrogen rich cultures …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:_AeoHAGD03cC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1513034319693261244&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The alternative mechanisms for the initiation of lipid peroxidation have been proposed to be the formation of singlet oxygen or the formation of radicals capable of abstracting methylene hydrogens from PUFA. Activation of oxygen by photosensitized reactions (1) is a possible mechanism for the peroxidation of PUFA for certain chemicals but interest in the generation of singlet oxygen by other reactions is controversial at best (2). Singlet oxygen may be very important in the photodynamic eradication of neoplastic tissues using hematoporphyrins (3. 4). The popular alternatives for the initiation of lipid peroxidation generate radicals which initiate invoke the involvement of transition metals. Carbon tetrachloride is perhaps the best example of an organic compound which is metabolized to free radical species capable of initiating lipid peroxidation (5). although the mechanism certainly may not be limited carbon tetrachloride.Lipid hydroperoxides themselves give rise to radicals which initiate lipid peroxidation in a process we refer lipid hydroperoxide-dependent lipid peroxidation (6). This reaction is readily catalyzed by transition metals or certain hemoproteins such cytochrome P450 (7). The initiation of lipid peroxidation by the generation of lipid radicals during the heme catalyzed degradation of lipid hydroperoxides may also be accompanied by lipid peroxidation by activated heme. similar to that observed when hydrogen peroxide reacts with metmyoglobin or met hemoglobin (8). The ability of oxygen radicals to directly initiate lipid peroxidation is also of …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17028233653980811590&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
69641,Toxicity and Carcinogenicity of Polybrominated Biphenyls,1983,Steven D Aust and James E Trosko and Stuart D Sleight,,,,,MICHIGAN STATE UNIV EAST LANSING CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY,The different Polybrominated Biphenyls PBB congeners are in fact very different chemicals with different biological responses. Some are metabolized by liver microsomal enzymes which are induced by phenobarbital. Some are metabolized by enzymes induced by 3-MC. Some of the PBB congeners induce enzymes which are induced by phenobarbital. some induce enzymes induced by 3-MC. and some induce both types of enzymes. The congeners which induce these enzymes arent necessarily metabolized. The toxic congeners must be able to exist in a planar configuration. apparently in order to serve as a ligand for the TCDD receptor. because toxicity is well correlated with the induction of AHH activity. Both toxic and non-toxic congeners appear to promote the development of enzyme altered foci in rats treated with diethylnitrosamine. Promotion by a toxic congener does not seem to be correlated with liver microsomal enzyme induction but appears related to pathology. The toxic and non-toxic congeners do not appear to be promoters in the same dose range. and perhaps not by the same mechanisms.Descriptors:,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADP001979,,,,,0,0,0

Four model lipid peroxidation systems have been studied in order to determine which mechanism of lipid peroxidation may prevail in biological systems. These model systems include liver microsomal NADPH dependent lipid peroxidation. xanthine oxidase dependent lipid peroxidation. hydroxyl radical (Fenton's reagent) dependent lipid peroxidation. and lipid hydroperoxide dependent lipid peroxidation. The first two systems have been studied by many investigators. The hydroxyl radical system was developed because the hydroxyl radical has been proposed to be involved in the first two systems. Lipid hydroperoxide dependent lipid peroxidation was studied because it also occurs in most lipid peroxidation systems being investigated. It also involves chelated forms of iron but not those forms involved in the initial formation of the lipid hydroperoxides.Kellogg and Fridovich (1. 2) studied xanthine oxidase promoted lipid peroxidation and found that both superoxide dismutase and catalase inhibited activity. Hydroxyl radical traps had very little effect. but singlet oxygen traps were very effective inhibitors. They therefore concluded that both hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen. produced by the Haber-Weiss reaction. were responsible for initiation of lipid peroxidation. While several reports have also proposed that singlet oxygen. generated by the non-enzymatic dismutation of superoxide. is responsible for initiation of …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:48xauSegjOkC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11688165177264367016&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Schingoethe & Thomas (Proc. Soc. exp. Biol. Med. 1969. 132. 453) shed further light on this question by showing that the growth rate of rats was depressed by only two out of four diets containing TI. Pancreatic enlargement occurred with all four diets but there was no reduction in intestinal proteolysis. This suggested that the growth depression exerted by raw soya-bean products was not caused by TI and occurred by some mechanism other than by interference with protein digestion.In the first study cited above. therefore. raw soya-bean meal was subjected to various physical and chemical treatments and a fraction free from TI was isolated. which. when fed to mice decreased weight …,True,DCsp5CAAAAAJ:v1_lew4L6wgC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12207056629802048280&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The initial apoptotic events are coordinated in mitochondria. whereby several proapoptotic factors. including cytochrome c. are released into the cytosol to trigger caspase cascades. The release mechanisms include interactions of B-cell/lymphoma 2 family proteins with a mitochondria-specific phospholipid. cardiolipin. to cause permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Using oxidative lipidomics. we showed that cardiolipin is the only phospholipid in mitochondria that undergoes early oxidation during apoptosis. The oxidation is catalyzed by a cardiolipin-specific peroxidase activity of cardiolipin-bound cytochrome c.

Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents an ancient vulnerability caused by the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cellular membranes. and cells have developed complex systems that exploit and defend against this vulnerability in different contexts. The sensitivity to ferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes. including amino acid. iron. and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism. and the biosynthesis of glutathione. phospholipids. NADPH. and coenzyme Q10. Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological cell death associated with degenerative diseases (i.e.. Alzheimer’s.

Yet. its relevance in non-transformed cells and tissues is unexplored and remains enigmatic. Here. we provide direct genetic evidence that the knockout of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) causes cell death in a pathologically relevant form of ferroptosis.

SOD competes with nitric oxide for reaction with superoxide and prevents generation of peroxynitrite. a potent oxidant that can modify proteins to form 3‐nitrotyrosine. Thus. sufficient amounts of catalytically competent MnSOD are required to prevent mitochondrial damage. Increased nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity has been reported after traumatic brain injury (TBI); however. the specific protein targets containing modified tyrosine residues and functional consequence of this modification have not been identified. In this study. we show that MnSOD is a target of tyrosine nitration that is associated with a decrease in its enzymatic activity after TBI in mice.

This externalized PS is required for effective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. Because PS trans-bilayer asymmetry is not absolute in different types of nonapoptotic cells. we hypothesized that the amounts of externalized PS may be critical for macrophage discrimination between apoptotic and nonapoptotic cells. We developed a sensitive electron paramagnetic resonance method to quantify the amounts of externalized PS based on specific binding of paramagnetic annexin V–microbead conjugates with PS on cell surfaces. Using this technique. we found that nonapoptotic Jurkat cells externalize 0.9 pmol of endogenous PS/106 Jurkat cells.

A novel method for detection of site-specific phospholipid peroxidation based on the use of cis-parinaric acid as a reporter molecule metabolically integrated into membrane phospholipids in living cells was employed. When several tissue culture cell lines and different exogenous oxidants were used. the relationship between the oxidation of phosphatidylserine and apoptosis has been revealed. The plasma membrane was the preferred site of phosphatidylserine oxidation in cells.

This review is focused on the specific role of oxidative  stress in apoptotic signaling. which is realized via  phosphatidylserine-dependent pathways leading to recognition of apoptotic  cells and their effective clearance.

Its antioxidant function is realized via scavenging peroxyl radicals as a result of which phenoxyl radicals of $aL-tocopherol are formed.

NO is produced from L-arginine catalyzed by NO synthase. and CO is formed during the conversion of bilirubin from heme by the action of heme oxygenase. NO. which exerts its biological actions through cGMP and heme. has recently been implicated in myocardial protection during ischemia and reperfusion. We hypothesized that the intracellular signaling by NO may be modulated by heme oxygenase. To test this hypothesis. isolated rat hearts were perfused for 10 minutes with one of the following:(1) buffer alone;(2) 3 mmol/L L-arginine. a precursor for NO;(3) 650 mumol/L zinc protoporphyrin. a heme oxygenase inhibitor;(4) 3 mmol/L L-arginine plus 650 mumol/L zinc protoporphyrin;(5) 15 mumol/L methylene blue. a cGMP inhibitor; or (6) 3 mmol/L L-arginine plus 15 mumol/L methylene blue.

Patients. at early stages of cancer. have normal presence of DCs. However. the difficulties in the development of antitumor responses in patients with low tumor burden raised the question of the mechanisms of DC dysfunction. In this study. we found that. in differentiated DCs. tumor-derived factors blocked the cross-presentation of exogenous Ags without inhibiting the Ag presentation of endogenous protein or peptides.

Recent findings identified CL and its oxidation products as important participants and signaling molecules in the apoptotic cell death program.

Consequently. significant amounts of CL become available for the interactions with cyt c. one of the major proteins of the intermembrane space.

This suggests that lipid antioxidants capable of inhibiting cardiolipin peroxidation may act as antiapoptotic agents. Etoposide. a widely used antitumor drug and a topoisomerase II inhibitor. is a prototypical inducer of apoptosis and. at the same time. an effective lipid radical scavenger and lipid antioxidant. Here. we demonstrate that cardiolipin oxidation during apoptosis is realized not via a random cardiolipin peroxidation mechanism but rather proceeds as a result of peroxidase reaction in a tight cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex that restrains interactions of etoposide with radical intermediates generated in the course of the reaction.

Unlike biotransformation by cytochrome P450 enzymes. peroxidases activate most substrates by one-electron oxidation via radical intermediates. This work analyzed the peroxidase-dependent formation of phenoxyl radicals in HL-60 cells and its contribution to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The results showed that myeloperoxidase-catalyzed redox cycling of phenol in HL-60 cells led to intracellular formation of glutathionyl radicals detected as GS-DMPO nitrone. Formation of thiyl radicals was accompanied by rapid oxidation of glutathione and protein-thiols. Analysis of protein sulfhydryls by SDS-PAGE revealed a significant oxidation of protein SH-groups in HL-60 cells incubated in the presence of phenol/H2O2 that was inhibited by cyanide and azide.

We hypothesized that phenoxyl radical intermediates formed from phenolic metabolites of benzene by oxidative enzymes (e.g.. peroxidases. tyrosinase) are able to damage biomolecules via (i) oxidation of low-molecular-weight thiols and protein thiols and (ii) thioI-dependent generation of oxygen radicals and subsequent oxidation of DNA. Phenoxyl radicals were generated by the oxidation of phenol by myeloperoxidase + H2O2. horseradish peroxidase + H2O2. or tyrosinase. The reaction of phenol-phenoxyl radicals with GSH and dihydrolipoic acid was studied. Our HPLC measurements showed that both thiols reduced the phenoxyl radical back to phenol.

CIDEA is a lipid droplet (LD)-protein enriched in brown adipocytes promoting the enlargement of LDs. which are dynamic. ubiquitous organelles specialized for storing neutral lipids. We demonstrate an essential role in this process for an amphipathic helix in CIDEA. which facilitates embedding in the LD phospholipid monolayer and binds phosphatidic acid (PA). LD pairs are docked by CIDEA trans-complexes through contributions of the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal dimerization region. These complexes. enriched at the LD–LD contact site. interact with the cone-shaped phospholipid PA and likely increase phospholipid barrier permeability. promoting LD fusion by transference of lipids. This physiological process is essential in adipocyte differentiation as well as serving to facilitate the tight coupling of lipolysis and lipogenesis in activated brown fat.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07485.001,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:kzcSZmkxUKAC,71,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07485,4569365297086344269,/scholar?cites=4569365297086344269,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07485.pdf,0,0,0

Lipid peroxidation is connected to increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. but there is also a required role for mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt-c). In apoptotic mitochondria. cyt-c gains a new function as a lipid peroxidase that catalyzes the reactive oxygen species-mediated chemical modification of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (CL). This peroxidase activity is caused by a conformational change in the protein. resulting from interactions between cyt-c and CL. The nature of the conformational change and how it causes this gain-of-function remain uncertain.

The experimental data suggest that saturated fatty acids quench 1O2 via a physical mechanism. presumably as a result of energy transfer to the vibrational sublevels of CH‐ and COOH‐groups. Unsaturated fatty acids are predominantly chemical quenchers. The relative contribution of the physical quenching depends on the number of double bonds in fatty acid molecules.

The peak height of the ESR spectrum of tocopheroxyl radicals (which is proportional to the amount of radical present) is proportional to the ratio of reduced to oxidized cytochrome c. In mitochondrial membranes succinate-cytochrome c reduction is inhibited by antimycin A. Addition of exogenous chromanols facilitates a by-pass of the antimycin A blocked electron pathway. and succinate-dependent cytochrome c reductase activity is restored.

We now report that overexpression of bcl-2 in PC12 cells does not protect the cells from NCS-induced oxidation of membrane phosphatidylserine (PS). and results in potentiation of NCS-induced externalization of membrane PS. two events associated with the apoptosis final common pathway.

Hyperoxic resuscitation is controversial. The authors proposed that hyperoxia would improve hemodynamics and neuronal survival by augmenting oxygen delivery despite increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in experimental combined controlled cortical impact plus hemorrhagic shock in mice. Methods: Adult C57BL6 mice received controlled cortical impact followed by 35 min of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure. 25–27 mmHg). The resuscitation phase consisted of lactated Ringer’s boluses titrated to mean arterial pressure greater than 70 mmHg. Definitive care included returning shed blood. Either oxygen or room air was administered during the resuscitation phases. Brain tissue levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers were measured at 24 h and hippocampal neuronal survival was quantified at 7 days.Results: Hyperoxia markedly increased brain tissue oxygen tension approximately four-to fivefold (n= 8) and reduced resuscitation fluid requirements approximately 15%(n= 53; both P< 0.05). Systemic and cerebral physiologic variables were not significantly affected by hyperoxia. Hippocampal neuron survival was approximately 40% greater with oxygen versus room air (n= 18. P= 0.03).

In contrast. a recent discovery of a direct free radical scavenging role of NO is due solely to its free radical nature (reviewed in 9). The overwhelming majority of structural and functional biomolecules in cells and biological fluids are not free radicals. Therefore. a reactive free radical once formed will most likely interact with these nonradical molecules to produce new …,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:gKiMpY-AVTkC,9,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/152308601300185142,8186024565470818278,/scholar?cites=8186024565470818278,,,0,0,0

The range and complexity of chemical and biological interactions of this relatively reactive radical are only now emerging. Nitric oxide has been the subject of much research. and as a result a multitude of organ-specific regulatory functions has been established for NO-. In addition to its physiological roles. there is now convincing evidence that excessive. prolonged production of NO. contributes to tissue damage in different inflammatory conditions I (eg. septicemia. ischemia/reperfusion injury). This damage is thought to be mainly due to a number of prooxidant reactions of NO..

We propose that cumulative distal mitochondrial protein damage results in impaired protein import. leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and focal activation of the canonical apoptosis pathway in neurites. This is a controlled process that may not lead to neuronal death and. thus. we term this phenomenon “neuritosis.” Consistent with our hypothesis. we show that in primary cerebrocortical neurons. mitochondrial distance from the soma correlates with increased mitochondrial protein damage.

MDSC contribute to the failure of cancer therapies and favor tumor progression and metastasis. However. despite the recent advances in understanding the biology of MDSC. the mechanisms driving their expansion and suppressive function are not yet well defined. Polymorphonuclear. PMN-MDSC is by far the largest population of MDSC. Here. we found that PMN-MDSC from tumor bearing mice and from cancer patients have higher amount of lipids than their counterpart (neutrophils) in tumor free mice and healthy donors. respectively. The content of lipids in PMN-MDSC was much higher in MDSC infiltrating the tumor. and the accumulation of lipids in PMN-MDSC was caused by the uptake of extracellular lipids.

We hypothesize that activation of VP-16 by myeloperoxidase (MPO) to its phenoxyl radical (VP-16-O.) and/or ortho-quinone metabolites is responsible for its leukemogenic effects in MPO+ myeloid precursors. We have demonstrated VP-16-O. production in MPO+ HL-60 cells by EPR. Downregulation of MPO activity by pretreatment of HL-60 cells with succinyl acetone (SA). a heme synthesis inhibitor. resulted in decreased VP-16-O. production and diminished topo II-DNA complex formation. In addition. VP-16-induced DNA strand breaks were reduced in SA-treated HL-60 cells using single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assays indicating that MPO catalyzed activation of VP-16 contributes to cellular DNA damage.

A possible reason for this is abnormal repair of the injured lung. One of the hallmarks of abnormal lung repair is pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis results from interactions between different cell types and biomolecules. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) can be classified as a collection of fibrotic lung disorders of unknown etiology. and involves sequential biological processes (1). In early IPF. there is alveolitis dominated by macrophages and fewer numbers of neutrophils. lymphocytes. and eosinophils. and there is also an increase in the number of type II cells in the epithelium. In the intermediate phase of IPF. alveolitis persists with the thickening of the alveolar walls with fibrosis.

HS phase I was induced by blood withdrawal of 3ml/100 g over 15 min. At HS 20 min albumin (group A. n= 7) or PNA plus tempol (group PNA+. n= 7) was started to maintain the MAP at 40 mm Hg until 90 min. At HS 45 min. an additional infusion of either albumin (group A) or PNA plus tempol (group PNA) was started (1ml/100g/h) and continued until 120 min. Resuscitation phase II was from 90 to 270 min including infusion of shed blood. glucose/bicarbonate and normal saline. Observation phase III was awake to 72h. Phases I and II were with standard light anesthesia. No systemic heparin was used.Results: Long-term (72h) survival rates (0/7 vs. 5/7; group A vs. PNA+. p= 0.02) and times (see figure. p= 0.02) were different between groups. During HS pHa decreased from normal baseline values to 7.32±0.03 in group A vs. 7.37±0.06 in Group PNA+(p= 0.12).

Boston. MA,Free radicals initiate lipid peroxidation of microsomal membranes by rapidly forming lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) from endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid residues of phospholipids. Lipid hydroperoxides may in turn propagate lipid peroxidation via the cytochrome P-450-dependent mechanism. Indeed cytochrome P-450 catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of lipid hydroperoxides to a pool of alkoxyl- (LO) and peroxyl-LOO) radicals which induce an additional formation of lipid hydroperoxides. Propagation and termination of lipid peroxidation in the cell are accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of numerous lipid peroxidation products possessing different effects on biomembranes and membrane bound enzymes (Halliwell and Gutteridge. 1985; Kagan. 1988).

February 19. 2014 805a crucially important for antitumor immunity. In cancer. DCs accumulate lipids and form lipid droplets (LD)-dynamic organelles composed of hydrophobic core of neutral lipids covered by monolayer of phospholipids. This is associated with the suppression of CP function of DCs. We detected and identified several molecular species of oxidized neutral lipids. particularly tri-acylglycerols (oxTAGs). cholesterol esters (oxCH) and free fatty acids (oxFFAs) lipids) accumulating in LDs of DCs in tumor bearing hosts.

The efficiency of delivery of the drugs depends on the duration of circulation of the liposomes and of preservation of their integrity in the blood stream. which may be disturbed as the result of interaction of the outer monolayer of the liposomes with various blood components (acyl hydrolases. acyl transferases. lipoproteins. macroglobulins. etc.)[5. 6].

A comparative study of alpha-tocopherol analogs differing in the length of the isoprenoid chain revealed that the increase in the chain length results in a decrease of the efficiency of inhibition in the course of synaptosomal lipid peroxidation activation. This effect is due to the diminution of mobility of chromanols in the lipid bilayer which is associated with an increase in the length of the isoprenoid fragment. The decreased efficiency of lipid peroxidation inhibition resulting from the lengthening of the chromanol nucleus phytol chain is concomitant with the appearance of new stabilizing properties. eg. the ability to protect synaptosomal membranes from the damaging action of phospholipase A2. This effect is lost with a decrease in the length of the chromanol isoprenoid chain.,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC,2,https://europepmc.org/article/med/3395640,3580418308705286492,/scholar?cites=3580418308705286492,,,0,0,0

The presence of hydrocarbon tail in the antioxidant molecule determines the decrease of antioxidant efficiency in biomembranes.

Erythrocyte ghosts were obtained from guinea pig blood; the reaction of oxidation of Ch in the erythrocyte ghosts or in micelles with Triton X-100 was carried out in the following medium: Tris-HCl 0.2 M. pH 7.0 (at 37 C). Triton X-100 0.25%. and ChO 0.05 U/ml. At the present time ChO is often used to study the asymmetry of distribution of Ch in biomembranes and the velocity of its transbilayer migration. It is suggested that changes in membrane permeability do not take place during the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. and no products capable of affecting flip-flop in biological are formed.

Biologicheskie nauki,3,21-32,,It has been shown that endogenous lipid peroxidation (LPO) is an effective mechanism participating in the destruction of endoplasmic reticulum membranes (cytochrome P450) in liver. Antioxidants are able to control the rate of degradation of cytochrome P450 in vivo. Stock of the constitutive cytochrome P450 as compared with induced P450 is more resistive to LPO in vivo and in vitro. Spontaneous as well as induced by Fe2+--ADP++ NADPH system destruction of cytochrome P450 due to accumulation of LPO products malonic dialdehyde (MDA) occurs during incubation of isolated rats hepatocytes. The LPO inhibitors (4-methyl-2. 6-ditretbutilphenol. pyrogallol) stabilize cytochrome P450 preventing accumulation MDA hepatocytes. Degradation of cytochrome P450 in microsomes during trypsin proteolysis has been found to be enhanced by PLO induction. Efficiency of proteolysis depends on the way of induction and decreases in such an order: NADPH--HNDH--ascorbate-dependent LPO.

Remarkably. localized spectral changes indicate selective dynamics in the protein-lipid complex that respond to the membrane fluidity. Different dynamic modulations occur dependent on the lipid composition. in terms of acyl chain and headgroup type. Thus. lipids act not only as preferred substrates but also as crucial dynamic regulators of this lethal interplay of proteins and lipids at the mitochondrial inner membrane.,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:C5mqfHIFIucC,0,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(19)31416-X.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

Indeed. a number of signaling functions of (phospho)lipid molecules has been discovered. Among these signaling lipids. a particular group of oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). so called lipid mediators. has been thoroughly investigated over several decades. This group includes oxygenated octadecanoids. eicosanoids and docosanoids and includes several hundreds of individual species. Oxygenation of PUFA can occur when they are esterified into major classes of phospholipids. Initially. these events have been associated with non-specific oxidative injury of biomembranes. An alternative concept is that these post-synthetically oxidatively modified phospholipids and their adducts with proteins are a part of a redox …,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:ZpgFv6i7Z4gC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14602452949478390412&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The team will focus on the key role played by protein 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) in ferroptosis using a broad interdisciplinary approach. Specifically the team will: (1) Elucidate the local structure around the catalytic site of 15-LOX as well as in a complex of 15-LOX with PEBP1 in order to understand how metal-protein interactions affect 15-LOX function and how PEBP1 binding to 15-LOX opens the active site; (2) Measure the atomic structure and molecular interactions of 15-LOX active site in the presence of newly designed specific inhibitors of 15-LOX/PEBP1 complex in order to understand the mechanism of inhibition; and (3) Characterize the previously unexplored role of 15-LOX/PEBP1 complex in triggering ferroptotic death of skin cells (melanocytes and keratinocytes) and its regulation by selective new inhibitors and melanin biosynthesis. The interdisciplinary team brings together the experts from the School of Arts and Sciences. the School of Medicine and the School of Public Health. The project builds on the expertise of the Kagan group in the discovery and understanding of the biochemical network that underpins ferroptosis. The Saxena group brings in the knowledgebase to measure at the atomic level key interactions that are essential for ferroptosis in order to aid the development of new ferroptosis inhibitors.

Considerably less is known regarding the effects of oxidized phospholipids including cardiolipin (CL) and its oxidized (CLox) species on pulmonary endothelium. Normally maintained in its reduced form within mitochondria. we have shown that in experimental (bacterial pneumonia. radiation. hyperoxia) ALI. CL can be oxidized (CLox) and CL (and possibly CLox) may be released from injured or dying cells. In cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells. exogenous CLox disrupts barrier function and causes necrotic cell death.

Specifically. we used FTIR and multidimensional magic-anglespinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) on samples mimicking proapoptotic conditions that trigger cyt-c’s peroxidase activity. Comparison to FTIR and solution NMR data for the soluble protein revealed that cyt-c did not experience major unfolding upon membrane binding.

MS has advanced into the field of imaging to enable the spatial cataloging of lipids in cellular compartments (reviewed in [3. 4]).The most commonly employed mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) techniques for lipids are secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). desorption electrospray ionization (DESI). and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI).

70404,Oxidized Lipids Block Antigen,2014,Dmitry I Gabrilovich and Esteban Celis Klein-Seetharaman and Valerian E Kagan,,,,,,Cross-presentation is one of the main features of dendritic cells (DCs). which is critically important for the development of spontaneous and therapy-inducible antitumor immune responses. Patients. at early stages of cancer. have normal presence of DCs. However. the difficulties in the development of antitumor responses in patients with low tumor burden raised the question of the mechanisms of DC dysfunction. In this study. we found that. in differentiated DCs. tumor-derived factors blocked the crosspresentation of exogenous Ags without inhibiting the Ag presentation of endogenous protein or peptides. This effect was caused by intracellular accumulation of different types of oxidized neutral lipids: triglycerides. cholesterol esters. and fatty acids. In contrast. the accumulation of nonoxidized lipids did not affect cross-presentation. Oxidized lipids blocked cross-presentation by reducing the expression of peptide–MHC class I complexes on the cell surface. Thus. this study suggests the novel role of oxidized lipids in the regulation of cross-presentation.

Numerous studies have demonstrated defective function of DCs in cancer. However. the mechanisms of those defects remain not clear. Previously. we have demonstrated that DCs in tumor-bearing hosts accumulate lipids via up-regulation of the expression of scavenger receptor A (CD204). This resulted in inability of DCs to effectively process exogenous antigens. In this study we found that the DCs exposed to tumor-derived factors (TDF) in vitro or isolated from tumor-bearing (TB) mice had increased uptake of soluble protein ovalbumin (OVA). No defect in the activity of lysosomal and endosomal proteases was detected. Using mass-spectrometry we determined that TDF did not affect processing of OVA by DCs. At the same time.

70425,"Reply to"" The flip side of cardiolipin import""",2011,Bill B Chen and Jian Fei Jiang and Nancy B Ray and Valerian E Kagan and Rama K Mallampalli,17,Nature Medicine,4,413-414,Nature Publishing Group,We read with interest the paper by Ray and colleagues1 reporting that elevated cardiolipin levels during pulmonary infection impair lung and lung surfactant function. They suggest that Atp8B1 is a cardiolipin importer that helps clear this lipid from lung surfactant and that it contains a 40-amino-acid cardiolipin-binding domain that reduces lung injury when introduced into infected lungs. We do appreciate the inference that elevated cardiolipin contributes to the etiology of pneumonia and the observation that Atp8B1 overexpression improves lung function after experimental pneumonia. However. the mechanism of pulmonary cardiolipin accumulation and the role of Atp8B1 therein is not illuminated by the experiments of Ray and colleagues1. Atp8B1 deficiency not only causes progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 but also extrahepatic symptoms arising from effects on the apical membranes of epithelial …,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:BFa5h04uPMwC,0,https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0411-413b,,,,,0,0,0

We proposed that cancer immunoediting occurs in three phases: Elimination (ie. cancer immunosurveillance. the host protective phase). Equilibrium (the phase where tumor cells that survive elimination nevertheless remain under immunologic control resulting in a state of functional tumor dormancy) and Escape (the phase where clinically apparent tumors emerge that display either reduced immunogenicity or enhanced capacity to induce an immunosuppressive state). Using in vivo mouse cancer models. strong experimental data have been obtained that demonstrate the existence of each phase of the cancer immunoediting process. In addition. compelling clinical data suggests that a similar process also occurs in humans.

70431,Cardiolipin and Its Redox Interactions With Cytochrome c In Apoptosis,2010,Valerian E Kagan,24,The FASEB Journal,,80.3-80.3,Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,During apoptosis cytochrome c (cyt c) interacts with cardiolipin (CL) and obtains a new catalytic function as a CL‐specific peroxidase that causes oxidation of CL in mitochondria. Fatty acid hydroperoxides are ~1.000 times more effective as sources of oxidizing equivalents for the peroxidase function of cyt c/CL than H2O2. Migration of CL from the inner to the outer mitochondrial membrane is a pre‐requisite for its interaction with cyt c. Thus. CL acts as a redox switch that turns off the electron transporting function of cyt c and turns on its peroxidase activity. Mitochondria‐targeted inhibitors of CL peroxidation act as potent anti‐apoptotic agents thus offering new opportunities for drug discovery. In the cytosol. released cyt c interacts with another anionic phospholipid. phosphatidylserine (PS). and catalyzes its oxidation. Peroxidation facilitates PS externalization ‐ essential for the recognition and clearance of apoptotic …,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:bXQfdp6S9ecC,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.24.1_supplement.80.3,,,,,0,0,0

Whether treatment of cells with externally applied drugs augments potentially lethal damage repair (PLDR) is unknown. A nitroxide free radical scavenger (TEMPO) and a mitochondrial targeted TEMPO (JP4-039) have been shown to be effective radioprotectors of hematopoietic cells exposed to ionizing radiation. We assessed whether PLDR and cell survival could be increased by treatment of irradiated cells in quiescence with JP4-039 or TEMPO.

SNO-Alb was shown to be protective against the potential free radical mediated damage and microvascular injury associated with ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)(2). Accordingly. in the current study. we have directly assessed the cytoprotective role of SNO-Alb in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBH) mediated toxicity in cultured rat pulmonary artery (RPAEC) and microvascular (RPMEC). Methods: RPAEC and RPMEC were treated with tBH in serum-free HBSS (10-5–10-4 M) for 6hr at 37 C with or without 20 μM SNO-Alb. L-NAME (1mM). an eNOS inhibitor. was added 1hr prior to the addition of SNO-Alb or tBH. Cell viability was assessed using Alamar blue. a fluorometric non-toxic metabolic probe and trypan blue exclusion as well as indices of apoptosis (including caspase activity and nuclear morphology). Additional biochemical endpoints included phospholipid oxidation and eNOS mRNA and protein. Results: We noted that tBH caused a concentration dependent cytotoxicity in which cell death could be completely accounted for via a necrotic pathway in both RPAEC and RPMEC. At 6 hr of 80 μM tBH in RPAEC. cell viability decreased to 40±5% of control via Alamar Blue assay or trypan blue exclusion and there was no significant increase in caspase activity.

As SWCNT are introduced into the life cycle of commercial products. their effects on human health and environment should be addressed. We demonstrated that pharyngeal aspiration of SWCNT elicited unusual pulmonary effects in C57BL/6 mice that combined a robust but acute inflammation with early onset yet progressive fibrosis and granulomas. A dose-dependent increase in the protein. lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). and g-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities in BAL were found along with accumulation of 4-hydroxynonenal (oxidative biomarker). and depletion of glutathione in lungs. An early neutrophils accumulation (day 1). followed by lymphocyte (day 3) and macrophage (day 7) influx were accompanied by early elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α. IL-1β. day 1) followed by fibrogenic TGF-β1 (peaked on day 7). A rapid progressive fibrosis found in mice exhibited two distinct morphologies:(1) SWCNT-induced granulomas mainly associated with hypertrophied epithelial cells surrounding SWCNT aggregates and (2) diffuse interstitial fibrosis and alveolar wall thickening likely associated with dispersed SWCNT. In vitro exposure of murine RAW264. 7 macrophages to SWCNT triggered TGF-β1 production similarly to zymosan but generated less TNF-α and IL-1β. SWCNT did not cause superoxide or NO• production. active SWCNT engulfment. or apoptosis in RAW264. 7 macrophages.

Selective oxidation of PS precedes its externalization/recognition and is essential for the PS-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells. Because etoposide is a potent and selective lipid antioxidant that does not block thiol oxidation. we hypothesized that it may affect PS externalization/recognition without affecting other features of the apoptotic program. We demonstrate herein that etoposide induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells without the concomitant peroxidation of PS and other phospholipids. HL-60 cells also failed to externalize PS in response to etoposide treatment. In contrast. oxidant (H2O2)-induced apoptosis was accompanied by PS externalization and oxidation of different phospholipids. including PS.

Ubiquinol-10 is easily oxidized to ubiquinone-10 both in vivo and in vitro. 7–9. 12 Exceptional oxidative lability of ubiquinol-10 implies that in vivo it is expected to be oxidized before other antioxidants. as is the case in vitro during lipoprotein7–9 and hepatocyte10. 11 oxidation.

The biochemical mechanisms of cytotoxicity for phenolic compounds are not well understood.  We hypothesized that enzymatic one-electron oxidation of phenolic compounds resulting in generation of phenoxyl radicals may be an important contributor to the cytotoxic effects.  Phenoxyl radicals are readily reduced (regenerated) by thiols. ascorbate and other intracellular reductants (e.g.. NADH. NADPH).  Hence. phenolic compounds may undergo enzymatically-driven redox-cycling thus causing oxidative stress.  To experimentally test the hypothesis we monotored thiol levels. lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant reserves in normal human keratinocytes incubated with phenol.  Using a newly developed cis-parinaric acid procedure for assay of site-specific oxidative stress in membrane phospholipids we found that phenol at subtoxic concentrations (50 μM) caused oxidation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (but not of phosphatidylserine) in keratinocytes.  Measurements with ThioGlo     T     M     showed that phenol dramatically depleted GSH.  Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence assay demonstrated a significant decrease in total antioxidant reserves of keratinocytes exposed to phenol.

Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to measure interactions of water-soluble antioxidants.  Phenoxyl radicals were generated at constant rate by incubation of tyrosinase with the antitumor drug. etoposide (VP-16).

As a result of the relative instability of free radicals and their potential to damage cells and tissues. there are both enzymes and small molecules with antioxidant capabilities that can protect against the adverse effects of free radicals (1. 2). There is. therefore. a critical balance between free radical generation and antioxidant defenses. Many of the protective antioxidants are essential nutrients. like vitamin E. Vitamin E is a generic term that comprises eight natural substances having vitamin E activity: da-. d-ß-. d-Yo. d-8-tocopherol; and da-. dB-. d-y-. d-8-tocotrienol.

Products of single-and double-electron reduction of oxygen (02-. H202) are themselves ineffective lipid oxidizing agents [1. 3. 11]. However. as a result of the breakdown of these molecules or their interaction. especially in the presence of variable valency metals. highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH) are formed [1. 3. 11]; these. interacting with polyunsaturated lipids at high velocity. generate radical lipid intermediates (R. RO. ROO) and lead to the formation of a variety of molecular LPO products [1. 3. 11. 14]. Excessive accumulation of LPO products is caused. on the one hand. by hyperproduction of active forms of oxygen. and on the other hand. by a deficiency of enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant systems.

During the normal course of metabolism. approximately 98% of molecular oxygen undergoes complete reduction to water via the “oxidase"" pathway [2]. The remainder is converted to partially reduced products (superoxide anion radical. hydrogen peroxide. hydroxyl radical) which are capable of initiating free radical mediated oxidative damage. These reactive oxygen species may arise from different sources. the most important of which are mitochondrial respiration. phagocytic and bactericidal function of leukocytes and macro-phages. dioxygenase activities (eg. cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase). and cytochrome P-450-supported monooxygenations [3]. A characteristic feature of free radical reactions is their ability to initiate and propagate chain reactions. resulting in an amplification and involvement of the bulk of membrane polyunsaturated lipids. Transition metals can act as potent catalysts of free radical reactions both by enhancing formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals in the aqueous phase in the course of the initiation stage and by splitting down hydroperoxides with subsequent formation of reactive alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals in the membranous phase at the propagation stage [4].",True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:zGWyAL6qfKUC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5287673779770634254&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

To examine whether these drugs produce a potentially toxic oxygen radical flux in whole cells. we studied the effect of doxorubicin (D) on KCN-resistant respiration in adult rat heart myocytes. Treatment of myocytes with D increased the rate of KCN-resistant respiration from 1.02±0.08 nmol/min/2xl0 s cells to 1.61±0.16. 2.79±0.55. or 3.22±0.24 nmol/min/2xl0 s cells after 50. i00. or 200# MD. respectively (P< 0.01 for each dose compared to control).

Tocopherol is distributed unevenly in the lipid bilayer of membranes. forming clusters and preferentially concentrated in regions with a high content of polyenic phospholipids [I. ii]. The development of oxidative stress is invariably accompanied by a fall in the tocopherol concentration [9. 3. 10]. and the resulting antioxidant deficiency in the membranes may be local in character. One way of correcting a local vitamin E deficiency may be through intermembrane transfer of~-tocopherol.Studies of inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LPO) during intermembrane transfer of tocopherols have proved contradictory. For instance. Niki et al.[8. 7] found that~-tocopherol. incorporated into donor liposomes …,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00839738,,,,,0,0,0

The repair and de novo systems also act as one of defenses. The water-soluble antioxidants scavenge aqueous radicals. but they can not scavenge lipophilic radicals in lie membranes. Lipidsoluble antioxidants located in the membranes protect them by scavenging oxygen radicals attacking from both outside of lie membrane and within lie membranes. Thus. lie activities of lie antioxidants depend very much on the site of radical generation.

Certain domains of these proteins may be exposed into the polar region of the membrane [i0]. It can be tentatively suggested that as a result of attack by active forms of oxygen the resulting damage is due to oxidative modification not only of hydrophobic. but also of polar domains of the molecules of this polyenzyme system. In that case not only lipid-soluble antioxidants. interacting with lipid radicals. but also water-soluble antioxidants. interacting with oxygen radicals in water. ought to have a protective action against injury by active forms of oxygen.The aim of this investigation was to compare the efficacy of the protective action of the lipid-soluble antioxidant~-tocopherol and the water-soluble antioxidant carnosine. and also a combination of …,True,fC2MlOEAAAAJ:7H_jS4BsgvYC,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00833801,,,,,0,0,0

As a result of this reaction active forms of oxygen (O~. H202) are formed. and in the presence of metals of variable valency. these give rise to hydroxyl radicals and may initiate the process of lipid peroxidation (LPO)[2]. Considering the wide distribution of MAO. this effect may be of great importance despite the very low rate of induction of LPO in the course of P~ O-catalyzed reactions. Evidently the nearest target for attack by active forms of oxygen and also by radical and molecular products of LPO may be the enzyme itself. which is a lipid-dependent integral membrane protein [6. ii].
