1193770,Pt-decorated graphene as superior media for H2S adsorption: a first-principles study,2012,Masoud Darvish Ganji and Narges Sharifi and Mahdi Ardjmand and Morteza Ghorbanzadeh Ahangari,261,Applied surface science,,697-704,North-Holland,The adsorption mechanism of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) molecules on pristine and Pt-decorated graphene sheets was studied using density functional theory calculations based on local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation methods. Our calculations show that a Pt-decorated graphene system has much higher binding energy. higher net charge transfer values and shorter connecting distances than pristine graphene due to chemisorption of the H2S molecule. Furthermore. the calculated density of states show that orbital hybridization is visible between the H2S and Pt-decorated graphene sheets. while there is no evidence for hybridization between the H2S molecule and the pristine graphene sheet. Interestingly. we find that up to seven H2S molecules can stably bind to a Pt atom on each side of the graphene sheet with desirable binding energy.,True,SYOshxEAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,99,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433212014614,12255857667967334421,/scholar?cites=12255857667967334421,,,0,0,0

Newly an innovative nanometer sized particles have been dispersed in the base fluid in heat transfer fluids. The fluids containing the solid nanometer size particle dispersion are called ‘nanofluids’. Two main categories were discussed in detail as the single-phase modeling which the combination of nanoparticle and base fluid is considered as a single-phase mixture with steady properties and the two-phase modeling in which the nanoparticle properties and behaviors are considered separately from the base fluid properties and behaviors. Both single phase and two phase models have been presented in this paper.

D-particles, fields, gravitation, and cosmology",7,,American Physical Society,A search for the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top quark pair (tt̅H) is reported. The search is performed in multilepton final states using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb⁻¹ of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy √s = 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. Higgs boson decays to WW*. ττ. and ZZ* are targeted. Seven final states. categorized by the number and flavor of charged-lepton candidates. are examined for the presence of the Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV and a pair of top quarks. An excess of events over the expected background from Standard Model processes is found with an observed significance of 4.1 standard deviations. compared to an expectation of 2.8 standard deviations. The bestfit for the  tt̅H production cross section is σ(tt̅H) = 790 +230 −210 fb. in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 507 +35 −50 fb. The combination of this result with other tt̅H searches from the ATLAS experiment using the Higgs boson decay modes to bb̅. γγ and ZZ* → 4ℓ. has an observed significance of 4.2 standard deviations. compared to an expectation of 3.8 standard deviations.

In order to study the effects of suction and blowing over the blade. 10 slots were considered on the upper surface of the blade. The slots were considered at intervals of 5% to 95% of the blade chord length. The results showed that applying both suction and blowing caused to delay the flow separation point and move it downstream which led to increase the lift coefficient and decrease the drag coefficient. Also. it was concluded that the effect of applying suction especially in the location where is near the trailing edge was significantly more than the effect of applying blowing.

A second order discretization method was used for solving equations and a SIMPLE algorithm was applied for pressure-velocity coupling using Fluent. Effect of nanoparticle volume fraction and particles size in different Reynolds numbers (900â‰¤ Reâ‰¤ 2100) on the convective heat transfer coefficient was studied. The simulation was conducted for three different volume fractions and particle sizes in the laminar flow under constant heat flux. The results showed that adding nanoparticles to the base fluid caused an increase in the thermal conductivity ratio of the fluid. which was observed to a greater degree in the fuel oil-alumina nanofluid than in the water-alumina nanofluid. The increase in nanoparticle volume fraction caused an increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number of the nanofluids.

1193839,Numerical Investigation of Hazardous Gas Dispersion Over Obstacles and Residential Areas,2020,E Fatahian and H Salarian and H Fatahian,33,International Journal of Engineering,10,2087-2094,Materials and Energy Research Center,In the present study. an attempt has been made to use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in the assessment of hazardous gas dispersion over obstacles. For this aim. the accidental dispersion of hazardous gas from the hole and the effect of different parameters such as changes in inlet wind velocity. the direction of the pollutant cloud and its movement. mass fraction of gas dispersion. and the pressure distribution were numerically analyzed. The flow was assumed as three-dimensional. unsteady. turbulent. and compressible. Different turbulent models were used in modeling the gas release and the most accurate one was suggested. The numerical simulation demonstrated that the gas mass fraction increased significantly due to the sudden dispersion of the gas. The amount of gas concentration gradually decreased after the formation of pollutant clouds by moving in the horizontal direction. Moreover. gas mass fraction had decreased by increasing the height. Comparing the results revealed that the pollutant cloud did not cover the surrounding area in the wind velocity of 1 m/s. Therefore. the pollutant clouds generated in this case could not impose a threat. In higher wind velocities (3 m/s and 5 m/s). the pollutant cloud approximately covered the surrounding areas. which caused a severe threat. The maximum overpressure at the hole is 5.7 Pa for a wind velocity of 5 m/s. while the maximum negative pressure was about -7.1 Pa. The influencing radius was obtained about 9.3 m. The overpressure did not cause obvious damage to buildings but led to a slight hurt to humans.,True,thZxhi0AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,3,http://www.ije.ir/article_115341.html,14194481999311757822,/scholar?cites=14194481999311757822,,http://www.ije.ir/article_115341_1dcfabddd908939dbbf94d0a0652fb92.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. the problem of forced convective heat transfer of flow over horizontal cylinder with equally spaced fins with high conductivity has been numerically investigated on the outer surface. The effect of the number of fins and their height on the average Nusselt number was investigated for Reynolds numbers within the domain 5-2000. The effect of the fins on the forced convective heat transfer over isothermal horizontal cylinder was studied for numerous combinations of fins (F= 0-14). the height of fins (H= 0.5-3) and different Reynolds number values (ReD= 5-2000). Changing the average Nusselt number for a given value of Reynolds number due to the increased number of fins. the average Nusselt number at the same Reynolds number was normalized by the Nusselt number of finless cylinder and it was conducted because of the focus on the relatively effect of the increased fins. The results showed that there is an optimum number of fins to obtain the maximum Nusselt number for a given value of fins height and Reynolds number.

In order to study the effects of suction and blowing over the blade. 10 slots were considered on the upper surface of the blade. The slots were considered at intervals of 5% to 95% of the blade chord length. The results showed that applying both suction and blowing caused to delay the flow separation point and move it downstream which led to increase the lift coefficient and decrease the drag coefficient. Also. it was concluded that the effect of applying suction especially in the location where is near the trailing edge was significantly more than the effect of applying blowing.

This new deflector was specifically proposed to minimize the severe effects of the complex wake zone created behind the conventional solid deflector that had not been investigated yet. This caused a deeper investigation into the effect of severe negative effects on the turbine performance to achieve an appropriate design configuration. Therefore. different configuration parameters were taken into account during the numerical process. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation in conjunction with the SST k-ω turbulence model was numerically solved. Comprehensive comparisons of torque. power. and flow structures between deflector configurations and the standard Savonius turbine were performed to illustrate the mechanism of how the porous deflector improved the turbine …,True,I9AcpEgAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,5,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890420306063,17811956099301366966,/scholar?cites=17811956099301366966,,,0,0,0

A second order discretization method was used for solving equations and a SIMPLE algorithm was applied for pressure-velocity coupling using Fluent. Effect of nanoparticle volume fraction and particles size in different Reynolds numbers (900â‰¤ Reâ‰¤ 2100) on the convective heat transfer coefficient was studied. The simulation was conducted for three different volume fractions and particle sizes in the laminar flow under constant heat flux. The results showed that adding nanoparticles to the base fluid caused an increase in the thermal conductivity ratio of the fluid. which was observed to a greater degree in the fuel oil-alumina nanofluid than in the water-alumina nanofluid. The increase in nanoparticle volume fraction caused an increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient and the Nusselt number of the nanofluids. The significant point of this study was that in the same volume fraction. the effect of adding alumina nanoparticles to the fuel-oil-based fluid had more effect than adding these particles to water-based fluid. while the effect of increasing the Reynolds number in the water-alumina nanofluid on convective heat transfer coefficient was greater than the fuel-oil-alumina. Also. in the same Reynolds number and volume fraction with increasing size of nanoparticles. the value of the convective heat transfer coefficient was decreased.

1193864,Numerical Investigation of Hazardous Gas Dispersion Over Obstacles and Residential Areas,2020,E Fatahian and H Salarian and H Fatahian,33,International Journal of Engineering,10,2087-2094,Materials and Energy Research Center,In the present study. an attempt has been made to use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in the assessment of hazardous gas dispersion over obstacles. For this aim. the accidental dispersion of hazardous gas from the hole and the effect of different parameters such as changes in inlet wind velocity. the direction of the pollutant cloud and its movement. mass fraction of gas dispersion. and the pressure distribution were numerically analyzed. The flow was assumed as three-dimensional. unsteady. turbulent. and compressible. Different turbulent models were used in modeling the gas release and the most accurate one was suggested. The numerical simulation demonstrated that the gas mass fraction increased significantly due to the sudden dispersion of the gas. The amount of gas concentration gradually decreased after the formation of pollutant clouds by moving in the horizontal direction. Moreover. gas mass fraction had decreased by increasing the height. Comparing the results revealed that the pollutant cloud did not cover the surrounding area in the wind velocity of 1 m/s. Therefore. the pollutant clouds generated in this case could not impose a threat. In higher wind velocities (3 m/s and 5 m/s). the pollutant cloud approximately covered the surrounding areas. which caused a severe threat. The maximum overpressure at the hole is 5.7 Pa for a wind velocity of 5 m/s. while the maximum negative pressure was about -7.1 Pa. The influencing radius was obtained about 9.3 m. The overpressure did not cause obvious damage to buildings but led to a slight hurt to humans.,True,I9AcpEgAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,3,http://www.ije.ir/article_115341.html,14194481999311757822,/scholar?cites=14194481999311757822,,http://www.ije.ir/article_115341_1dcfabddd908939dbbf94d0a0652fb92.pdf,0,0,0

A two-way momentum coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian multiphase approach was used to simulate the formation of the water film layer on the airfoil's surface. According to the results. very low values of the lift-to-drag ratio at low angles of attack reflected severe degradation of the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil in the presence of water accumulated on its surface. The impact of rain droplets on the leading-edge slat surface led to less water accumulating on the main section of the airfoil. In particular. the maximum water film mass concentrated on the airfoil surface decreased from 15 g to 1 g compared with the single element airfoil.

In this study. the problem of forced convective heat transfer of flow over horizontal cylinder with equally spaced fins with high conductivity has been numerically investigated on the outer surface. The effect of the number of fins and their height on the average Nusselt number was investigated for Reynolds numbers within the domain 5-2000.

Exerting modified rule of mixture (MROM). the mechanical properties of nanocomposite including matrix. nanoparticles or multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). and fiber are attained. In order to analyze the low-velocity impact. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Hertz's contact law are simultaneously employed to govern the equations of motion. Using Ritz's variational approximation method. a set of nonlinear equations in time domain are obtained. which are solved using a fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The effect of different parameters such as adding nanoparticles or MWCNT's on maximum contact force and energy absorption. stacking sequence. geometrical dimensions (i.e.. length. width and height). and initial velocity of the impactor have been studied comprehensively on dynamic behavior of the nanocomposite beam.

Two types of boundary conditions (BCs) can be considered for impactor in the low-velocity impact: constrained (if the impact angle between the impactor and target remains constant during and after the contact) and free (if rotation of the impactor and change in angle with respect to the target is likely) BCs. The more details of these BCs are described in the paper. The OLVI is numerically modeled for four different impact angles. Effect of BC types and impact angle on energy absorption. as well as maximum contact force. is investigated. Due to lack of experimental results for the OLVI on FMLs in the open literature. the authors had to validate the present modelling via the experimental data of the perpendicular low-velocity impact.

Empirical research on the relationship between the yarn pull-out behavior and fabric properties are evaluated. along with a detailed comparison of friction between the fabric fibers in static and dynamic modes. Samples are tested in three modes. namely. neat. dissolved liquid. and silica particle- based Shear thickening fluid (STF)-treated fabric. Accordingly. the presence of STF increases friction between the fabrics and the warp and weft yarns. as well as prevents the displacement of the yarns. Increased friction also leads to an increase in the energy absorption of the yarn pull-out process.

Thick honeycomb could be also used for energy absorption applications. Moreover. studying the mechanical behavior of honeycombs under in-plane loading could help understanding the mechanical behavior of more complex 3D tessellated structures such as porous biomaterials. In this paper. we study the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs made using additive manufacturing techniques that allow for fabrication of honeycombs with arbitrary and precisely controlled thickness. Thick honeycombs with different wall thicknesses were produced from polylactic acid (PLA) using fused deposition modelling. ie. an additive manufacturing technique. The samples were mechanically tested in-plane under compression to determine their mechanical properties. We also obtained exact analytical solutions for the stiffness matrix of thick hexagonal honeycombs using both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The stiffness matrix was then used to derive analytical relationships that describe the elastic modulus. yield stress. and Poisson’s ratio of thick honeycombs. Finite element models were also built for computational analysis of the mechanical behavior of thick honeycombs under compression. The mechanical properties obtained using our analytical relationships were compared with experimental observations and computational results as well as with analytical solutions available in the literature.

In this regard. a formulation that employs a full compatible three-dimensional Hermitian element with 168 degrees of freedom and guarantees continuity of the strain and stress components is used. It is known that all of the available famous commercial finite element softwares and the proposed series solutions satisfy continuity conditions of the displacement rather than the stress components.

1193947,Relationship between occupational stress and cardiovascular diseases risk factors in drivers,2016,Hamed Biglari and Mohammad Hossein Ebrahimi and Maryam Salehi and Mohsen Poursadeghiyan and Iman Ahmadnezhad and Milad Abbasi,29,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,6,895,Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine,Objectives: Of all work stressors. occupational stress is the leading cause of many disorders among workers. Drivers are classified as a high risk group for work related stress. This study set out to determine the relationship between risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and occupational stress among drivers. Material and Methods: Two hundred and twenty two Ilam’s intercity drivers were selected for the study. For measuring work stress. the Osipow work stress questionnaire was used. After a 10-h fasting period. systolic and diastolic blood pressure was recorded. Intravenous blood samples were taken to determine cholesterol. triglyceride and blood glucose levels. The independent samples t-test and Pearson’s correlation test were used to assess the relationship between variables and occupational stress. Results: Seventy-one percent of the intercity drivers suffered from average to acute stress. and 3.1% of them suffered from acute stress. There was no significant relationship between occupational stress and diastolic blood pressure (p= 0.254) among the drivers. Nevertheless. the Pearson’s correlation test demonstrated a strong relationship between work stress and blood glucose (p< 0.01). while no strong correlation was found for blood triglycerides and cholesterol levels. Conclusions: Based on the results. high rates of occupational stress were observed in the Ilam’s intercity drivers. Occupational stress may have effect on blood glucose levels but the results did not suggest a considerable relationship between risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and occupational stress among intercity drivers.

On the basis of the principle of minimum potential energy and the Rayleigh Ritz method. the equations of motion are derived in conjunction with the graded finite element approach. Solution of the resulted system of equations in time domain is carried out via Newmark's time integration method. Calculations are applied for fully clamped boundary condition. In the present paper. two different sets of distributions for material properties are considered. For the static analysis. material properties are considered to vary through the thickness direction according to an exponential law. In the case of dynamic analysis. variations of the volume fractions through the thickness are assumed to obey a power law function. Thus. the effective material properties at each point are determined by the Mori-Tanaka scheme. In case of dynamic analysis. the results are obtained for uniform step loadings. The effects of material gradient index and skew angle on displacement components and stress response are studied. Results of present formulations are verified by available results of a functionally graded rectangular plate for different boundary conditions and also compared with result of a homogenous skew plate by commercial FEM software.,True,o-k81YsAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C,26,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-78252014000300008&script=sci_arttext,11282379124054396714,/scholar?cites=11282379124054396714,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-78252014000300008&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

CNT length. chirality and defect position as the critical position of STW defect is near the fixed end for both cantilever and bridge boundary conditions.

1193965,Probabilistic load forecasting via quantile regression averaging on sister forecasts,2015,Bidong Liu and Jakub Nowotarski and Tao Hong and Rafał Weron,8,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2,730-737,IEEE,The majority of the load forecasting literature has been on point forecasting. which provides the expected value for each step throughout the forecast horizon. In the smart grid era. the electricity demand is more active and less predictable than ever before. As a result. probabilistic load forecasting. which provides additional information on the variability and uncertainty of future load values. is becoming of great importance to power systems planning and operations. This paper proposes a practical methodology to generate probabilistic load forecasts by performing quantile regression averaging on a set of sister point forecasts. There are two major benefits of the proposed approach. It can leverage the development in the point load forecasting literature over the past several decades and it does not rely so much on high-quality expert forecasts. which are rarely achievable in load forecasting practice.

However. recent studies suggest that financial asset returns exhibit tail exponents well above the Levy-stable regime (0 < α ≤ 2). In this paper. we illustrate that widely used tail index estimates (log–log linear regression and Hill) can give exponents well above the asymptotic limit for α close to 2. resulting in overestimation of the tail exponent in finite samples.

Unfortunately. estimation routines for the long-term and short-term seasonal pattern are usually quite sensitive to extreme observations. known as electricity price spikes. Improved robustness of the model can be achieved by (a) filtering the data with some reasonable procedure for outlier detection. and then (b) using estimation and testing procedures on the filtered data. In this paper we examine the effects of different treatments of extreme observations on model estimation and on determining the number of spikes (outliers). In particular we compare results for the estimation of the seasonal and stochastic components of electricity spot prices using either the original or filtered data.

Followers conform to all other individuals. whereas snobs conform only to their own group and anticonform to the other. The model allows to examine the role of the social structure. i.e. the influence of the number of inter-links between the two communities. as well as the role of the stability of links. The latter is accomplished by considering two versions of the same model—quenched (parameterized by fraction L of fixed inter-links) and annealed (parameterized by probability p that a given inter-link exists). Using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical treatment (the latter only for the annealed model). we show that there is a critical fraction of inter-links. above which recurring cycles occur. For p ≤ 0.5 we derive a relation between parameters L and p that allows to compare both models and show that the critical value of inter-connections. p*. is the same for both versions of the model (annealed and quenched) but the period of a fashion cycle is shorter for the quenched model. Near the critical point. the cycles are irregular and a change of fashion is difficult to predict. For the annealed model we also provide a deeper theoretical analysis. We conjecture on topological grounds that the so-called saddle node heteroclinic bifurcation appears at p*. For p ≥ 0.5 we show analytically the existence of the second critical value of p. for which the system undergoes Hopf’s bifurcation.,True,BkmQkbYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,9,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166323,4008682589689740400,/scholar?cites=4008682589689740400,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166323,0,0,0
1193989,Beating the Naïve—Combining LASSO with Naïve Intraday Electricity Price Forecasts,2020,Grzegorz Marcjasz and Bartosz Uniejewski and Rafał Weron,13,Energies,7,1667,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In the last three decades the vast majority of electricity price forecasting (EPF) research has concerned day-ahead markets. However. the rapid expansion of renewable generation—mostly wind and solar—have shifted the focus to intraday markets. which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday. continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient. that is. that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here. we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naïve forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue. that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours. the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naïve forecast.

1193990,Forecasting Electricity Prices Using Deep Neural Networks: A Robust Hyper-Parameter Selection Scheme,2020,Grzegorz Marcjasz,13,Energies,18,4605,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Deep neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity. However. their application requires setting multiple hyper-parameters. and the performance relies strongly on this choice. We address this issue and propose a robust ex-ante hyper-parameter selection procedure for the day-ahead electricity price forecasting that. when used jointly with a tested forecast averaging scheme. yields high performance throughout three-year long out-of-sample test periods in two distinct markets. Being based on a grid search with models evaluated on long samples. the methodology mitigates the noise induced by local optimization. Forecast averaging across calibration window lengths and hyper-parameter sets allows the proposed methodology to outperform a parameter-rich least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-estimated model and a deep neural network (DNN) with non-optimized hyper-parameters in terms of the mean absolute forecast error.,True,BkmQkbYAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,5,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4605,568536271197901934,/scholar?cites=568536271197901934,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4605/pdf,0,0,0

The latter are often compared using unique. not publicly available datasets and across too short and limited to one market test samples. The proposed new methods are rarely benchmarked against well established and well performing simpler models. the accuracy metrics are sometimes inadequate and testing the significance of differences in predictive performance is seldom conducted. Consequently. it is not clear which methods perform well nor what are the best practices when forecasting electricity prices. In this paper. we tackle these issues by performing a literature survey of state-of-the-art models. comparing state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning methods across multiple years and markets. and by putting forward a set of best practices. In addition. we make available the considered datasets. forecasts of the state-of-the-art models. and a specifically designed python toolbox. so that new algorithms can be rigorously evaluated in future studies.,True,BkmQkbYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08004,7924043544070261162,/scholar?cites=7924043544070261162,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08004,0,0,0

Said methods cover a very broad spectrum. from decision trees. through random forests to various artificial neural network models and hybrid approaches. In electricity price forecasting. neural networks are the most popular machine learning method as they provide a non-linear counterpart for well-tested linear regression models. Their application. however. is not straightforward. with multiple implementation factors to consider. One of such factors is the network's structure. This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of two most common structures when using the deep neural networks--one that focuses on each hour of the day separately. and one that reflects the daily auction structure and models vectors of the prices. The results show a significant accuracy advantage of using the latter. confirmed on data from five distinct power exchanges.,True,BkmQkbYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08006,453029432178963511,/scholar?cites=453029432178963511,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08006,0,0,0

Here. considering two novel extensions of the SCANN concept to probabilistic forecasting. we find that (i) efficiently calibrated NARX networks can outperform their autoregressive counterparts. even without combining forecasts from many runs. and that (ii) in terms of accuracy it is better to construct probabilistic forecasts directly from point predictions. however. if speed is a critical issue. running quantile regression on combined point forecasts (ie. committee machines) may be an option worth considering.

The results demonstrate the good safety benefit of oxy-CFB operation. especially in the oxy-transition process. A slightly higher oxygen concentration. ranging from 22.2% to 23.4% for different fuels in oxy-fuel operation. can bring equivalent or higher carbon burnout than air combustion.

Recent attempts to improve the CO2 uptake of Ca-based sorbents by adding calcium lignosulfonate (CLS) with hydration have succeeded in enhancing its effectiveness. The optimum mass ratio of CLS/CaO is 0.5 wt.%. The reduction in particle size and grain size of CaO appeared to be parts of the reasons for increase in CO2 capture. The primary cause of increase in reactivity of the modified sorbents was the ability of the CLS to retard the sintering rate and thus to remain surface area and pore volume for reaction. The CO2 uptake of the modified sorbents was also enhanced by elevating the carbonation pressure. Experimental results indicate that the optimal reaction condition of the modified sorbents is at 0.5 MPa and 700 °C and a high conversion of 0.7 is achieved …,True,PzfK_oIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,43,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378382010003656,9251902877249822476,/scholar?cites=9251902877249822476,,,0,0,0

A low-cost and easy method was proposed to improve the cyclic CO2 capture capacity of the limestone by discontinuously adding hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the carbonation step in some cycles rather than in the each cycle at the calcium looping conditions. The effects of the discontinuous addition of HCl under the various conditions on the CO2 capture performance of the limestone at the calcium looping conditions were investigated in a dual fixed-bed reactor. The results show that HCl addition during the initial several cycles leads to the formation of CaClOH and the moderate CaClOH in the carbonation product is favorable to CO2 capture by the limestone.

1194185,US state-level carbon dioxide emissions: a spatial-temporal econometric approach of the environmental Kuznets curve,2010,James Burnett and John C Bergstrom,,,1607-2016-134496,,,One of the major criticisms of past environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) studies is that the spatiotemporal aspects within the data have largely been ignored. By ignoring the spatial aspect of pollution emissions past estimates of the EKC implicitly assume that a region’s emissions are unaffected by events in neighboring regions (ie. assume there are no transboundary pollution emissions between neighbors). By ignoring the spatial aspects within the data several past estimates of the EKC could have generated biased or inconsistent regression results. By ignoring the temporal aspect within the data several past estimates of the EKC could have generated spurious regression results or misspecified t and F statistics. To address this potential misspecification we estimate the relationship between state-level carbon dioxide emissions and income (GDP) accounting for both the spatiotemporal components within the data. Specifically. we estimate a dynamic spatiotemporal panel model using a newly proposed robust. spatial fixed effects model. This new estimation scheme is appropriate for panels with large N and T. Consistent with the EKC hypothesis we find the inverted-U shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and income. Further. we find adequate evidence that carbon dioxide emissions and state-level GDP are temporally and spatially dependent. These findings offer policy implications for both interstate energy trade and pollution emission regulations.

The analysis is then expanded to examine the estimable relationship at the state level. The air pollution indicators include ozone. carbon monoxide. nitrogen dioxide. sulfur dioxide. and particulate matter. The results are mixed results. This study finds a statistically significant U-shaped relationship for some of the pollutants; however. the evidence is pretty weak with the exception of ground level ozone. This study does not find evidence to support the traditional EKC inverse U-shaped relationship. These results are compared and contrasted to previous studies providing insight into unresolved theoretical and empirical estimation issues and future research needs.,True,BeSg2OsAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,9,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/46838/,15449351058962310220,/scholar?cites=15449351058962310220,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/46838/files/Burnett_manuscript1.pdf,0,0,0

This methodology allows us to account for endogenously determined economic fundamentals and market speculation. After controlling for market trends and seasonality. we find relative large increases in volatility spillovers between corn. crude oil. and ethanol futures prices.

In modern wholesale electricity markets. these transmission constraints lead to spatial patterns within the nodal electricity spot prices. This study exploits these spatial patterns to better predict spot prices within a wholesale electricity market. More specifically. we use the latest spatial panel data econometric models to compare within-sample and out-of-sample forecasts against nonspatial panel data models. The spatial panel data approach is explained by demonstrating a simple network optimization model.

We measure efficiency by extending a cost-minimization model that treats the total amount of energy services produced as latent or unobserved due to technological differences in household consumption. The empirical strategy consists of applying latent class modeling to cost frontier analysis. which helps to identify heterogeneous subsets of units that require the fewest energy resources. Our estimates of efficient units form an empirical cost frontier of best practices within each subset. In order to understand the determinants of household-level energy efficiency. we condition the cost frontier analysis on numerous physical. climate-related. and socio-economic characteristics of the household. We find that state-level energy building code regulations. on average. induce a one-to-four percent marginal increase in household energy consumption.,True,BeSg2OsAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,4,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=3100,1427347516375511038,/scholar?cites=1427347516375511038,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=3100,0,0,0

1194195,Hydraulic fracturing and US water policy,2013,J Wesley Burnett,30,"AGH Drilling, Oil, Gas",,,,EN The recent boom in the development of natural gas from shale is a game changer for US domestic energy. Large domestic reserves of shale gas reduce dependency on foreign producers. as is currently the case for crude oil. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that the US contains approximately 500 trillion cubic feet of unproved technically recoverable resources from shale gas. At current rates. that is enough gas from shale alone to supply the entire country for approximately twenty-one years. The large increase in shale gas development has been made possible through the development of two principle technologies: horizontal drilling and high-volume. hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) fluid. Horizontal drilling or directional drilling allows producers to access far more natural gas from relatively thin shale deposits within the earth. HVHF involves injecting a large volume mixture of water. sand. and other chemicals deep into the earth. The high pressure from the fluid causes shale rock formations to fracture so that natural gas can be released and extracted. HVHF fluid is mostly composed of water (generally ninety-eight to ninety-nine percent) and can contain some potentially hazardous (and possibly carcinogenic) chemicals including benzene and lead. The contention over hydraulic fracturing surrounds public fears over contamination of drinking water sources. This sentiment was captured in the anti-fracking film by Josh Fox called Gasland-the film received a 2010 special jury prize for a documentary at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated by the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2011.

According to a recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA. 2013) report. approximately 39% of the current population is concentrated in coastal counties. which constitute less than 10% of the entire land area within the contiguous US Further. approximately 52% of the population lives in counties that drain into coastal watersheds. which represent less than 20% of the total US land area. Based on current trends. the population within coastal regions will grow from the current level of 123 million to 134 million people by the year 2020. The trends in population growth are no different for the South Atlantic coastal region of the US. which consists of the states of North Carolina. South Carolina. Georgia. and Florida. According to the US Census Bureau (2010). approximately 23 million people moved to the coastal counties within the Southeastern Region between 1960 and 2008. The South Atlantic region. as a whole (ie. coastal and non-coastal areas). is host to the most active and persistent inflow of domestic migrants in the US Based on current trends. this area could soon become the nation’s most populous region (Kotkin 2013). In South Carolina alone. the coastal region has experienced a 22% increase in population and is expected to reach over 1.5 million people by 2030 (South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office 2015).

The new rule establishes emissions guidelines. including heat-rate efficiency improvements. for states when developing plans to limit GHG emissions. Past studies have indicated that heat-rate efficiency improvements can increase electricity output. leading to a reduction in emissions rates and an increase in emissions levels – a rebound effect that can temper the emissions-reduction benefits of plant-level heat-rate efficiency.

1194207,Capturing rents from natural resource abundance: Private royalties from us onshore oil & gas production,2016,Jason P Brown and Timothy Ryan Fitzgerald and Jeremy Glenn Weber,46,Resource and Energy Economics,,23-38,,We study how much private mineral owners capture geologically-driven advantages in well productivity through a higher royalty rate. Using proprietary data from nearly 1.8 million leases. we estimate that the six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014. There is limited pass-through of resource abundance into royalty rates.

1194222,The off-farm occupations of US farm operators and their spouses,2013,Jason P Brown and Jeremy Weber,,USDA-ERS Economic Information Bulletin,117,,,Because of the broad definition of a farm—which includes numerous small operations that produce little or no agricultural commodities in any given year—most farm households earn all of their income from non-farm sources. However. even those operating farms with substantial production often have significant non-farm income. Most non-farm income. in turn. comes from off-farm jobs. Industry and occupation information collected by the US Department of Agriculture’s 2010 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) provides one indication of how the skills demanded and cultivated on the farm influence off-farm employment incentives and opportunities. Consistent with the notion that farming requires substantial management skills. this study finds that when farm operators and their spouses work off farm. they are most likely to hold a management or professional occupation.

Pennsylvania introduced a per-well impact fee despite concerns that it would discourage industry investment. Using a quasi-experimental design and data that nearly cover the universe of leases and wells in Pennsylvania. Ohio. and West Virginia. we find that leasing by energy firms declined dramatically after the fee’s enactment. but little to no declines in well permitting or drilling occurred in the most geologically similar subsample. We estimate that at least 60% of the decline in leasing reflects a liquidity crunch linked to retroactive application of the fee in a time of low natural gas prices.

By exploiting periods of high and low appreciation that caused various increases in wealth for farmers owning various shares of their farmland. we examine whether U.S. grain farmers expanded their acres harvested or acres owned in response to an increase in their land wealth. We find that land wealth had little effect on farm size. However. for similarly-sized farms. a larger ownership share (10 percentage points) led to an increase in the growth of land owned (2 percentage points).

Our results support past research findings that indicate farmland values are only partially explained by agricultural returns. We find that multiple nonagricultural attributes of farmland also contribute to the market value.,True,IWGMecEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,84,https://academic.oup.com/ajae/article-abstract/96/5/1307/2738765,4574983775527703203,/scholar?cites=4574983775527703203,,https://academic.oup.com/ajae/article-pdf/96/5/1307/8637808/aau041.pdf,0,0,0
1194230,Agriculture's supply and demand for energy and energy products,2013,Jayson Beckman and Allison Borchers and Carol Adaire Jones,112,USDA-ERS Economic Information Bulletin,,,,Rising energy prices and changing energy and environmental policies have transformed the relationship between the energy and agriculture sectors. Traditionally. the relationship has been one-way. with agriculture using energy products as an input in production; during the past decade. however. the energy sector’s use of agricultural products as renewable-fuel feedstocks has increased substantially. This report examines both sector and farm-level responses to changing market and policy drivers such as the increased production of biofuel crops and other sources of renewable energy. together with changes in production practices to economize on energy-based inputs like fertilizer. We provide insight into how farmers have adapted to the changes and update and provide new data on the evolving linkages between the energy and agricultural sectors.,True,IWGMecEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,68,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2267323,15436663714994053644,/scholar?cites=15436663714994053644,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/149033/files/eib-112.pdf,0,0,0

The model allows the marginal impacts of parcel characteristics to vary nonlinearly over space with an endogenous smooth transition between urban fringe and rural areas. The estimation examines 10.317 parcel-level farmland transactions across the state of Illinois over the period January 2001–December 2009.

1194234,Multi-cropping practices: recent trends in double-cropping,2014,Allison Borchers and Elizabeth Truex-Powell and Steven Wallander and Cynthia Nickerson,,,1476-2017-3888,,,Over the last decade. growing demand for agricultural commodities—for both food and fuel—has increased the incentives for farm operators to increase production. One way to expand production and potentially increase the return to farming is by intensifying the use of existing cropland. One form of intensification is double cropping—the harvest of two crops from the same field in a given year. From 1999 to 2012 double cropping occurred on about 2 percent of total cropland in most years. Soybeans were. on average. the most common crop found on double-cropped acres over this time period. and. in 2012. winter wheat most commonly preceded these soybean plantings. However. regional and temporal variation is apparent in all double-cropping trends. likely indicating farmers’ responsiveness to local conditions and changing market incentives. Although double cropping has the potential to limit the environmental consequences associated with cropland expansion (such as increased soil erosion and loss of wildlife habitat or carbon sinks) as US farmers increase production to meet growing global demand. it also may introduce negative environmental consequences of its own. The trends and analysis provided in this report are intended to support future discussion on the factors influencing its use and help inform discussions about the merits of expanding its use.,True,IWGMecEAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,42,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/262122/files/46871_eib125.pdf,12445849419486657041,/scholar?cites=12445849419486657041,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/262122/files/46871_eib125.pdf,0,0,0

Data were collected from an Internet survey of 515 residents of New York State. The welfare analysis indicated that on average households incur a welfare loss from in-state hydraulic fracturing as the source of their electricity.

Farm real estate (which includes land and the structures on it) accounts for over 80 percent of farm-sector assets. Farm real estate values reached record highs in 2015. driven by high net cash farm income and low interest rates. However. farmland appreciation has slowed considerably over the last 2 years due to lower commodity prices and lower net cash farm income. raising questions about the potential impact on farm financial stress. This study finds that farmland appreciation lowered the share of farms that were considered financially stressed in 2000-2012. particularly those that owned less than one-quarter of their acres operated. It also finds that farms that owned at least 50 percent of their acres purchased more farmland during periods of high appreciation and land equity gains.

However. after years of strong farm sector performance. the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates net farm income declined in 2014 and projects continued declines in 2015 and 2016. returning to levels last observed in 2002. after adjusting for inflation. The continued drop in farm sector income is expected to place downward pressure on farm asset values. which had appreciated during the previous several years. The resulting drop in liquidity from multiple years of lower income is also expected to increase the need for sector borrowing relative to the 2009-2013 period. As a result. the USDA predicts a decline in sector equity and an increase in leverage. which signals the potential building of financial stress within the farm sector.

We test different theories that might explain this. and conclude that the shift is mostly the result of revolutionary changes in cultivation practices. The switch from conventional to conservation tillage brought about by changes in herbicide technologies. genetically modified seeds. increased fuel costs. and knowledge of the benefits of soil micro‐organisms. has reduced a tenant‐farmer's ability to exploit a landowner's soil. This removes a major incentive to cropshare and makes cash renting more attractive.

1194257,Agricultural pests as common property: Control of the corn rootworm,1984,William F Lazarus and Bruce L Dixon,66,American Journal of Agricultural Economics,4,456-465,Oxford University Press,Insecticide resistance is an increasingly widespread problem reducing effectiveness and necessitating a switch to more expensive controls. A common property resource model is used to describe potential gain from internalizing resistance externalities through regional coordination. A nonlinear programming model of an Illinois cash grain farm is used to estimate the gain for corn rootworm control where rotation to soybeans is an alternative to insecticide. Switching to rotation as resistance builds causes a relatively minor decrease in profits because soybeans are profitable. Gain from delaying resistance is slight.

However. these studies have failed to consider potential differences in farm size between the two systems. If an organic crop rotation cannot be managed on as large an area as a conventional rotation given the same resources. a per-hectare profitability advantage for the organic system would not necessarily translate into a whole-farm profitability advantage.This paper uses management data from a long-term cropping systems trial to estimate the maximum farm size for a conventional corn–soybean rotation and an organic corn–soybean–oat/alfalfa–alfalfa rotation. subject to appropriate yield penalties for management delays and three different machinery complement scenarios.

The study was largely a review of the “gray literature” on digesters. and it serves as a snapshot overview of the industry. Digesters are fairly capital-intensive when viewed primarily as an energy source. On a strictly market basis. current US average electricity prices do not appear to provide sufficient economic justification for digesters to move beyond a fairly limited niche. Digesters make the most sense today where the odor and nutrient management benefits are important. or where the electricity or heat has a higher-than-average value. Digester biogas is mainly methane. which is destroyed when flared or used for electricity. This methane destruction is beneficial in terms of climate change.

We estimate cross-sectional regressions of the mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease against the intensity of fuel consumption using local data for the entire US. before the US Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1974 and after the most recent policy revisions in 2004.

The trees can be grown for energy and for traditional uses such as oriented strandboard. Using IMPLAN (Impact Analysis for Planning) software. we modeled the impacts of shifting land use from hay and pasture for cow—calf beef operations to hybrid poplars in northwest and west central Minnesota. Construction of a $175 million energy conversion facility capable of making 44 million gal of ethanol and 7.6 million gal of mixed alcohols by gasification/catalysis would create 2.412 jobs. with $158 million in value added. Facility operation. assuming establishment of 200.000 ac of hybrid poplar. did not substantially change the number of jobs relative to using the land for cow—calf operations.

Changes in one region therefore also affect others. This is particularly true for a force as large and pervasive as urbanization which resulted in massive rural and urban economic restructuring and geographic realignment of rural–urban boundaries. Until the mid-twentieth century. rural could be considered the opposite of urban. but in the process of urbanization. economic and social structures of rural and urban regions became more similar. However. perceptions and attitudes often survive long after conditions that shaped them have changed. In this article. the authors explain why attention to proper definitions of rural and urban is important to policymaking and analysis.

These results do not come as a surprise given that many SSA countries score very low on all dimensions of institutional quality.

It updates and extends an earlier study [1]. The extensions include analyses of population distribution trends by region and citizenship. Results show that Switzerland experienced deconcentration in the 1970s at the cantonal level. and in the 1980s and 1990s at the district level. The results also show a trend of moving away from large densely populated districts to small. sparsely populated and medium sized districts. There was a strong suburbanization trend starting in the 1950s and counter-urbanization during 1980-2000. The core urban areas experienced the slowest growth at the end of the century.

1194286,An analysis of amenity-led rural economic* development in northeast region: A spatial simultaneous equations approach,2009,Mulugeta Saare Kahsai,,,,,,In a matter of just a few decades. the economic landscape of rural America has changed in fundamental ways. Industries once considered the backbone of rural economies have been transformed by globalization and marketing. Others. such as tourism and amenity-based economies or the service sector. have emerged to replace the traditional natural resource and manufacturing-based economies. These changes have invigorated some areas. and forever altered others. Consequently. Interest in an amenity focused development strategy has exploded as policymakers and community leaders realize that most of the jobs lost in recent decades will not return. Instead. these leaders are looking inside their communities for new sources of economic growth.; In an effort to analyze the role of natural and recreational amenities in rural economic growth. this study develops a simultaneous-equation system under the assumptions of profit maximization of firms and utility maximization of households as well as the neoclassical assumption of equilibrium growth in a partial lag-adjustment growth-equilibrium framework. Past studies assume that amenities have a direct and independent effect on economic growth. but in reality the availability of high amenity levels alone can only create the opportunity for economic growth. But to be an effective development tool it should be coupled with factors that can exploit its existence. encourage its use. and give it a comparative advantage.; This research extends existing studies in this area by incorporating interaction terms that account for the combined impact of amenities with proximity to metropolitan areas and …,True,suKR5eUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,10,https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/etd/2925/,7975062976781712337,/scholar?cites=7975062976781712337,,https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3929&context=etd,0,0,0

Hence. policies affecting documented migration also affect undocumented migration. This paper explores this relationship from a theoretical perspective. The implications of this exploration are that lax enforcement of visa rules and national borders. combined with a very long waiting line (small annual quotas) for immigrant visas. can make illegal immigration a preferred option over legal immigration or. more generally. that for policy purposes all types of migrations should be regarded as interdependent.

To answer this fundamental question. it attempts to replicate traditional experimental design by comparing places in which a policy (treatment) has been implemented with carefully matched control groups in which no treatment has been implemented. The control group serves as the counterfactual for what would have happened to the treatment group in the absence of treatment. It provides a baseline forecast.

Based on a system of equations estimation. the empirical results confirm the hypotheses that income inequality has a growth-dampening effect. that income inequality is endogenous to regional growth. and that the channels through which income inequality determines growth are adjustments at the regional level. such as migration and changes in employment and incomes. The results have numerous policy implications. The noted forces can be utilized as policy instruments to mitigate income inequality and its growth dampening effects. because a) as income inequality is endogenous. its equilibrium level can be internally determined within a regional growth process. b) since traditional income inequality mitigating policies have an indirect effect on overall regional growth. they may have unintended indirect effects on income inequality. and c) regional growth adjustment also equilibrates income inequality.,True,suKR5eUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://ideas.repec.org/a/jid/journl/y2011v20i3-4p43-56.html,3034118292368754611,/scholar?cites=3034118292368754611,,,0,0,0

The Autoregressive Distributed Bounds Testing Approach (ARDL) is employed to calculate short-run and long-run relationships in the presence of structural breaks and the vector error correction model is applied to determine the direction of causality. The bounds tests suggest that the five variables are bound together in the long run when CO2 emission is the dependent variable and that urbanisation has the largest impact on CO2 emissions.

The contribution of these factors in aggregate output and telecommunications evolution is examined using a framework that accounts for the endogeneity and interactions between aggregate output and telephone penetration rates. Results from the study indicate that government effectiveness is an important determinant for aggregate output. Another supplemental finding is that the incessant political upheavals in SSA countries have a detrimental effect on aggregate output. From this. we endorse that SSA countries should design and implement efficient institutional frameworks and mechanisms that will expand telecommunications network infrastructure in both rural and urban areas and thus spur growth and development.,True,suKR5eUAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/rri_pubs/59/,,,,https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1043&context=rri_pubs,0,0,0

In the first step. we examine the degree of integration between GDP and energy consumption and find that the variables are integrated of order one. In the second step. we investigate the long-run relationship between energy consumption and GDP; our results provide strong evidence that GDP and energy consumption move together in the long-run. In the third step. we estimate the long-run relationship and test for causality using panel-based error correction models and find a long-run bidirectional relationship between GDP and energy consumption.

The key question addressed by this approach is “what would have happened had there been no policy/treatment/intervention”. To answer this fundamental question. it attempts to replicate traditional experimental design by comparing places in which a policy (treatment) has been implemented with carefully matched control groups in which no treatment has been implemented. The control group serves as the counterfactual for what would have happened to the treatment group in the absence of treatment. It provides a baseline forecast. This method is typically used in impact evaluations when experiments are infeasible.Selecting the right control group and applying an appropriate impact evaluations method are key to the effectiveness of quasi-experimental approach. Over the years. researchers have developed different control group selection methods that use single/multiple similarities on the pre-treatment period. The most widely used are difference of means test. Mahalanobis distance. and propensity score. Impact evaluation is done based on simple difference of means test. simple regression. regression discontinuity. and difference of difference methods.,True,suKR5eUAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12864356843615012019&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

A spatial-econometric hedonic housing price model is developed and estimated for the Seoul metropolitan area to measure the marginal value of improvements in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NOx) concentrations. Diagnostic testing favored the spatial-lag model over the spatial error model. Results showed that SO2 pollution levels had a significant impact on housing prices while NOx pollution did not. The authors attribute this differential impact to the relatively higher levels of SO2 pollution when compared with pollution standards and the relative recency of the NOx pollution. Marginal WTP for a 4% improvement in mean SO2 concentrations is about $2333 or 1.4% of mean housing price.,True,xsLc0rEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,810,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009506960200013X,4671374428466803732,/scholar?cites=4671374428466803732,,,0,0,0

The results are. as expected. different than those for conventional agricultural technologies. For example. the effects of human capital characteristics are significant. while those for structural and institutional characteristics are not. However. the likelihood of adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is affected most by the environmental characteristic of whether or not the producer is aware that ground water contamination exists on his farm.

Work on this problem has evolved from the initial suggestion by Rosen [16] that exogenous market supply will solve the identification problem to arguments by Diamond and Smith [7] for the use of multiple markets.A good deal of uncertainty still exists. however. because there is little agreement on criteria for identification and. more fundamentally. there is little discussion of what is being identified.

In general. non‐farm business owners bear little or none of the costs of environmental degradation that their business activities cause. However. farmers who reside on the farm may bear some of the costs associated with using chemicals. As a result. voluntary programs encouraging adoption of management practices that simultaneously improve on farm and off‐farm environmental quality may not require subsidizing farmers for their full loss in profits.

Consumers worried about the health effects of pesticide residues on foods; conversion of wetlands to crop production was blamed for the decreased population of migratory waterfowl; rural residents womiedabout the effects of nitrates and pesticides found in their groundwater supplies; and sediment. nutrients. and pesticides in surface waters were blamed for the decline of estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay and contributed to problems in freshwater and coastal fisheries.As a result of this concern. many changes occurred. The first involved changes in policies. New farm programs designed to protect the environment. such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). and sodbuster and swampbuster restrictions. were incorporated into the Food Security Act of 1985 (FSA). The Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FTFRA) was revised to speed up the timetable for reviewing older pesticides. The revised Water Quality Act of 1987 directed states to develop management plans to control nonpoint source pollution.

Pollak (1978) states four reasons why change in taste may be considered endogenous to a socio-economic system and one of the more important factors involves consumers developing habits.'Consumers' current preferences depend upon their past consumption decisions. This phenomenon has been explicitly included in demand analyses by formulating various habit formation schemes. Stone (1954). Pollak and Wales (1969). Houthakker and Taylor (1970). Phlips (1974) and others have proposed and tested several different habit specifications in demand systems.

Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ.,In this paper we develop a spatial panel simultaneous-equations model of employment growth. migration behavior. local public services and median household income in a partial lag-adjustment growth-equilibrium framework and utilizing a one-way error component model for the disturbances. To estimate the model. we developed a five-step new estimation strategy by generalizing the Generalized Spatial Three-Stage Least Squares (GS3SLS) approach outlined in Kelejian and Prucha (2004) into a panel data setting. The empirical implementation of the model uses county-level data from the 418 Appalachian counties for 1980-2000. The estimates show the existence of feedback simultaneities among the endogenous variables of the model. the existence of conditional convergence with respect to the respective endogenous variable of each equation of the model. and the existence of spatial autoregressive lag effects and spatial cross-regressive lag effects with respect to the endogenous variables of the model. Moreover. the speed of adjustment parameters is generally comparable to those in literature. One of the key conclusions is that sector-specific policies should be integrated and harmonized in order to give the desirable outcome. In addition. regionally focusing resources for development policy may yield greater returns than treating all locations the same.,True,xsLc0rEAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Schaeffer/publication/23566129_A_Simultaneous_Spatial_Panel_Data_Model_of_Regional_Growth_Variation_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Employment_Income_Migration_and_Local_Public_Services/links/09e4150f73591cb3ca000000/A-Simultaneous-Spatial-Panel-Data-Model-of-Regional-Growth-Variation-An-Empirical-Analysis-of-Employment-Income-Migration-and-Local-Public-Services.pdf,16613137064363697650,/scholar?cites=16613137064363697650,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Schaeffer/publication/23566129_A_Simultaneous_Spatial_Panel_Data_Model_of_Regional_Growth_Variation_An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Employment_Income_Migration_and_Local_Public_Services/links/09e4150f73591cb3ca000000/A-Simultaneous-Spatial-Panel-Data-Model-of-Regional-Growth-Variation-An-Empirical-Analysis-of-Employment-Income-Migration-and-Local-Public-Services.pdf,0,0,0

1194396,SOFTWARE SENSOR DESIGN FOR CEMENT GRINDING CIRCUITS-PRACTICAL ISSUES,2006,Renato Lepore and Alain Vande Wouwer and Marcel Remy and Philippe Bogaerts,,,,59,Elsevier,Due to the lack of reliable and/or inexpensive hardware sensors in cement grinding. development of software sensors is particularly significant for control and monitoring purposes. In this study. a nonlinear distributed-parameter. full-horizon observer is designed. which allows the contents of the mill to be described in terms of hold-up and particle size distribution. When measurements are available at relatively high sampling rates and at. at least. two spatial locations along the mill. fast observer convergence is obtained. However. in practical situations where measurements can be collected at the mill outlet only and with a relatively low sampling rate. the observer convergence deteriorates. as the sampling rate decreases. performance becomes similar to an asymptotic (simulation) observer. The robustness of the software sensor can be improved by on-line identification of some time-varying parameters. such as the …,True,0kPOgJoAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017310005,,,,,0,0,0

The CHP economic dispatch is solved in two levels known as the lower level and higher level. The higher level is the optimization of the surrogate dual function for the relaxed global constraints in which the surrogate subgradient is used to update the Lagrangian multipliers. Coherently. the lower levels are the optimization of the subproblems taking in count each of its local constraints. Flexibility for the choice of algorithm is given at the lower levels optimization techniques with the condition that the algorithm is able to improve its search at each iteration.

Low Frequency Oscillations (LFO) in the range of 0.1–2.5 Hz have been solved through Power System Stabilizer (PSS). Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is the simplest and effective solution to the most of control engineering applications today. Based on advantage. the PID controller combined with PSS to enhance the stability in power system. In practice most of the PID controller and parameters of PSS are tuned manually and fixed for certain operating conditions. In general power systems are non linear. conventional methods had lack of robustness. Therefore it is necessary to take advantage in simplifying the problem and implementation by utilizing most efficient optimization methods. From this view. many optimization methods and algorithms have been employed to tune the PID gains and PSS parameters. This paper broadly reviews the optimization methods and algorithms such as Conventional methods. Soft Computing. Genetic Algorithm (GA). Evolutionary Programming (EP). Differential Evolution (DE) and Swarm Intelligence methods were available for tuning the PID gains and PSS parameters successfully. Research showed the design of controllers based on conventional methods; soft computing and population based algorithms suffer from limitations. However. swarm intelligence techniques proved to be able to overcome these limitations. Swarm intelligence based coordinated controller (PID+ PSS). will effectively enhance the small signal stability and transient stability in power system.

The design methodology of this approach is based on suppressing the TCR harmonic current components by inserting a series LC circuit between the ac source and the parallel combination of TCR and filtering circuit. The series LC circuit is tuned at the ac supply fundamental frequency. whereas the filtering circuit is built of a set of significant odd harmonic filters characterized by minimal no load operating losses and no reactive power contribution at the fundamental frequency. The proposed filtering circuit is less sensitive to the adjacent harmonics generating circuits in the power system network. therefore it remains always efficient.

However. much of the work that has been published to date does not fully investigate the validity of the assumptions within the model and whether they fully characterise the building. To investigate this issue. a typical pre-1920’s UK house is modelled in Designbuilder in order to recognise and reduce the gap between modelled and measured energy performance. A model was first built to the specifications of a measured survey of the Salford Energy House. a facility which is housed in a climate controlled chamber.

However. the industry needs to look beyond regarding the problem as restricted to the physical upgrade of properties. Asset managers. engineers and installers work on and in people’s homes and. in many cases. are subsequently changing the way householders use their homes to meet their comfort and wider energy needs. Here we consider how the twin issues of adopting and living with retrofit technologies have affected groups of residents in social housing.

If we look at such an integrated project team or supply chain. however. what motivates its members to collaborate with each other? Does collaboration only occur where commercial self-interest exists? This paper argues that even where there are efficient supply chain processes in place. high levels of collaboration require trust. Trust makes information flow smooth. and creates a knowledge sharing environment in which the whole supply chain progresses and develops. This paper reviews the concepts of trust and collaborative working. Drawing from the findings of an EPSRC funded project on trust in Construction Project. we suggest the main drivers for. and barriers against. the development of trust in the construction sector The paper reports on a content analysis of interviews that explored the meaning of trust in construction and relates this concept to that of collaborative working.

The IMI Trust in Construction Project is an attempt to evaluate the levels of trust between individuals working together on construction projects. The project is currently undertaking pilot case studies applying Social Network Analysis. This approach has already been demonstrated as useful in reflecting the structure of construction teams (Pryke 1998). The Trust in Construction approach seeks to expand this to include cognitive and behavioural data based on the ideas of a Trust Inventory (Bromily and Cummings 1996). The first stage of the Trust in Construction project is to develop networks built on objective measures. based on questionnaires and documentation (Scott 1991). to evaluate structure and information flow. The data collection methodologies are presented as a central factor in evaluating relationships and. ultimately. trust. Social Network Analysis gives a number of analytical approaches to attempt to understand the data collected. The data allows the analysis of structural. transactional and linking concepts (Tichy 1979). Concepts such as distance and centrality can show roles and participation within the network providing a basis for further analysis. Cliques. clusters or cores can shows how individuals or groups of individuals operate within the context of the whole construction project (Scott 1991).,True,0OtND24AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,14,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.6704&rep=rep1&type=pdf,10815236766638764655,/scholar?cites=10815236766638764655,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.6704&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Current methods identify that surface areas exhibiting a homogeneous temperature—away from regions of thermal bridging—can be used to obtain U-values. In doing so. however. the resulting U-value is assumed to represent that entire building element. contrary to the information given by the initial infrared inspection. This can be problematic when applying these measured U-values to models for predicting energy performance. Three techniques have been used to measure the U-values of external building elements of a full-scale replica of a pre-1920s UK home under controlled conditions: point measurements. using heat flux meters. and two variations of infrared thermography at high and low resolutions. U-values determined from each technique were used to calibrate a model of that building and predictions of the heat transfer coefficient. annual energy consumption. and fuel cost were made. Point measurements and low-resolution infrared thermography were found to represent a relatively small proportion of the overall U-value distribution. By propagating the variation of U-values found using high-resolution thermography. the predicted heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was found to vary between 183 W/K to 235 W/K (±12%). This also led to subsequent variations in the predictions for annual energy consumption for heating (between 4923 kWh and 5481 kWh.±11%); and in the predicted cost of that energy consumption (between£ 227 and£ 281.±24%).

This paper examines suspended timber ground floor heat-flow by presenting high resolution in-situ heat-flux measurements undertaken in a case study house at 15 point locations on the floor. The results highlight significant variability in observed heat-flow: point U-values range from 0.56 ± 0.05 to 1.18 ± 0.11 Wm−2 K−1.

While new build. particularly in the social housing sector. has been subject to increasingly stringent regulation. through the Building Regulations (ODPM 2006) and the Code for Sustainable Homes (CLG 2009). there is recognition that this will mean change for only a small part of the current housing stock. having only a minimal effect on the overall energy use and related emissions of the domestic sector. The existing UK housing stock is replaced at less than 1% per annum (Boardman 2007; Ravetz 2008; HM Government 2010a). so in order to reduce energy consumption and the associated carbon dioxide emissions. the current wisdom is that the existing stock must be brought up to higher energy performance standards (Kelly 2009 …,True,0OtND24AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,12,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118273463#page=52,15198345965588597713,/scholar?cites=15198345965588597713,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Will_Swan/publication/315896928_Retrofit_innovation_in_the_UK_social_housing_sector_A_Socio-technical_perspective/links/5bd0255092851c1816bc9612/Retrofit-innovation-in-the-UK-social-housing-sector-A-Socio-technical-perspective,0,0,0

However. much of the work that has been published to date does not fully investigate the validity of the assumptions within the model and whether they fully characterise the building. To investigate this issue. a typical pre-1920’s UK house is modelled in Designbuilder in order to recognise and reduce the gap between modelled and measured energy performance. A model was first built to the specifications of a measured survey of the Salford Energy House. a facility which is housed in a climate controlled chamber.

Current methods identify that surface areas exhibiting a homogeneous temperature—away from regions of thermal bridging—can be used to obtain U-values. In doing so. however. the resulting U-value is assumed to represent that entire building element. contrary to the information given by the initial infrared inspection. This can be problematic when applying these measured U-values to models for predicting energy performance. Three techniques have been used to measure the U-values of external building elements of a full-scale replica of a pre-1920s UK home under controlled conditions: point measurements. using heat flux meters. and two variations of infrared thermography at high and low resolutions. U-values determined from each technique were used to calibrate a model of that building and predictions of the heat transfer coefficient. annual energy consumption. and fuel cost were made. Point measurements and low-resolution infrared thermography were found to represent a relatively small proportion of the overall U-value distribution. By propagating the variation of U-values found using high-resolution thermography. the predicted heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was found to vary between 183 W/K to 235 W/K (±12%). This also led to subsequent variations in the predictions for annual energy consumption for heating (between 4923 kWh and 5481 kWh.±11%); and in the predicted cost of that energy consumption (between£ 227 and£ 281.±24%).

This in part can be achieved by installing energy efficient building elements such as windows. curtains. doors. etc. Thus the aim of this study was to develop a combined imaging system for measuring the thermal and acoustic efficiency of retrofit building elements in modern homes. A case study is presented for measuring the thermal and acoustic efficiency of tweed curtains on a double sash window as a part of a collaborative. interdisciplinary project involving the Acoustics Test Laboratories and the Energy House at University of Salford. The thermal efficiency was quantified by measuring U-values of the curtain and the window. The acoustic efficiency of the curtain was quantified by its ‘Sound Insulation’. Using the Microflown PU acoustic probe. the insertion loss was measured as well as the noise break-in was assessed for ventilated case-when the window is opened. These parameters are measured in-situ and may be used to compliment qualitative comfort values.

Tested under Controlled Conditions,2018,A Marshall and R Fitton and M Benjaber and W Swan,,,,203-214,,Dwellings with suspended timber floors are commonplace in the UK. making up almost a third of the overall housing stock. Floor coverings. such as carpets and vinyl. are often used in these types of dwellings to achieve thermal comfort. aesthetics and energy. Over time. due to general wear and tear. the quality and performance of floor coverings can deteriorate. This deterioration affects the overall performance of these coverings as a whole and so it becomes necessary to replace them. Developments in the production of floor coverings and underlay have resulted in the opportunity to replace floor coverings with more robust materials. which can demonstrate improved energy efficiency. The Energy House at the University of Salford is a full-scale replica of a typical UK home (pre 1920’s Victorian Terrace). contained within a controlled environment. This facility was originally fitted with a synthetic carpet and laminate on top of rubber-based underlay material. After 6 years of heavy use. all floor coverings within the house were replaced with new materials. Tests were conducted throughout the transition from old coverings to new. under steady state conditions; this included measurements of energy consumption. heat flux density. air tightness. and the global heat transfer coefficient. The original floor coverings were found to improve the overall energy consumption by 2.7%. heat flux through the floor by 16.9%. air tightness by 3.3% and the global heat transfer coefficient by 3.0%.

1194626,On modelling for domestic energy autonomy in the UK: understanding the role of traditional and novel technologies for small-scale hydrogen storage,2018,AS Marshall,,,,,,The domestic sector is one of the largest consumers of energy in the UK. The poor energy performance of the existing housing stock within this sector has resulted in an ever-growing energy demand and an energy infrastructure that is struggling to cope. With an increasing drive towards decarbonisation comes the expansion of renewable generation across the UK. however with that comes the limitations of intermittency inherent in the technologies. Energy storage is considered as a solution to these limitations. though with this is the potential for redefining the UK’s energy regime. Decentralised generation. storage and consumption of energy is proposed as an alternative regime as the core theme of this thesis. A common type of British home (a pre-1920s Victorian end terrace building) has been modelled in the dynamic energy simulation software Designbuilder in order to explore how such buildings respond to decentralised energy management. The model was based upon a house of this type within the Energy House research facility at the University of Salford. constructed inside a climate controlled chamber and augmented with a photovoltaic installation. Intrinsic flaws in building modelling appear in the phenomenon known as the performance gap. which reduces the accuracy of models. The same flaws were found in the model created for this study. By applying a calibration procedure that replaced assumed performance parameters with those measured in-situ. the observed performance gap was reduced by a significant amount and therefore increasing the accuracy and predictive capacity of the model.

However. much of the work that has been published to date does not fully investigate the validity of the assumptions within the model and whether they fully characterise the building. To investigate this issue. a typical pre-1920’s UK house is modelled in Designbuilder in order to recognise and reduce the gap between modelled and measured energy performance. A model was first built to the specifications of a measured survey of the Salford Energy House. a facility which is housed in a climate controlled chamber.

The property is a re-construction within an environmental chamber using reclaimed materials designed to test housing retrofit solutions. Climate projections for Manchester from both UKCIP02 and UKCP09 programmes were used to assess the likely overheating in summer for this ‘Hard to Treat’ property judging by both single and adaptive comfort criteria from CIBSE Guide A and BS EN 15251. In the bedroom. where occupants have less ability to adapt. overheating could occur as early as 2020s; while in the living room. using the annually adaptive approach. overheating may not happen until 2080s.

The purpose of the work is to demonstrate the potential of CFD for modelling these airflows using solutions from simple mathematical models and salt bath experiments to provide an indication of the accuracy that can be attained. The storeys are connected to an atrium and air flows into them via top-down-chimneys.

The 2-D modelling work investigates the coupled convective. conductive and radiative heat transfer through the DSF system. The angles of the venetian blind can be adjusted and a series of angles (0. 30. 45. 60 and 80 degrees) has been modelled. The modelling results are compared with the measurements from a section of façade tested within a solar simulator and with predictions from a component based nodal model. Agreement between the three methods is generally good. Discrepancies in the results are generally caused by the simplification of the CFD model resulting less turbulence mixing within the façade cavity. The CFD simulation output suggests that the presence of the venetian blinds has led up to 35 percent enhancement in natural ventilation flow for the façade cavity and 75 percent reduction in heat loads for the internal environment. It was also found that little changes of the convective heat transfer coefficients on the glazing surfaces have been caused by the venetian blinds with different angles.,True,aDBMBLIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,32,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/id/eprint/12352,5443021928344427787,/scholar?cites=5443021928344427787,,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/12352/1/p753_final.pdf,0,0,0

The simulations were compared with a series of small-scale laboratory experiments and existing theoretical models. The aim of the work was to benchmark CFD models for time-dependent buoyancy-driven natural ventilation against previously published experimental results and theoretical models. The simulations agree well with experimental results during the initial development of the room stratification. The CFD results accurately predict the maximum depth of the hot buoyant layer at the top of the room as well as the steady-state interface height which separates the warm upper buoyant layer from the cooler air below.

1194638,The role of diffusion on the interface thickness in a ventilated filling box,2010,N Kaye and M Flynn and Malcolm Cook and Y Ji,652,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,195-205,Cambridge University Press,We examine the role of diffusivity. whether molecular or turbulent. on the steady-state stratification in a ventilated filling box. The buoyancy-driven displacement ventilation model of Linden et al. (J. Fluid Mech.. vol. 212. 1990. p. 309) predicts the formation of a two-layer stratification when a single plume is introduced into an enclosure with vents at the top and bottom. The model assumes that diffusion plays no role in the development of the ambient buoyancy stratification: diffusion is a slow process and the entrainment of ambient fluid into the plume from the diffuse interface will act to thin the interface resulting in a near discontinuity of density between the upper and lower layers. This prediction has been corroborated by small-scale salt bath experiments; however. full-scale measurements in ventilated rooms and complementary numerical simulations suggest an interface that is not sharp but rather smeared out over a finite thickness. For a given plume buoyancy flux. as the cross-sectional area of the enclosure increases the volume of fluid that must be entrained by the plume to maintain a sharp interface also increases. Therefore the balance between the diffusive thickening of the interface and plume-driven thinning favours a thicker interface. Conversely. the interface thickness decreases with increasing source buoyancy flux. although the dependence is relatively weak. Our analysis presents two models for predicting the interface thickness as a function of the enclosure height. base area. composite vent area. plume buoyancy flux and buoyancy diffusivity. Model results are compared with interface thickness measurements based on previously …,True,aDBMBLIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,27,http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/11431/,5809828769099738405,/scholar?cites=5809828769099738405,,http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/11431/1/JFM_YJi.pdf,0,0,0

Sophisticated and detailed human models. i.e. the active multi-nodal thermal models with physiological regulatory responses. have been developed and widely adopted in both research and industrial practice. The recent trend is to integrate human models with environmental models in order to provide more insight into the thermal comfort issues. especially in the non-homogeneous and transient conditions. This paper reviews the logics and expectations of coupling human models with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. One of main objectives of such approaches is to take the advantage of the high resolution achievable with the CFD. to replace the empirical methods used in the human models. We aim to initiate debates on the validity of this objective. and to identify the technical requirements for achieving this goal. A simple experiment with 3D human models of different sizes and shapes is also reported. Initial results shows the presence of arms may be important.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the energy saving potentials from building retrofit using an end-terrace house. similar houses represent about 30 per cent of the existing building stock in the UK.The Salford Energy House – a unique pre-1919 Victorian end-terrace house built within an environmental chamber – was used. Retrofit modelling analysis was carried out using IESVE – a dynamic thermal simulation tool. The retrofitted model was also evaluated using future projected climate data (CIBSE latest release) to examine energy demands and overheating.Findings show that improving building fabric thermal characteristics can reduce space heating demands substantially.

1194654,A critique of the ventilation system used for public schools around gas flaring sites in the Nigeria Niger Delta area,2017,UJ Ogbonda and Y Ji,,Healthy Buildings 2017 Europe,,,,The consideration of ventilation requirements in school buildings has significantly become a critically important factor in the academic performance of pupils in schools. Their health. concentration and performance output have been linked to the amount and quality of fresh air indoors. The ventilation systems employed in Nigerian schools are basic. simple and natural. often through windows and doors. This paper attempts to investigate the appropriateness of ventilation and specification systems used for ventilating classrooms in Nigeria based on documentary reviews of specification guidelines for school construction in other parts of the world. Using a purposive sampling and open-ended questionnaire. this paper finds that the ventilation system used in the Niger delta where gas flaring activities happens in close proximity to schools. falls short of WHO clean indoor air quality standards. Evidence shows that natural ventilation is inadequate to achieve clean indoor air quality. Improving indoor air quality in such areas require mechanical air purifier/humidifier systems. to provide satisfactory air quality. Keywords: School buildings. Indoor Air Quality. Ventilation.

The issues include the development of rating scales for annoyance and social factors. decisions regarding the terminology used in the survey to define annoyance. different sources of vibration. and how respondents’ consider the residential area of investigation when completing the survey. The process highlights the need to combine disciplines. in this case applying knowledge from social sciences and acoustics in order to ensure the collection of robust and reliable data.

1194674,Tenant perceptions and experiences of retrofit,2012,Sharon Chahal and Will Swan and Philip Brown,,"Proceedings of Retrofit 2012 Conference, University of Salford, Salford",,24-26,,The UK Residential Sector accounts for approximately 27% of all the of the energy use in the UK (DECC 2011). The slow replacement rate of the stock. less than 1% per annum. means that changes to the way we build new homes will only make a minimal impact on the energy use within the domestic sector. meaning minimal impact on policy issues such as climate change and fuel poverty. To drive real changes we must address the existing stock. However. when we are considering the residential stock we are not talking about a purely engineering problem. Despite many technical improvements to the UK building stock. CO2 levels continue to rise (Lomas 2010). Resident attitudes. perceptions and experiences of energy efficiency upgrades. both prior and after the installation of measures. are a central element of understanding the success of a retrofit project. In 2010. Fusion21 in conjunction with TPAS (Tenant Participation Advisory Service).

It reports on interviews with 18 representatives of 11 homelessness service providers in one city in England. As Cloke et al. found. these providers tended to be either larger. more ‘professional’. ‘insider’ services or smaller. more ‘amateur’. ‘outsider’ services. However. this does not mean that the former were necessarily more revanchist and the latter less so.

The portrayal of Roma populations as ‘benefit tourists’ has become common within popular media over the last decade. both in the UK and the wider EU. evident in headlines such as ‘The Roma gipsy who sparked a crackdown on benefit tourism’(Daily Mail. 2014) and ‘German economist denounces Roma “benefits tourism”’(EurActiv. 2013). Indeed. the prominent use of the term ‘Roma’in such contexts has been referred to as the ‘ethnicisation of the topic’(Benedik. 2010: 160). However. such narratives need to be seen within a particular social and political context. specifically. the increasing problematisation of immigration since 2000 (Blinder. 2015) coupled with increasingly Eurosceptic attitudes (Ormston and Curtice. 2015).‘Benefit tourism’is one of a number of themes which recur in British media reporting on migrants in general. along with competition for state resources. criminality. anti-social behaviour and. more recently. purported links to terrorism (Garner et al. 2009; Gerard. 2016).

'community' and 'belonging' whilst claiming asylum in the UK. By taking a narrativedialogical approach this research explores the stories that have been constructed around 'asylum' by policy. those working with 'asylum seekers' and 'asylum seekers' themselves. This research looks at how the 'official' narratives of asylum are operationalised and delivered by workers contracted to implement government policy. The study also explores how those making a claim for asylum narrate their lives whilst living in dispersal sites in one region of the UK with particular focus paid to exploring how asylum and dispersal impacts upon 'identity' and 'belonging'. The data for this project was generated in three phases. In the first phase of data generation ten asylum support managers participated in semi-structured interviews. These managers worked for local authorities in the Region planning the strategy and delivery of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) policies to 'asylum seekers' accommodated locally. The second phase of the research also included workers involved in delivering NASS support but in a service delivery role.

Evrard, Architecture and sustainable development. 27th International conference on passive and low energy architecture",,,,This paper approaches the reconstruction of low income housing in a post-disaster zone from the perspective of sustainability. It builds a holistic definition of sustainability for low income housing. based on five key interests: social. cultural. environmental. economic and aesthetics. An Assessment Grid is developed. based on the theory of those five interests and real world experiences. which can be used as a framework for judging the sustainability of an architectural response to low income housing reconstruction. and as a tool to challenge the architect during the design process. The Assessment Grid is applied to develop a sustainable design proposal for the reconstruction of low income dwellings in Pisco. Peru–the site of a devastating earthquake in 2007. The proposal is developed in a real-life scenario. based on data supplied by an NGO working on postdisaster reconstruction in the area. in collaboration with local inhabitants. The Grid is used at each stage of design to highlight the weaknesses and push the design forward. The final design is a demonstration that an architectural solution is possible for sustainable low income housing reconstruction in post-disaster zones. It is also a testament to the usefulness of the Assessment Grid process.

In support of the UK's carbon emission reduction targets. the UK's existing housing stock would benefit from its thermal performance being characterised. This would facilitate decision-making in the reduction of space-heating energy demand through retrofit. Approximately 25% of the UK's 26 million dwellings pre-date 1919 and are predominantly of suspended timber ground floor construction. the performance of which has not been extensively investigated at present. While under-floor insulation uptake may increase under future government policies. the actual thermal performance of suspended timber ground floors and the implications of insulating them are poorly characterised at present. This PhD research used in-situ heat-flow measuring techniques and the research improved and added knowledge and understanding to the methodological approaches of in-situ estimation of floor U-values. the in-situ estimated U-value of a small number of suspended timber ground floors and the effect of some insulation interventions. Findings highlighted a significant variation in 'point' U-values across the floor with increased thermal transmittance observed along the exposed perimeter and near airbrick locations. This additionally highlighted that obtaining 'whole' floor U-values from a limited number of measured point locations on a floor with large heat-flow variations is challenging.

1194699,Future-proofing London,2013,Sofie Pelsmakers,,IMAGINING THE FUTURE CITY,,73,,It is an undeniable fact that even a relatively minimal rise in global warming (around 0.8–1 C to date) has already had a discernible effect on our environment. causing sea level rises of up to 220mm (Allen et al. 2013; UKCP09. nd). While the EU and UK governments have agreed that global warming must be limited to a maximum 2 C rise. global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions continue to rise at an alarming rate (Allen et al. 2013; UKCP09. nd). Current records suggest that the world is heading towards a 2–6 C rise by 2100. associated with a medium. or even high risk global warming scenario (Jennings & Hulme. 2010). So what does this mean for our cities. and specifically for London?In recent years. successive UK governments have made a commitment to ensuring that all new build dwellings are designed to ‘zero carbon’by 2016. an objective to be rolled out across other building types by 2019 (DCLG. 2013). The government also envisages an upgrade of all existing buildings to zero. or close to ‘zero carbon’by 2050 (DECC. 2011). This would suggest. if targets were met. that by 2062 the entire built environment in London will be virtually zero carbon. Zero carbon buildings can only be achieved by building or upgrading existing structures to significantly increased building fabric energy efficiency standards. while also implementing on site renewable technologies and relying on a cleaner energy supply. In addition. it will also be necessary to make considerations for the projected impact of climate change on our existing and future designs. for it must be assumed that by 2062. our buildings and their occupants will be subject to different …,True,qFWPvL0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/10.5334/bag.k/download/82/,17537325677755151165,/scholar?cites=17537325677755151165,,https://ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/10.5334/bag.k/download/82/,0,0,0

While generally the construction industry has been slow to respond to climate change. and scarce resource availability. there is an increasing focus on the circular economy. and future-proofing buildings to a changing climate (Densley Tingley. 2012; Gething. 2013). This has meant that an increasing number of buildings are incorporating increased ecological adaptability. viewed over an extended period of time (30 to 100 years or beyond). While this is an improvement from the prevailing view that buildings are permanent. and that change is detrimental. and to be resisted (Brand. 1994). there is a danger that long-term ecological adaptability comes at the expense of the needs of the users that change daily. weekly. yearly. and between decades. This might lead to a longevity paradox: the building fails if it is not able to answer to user need changes. occurring both in long-term periods. and in a cyclical short-term manner. despite being designed to meet climatic or resource needs. Thus. even the most ecologically sustainable building would need to be replaced sooner than intended when neglecting the different rhythms and reasons for changes.

1194702,Should the Passivhaus standard include the environmental impact of materials in its standard?,2015,S Pelsmakers and E Andreou,,,,,TIB,Human activities are significantly contributing to an upsurge of greenhouse gases that lead to climate change (IPCC. 2014). Building construction and operation are responsible for ~40% of energy consumption worldwide and for ~30% of the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere (UNEP. 2009). These high emissions has forced UK authorities to promote mitigation measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. hence reduce energy consumption (e.g. the EU’s EPBD demands ‘nearly-zero energy buildings’ by 2020). At present. operational energy in buildings and especially space-heating. which represents the highest proportion of energy use in UK housing (Shorrock. 2005). are regulated in building codes. However. in order to reduce this operational energy. there is usually an increased demand for high-intensity materials and construction processes which. although they may improve the building energy performance. in turn increase the building’s embodied energy (Lane. 2010. Crawford & Stephan. 2013). An unintended consequence of regulations imposing the design of low-energy buildings may be that they require more energy for their construction (Lane. 2010). leading to an increase in associated CO2 and CO2e emissions (CO2e : the greenhouse potential of emissions. considered as if they were all CO2 – Pelsmakers. 2012).

Within the Finnish urban housing context. this study evaluates the adaptation potential of two case study apartment buildings. with seven apartments studied in more detail. These cases represent a broader set of housing cases finished in 2019 or planned to be constructed in 2020–2022 in Finland's largest urban areas. Illustrated by comparative building and apartment plans. the findings indicate that the selected cases generally lack much capacity to accommodate change. but this can be improved with fairly simple spatial modifications with the same apartment number and size. It was also highlighted that in some cases there may be broader implications for the land use. and the city plan.

This paper presents the findings of a steady-state modelled low-energy retrofit dwelling in northern England and its potential current and future climate overheating risks using UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP09) scenarios (2050 and 2080 High Emission Scenarios). Predictive findings highlight that retrofitting to low-energy standards increases overheating risk over time. unless passive prevention measures are included in the retrofit design. In addition. the steady-state nature of the model might not fully capture the occupants’ exposure to actual future overheating risks. Among the most effective individual passive overheating mitigation strategies are temporary internal shading. permanent external shading and night-time ventilation. Most effective is a combination of these adaptation measures. so that predictive overheating is minimised in a future changing climate. reducing the uptake of active cooling in retrofitted dwellings.Practical application: Much research focuses on building overheating risks in the warmer South-east of England.

1194716,The PassivHaus Standard: Minimising overheating risk in a changing climate,2015,Eleni Vogiatzi and Sofie Pelsmakers and Hector Altamirano,,,,151-160,School of Architecture. University of Sheffield,Building operational energy is responsible for approximately 40% of UK’s CO2 emissions (GOV.UK. 2014) with almost 25% in housing alone. mostly for space heating. This significantly contributes to climate change. which is now considered unavoidable (IPCC. 2013) and could affect occupants’ thermal comfort and health (Public Health England. 2013). Given that our buildings are built for 50-100 year lifespans (de Wilde et al. 2008). measures to adapt our buildings to a changing climate need to be undertaken alongside climate change mitigation strategies. This paper investigates the risk of overheating and the remedial measures required for future UK climate scenarios if the PassivHaus standard is applied. A case-study dwelling was modeled and its performance assessed under present and future climate scenarios in London: 2050s and 2080s for a Medium and High emissions scenario. Findings indicated that while space-heating demand would be reduced by 45% by the 2080s. the case-study dwelling is likely to need some form of cooling from the 2050s onwards. unless passive adaptation measures are put in place. The most effective adaptation measure was found to be a combination of reduction on the glazing’s g-value. summer night-time natural ventilation and solar shading. The performance of the Building Regulations (2013) notional specification highlights that while it is predicted to lead to marginally lower overheating frequencies than the PassivHaus dwelling. its space heating demand will be up to five times higher in the 2080s. Hence measures for reducing space heating demand alongside measures to reduce future …,True,qFWPvL0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/97136/,,,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/97136/13/PAPER%20AR2015_Vogiatzi_Pelsmakers.pdf,0,0,0

1194719,In-situ measurement methods for characterisation and diagnosis of airborne sound transmission through multi-layered building partitions,2018,N Patil,,,,,,The thesis concerns with the development of novel measurement methods for characterisation and diagnosis of airborne sound transmission through building partitions. Using standard tests. the airborne sound insulation of partitions can be measured as the Sound Reduction Index ‘SRI’. While the SRI provides the frequency dependence of sound insulation (or transmission). the local/spatial sound transmission through various paths in the partition is not known. If the contributions of different paths in the partition can be measured then any weak paths of sound insulation can be diagnosed. This would be especially useful in the case of multi-layered partitions where the sound insulation depends on the sound transmission through point connections/ribs/studs/frame. etc. present in the structure. While different theoretical models are in place to predict the sound insulation in presence of such elements. the experimental diagnosis of their sound transfer contributions remains fairly unexplored. Similar diagnosis problems are encountered by automotive industry while dealing with structure borne sources in the vehicle. In practice. Transfer Path Analysis (TPA) methods are extensively used in such cases for diagnosing the contributions of different structure borne sources at vehicle interiors. Application of such TPA methods for diagnosing airborne sound transmission is challenging on various counts. Firstly. the airborne source applies a continuous excitation on the receiver as opposed to structure borne sources which are typically discrete. Secondly. for our study. the path contributions are desired which is difficult than measuring source characterisations …,True,GnhsCd0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,http://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/46321/,5517198865141294627,/scholar?cites=5517198865141294627,,https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/46321/1/Thesis_new%20format.pdf,0,0,0

This in part can be achieved by installing energy efficient building elements such as windows. curtains. doors. etc. Thus the aim of this study was to develop a combined imaging system for measuring the thermal and acoustic efficiency of retrofit building elements in modern homes. A case study is presented for measuring the thermal and acoustic efficiency of tweed curtains on a double sash window as a part of a collaborative. interdisciplinary project involving the Acoustics Test Laboratories and the Energy House at University of Salford. The thermal efficiency was quantified by measuring U-values of the curtain and the window. The acoustic efficiency of the curtain was quantified by its ‘Sound Insulation’. Using the Microflown PU acoustic probe. the insertion loss was measured as well as the noise break-in was assessed for ventilated case-when the window is opened. These parameters are measured in-situ and may be used to compliment qualitative comfort values.

Specifically. the paper presents a review of the literature addressing how the regional development impacts of mining ventures (e.g.. employment multipliers) can be comprehended and assessed empirically. as well as the role of various benefit-sharing instruments in generating a more inclusive development. These issues are investigated in the context of selected practical experiences in four high-income mining countries (Australia. Canada. Chile and the USA). Important issues and challenges that deserve increased attention in future research are identified.

This requires that the developed countries’ emissions are radically reduced during the next 40 years. Energy scenario studies provide insights on the societal transitions that might be implied by such low-carbon futures. and in this paper we discuss how a greater attention to different governance and institutional issues can complement future scenario exercises. The analysis is based on a critical review of 20 quantitative and qualitative scenario studies. all of relevance for meeting long-term climate policy objectives.

We discuss the key findings in this work. how the choices of model. data. statistical tests etc. influence the results. and discuss some policy implications. The empirical research on convergence in per capita carbon dioxide emissions shows some evidence of convergence between developed (OECD) countries. while at the global level there appear to be relatively persistent gaps or divergence. These results are however sensitive to the choice of econometric approach and data set (eg. the length of the time series). Still. the empirical basis for an egalitarian rule of equal per capita emissions in the design of global climate policy is not solid; it ignores the specific structural characteristics of countries such as climate. natural resource endowments etc. The analysis therefore points to a need for more indepth analyses of the structural determinants of carbon intensity (productivity) at the country level. as well as to additional research on the economic consequences of different types of equity principles (including combinations of such principles).,True,T_G8saYAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C,92,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrik_Soederholm/publication/274187452_Convergence_of_Carbon_Dioxide_Emissions_A_Review_of_the_Literature/links/5640e51e08aebaaea1f6c08f/Convergence-of-Carbon-Dioxide-Emissions-A-Review-of-the-Literature.pdf,9530439195837557802,/scholar?cites=9530439195837557802,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrik_Soederholm/publication/274187452_Convergence_of_Carbon_Dioxide_Emissions_A_Review_of_the_Literature/links/5640e51e08aebaaea1f6c08f/Convergence-of-Carbon-Dioxide-Emissions-A-Review-of-the-Literature.pdf,0,0,0

In doing so. it comments on the engineering approach to material efficiency presented by Allwood et al. (2011) in an earlier issue of Resources. Conservation and Recycling. We argue that concerns over potential future natural resource scarcities do not represent a strong motive for introducing policies to foster greater material efficiency but that various environmental externalities and information failures in the relevant material markets do. Moreover. in such instances policy makers should opt for policy measures that target the relevant market failures (e.g.. environmental damages) as closely as possible.

The study is based on 536 survey responses from Swedish households and they are analyzed econometrically using probit regression techniques. The analysis is based on a theoretical framework. which embraces both economic and psychological motives behind household decision-making. The results show that households that anticipate significant economic benefits from choosing a more active behavior are also more likely to purse this. while those with smaller potential gains (e.g.. households without electric heating) are less likely to change supplier and/or renegotiate their contracts.

This paper analyzes the general impact on forest raw material markets following an increased diffusion of biorefineries and highlights a number of related public policy issues. The analysis indicates that the character of forest raw material supply. in particular the distinction between main products and byproducts. will have a major influence on the functioning and the organization of future forest products markets. Moreover. the advent of new uses of forest-based biomass will foster an increased competition for (and thus higher price of) this resource. An important policy lesson. however. is not to directly regulate the allocation of forest resources between different sectors or promote a certain industrial structure. The rationale for policy intervention lies instead in identifying situations in which essential societal costs and benefits do not enter the private decision-making process. The presence of external environmental costs (eg. damages to the climate) and the public spillover effects from R&D and innovation activities provide such rationales. but at the same time require careful analysis prior to the introduction of specific policy instruments.

The Electricity Price Area Differentials (EPADs) are used to hedge against price differences between a bidding area and the Nordic system price. The aim of this paper is twofold. First. we estimate the magnitude and significance of ex-post risk premia in EPAD products (season. month. quarter. year) with delivery in 2000-2013. Further. we estimate the relationship between spot and futures prices by vector autoregression (VAR) model. By observing Granger causalities. adjustments to price shocks. and decomposing variance. we aim to shed light on the EPADs’ efficiency. Second. we elaborate on some determinants of risk premia and test the roles of time-to-maturity and open interest on risk premia. We additionally consider. for the Nordic system an essential energy source. the role of water availability in the hydro reservoirs on explaining local area price spreads.

The possibility to replicate the FTR contracts with a combination of EPAD contracts is presented and discussed. Based on historical evidence and empirical analysis of ten Nordic interconnectors and twenty bidding areas. we investigate the pricing accuracy of the replicated FTR contracts by quantifying ex-post forward risk premia. The results show that the majority of the studied FTR contain a negative risk premium. especially the monthly and the quarterly contracts. Reverse flow (unnatural) pricing was identified for two interconnectors. From a theoretical policy point of view the results imply that it may be possible to continue with the EPAD-based system by using EPAD Combos in the Nordic countries. even if FTR contracts would prevail elsewhere in the EU. In practice the pricing of bi-directional EPAD contracts is more complex and may not always be very efficient. The efficiency of the EPAD market structure should be discussed from various points of view before accepting their status quo as a replacement for FTRs in the Nordic electricity markets.

We particularly focus on power spreads that are hedgeable in futures markets in three European electricity markets (Germany. UK. Nordic) over the time period 2009-2016.

Specifically. we show that the total vRES capacity installed during 2009-2016 is associated with a drop of 3-22% in hedgeable profit margins of coal and especially gas power generators. While this shows that the expansion of vRES has a significant negative effect on the hedgeable profitability of dispatchable. flexible power generators. it also suggests that the overall decline in power spreads is further driven by the price dynamics in the CO2 and fuel markets during the sample period.

German. and UK electricity day-ahead markets during 2006-2016. During this time period. variable renewable energy sources (vRES) have been rapidly penetrating the markets and increasing the volatility of the residual load. which is often assumed to be associated with improving financial viability of energy storages. However. storage operator profits are not publicly available. in particular not at plant level. We therefore develop a linear optimisation model which maximises profits from arbitraging hourly prices and use the model output of profits and storage operating hours in further econometric analyses. This is a novel approach merging two strands of literature (optimisation and econometrics) in a single energy storage study. Specifically. we quantify and disentangle the effects of electricity demand. solar and wind generation. the spread between gas and coal prices. carbon emission prices and structural breaks on profits and operation of 1-13MWh/MW energy storages. Among others we find that solar generation is associated with lower profits but higher operating frequency of energy storages in Germany.

1194770,Long-term transmission rights in the Nordic electricity markets: An empirical appraisal of transmission risk management and hedging,2017,Petr Spodniak,,,,,Lappeenranta University of Technology,The increasingly integrated European electricity markets enable participants to exploit market opportunities and participate in cross-border electricity trading. But. the network gets congested because of the scarce transmission capacity. so electricity prices vary greatly in time and across geographical areas. Market participants thus need an efficient hedging mechanism that limits their exposure to the locational price risks. The hedging solutions against the area price differences that originate from interconnector congestion are commonly called long-term transmission rights (LTRs). This work studies the economics of transmission network congestion in the Nordic electricity markets. including the associated risks and alternative LTR mechanisms and how to manage them. The Nordic electricity markets are selected as a case study for their unique market design and the current regulatory challenge they face with respect to efficiency limits identified in their transmission risk hedging contracts. called electricity area price differentials (EPADs). In addition to the policy and regulatory motivations. the current understanding of derivatives pricing for non-storable commodities. such as electricity. is limited. In particular. the interpretation of the systematic bias between futures prices and the expected delivery date spot prices. called risk premia. is still ambiguous in terms of economic theory.

We also find significant persistence (and asymmetric effects) in the power spreads volatility using a univariate TGARCH model.,True,mUNjjIMAAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC,0,http://aei.pitt.edu/id/eprint/102193,,,,http://aei.pitt.edu/102193/1/WP580.pdf,0,0,0
1194777,Methods for evaluation of the Nordic forward market for electricity,2016,Olle Björk and Björn Hagman and Petr Spodniak,,,,,,On 26 September 2016 the European Commission adopted its regulation (EU) 2016/1719 establishing a guideline on forward capacity allocation (FCA). The regulation entered into force 17 October 2016.The FCA GL requires for two kinds of decisions that the regulators assess whether the electricity forward market provides sufficient hedging opportunities in the concerned bidding zones (Article 30 (3). The first decision is not to issue long-term transmission rights (LTTRs) on a bidding zone border (Article 30 (1). The second decision is regarding introduction of LTTRs if LTTRs do not exist on a bidding zone border (Article 30 (2). The assessment shall include at least a consultation with the market participants about their needs. a correlation analysis and an analysis of whether products offered are efficient.

This article explores their price and welfare effects and relates to antitrust legislation in the United States. the European Union. and some of the EU member states-in particular. Sweden. Welfare is higher with a monopoly cooperative than with a profit-maximizing monopoly. if the scope for price discrimination is small and if the world-market price is low relative to the domestic price. As the world-market price rises (or as price discrimination becomes more important). the welfare effect is reversed. The price-discrimination effect suggests that. as a marketing cooperative integrates vertically. welfare may fall. These results carry over to a duopoly with a cooperative firm and a profit-maximizing firm. In such a duopoly. the cooperative behaves more aggressively and obtains a larger market share.

1194799,Payment system efficiency and pro-competitive regulation,2003,Mats A Bergman,,SVERIGES RIKSBANK ECONOMIC REVIEW,,25-52,Sveriges Riksbank,Effective competition guarantees that prices are set at such a level that efficiency is promoted (resulting in so-called allocative efficiency). but in markets characterised by large returns to scale and strong network effects. it may be too costly to have more than one firm operating. In such markets. known as natural monopolies. technical efficiency is best achieved by a single firm. More generally. a given market may be too small to support enough firms to guarantee effective competition. This creates a dilemma: if the market is monopolised. market power and monopoly pricing will result in allocative inefficiencies. while if several firms are active. there will be technical inefficiencies (or positive network effects will not be fully exploited). In many natural monopolies. regulators have sought to resolve this dilemma by introducing pro-competitive regulation.

1194800,Competition in services or infrastructure-based competition?,2004,Mats Bergman,,"Swedish Competition Authority and Stockholm University, September",,,,A perfectly competitive market has uniquely favourable characteristics: firms produce efficiently and sell to consumers at marginal costs. On the other hand. no real market has all the properties that are necessary for perfect competition. such as perfect information and price taking by every firm and every consumer.At best. some markets can be approximately perfectly competitive. In practice. most markets deviate quite substantially from the perfectly competitive ideal. A possible policy response is to introduce regulation. in order to correct for the failures of the market. However. regulation gives rise to inefficiencies. No matter what regulatory model is chosen. there will be disadvantages. Depending on how well an unregulated market would function and on how efficient regulation would be. the best course of action may either be to accept a certain degree of inefficiency in an unregulated market–or to introduce regulation. 1,True,FQ4daEwAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,21,http://www.thorngren.nu/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Bergman_M_2004_Infrastructure_Comp.pdf,15276791254621896579,/scholar?cites=15276791254621896579,,http://www.thorngren.nu/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Bergman_M_2004_Infrastructure_Comp.pdf,0,0,0

1194802,Potential competition: Theory. empirical evidence. and legal practice,2002,Mats A Bergman,,The Swedish Competition Authority,,,,This article surveys theoretical and empirical studies that relate to potential competition and outlines the role of potential competition in competition law enforcement.According to the contestable-market hypothesis. potential competition is very effective. According to the limit-pricing theory. potential competition is moderately effective. while other theories suggest that potential competition is not effective at all. Most empirical evidence suggest that potential competition is a competitive constraint. but a weaker such than actual competition.

1194803,Tendering design when price and quality is uncertain,2017,Sofia Lundberg and Mats A Bergman,,International Journal of Public Sector Management,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,The purpose of this paper is to analyze how local and central authorities choose between lowest price and more complex scoring rules when they design supplier-selection mechanisms for public procurements. Five hypotheses are tested: a high level of cost uncertainty and highly non-verifiable quality makes the use of the lowest-price supplier-selection method less likely. Organizational habits and transaction-cost considerations influence the choice of mechanism. Strong quality concerns make complex rules more likely.The analysis departures from normative theory (rational choice) and is based on the regression analysis and survey data comprising a gross sample of 40 contracting authorities and detailed information about 651 procurements.More complex scoring rules are used more often when the authority is uncertain about costs and about delivered quality …,True,FQ4daEwAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C,18,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJPSM-04-2016-0063/full/html,17776575497096263807,/scholar?cites=17776575497096263807,,,0,0,0

This paper compares open access and individual transferable quota equilibria to the equilibrium in which the joint value of the fisheries is maximized. The open access induced problems can be corrected by an individual transferable quota system only if both the target species and the bycatch species have tradable quotas. and only if the bycatch species does not have existence value. There exists a range of the bycatch-to-target species harvest levels for which the total harvest of each will be exactly taken by a given technology. even under open access. However. there may not even exist a unique open access equilibrium if bycatch is allocated by “rule of capture.” Prohibitions on the sale of bycatch reduce the bycatch level. but they also reduce social welfare.,True,hIfAwJMAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,148,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069696900479,1901127693036161725,/scholar?cites=1901127693036161725,,https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/162-34270/Boyce%2B1996%2BJEEM%2BBycatch.pdf,0,0,0

If there are production externalities (e.g.. congestion or stock externalities) present. the market price of a quota will not be fully reflected in these externalities. Thus. fishermen will not fully internalize the externalities in their effort decisions. Even if there are no production externalities. an individual fisherman imposes costs on others under open access by removing a fish that was available to all fishermen. An ITQ system allows the individual who values that fish most to obtain the right to harvest the fish. so each fisherman must internalize the full social cost.

1194814,A Hotelling Explanation of “The Curse of Natural resources”,2005,John R Boyce and JC Herbert Emery,6,"University of Calgary, Department of Economics Discussion Paper",,,,Sachs and Warner (1995. 1999. 2001) show that over the last 35 years. economies that are dependent on natural resource exports have grown slower than resource scarce economies. They have dubbed this observation the “curse of natural resources” and there is a growing literature seeking to explain this surprising outcome. In this paper. we show that the resource curse occurs in competitive exhaustible resource markets as a result of the intertemporal optimization decisions made by owners of the resource stock. The evidence for the resource curse comes from adding measures of resource abundance to the conditional convergence growth models as estimated by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) and Mankiw. Romer and Weil (1992). Sachs and Warner (1995) use as their measure of resource abundance the share of GDP represented by the value of primary products for export. They find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of primary product exports to GDP in 1971 of 0.134 decreases expected growth over the next 20 years by almost one percent per year. 11 The curse has also been found in Leite and Weidmann (1999). Atkinson and Hamilton (2003). Bulte. Damania and Deacon (2003). Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003). and Papyrakis and Gerlagh (2004).

A special form of the emissions function is also examined which is equivalent to an excise tax on output. The model indicates that many conventional results in the durability and taxation literature need not hold when durability is endogenously determined.

This paper investigates the empirical robustness of this claim. I use out-of-sample methods to test whether the HDPO model is capable of estimating ultimately recoverable reserves. HDPO model estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves. based on data available 30 years or more in the past. are found to be less than current observed cumulative production and discoveries. This result is robust to different specifications of the HDPO model. to applications to production and discoveries data. and to various levels of geographical aggregation. These problems stem from an attempt by the HDPO model to force a linear relationship onto data which are inherently nonlinear. This characteristic of the data is present in a wide variety of natural resources. I also show that the HDPO model is incapable of distinguishing between processes for which cumulative production is truly finite and processes for which cumulative production is unbounded. These findings undermine claims that the HDPO model is capable of yielding meaningful measures of ultimately recoverable reserves or of predicting when world oil production might peak.",True,hIfAwJMAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,12,https://www.iaee.org/en/Publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=2516,5615402350898901069,/scholar?cites=5615402350898901069,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2516,0,0,0
1194825,Using participation data to estimate fishing costs for commercial salmon fisheries in Alaska,1993,John R Boyce,,Marine Resource Economics,,367-394,Marine Resource Foundation,This paper estimates the fishing costs and the returns to fishing for nine commercial salmon fleets in Alaska. The econometric model uses a twostage least squares estimation procedure to estimate the effect of congestion and heterogeneity on the returns to fishermen. The hypotheses that fishermen are homogenous and that there is no congestion externality present in the fisheries are strongly rejected. The data indicates that fishermen are quite heterogeneous in fishing skill levels. This difference accounts for the overall estimates of positive net returns to the common property fisheries. Estimates of the net returns to the fisheries suggest that the returns to different gear types vary largely. The set net fleets are found to have the highest return as a percentage of total revenues.,True,hIfAwJMAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,12,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/mre.8.4.42731367,5318095551702987811,/scholar?cites=5318095551702987811,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6942180.pdf,0,0,0

Bulow (1986) examined a monopolist's choice of product durability and found that firms who sell their products tend to choose lower durability levels than firms that rent. We argue that the speed of new product development may be a more appropriate proxy for obsolescence than is durability. Reformulating Bulow's model in terms of R&D choice rather than durability choice. we find that sales firms engage in higher levels of R&D than do rental firms. Additionally. we provide an empirical example using data from the copier and computer industries which also suggests a strong positive relationship between the R&D intensity of a firm and the proportion of output sold versus rented.,True,hIfAwJMAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,12,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01024249.pdf,5771434708943819449,/scholar?cites=5771434708943819449,,http://contacts.ucalgary.ca/info/econ/files/info/unitis/publications/162-49461/Goering%2BBoyce%2BCollins%2BRIO%2B1993%2BR%2526D%2BProduct%2Bobsolecense.pdf,0,0,0
1194827,An ‘oil’igopoly theory of exploration,2008,John R Boyce and Lucia Vojtassak,30,Resource and Energy Economics,3,428-454,North-Holland,This paper develops a theory of ‘oil’igopoly exploration of an exhaustible resource. Strategic exploration and production are jointly derived in a three period subgame perfect equilibrium. While the ‘oil’igopoly theory of exploration shares many features with non-strategic models of exploration and production. there is one important difference. The ‘oil’igopoly theory of exploration predicts that firms who exhaust their proved reserves before they can convert their unproved reserves into proved reserves have an incentive to over-explore. relative to the Nash equilibrium level of exploration. A simple empirical prediction is that firms holding smaller proved reserves should be observed doing more exploration. This prediction is consistent with country-level production and reserve data in the post-World War II era.,True,hIfAwJMAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765507000486,16035776469677274444,/scholar?cites=16035776469677274444,,https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/162-34412/Boyce%2BVojtassak%2B2008%2BREE.pdf,0,0,0

In the case where the firm rents its output. the optimal tax is lower than the tax placed on a competitive industry. all else held constant. When the monopolist sells its output. the tax will be larger than in the rental case. The authors find that this is due to the ""Coase conjecture"" that durable goods sales monopolists will be forced nearer to marginal cost pricing than will durable goods rental monopolists. They also show that Buchanan's result that the optimal pollution tax on a simple monopolist is less than the optimal pollution tax on a competitive industry generally holds for the case where the monopolist sells durable goods. However. an exception to this occurs when production costs decrease at the margin. In the durable goods case. Buchanan's result may be reversed.

Although transaction cost economics (TCE) provides a workable and well-used framework within which to analyse this choice. it only captures the static transaction costs related to the two modes. This has lead to a discussion about dynamic governance costs and possible benefits related to the governance mode. The objective of this paper is to show how this extended framework differs from TCE when determining the appropriate governance mode. We use four factors related to nature of cooperation to contrast these two approaches. We collected empirical data about cooperation in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector in order to find support for these arguments.

India,Strategic patent portfolios are intangible assets that technology oriented companies hold to secure their competitive advantage in the future. Traditionally. valuation of forward-looking strategic patent portfolios is more an art than a science. nevertheless. they play an important role in the future competitive advantage positioning of high-tech oriented companies. This paper discusses forward-looking strategic patent portfolios and presents some new ideas on how numerical valuation methods could be used in framing the valuation of these portfolios. The basis on which the forward-looking far away from exploitation strategic patent portfolios are valued is crucially different from the valuation of ‘in production’patents or already existing licensable IPRs. since future strategic patents must be based on vague information with structural uncertainty about the future. The authors show how flexible tools and analysis using the pay-off method can be used to solve these complex problems faced by companies; and illustrate the same using a numerical example.,True,d7zy67YAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,22,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/18376,1533776835659792486,/scholar?cites=1533776835659792486,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/18376/1/JIPR%2018(3)%20230-241.pdf?utm_source=The_Journal_Database&trk=right_banner&id=1408029630&ref=16ec2f31cc6855ed233d0690f7cc761b,0,0,0

The time constraints consist of upper bounds on: (1) the amount of time by which the pick-up or delivery of a customer can deviate from the desired pick-up or delivery time; (2) the time that a customer can spend riding in a vehicle. The algorithm uses a sequential insertion procedure to assign customers to vehicles and to determine a time schedule of pick-ups and deliveries for each vehicle. A flexible objective function balances the cost of providing service with the customers' preferences for pick-up and delivery times close to those requested. and for short ride times.

In order to comply with these regulations many ship operators will switch to more expensive low-sulphur fuel when sailing inside ECAs. Since they are concerned about minimizing their costs. it is likely that speed and routing decisions will change because of this. In this paper. we develop an optimization model to be applied by ship operators for determining sailing paths and speeds that minimize operating costs for a ship along a given sequence of ports. We perform a computational study on a number of realistic shipping routes in order to evaluate possible impacts on sailing paths and speeds. and hence fuel consumption and costs. from the ECA regulations.

Each of these variables evolves according to an independent Markov process. The vehicle can wait at a node (at a cost) in anticipation of more favorable arc costs. We first develop two recursive procedures for the individual arc case. one based on successive approximations. and the other on policy iteration. We also solve the same problem via parametric linear programming. We show that the optimal policy essentially classifies the state of the environment variable at a node into two categories: green states for which the optimal action is to immediately traverse the arc. and red states for which the optimal action is to wait. We then extend these concepts for the entire network by developing a dynamic programming procedure that solves the corresponding problem.

Among the top fuel-consuming categories of ships and hence air polluters are container vessels. The main reason is their high service speed. Lately. speed reduction has become a very popular operational measure to reduce fuel consumption and can obviously be used to curb emissions. This paper examines such an operational scenario. Since time at sea increases with slow steaming. there is a parallel and strong interest to investigate possible ways to decrease time in port. One way to do so is to reduce port service time. Another possible way to minimize disruption and maximize efficiency is the prompt berthing of vessels upon arrival. To that effect. a related berthing policy is investigated as a measure to reduce waiting time.

Problems in this class are interesting for both practical and theoretical reasons. From a practical perspective. these problems arise in several transportation environments. For instance. in the routing and scheduling of cargo ships. the routing structure is “easy” because the ports to be visited are usually located along a shoreline. However. because release times of cargoes at ports generally complicate the routing structure. the combined routing and scheduling problem is nontrivial.

The problem in question is known in the Transportation literature as the single vehicle many-to-many Dial-A-Ride Problem. or DARP. The DARP is the problem of minimizing the length of the tour traveled by a vehicle to service N customers. each of whom wishes to go from a distinct origin to a distinct destination. The vehicle departs from a specified point and returns to that point upon service of all customers. Precedence constraints in the DARP exist because the origin of each customer must precede his/her destination on the route. As in the interchange procedure of Lin for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). a k-interchange is a substitution of k of the links of an initial feasible DARP tour with k other links. and a DARP tour is k-optimal if it is impossible to obtain a shorter tour by replacing any k of its links …,True,H7MnRnAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,110,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377221783900991,8801962218222716241,/scholar?cites=8801962218222716241,,http://martrans.org/documents/2005/rsl/Psaraftis_k%20Interchange%20Procedures%20for%20the%20Local%20Search%20in%20a%20Precedence%20Constrained%20Routing%20Problem.pdf,0,0,0

Flight Transportation Laboratory.[1978],"In this report. a number of Dynamic Programming algorithms for three versions of the Aircraft Sequencing problem are developed. In these. two alternative objectives are considered: How to land all of a prescribed set of airplanes as soon as possible. or alternatively. how to minimize the total passenger waiting time. All these three versions are ""static"". namely. no intermediate aircraft arrivals are accepted until our initial set of airplanes land. The versions examined are (a) The single runway-unconstrained case. (b) The single runway-Constrained Position Shifting (CPS) case and (c) The two-runway-unconstrained case. In the unconstrained case. no priority considerations exist for the airplanes of our system. By contrast. CPS prohibits the shifting of any particular airplane by more than a prespecified number of positions (MPS) from its initial position in the queue. All three algorithms exploit the fact that the airplanes in our system can be classified into a relatively small number of distinct categories and thus. realize drastic savings in computational effort. which is shown to be a polynomially bounded function of the number of airplanes per category. The CPS problem is formulated in (b) in a recursive way. so that for any value of MPS. the computational effort remains polynomially bounded as described above.

For ships crossing in and out of ECAs. such as deep-sea vessels. one of the common options for complying with these limits is to burn heavy fuel oil (HFO) outside the ECA and switch to low-sulfur fuel such as marine gas oil (MGO) inside the ECA. As the prices of these two fuels are generally very different. so may be the speeds that the ship will sail at outside and inside the ECA. The first optimization problem examined by the paper considers an extension of the model of Ronen (1982) in which ship speeds both inside and outside the ECA are optimized. The second problem is called the ECA refraction problem. due to its conceptual similarity with the refraction problem when light travels across two different media. and also involves optimizing the point at which …,True,H7MnRnAAAAAJ:xlVdBZVQT58C,81,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920915000802,7936495779700497690,/scholar?cites=7936495779700497690,,https://sintef.brage.unit.no/sintef-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2474462/On%2Btwo%2Bspeed%2Boptimization%2Bproblems%2Bfor%2Bships%2Bthat%2Bsail%2Bin%2Band%2Bout%2Bof%2Bemission%2Bcontrol%2Bareas_Revision%2B1_May_2015.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

One such criterion can be reflected by the Cost of Averting a Tonne of oil Spilt (CATS) whereas its target value is updated by elaborating the inherent uncertainties of oil spill costs and establishing a value for the criterion’s assurance factor. To this end. a value of $80.000/t is proposed as a sensible CATS criterion and the proposed value for the assurance factor F = 1.5 is supported by the retrieved Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Clubs’ Annual Reports.

Container positioning is a vital part of their strategy. Instead of minimizing costs of moving empty units as preferred in the literature. this paper presents a formulation that optimizes the trade-off between full and empty units. Paradoxically. carrying empty instead of full units in some cases leads to more profitable operations. This paper considers these as well as the derived CO 2 footprint aspects.

1194891,New frontiers through short sea shipping,1997,Orestis D Schinas and HN Psaraftis,,"SNAME National Conference, Ottawa",,,,Short sea shipping is a policy choice of the European Union and affects all transport activities across Europe. Taking the European experience as an example and not as a pilot project. expansion of short sea shipping can be achieved everywhere on the globe. Although short sea shipping offers many advantages to policy makers such as improvement of the efficiency of intermodal transport. environmental friendliness and enhancement of competitiveness. it also reveals the inadequate infrastructure of ports and hinterland connections and the gap between the policy makers and market forces. The growing demand for transport services (both freight and passengers). fast and accurate services-Just In Time. the increasing imbalance between different modes and the investment in transport infrastructure are the main points of concern of all planners. The only way to achieve the shift of cargo from land to sea is through technology and regulatory arrangement.Technical solutions are not worthy when they cannot be applied. The main obstacle in promoting intermodality is the cost. and also some barriers of the existing legal system. Every design can be feasible if it is also included in the existing regulatory and logistical system.

The low-sulfur (LS) marine fuels have a higher price. and their fluctuation is almost similar to the fluctuation of high-sulfur (HS) fuels. The price difference between HS and LS might also determine the decision of operators for alternative technical means. such as scrubbers. in order to comply with the new limits. This paper aims to provide a thorough statistical analysis of the currently available LS and HS marine fuels time series. as well as to present the analysis of the differential of the HS and LS fuel prices.

1194906,Estimating the cost of regulation; a case study based on MARPOL Annex VI,2010,Orestis Schinas and Sönke Hartmann,,"Annual Conference, International Association of Maritime Economists",,,,Recent regulatory actions have ignited strong debates and discussions over the cost of the environmental policy measurements. as well as over the overall cost of operation of seagoing vessels. thus jeopardizing also other policies promoting sea transport over other modal alternatives. As the issue of the cost of regulation is extremely broad. the analysis focuses on the recent developments in environmental policies. and specifically on MARPOL Annex VI. In the first section of this paper. a brief description of the new regulation as well as of its economic and operational impact is provided. A model based on stochastic linear programming is developed for the total transportation cost as well as one for the cost born by an operator. Initial (acquisition) and operational decisions for the composition of a fleet that serves a given market are addressed. where market growth and operational expenses provide the necessary scenarios for the development of the stochastic model. The operation of a ship within or out of a sensitive environmental area. and thus the higher cost of bunkers and operations. determines the differences of total cost (ie of the objective function) before and after the implementation of the regulation. A case study based on actual fleet data and operating parameters. provided by a major German operator. approximates the increase of total cost. and given the output of the model. conclusions can be drawn on the utilization of the fleet per ship type and market condition. In the last section. the limitations of this approach are discussed as well as the potential for its application on other regulatory cases vis-à-vis widely applied models. such as …,True,xrqSiiUAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Orestis_Schinas/publication/255708747_Estimating_the_Cost_of_Regulation_A_Case_Study_Based_on_Marpol_Annex_VI/links/0deec5204c118970c4000000/Estimating-the-Cost-of-Regulation-A-Case-Study-Based-on-Marpol-Annex-VI.pdf,4633269204166689050,/scholar?cites=4633269204166689050,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Orestis_Schinas/publication/255708747_Estimating_the_Cost_of_Regulation_A_Case_Study_Based_on_Marpol_Annex_VI/links/0deec5204c118970c4000000/Estimating-the-Cost-of-Regulation-A-Case-Study-Based-on-Marpol-Annex-VI.pdf,0,0,0

Scenario development plays a key role in strategic planning. as the process supports the development of future visions and actions required for their realisation. However. new approaches to scenario development are required to address the limitations of conventional scenario development methods. such as the cognitive barriers of ‘groupthink’. reluctance to consider ‘outside-the-box’ options. handling of complexity. and ad hoc scenario selection and general non-transparency of scenario development processes.

1194921,Advancing urban analytics for energy transitions: Data-driven strategic planning for citywide building retrofitting,2020,Oleksii Pasichnyi,,,,,,This thesis aims to summarise and communicate to a broader audience what my PhD studies in 2015–2020 were about. Eventually it started to be seen as urban energy data analytics. the new area which rapid development is powered by the growing ubiquity of data and urgency of climate transitions. Even though it is still very much a human expertise-dominated area. there is growing evidence of our (human) ability to produce machines and algorithms that are capable not only of assisting. but also of running our cities. built infrastructure (and us) in a more intelligent and efficient way. This promises to result in a significantly new level of urban systems integration. leading to great new achievements in humanity’s race for a better life and. hopefully. avoidance of a climate catastrophe. At the same time. the future of ‘urban energy data and the last human’1. where machines beat the best energy experts and city planners. does not feel to be so impossible any longer. This places even more responsibility on researchers currently pushing the frontiers to constantly check among ourselves. and with society. about where the currently visible pathways lead. and whether we and coming generations would like to live in such a future. Of course. many things will remain unclear about these changes even when they are already in place. What is certain is that change is happening. it is fast and it can make a difference to the lives of all. That is probably the most challenging. intriguing and astonishing part of the research adventure in which I am engaged.,True,izP8o7AAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1500863,,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1500863,0,0,0

This paper uses an empirical approach to investigate and compare different properties of four typical capacity credit definitions. It is shown that the choice of definition indeed can have a significant impact on the results. Concerning three of the analyzed methods. it is found that important factors that influence the capacity credit are the overall generation adequacy and the penetration factor of the power plant; this means that the same generating unit will generally have a higher capacity credit if added to a system with high loss of load probability. and the unit will have a higher capacity credit if its installed capacity is small compared to the total installed capacity of the system.

It concerns the interactions between the spot price and the flexible demand. Both conditional value-at-risk and volume deviation risk are taken into account. A numerical study using the data from the Nordic electricity market is performed to investigate the influence of risk factors on the retailer's profit. risk levels. average spot price. and total consumption. Three types of price elasticity are compared to show that the retailer can benefit from the flexibility in demand side in some cases.

1194933,On monte carlo simulation and analysis of electricity markets,2004,Mikael Amelin,,,,,,This dissertation is about how Monte Carlo simulation can be used to analyse electricity markets. There are a wide range of applications for simulation; for example. players in the electricity market can use simulation to decide whether or not an investment can be expected to be profitable. and authorities can by means of simulation find out which consequences a certain market design can be expected to have on electricity prices. environmental impact. etc. In the first part of the dissertation. the focus is which electricity market models are suitable for Monte Carlo simulation. The starting point is a definition of an ideal electricity market. Such an electricity market is partly practical from a mathematical point of view (it is simple to formulate and does not require too complex calculations) and partly it is a representation of the best possible resource utilisation. The definition of the ideal electricity market is followed by analysis how the reality differs from the ideal model. what consequences the differences have on the rules of the electricity market and the strategies of the players. as well as how non-ideal properties can be included in a mathematical model. Particularly. questions about environmental impact. forecast uncertainty and grid costs are studied. The second part of the dissertation treats the Monte Carlo technique itself. To reduce the number of samples necessary to obtain accurate results. variance reduction techniques can be used. Here. six different variance reduction techniques are studied and possible applications are pointed out.

To calculate average system performance for many alternatives over long time periods. it is necessary to simulate large numbers of hourly combinations of renewable production and loads across large regions. As this is usually impractical for full network representations of such systems. aggregation of buses and lines is desirable. We propose an improved aggregation method for creating multi-area representations of power systems that yields more accurate estimates of the quantities required by planners. The method is based on partitioning the original large system into smaller areas and making a reduced equivalent for each area. The partitioning is based on available transfer capability (ATC) between each pair of network buses. Because ATC depends on net load conditions. separate partitions …,True,-oMzEpQAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,33,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6825923/,11506843985716622789,/scholar?cites=11506843985716622789,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:781372,0,0,0

Under certain circumstances the operating point of the power system may start drifting towards the set of voltage unstable operating points. If no preventive measures are taken. after some time the operating point may eventually become voltage unstable. It will thus be preferable to have a measure of the risk of voltage collapse in future loading states. This paper presents a novel method for estimation of the probability distribution of the time to voltage instability for a power system with uncertain future loading scenarios. The method uses a distance from the predicted load-path to the set of voltage unstable operating points when finding an estimate of the time to voltage instability.

This development will have a significant impact on power system operation and economics. One of the challenges is that the difficulty to forecast wind power generation will increase the need for real-time balancing. This paper presents a study of how the impact of wind power forecast errors can be reduced by changes in the market design. The study is based on the conditions in the Nordic electricity market. A characteristic of this market is that there is a large share of flexible hydro generation; hence. ramp and unit commitment constraints rarely constrain dispatch. The need for regulation during real-time is provided in a voluntary real-time balancing market. where players can be compensated for their redispatch costs.

Elproduktionen från vindkraft varierar som bekant kontinuerligt och det är därför nödvändigt att balansera dessa variationer med annan kraftproduktion. I det nordiska elsystemet är vattenkraften väl lämpad för denna typ av balansering. men det finns naturligtvis en gräns för hur stora volymer vindkraft som kan balanseras av vattenkraften i ett givet område. Om vindkraftutbyggnaden överskrider denna gräns kan det bli aktuellt att förstärka överföringskapaciteten till närliggande områden för att undvika att behöva spilla vatten-eller vindkraft.Denna rapport beskriver resultaten från en studie av vattenkraftens förmåga att balansera olika mängder vindkraft i norra Sverige. För att kunna genomföra en sådan analys har en modell av vattenkraftsystemet norr om snitt två tagits fram. Modellen omfattar 154 vattenkraftverk med en sammanlagd effekt på 13. 2 GW. vilket motsvarar ungefär 80% av den installerade effekten i den svenska vattenkraften.

Vattenkraftsmodellen har gjorts så detaljerad som möjligt. och tar hänsyn till vattendomar. rinntider mellan kraftverk och andra fysiska begränsningar. Däremot har det inte varit möjligt att inom ramen för detta projekt utveckla tillräckligt detaljerade modeller av säsongs-och korttidsplanering. Även modelleringen av elmarknaden är starkt förenklad.

Different studies prove the techno-economic potential of these technologies but. due to the added complexity. it is challenging to design and control such systems. This paper describes an integrated optimal design and control algorithm. which is applied to the design of a district heating network with solar thermal collectors. seasonal thermal energy storage and excess heat injection. The focus is mostly on the choice of the size and location of these technologies and less on the network layout optimisation. The algorithm uses a two-layer program. namely with a design optimisation layer implemented as a genetic algorithm and an optimal control evaluation layer implemented using the Python optimal control problem toolbox called modesto. This optimisation strategy is applied to the fictional district energy system case of the city of Genk in Belgium. We show that this algorithm can find optimal designs with respect to multiple objective functions and that even in the cheaper. less renewable solutions. seasonal thermal energy storage systems are installed in large quantities.

This flexibility-the capability of shifting energy use in time and/or magnitude-can be obtained. amongst others. by integration of thermal energy storage in district heating systems. Adequate control of storage systems allows increasing intermittent renewable energy supply and/or decreasing curtailment. In a district heating network. many different thermal energy storage systems are available. each with their own characteristics and dynamics. To facilitate an optimal selection and combination of these different storage systems. a flexibility characterization method was defined by IEA-EBC Annex 67. This paper applies this characterization method to evaluate the energy flexibility provided by two sources inherently present in a district heating network. being the water thermal mass in the network pipes and the thermal inertia of the buildings connected to the network. The paper evaluates multiple scenarios. comparing different streets and districts and combinations of dwelling types. The obtained energy flexibility characteristics shows that the contribution of the network pipes is limited compared to that of the buildings’ thermal inertia. Furthermore. results show that the non-linear characteristics of the district heating network. such as congestion. could complicate the aggregation of the flexibility characteristics.,True,DoLXRvAAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,9,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/2346099?limo=0,7909208323574313567,/scholar?cites=7909208323574313567,,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/525394,0,0,0

Garrido and José María Sala and Lieve Helsen,10,Energies,2,,,The two spaces office module is usually considered as a representative case-study to analyse the energetic improvement in office buildings. In this kind of buildings. the use of a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for the climate system control provides energy savings over 15% in comparison to classic control policies. This paper focuses on the influence of solar radiation on the climate control of the office module under Belgian weather conditions. Considering MPC as main climate control. it proposes a novel distributed enhanced control for the blind system (BS) that takes into account part of the predictive information of the MPC. In addition to the savings that are usually achieved by MPC. it adds a potential 15% improvement in global energy use with respect to the usually proposed BS hysteresis control. Moreover. from the simulation results it can be concluded that the thermal comfort is also improved. The proposed BS scheme increases the energy use ratio between the thermally activated building system (TABS) and air-handling unit (AHU); therefore increasing the use of TABS and allowing economic savings. due to the use of more cost-effective thermal equipment.

It can be used to support short-and long-term decisions and it leads to further insights regarding the behaviour of the energy system as a whole. resulting in better integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). However. optimization of these energy systems is not trivial. due to large-scale systems. a broad range of time constants. non-linearities. etc. Additionally. the requirements of the optimization model are very case and goal specific.

On the one hand. they are required to ensure that each building (no matter the distance to the heat source) has warm water within an acceptable time. On the other hand. they form a short-circuit between the warm supply and cold return line and their use can increase the return temperature substantially. Therefore. a good control of these bypass valves is critical to limit the drawback of their use. In this context. this paper compares two commonly used control strategies (manual control and thermostat control) to a new theoretical benchmark that provides an upper boundary for the performance of bypass controllers.

Most importantly. they open perspectives for integration of low-grade residual heat from industry. renewable energy sources (such as geothermal heat and cold and solar thermal collectors). more efficient energy conversion units (such as collective heat pumps). while thermal energy storage (TES) systems increase system flexibility. In order to optimize design and control of such complex systems. a toolbox modesto (Multi-objective district energy systems toolbox for optimization) is under development.

However. CCA is characterized by a large thermal capacity and thus large time constant. which hampers adequate control. Model based control strategies can overcome this challenge if accurate CCA thermal models are available. But. computation time reduction in applied optimization routines compel simplified models. A sound trade-off between computation speed and accuracy needs thus to be found. In this paper a 1D controller model for an inhomogeneous CCA floor slab with air cavities is constructed. Initial model architecture is based on an available 1D-model for a homogeneous CCA slab and the physical properties of the inhomogeneous CCA slab determine the initial parameters. Firstly. experimental temperature and heat flow data from a full-scale test setup in a controlled environment are used to validate a detailed 3D finite element (FE) model of the CCA floor slab. Secondly. this 3D-FE-model generates multiple response data sets. that are used as training and validation data sets for the parameter identification of the modified 1D controller model. Compared to the 3D-FE-model. the 1D-model predicts steady state heat fluxes with an error smaller than 7.5%. while the time constants of surface heat flux. induced by a step in water supply temperature. are predicted with a maximal error of 6%.

Energy storage. more specifically in the form of heat or cold. will play a crucial role in future energy systems where large shares of renewable and residual energy sources are included. Due to the variability and seasonality of particular renewable sources. energy storage is needed to bridge the mismatch between moments where energy is needed by end-users and when it is available. Thermal networks are a second technology that may be crucial in the energy system of the future. Whereas energy storage systems solve mismatches in time. thermal networks are able to solve misalignments in space. between locations with large heat or cold surpluses on the one hand and large demands on the other. Moreover. collective systems may exploit the economy of scales. and the lower supply temperatures of the newest generation of district heating allow for more efficient heat production systems. both renewable (such as solar thermal collectors or low-temperature geothermal heating) and electricity based (such as heat pumps).

On the other hand. the integration of storage can reduce curtailment during periods with excessive renewable energy availability. Sensible TES shows great potential in the latest generation of thermal networks (4th generation thermal networks). which are expected to be very performant in coping with waste heat sources and distributed generation based on renewable sources. This research aims at optimizing the location and size of different possible sensible TES systems in a thermal network. Linearized component models are used. combined with an optimal control strategy. This control strategy assumes perfect knowledge of disturbances and comfort constraints are incorporated. The implementation of the novel pipe model described by van der Heijde et al. is crucial to obtain realistic optima. For thermal networks supplied with low temperature differences. which is the case in 4th generation networks. the relative importance of the heat losses increases and this necessitates the use of realistic heat loss models.

1194976,The business model dilemma of technology shifts,2014,Stefan Tongur and Mats Engwall,34,Technovation,9,525-535,Elsevier,Technology shifts are lethal to many manufacturing companies. Previous research indicates that this is not purely a problem of technological innovation. but is also closely related to the inertia of business models and business model innovation. This paper inquires into the dynamics of this intersection between technology and business models. Anchored in a case study in the automotive industry. it reveals how a potential technology shift constitutes a business model dilemma for firms leading in the existing technology. The paper illustrates why technology shifts are so difficult to master and contributes to theory by suggesting that managing technology shifts does not require either technology or service innovation in order to create a viable business model. but instead a compound of both. Furthermore. the paper applies a business model perspective to illustrate the explanatory power of analyzing the challenges of …,True,vnHCVggAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,266,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166497214000248,4613402583841862152,/scholar?cites=4613402583841862152,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:636326,0,0,0

ERS is defined by dynamic power transfer from the road to the vehicle while the vehicle is in motion and could be achieved through different power transfer technologies from the road to the vehicle such as rail. overhead-line. and wireless solutions. The investment cost to implement ERS will be high and decision makers will require knowledge about how mature different solutions are compared to the conventional and alternative technologies. However. while there are numerous ERS development and demonstration projects globally. it is unclear which technological solution that is best suited for large scale implementation.

Transition toward alternative technologies. such as ERS. is necessary in order to achieve the sustainability goals in road transportation. While several studies have emphasized that new business models are necessary in order to commercialize such technologies. they tend to neglect the fact that many of these technologies require socio-technical change. such as investments in alternative infrastructure. Hence. this thesis examines the relationship between business models and socio-technical change.The research was explorative and based on two case studies investigating the development of ERS: a longitudinal case study in Sweden and an in-depth case study in Los Angeles. USA. The findings suggest different roles that business models can have in different types of projects when preparing ERS for commercial takeoff: first. new business models were not part of the pilot projects which focused on radical innovation; second. business models were developed in demonstration projects with user interactions; and. third. business models were evaluated. and in this case rejected. in a deployment project aiming to transform the existing socio-technical system.,True,vnHCVggAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,14,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1194740,3728661218913079902,/scholar?cites=3728661218913079902,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1194740,0,0,0

1194982,Exploring business models and discontinuous innovation: The transition towards the Electric Road System (ERS),2013,Stefan Tongur,,,,,,How does system innovation. the transition from one technical system to another. come about and affect stakeholders that either are incumbents or new entrants? Why do some incumbent firms manage the associated technical change successfully and other not? And what is the role of business models in this setting? This thesis argues that these questions are relevant for the understanding of how business models are challenged during the discontinuous innovation. The thesis explores the role of business model in discontinuous change in system through a case study illustrating a transition from the conventional road system to the Electrical Road System (ERS).In the light of system challenges (eg in energy. mobility. and communication). the search for technologies that have the potential to transform technical systems has been highly relevant (Elzen et. al.. 2004; Smith et. al.. 2005). Most of these technologies fail in transforming the system despite having the potential to do so. due to a “lock in” to a technological standard and dominant design (Unruh. 2000; Abernathy and Utterback. 1978). Historical studies account for various cases where new systems have emerged into such dominant design (also called technological momentum) in a period of competition between different standards (Hughes. 1983; Arthur. 1989). Proponents of “history of science” have studied technical change by analysis of how technology. science and society are interrelated(eg Hughes. 1983; Latour. 1987; Pinch et. al.. 1987). Their focus is on the evolution of the new system and not the transition from the old system to new one. system innovation (Malerba. 2002).

Surprisingly. there has been very little attention to how users will pay for using ERS. An implemented ERS could require an operator that handles the relationship between users and suppliers of ERS. We term this operator role as ERSO (Electric Road System Operator) and define it as the role that connects the users with energy supply of the electric road. The paper presents an architecture that describes the ERSO interfaces. relationships between stakeholders. and discusses the role of ERSO in two different deployment scenarios. The paper concludes that the role of ERSO will not be homogenous but will depend on how closed or open ERS will be.

1194987,The empowerment dilemma of niche advocates,2018,Stefan Tongur,,,,,,Given sustainability challenges. it is crucial to develop sustainable technologies that reduce emissions and oil dependency and increase energy efficiency. Transition literature advocates creating niches where learning activities can occur. but internalniche development alone is insufficient. The niche empowerment concept has attracted attention for its utility in analyzing how alternative technologies with sustainability potential can diffuse beyond niches and become commercialized. As few studies consider how firms choose empowerment strategies. depending on their selection environments. this paper analyses business model barriers in niche projects implemented in different institutional contexts. This paper compares two electric road system (ERS) demonstration projects. analyzing how their contexts influence the niche advocate’s empowerment strategy. The projects were largely similar. suiting them for comparison. though their barriers to creating a business model differed. affecting the empowerment processes facilitating wider transition of the socio-technical regime. Analyzing the empirical data indicated that the niche advocate implemented two empowerment approaches in the two similar ERS demonstration projects: a “fit-and-conform” process in Gävle and a “stretch-and-transform” process in LA. The paper identifies a dilemma whereby no single niche empowerment strategy can overcome the business model barriers; accordingly. niche advocates must develop an empowerment strategy that simultaneously deploys both strategies.,True,vnHCVggAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1194734,,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1194734,0,0,0

The correlation between the evolution of a distinct morphology reveals that the reactor pressure perturbs the growth modes and suggests that the entangled NWs follow the vapor–liquid–solid mechanism and the growth of vertical NWs is likely to be vapour–solid driven. μ-Raman and photoluminescence studies exhibit the high optical quality of both the entangled and vertical NWs.,True,VcQPvF8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,37,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2012/ra/c2ra01000c,4902744093215592935,/scholar?cites=4902744093215592935,,http://14.139.186.108/jspui/bitstream/123456789/26414/1/67.pdf,0,0,0

The activation energy for the growth of the SnO2 nanograins was estimated to be ∼28.28 kJ/mol. which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of bulk SnO2. The estimated m value suggests that the growth mechanism of the nanograins is primarily through lattice diffusion in the pore control scheme. Precise control of the calcination temperature and time is necessary to maximize the efficiency of electrospinning-synthesized SnO2 nanofibers for sensor applications. Importantly. the sensor fabricated with nanofibers of small nanograins showed much better sensing properties to CO and NO2 comparing with the sensor fabricated with nanofibers of large nanograins.

The CdS films were deposited on glass substrate by thermal evaporation. and the films studied in the present work are polycrystalline with crystallites preferentially oriented along (002)-H direction. It is shown that swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation leads to grain agglomeration and hence an increase in the grain size at low ion fluences. The observed lattice compaction was related to irradiation induced polygonization.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy determines a quantitative analysis of the oxidation states and the corresponding physicochemical interactions of the cations. It also substantiates the observed distortions incurred as an effect of samarium dopants onto the crystal lattice structure. Temperature dependent dielectric analysis for the rare earth orthochromites exhibits negligible dielectric loss. improved dielectric …,True,4c5efQMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S025405842030300X,13045103791857088773,/scholar?cites=13045103791857088773,,,0,0,0

The physical characterization studies of the final composite provided that the lattice structure of Zn 2+ substituted at Ni sites confirms for the single-phase ferrite with spinel structure got investigated at room temperature (RT) with functional. morphological as well as temperature-dependent magnetic and dielectric properties. The magnetic properties imply that the distribution of cations at the lattice sites suggests that the magnetization is getting increased with a decrease of temperature from RT to lower temperature in a field cooling process and is due to the strong dipolar magnetostatic interactions between the …,True,4c5efQMAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10854-020-04187-9,7767536855267547313,/scholar?cites=7767536855267547313,,,0,0,0

It is tested to investigate its performance in terms of its ability to effectively humidify air. The system investigated in this study has both the humidifier and the heater (s) integrated in one unit. Special low pressuredrop nozzles are used to spray water such that they provide a fine mist. thus they break a liquid to tiny droplets to increase the surface area for better heat and mass transfer between the hot air and sprayed water. Several attempts to improve system performance are made. For example. the effect of adding packing material to further increase heat and mass transfer surface area is attempted. Another attempt is by having an interstage heating such that a heating coil (basically a heat exchanger where hot water is circulated in a closed loop) is placed after a first-stage sprayer to heat the air again such that its ability to absorb …,True,Kt4-Q6IAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IMECE/proceedings-abstract/IMECE2015/V06AT07A049/257926,,,,,0,0,0

To resolve this. solar desalination system has been added under the collector of a solar chimney power plant. Generally the collector ground is completely covered by the desalination pond but here it is shown that more benefit can be achieved by partial occupation of the collector area.

The Combined Pinch and Exergy Analysis (CPEA) first considers the representation of the hot and cold Composite Curves of the Rankine cycle and defines the energy and Exergy requirements. The basic assumption of the minimum approach temperature difference (∆ Tmin) required for the Pinch Analysis is represented as a distinct Exergy loss that increases the fuel requirement for power generation. The exergy composite curves put the focus on the opportunities for fuel conservation in the cycle. The application results of CPEA in the power plant showed that its fuel consumption could be reduced by 5.3% and the thermal cycle performance could be increased from 39.4 to 41.9%.

In addition to allowing re-use of water in multiple-contaminant systems. issues about heat losses and flowrate changes inside unit operations have also been incorporated in this new design method. To implement such a design. two new design aspects are introduced; new method for “Non-isothermal Mixing” point identification and new “Separate System” generation. The first aspect involves “non-isothermal mixing”. which enables direct heat recovery between water streams. and therefore allows the reduction of the number of heat transfer units. The other aspect is the generation of “separate system “in heat exchanger network design. The flexibility of mixing and splitting of water streams allows separate systems to be created as a cost-effective series of heat-exchanger units between freshwater and wastewater streams.

The leachate of the waste has created a lake with 180000m3 in volume. A plant is under construction totreat the leachate. A significant amount of biogas can be produced in anaerobic digestion phase in the treatment plant reactor. The designing process of a power plant in accordance with the produced biogas has been discussed in the present study. In the present investigation the air pollution from power plant has also been modeled. The leachate organic load (BOD=34400 mg/L and COD=53900 mg/L) is considerably higher when compared with other countries due to higher amount of organics available in Tehran wastes. The results indicate that an amount of 33504 m3/d biogas can be produced in Tehran’s landfill that eventually would be sufficient to run a power plant of 3.4 MW capacities. The plant which is designed by Thermoflow software is consisted of two gas turbine units with 2 MW capacities so that the total capacity is 4MW. About 10% of the generated power is for in-plant consumption and the rest can be sold.

1195832,Operation Adaptation of Moving Bed Biomass Combustors under Various Waste Fuel Conditions,2020,Mohammad Hosseini Rahdar and Fuzhan Nasiri,13,Energies,23,6352,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper analyzes a moving grate biomass boiler operating with three alternative waste fuels. including biomass pellets. wood waste. and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from a combination of thermal. economic. and environmental perspectives. The focus of this paper is on system functionality adaptation to retrofit the current systems operational conditions. A one-dimensional numerical bed model integrated with a black-box overbed model was developed to carefully investigate the fuel bed’s thermal characteristics. as well as the boiler’s output. According to the results. the system operates more efficiently under the biomass pellets feeding and annually generates 548 GJ heat. while it drops significantly in other scenarios. The system was economically evaluated based on a 25-year life cycle cost analysis. Subsequently. an internal rate of return (IRR) of 36% was calculated for biomass pellets. while the value reduced by 50% and 27% regarding wood waste and RDF. respectively. The fuel cost was identified as the main contributor to the total life cycle cost of the heating system. regardless of which feeding fuel was utilized. A long-term environmental impacts assessment of the boiler operation emerged. to show how plant-based fuels can significantly decrease the impacts of climate change that have originated from fossil fuel usage. The current study concludes that all the proposed scenarios are feasible to different degrees. and can extensively benefit a diverse set of energy sectors.

1195835,Hydrothermal carbonization of fruit wastes: A promising technique for generating hydrochar,2018,Bide Zhang and Mohammad Heidari and Bharat Regmi and Shakirudeen Salaudeen and Precious Arku and Mahendra Thimmannagari and Animesh Dutta,11,Energies,8,2022,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a useful method to convert wet biomass to value-added products. Fruit waste generated in juice industries is a huge source of moist feedstock for such conversion to produce hydrochar. This paper deals with four types of fruit wastes as feedstocks for HTC; namely. rotten apple (RA). apple chip pomace (ACP). apple juice pomace (AJP). and grape pomace (GP). The operating conditions for HTC processing were 190 C. 225 C. and 260 C for 15 min. For all samples. higher heating value and fixed carbon increased. while volatile matter and oxygen content decreased after HTC. Except for ACP. the ash content of all samples increased after 225 C. For RA. AJP. and GP. the possible explanation for increased ash content above 225 C is that the hydrochar increases in porosity after 230 C. It was observed that an increase in HTC temperature resulted in an increase in the mass yield for RA and GP. which is in contrast with increasing HTC temperature for lignocellulose biomass. Other characterization tests like thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also showed that the HTC process can be successfully used to convert fruit wastes into valuable products.

The catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) of bioethanol was considered the most ideal method for mobile applications because of its sustainable nature and low energy requirements. Carbon deposition in the catalyst bed is the most significant challenge faced in CPOX. This study thus includes a numerical simulation that elucidates the effect of carbon on the bed properties that determine heat and mass transfer. It was discovered that the presence of carbon lowered the thermal conductivity. porosity. and permeability of the catalyst bed. thus reducing the rate of heat and mass transfer. and consequently. reaction rate.

This study is aimed at designing and analyzing two scenarios for bioenergy production from undervalued biomass (sawdust). In one of the scenarios (direct combustion or DC). raw biomass is burned in a combustor to provide the heat that is required by the Rankine cycle to generate electricity. In the other scenario (HTC-AD). the raw biomass first undergoes HTC treatment. While the solid product (hydrochar) is used to produce power by a Rankine cycle. the liquid by-product undergoes an AD process. This results in fuel gas production and it can be used in a Brayton cycle to generate more power. Energy and mass balance analysis of both scenarios were developed for each unit process by using Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The required data were obtained experimentally or from the literature. The performances of the proposed systems were evaluated. and a sensitivity analysis was presented to help in finding the best operational conditions.

1195891,Modeling of automotive recycling planning in the United States,2005,J-K Choi and JA Stuart and Karthik Ramani,6,International journal of automotive technology,4,413-419,The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers,The United States automotive recycling infrastructure has successfully reduced the amount of automotive waste sent to landfills. especially since the introduction of shredders in the late 1950s. Shredders are necessary to process and recycle automotive hulks and other durable goods. However. this industry faces significant challenges as the automotive manufacturers are increasing the use of nonmetallic components which are difficult to recycle. Additionally. it is becoming obvious that automobiles contain hazardous materials which place heavy burdens on the environment. To address this growing concern. we propose a process planning model for automotive shredders to make tactical decisions regarding at what level to process and at what level to reprocess feed stock materials. The purpose of this paper is to test analytical models to help shredders improve the profitability and efficiency of the bulk recycling processes for end of life automobile returns. The work is motivated by an actual recycling problem that was observed at Capitol City Metals shredding facility in Indianapolis.

The theoretical predictions are compared to the experimental reality in both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium regimes. For extremely small MgO thickness. we illustrate that the equilibrium tunnel transport in Fe/MgO/Fe systems leads to antiferromagnetic interactions. Artificial antiferromagnetic systems based on coupling by spin polarized tunnelling have been elaborated and studied. In the out-of-equilibrium regime and for large MgO barrier thickness. the tunnel transport validates specific spin filtering effects in terms of symmetry of the electronic Bloch function and symmetry-dependent wavefunction attenuation in the single-crystal barrier.

Indeed it provides a new way to control and manipulate spin currents. which are key elements of spin-based electronics. Here we report on a giant magnetothermoelectric effect in a magnetic tunnel junction. The thermovoltage in this geometry can reach 1 mV. Moreover a magnetothermovoltage effect could be measured with ratio similar to the tunnel magnetoresistance ratio. The Seebeck coefficient can then be tuned by changing the relative magnetization orientation of the two magnetic layers in the tunnel junction. Therefore. our experiments extend the range of spintronic devices application to thermoelectricity and provide a crucial piece of information for understanding the physics of thermal spin transport.,True,9CXCajIAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC,108,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1748,15256473608064993172,/scholar?cites=15256473608064993172,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1748,0,0,0

A detailed magnetic characterization is performed using vector-field magnetometery combined with a numerical Stoner-Wohlfarth analysis.

The three anisotropies show different behavior with the annealing temperature. The biaxial anisotropy shows a monotonic increase.

However. one of the unsolved questions is that of conservation of the total angular momentum during the ultrafast demagnetization. Here we report the ultrafast transfer of angular momentum during the first hundred femtoseconds in ferrimagnetic Co 0.8 Gd 0.2 and Co 0.74 Tb 0.26 films. Using time-resolved X-ray magnetic circular dichroism allowed for time-resolved determination of spin and orbital momenta for each element. We report an ultrafast quenching of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and show that at early times the demagnetization in ferrimagnetic alloys is driven by the local transfer of angular momenta between the two exchange-coupled sublattices while the total angular momentum stays constant.

A careful analysis of the angle-dependent and field-dependent longitudinal magnetoresistance indicates that the SMR contains a contribution that does not follow the bulk magnetization of CFO. but it is a fingerprint of the complex magnetism at the surface of the CFO layer. thus signaling SMR as a tool for mapping surface magnetization. A systematic study of the SMR for different temperatures and CFO thicknesses gives us information impossible to obtain with any standard magnetometry technique. On one hand. the surface magnetization behaves independently of the CFO thickness and does not saturate up to high fields. evidencing that the surface has its own anisotropy.

As applications are more exigent this characterization is of increasing importance. We present a technique to characterize the surface topography of optical surfaces. It is especially well adapted to Fresnel lenses where abrupt surface slopes are usually difficult to handle in conventional techniques. The method is based on a new photometric strategy able to codify the height information in terms of optical absorption in a liquid. A detailed topographic map is simple to acquire by capturing images of the surface. Some experimental results are presented.

However. although they are exceptional tools there are few reports where both techniques were used in these kinds of devices. In this work. the surface electronic states on AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures were studied in order to identify the effect of factors like laser penetration depth. cap layer thickness. and surface passivation over PR and Raman spectra. PR measurements were performed alternately with two lasers (532 nm and 375 nm wavelength) as the modulation sources in order to identify internal and surface features. The surface electric field calculated by PR analysis decreased whereas the GaAs cap layer thickness increased. in good agreement with a similar behavior observed in Raman measurements ( ratio). When the heterostructures were treated by Si-flux. these techniques showed contrary behaviors. PR analysis revealed a diminution in the surface electric field due to a passivation process whereas the  ratio did not present the same behavior because it was dominated by the depletion layers width (cap layer thickness) and the laser penetration depth.,True,tobj4fsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jspec/2016/4601249/abs/,,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jspec/2016/4601249/abs/,0,0,0

To this goal. we start with anodic alumina substrates displaying controlled modulations in pore diameter obtained by alternating “mild” and “hard” electrochemical etching conditions. We then utilize atomic layer deposition (ALD) to coat the internal pore walls with conformal layers of an oxide. Ferromagnetic Fe3O4 tubes of 10 nm wall thickness and 10−30 μm in length are thus prepared. which replicate the modulated silhouette of the template. Their magnetic properties strongly depend on the presence of diameter modulations.

The temperature above which He is zero (the blocking temperature) is taken as a measure of the ordering temperature of the superlattice. In CoO‐NiO superlattices with short repeat distances the CoO and NiO layers order at a single temperature that is between the ordering temperatures of bulk CoO and NiO. These ordering temperatures are the same as for CoxNi1−xO alloy films with the same overall composition. The temperature dependence of He in some of the superlattice exchange couples deviates from the linear behavior expected for cubic antiferromagnets. In addition. the exchange anisotropy induced by some CoO‐NiO superlattices is greater than that induced by …,True,A6ySwV4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,112,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.352426,18311856304628312012,/scholar?cites=18311856304628312012,,,0,0,0

A magnetoresistance of 5.5% and shield-to-shield spacing of 45 nm have been achieved by using an all-metal single-spin-valve with Heusler-alloy-based free and reference magnetic layers. Read heads with magnetic read widths ~45 nm were tested on perpendicular media. resulting in signals above 1 mV and signal-to-noise ratio ~30 dB. Linear densities in excess of 1050 kbpi were achieved with thermal fly-height control. compatible with recording areal densities of ~400 Gb/in 2 . Current-induced spin-torque effects in the recording head were observed to result in rapid performance degradation above a threshold bias voltage of about 75 mV. corresponding to current densities >10 8  A/cm 2 .,True,A6ySwV4AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,92,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4407570/,2486711766366582679,/scholar?cites=2486711766366582679,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff_Childress/publication/3113033_All-Metal_Current-Perpendicular-to-Plane_Giant_Magnetoresistance_Sensors_for_Narrow-Track_Magnetic_Recording/links/54aabcab0cf25c4c472f4dca/All-Metal-Current-Perpendicular-to-Plane-Giant-Magnetoresistance-Sensors-for-Narrow-Track-Magnetic-Recording.pdf,0,0,0

Seeking to improve the recording density has raised intriguing fundamental questions about the feasibility of combining ultrafast temporal resolution with sub-wavelength spatial resolution for magnetic recording. Here we report on the experimental demonstration of nanoscale sub-100 ps all-optical magnetization switching. providing a path to sub-wavelength magnetic recording. Using computational methods. we reveal the feasibility of nanoscale magnetic switching even for an unfocused laser pulse. This effect is achieved by structuring the sample such that the laser pulse. via both refraction and interference. focuses onto a localized region of the structure. the position of which can be controlled by the structural design.

Although ultrafast heating may assist these processes of magnetization reversal. it has been generally assumed that just a heating pulse alone cannot result in a deterministic reversal of magnetization. Using fs-optical excitation and X-ray detection of magnetic nanostructures we have discovered a novel mechanism of magnetization reversal in a ferrimagnet. which is triggered by a heat pulse only. The mechanism does not require the presence of any other stimulus and occurs each time when a heat pulse brings magnetic sublattices of a ferrimagnet out of- equilibrium with each other. In this presentation. static Photoemission Electron Microscope (PEEM) measurements on square- and circle-shaped GdFeCo structures down to 500 nm will be shown and the model of this new magnetization reversal discussed.

A WSN is a collection of nodes organized into a network. Routing is a vital technology in WSNs and can be roughly divided into two categories: flat routing and hierarchical routing. In a flat routing topology. all nodes have identical functionality and carry out the same task in the network. Nodes in a hierarchical topology do different tasks in WSNs and are usually arranged into clusters. In this paper. a survey on cluster-based routing schemes for WSNs has been done and comparisons made on the basis of performance factors such as latency. scalability. and energy awareness.

Cloud providers can manage their resource usage by knowing future usage demand from the current and past usage patterns of resources. Resource usage prediction is of great importance for dynamic scaling of cloud resources to achieve efficiency in terms of cost and energy consumption while keeping quality of service. The purpose of this paper is to present a real-time resource usage prediction system. The system takes real-time utilization of resources and feeds utilization values into several buffers based on the type of resources and time span size. Buffers are read by R language based statistical system. These buffers’ data are checked to determine whether their data follows Gaussian distribution or not. In case of following Gaussian distribution. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is applied; otherwise Autoregressive Neural Network (AR-NN) is applied. In ARIMA process. a model is selected based on minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values.

Hybrid Routing is suggested to be used in ad-hoc and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). One such hybrid routing protocol is the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP). ZRP attempts to reduce the initial route discovery delay in case of reactive routing. and the control traffic in case of proactive routing by dividing the network into zones. Within each zone proactive routing is used while between zones. reactive routing is used. In this paper we evaluate the performance of ZRP when instead of proactive routing. reactive routing is used within zones and proactive routing is used between zones. Apparently this approach might indicate that the whole purpose of using hybrid routing is defeated.

Recent studies (A. Ben-Hur et al.. 2001) proposed to employ them for cluster analysis too. The basis of this support vector clustering (SVC) is density estimation through SVM training. SVC is a boundary-based clustering method. where the support information is used to construct cluster boundaries. Despite its ability to deal with outliers. to handle high dimensional data and arbitrary boundaries in data space. there are two problems in the process of cluster labelling. The first problem is its low efficiency when the number of free support vectors increases. The other problem is that it sometimes produces false negatives. We propose a robust cluster assignment method that harvests clustering results efficiently. Our method uses proximity graphs to model the proximity structure of the data.

1196374,A method for the visual analysis of the streetscape,2005,Chris Tucker and M Ostwald and S Chalup and Josh Marshall,,University of Newcastle,,519-529,,This paper outlines an interdisciplinary approach. utilising architectural knowledge and computer imaging. to develop an analytical tool that describes the physical characteristics of a streetscape. Techniques for connecting the urban texture at the scale of the individual. with the urban character of precincts within the city are difficult to find. One theory that does appear to be able to make such a connection is space syntax. By considering the open spaces generated by the existence of an interdependent built boundary extending in scale from the individual house through to the streets that form cities. space syntax attempts to explain human behaviour as it occurs in those spaces. Describing the visual character of a streetscape through analysis of its spatial configuration might then provide an objective measure within a planning field that is dominated by qualitative methods. A method of analysis is developed using an algorithm. based on the Hough transform. which provides a global measure of the geometry within the convex space of the streetscape. This image processing technique segments an image at a fine scale on the basis of discontinuity and similarity. allowing the edges that define features within the built surface to be detected. The density of edges within the textured surface then provides a measure of how visual detail is distributed throughout an image at different scales. a concept that is closely related to fractal geometry.The approach is conceptually related to the theory of description retrieval. facade configuration and the facade isovist discussed by Hillier (Hillier 1996: p238; Hillier 2003).

However. the success rate was generally low and severe instability issues were encountered. The present study examines the hypothesis that a combination of evolutionary hill climbing with incremental learning and a well-balanced training set enables first order recurrent networks to reliably learn context-free and mildly context-sensitive languages. In particular. we trained the networks to predict symbols in string sequences of the context-sensitive language {anbncn; n≥1}.

In order to simulate this phenomenon. which is a form of pareidolia. a software system for pattern recognition based on statistical learning was applied. One-class classification was used for face detection and an eight-class classifier was employed for facial expression analysis. The system was trained by means of a database consisting of 280 frontal images of human faces that were normalised to the inner eye corners. A separate set of test images contained human facial expressions and selected house façades. The experiments demonstrated how facial expression patterns associated with emotional states such as surprise. fear. happiness. sadness. anger. disgust. contempt or neutrality could be identified in both types of test images. and how the results depended on preprocessing and parameter selection for the classifiers.,True,61q7GXYAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,34,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan_Chalup/publication/228735838_Simulating_Pareidolia_of_Faces_for_Architectural_Image_Analysis/links/0fcfd511b3ff280efe000000/Simulating-Pareidolia-of-Faces-for-Architectural-Image-Analysis.pdf,13020772887808693692,/scholar?cites=13020772887808693692,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephan_Chalup/publication/228735838_Simulating_Pareidolia_of_Faces_for_Architectural_Image_Analysis/links/0fcfd511b3ff280efe000000/Simulating-Pareidolia-of-Faces-for-Architectural-Image-Analysis.pdf,0,0,0

1196379,Analyzing architectural space: identifying salient regions by computing 3D isovists,2012,Shashank Bhatia and Stephan K Chalup and Michael J Ostwald,,"Conference proceedings. 46th annual conference of the architectural science association (AN-ZAScA), Gold Coast, QLD",,,,Spatio-cognitive properties–including the capacity to evoke a sense of place or support wayfinding–are amongst the most important considerations in the design of large urban and architectural spaces. Both wayfinding and spatial identity rely on the capacity of a space to be noticeably distinct; a property that is called saliency. However. there are relatively few experimental techniques to identify locations that are rich in such visual properties and those that do exist were typically developed in the 1980s using only two-dimensional viewshed geometry. In contrast. this paper describes the use of 3D isovists to develop a salient region estimation technique for architectural and urban environments. The underlying method of saliency estimation is based on principal component analysis that is used to compare geometric properties of the areas surrounding a vantage point. Statistical summaries of the 3D isovists are compared in the principal component space to differentiate the monotonous regions from the ones that are more visually distinct. The experimental results reported in this paper are developed using a model of the Villa Savoye to demonstrate that 3D isovists can be used to determine the extent to which an environment supports a capacity for wayfinding. The paper makes two major contributions to architectural computational analysis; first. it demonstrates a consistent. stable 3D isovist method and second. it proposes a quantitative technique for detecting regions with strong visual characteristics.,True,61q7GXYAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,24,http://anzasca.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/p681.pdf,11317265706118503693,/scholar?cites=11317265706118503693,,http://anzasca.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/p681.pdf,0,0,0

Intell,1,71-93,,Cooperative reinforcement learning algorithms such as BEST-Q. AVE-Q. PSO-Q. and WSS use Q-value sharing strategies between reinforcement learners to accelerate the learning process. This paper presents a comparison study of the performance of these cooperative algorithms as well as an algorithm that aggregates their results. In addition. this paper studies the effects of the frequency of Q-value sharing on the learning speed of the independent learners that share their Q-values among each other.

Heidelberg,Computer vision systems frequently employ colour segmentation as a step of feature extraction. This is particularly crucial in an environment where important features are colour-coded. such as robot soccer. This paper describes a method for determining an appropriate colour model by measuring the compactness and separation of clusters produced by the k-means algorithm. RGB. HSV.

A software tool was developed which consists of an intensity-based skyline extraction module combined with a box-counting approach for calculation of the fractal dimension. Obstacles such as power-lines. vertical poles or cranes which interrupt the skyline can automatically be excluded from the analysis. The paper describes the methods involved and presents three pilot experiments using the new approach which indicate that: (1) If trees intersect the skyline they typically increase its fractal dimension; (2) Different types of cities can be distinguished by their characteristic skylines; (3) The process to determine the best fit skyline in an image can require user intervention.

1196388,An automated colour calibration system using multivariate gaussian mixtures to segment hsi colour space,2008,Naomi Henderson and Robert King and Stephan K Chalup,,Proc. of the 2008 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation,,,,This paper presents a system for automating the time consuming task of manual colour calibration for a mobile robot. By converting a series of YUV images to HSI format and analysing histogram data it can be seen that there are distinct regions of colour space for each object colour class and that one dimension. hue. can be used to uniquely identify each colour class. Using an expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. it is proposed that the HSI colour space can be segmented and automatically labeled for the purpose of automatic colour calibration. This method is applied to a Aldebaran Nao robot vision system that uses a ‘soft’colour classification method to classify non-unique colour space. By reducing the colour labeling dimension to one and implementing soft classification principles. a reliable automatic calibration system was achieved.,True,61q7GXYAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,21,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2008/papers/pap150s1.pdf,16354835559374877145,/scholar?cites=16354835559374877145,,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2008/papers/pap150s1.pdf,0,0,0

The data consist of points on two intertwined spirals which cannot be linearly separated. This article reviews how this task and some of its variations have significantly inspired the development of several important methods in the history of artificial neural networks. The two-spiral task became popular for several different reasons: (1) it was regarded as extremely challenging; (2) it belonged to a suite of standard benchmark tasks; and (3) it had visual appeal and was convenient to use in pilot studies.

NUClear is modular. low latency and promotes functional and expandable software design. It greatly reduces the latency for messages passed between modules as the messages routes are established at compile time. It also reduces the number of functions that must be written using a system called co-messages which aids in dealing with multiple simultaneous data. NUClear has primarily been evaluated on a humanoid robotic soccer platform and on a robotic boat platform. with evaluations showing that NUClear requires fewer callbacks and cache variables over existing message-passing architectures. NUClear does have limitations when applying these techniques on multi-processed systems. It performs best in lower power systems where computational resources are limited.

The problem is reformulated through relaxing one of its hard constraints and then creating a soft constraint to address the relaxed constraint. The relaxed problem is solved in two steps. First. a graph-based heuristic is used to construct a feasible solution of the relaxed problem. and then. a simulated annealing (SA)-based approach is utilized to minimize the violation of the soft constraint. In order to strengthen the diversification ability of the method in the SA phase. a heuristic based on Kempe chain neighborhood is embedded into the standard approach.

In the past. most common training schemes for WNNs. such as gradient descent. have been restricted to training only a subset of differentiable parameters. In this paper. we propose an evolutionary method to train both differentiable and non-differentiable parameters using the concept of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). The approach was evaluated on the two-spiral task and on real-world datasets for the detection of breast cancer and Parkinson’s disease. In our experiments. the performance of the proposed method was comparable to several standard methods of classification. On the breast cancer dataset. the performance was better than other non-ensemble and multistep processing methods.

NUClear is modular. low latency and promotes functional and expandable software design. It greatly reduces the latency for messages passed between modules as the messages routes are established at compile time. It also reduces the number of functions that must be written using a system called co-messages which aids in dealing with multiple simultaneous data. NUClear has primarily been evaluated on a humanoid robotic soccer platform and on a robotic boat platform. with evaluations showing that NUClear requires fewer callbacks and cache variables over existing message-passing architectures. NUClear does have limitations when applying these techniques on multi-processed systems. It performs best in lower power systems where computational resources are limited.

In vitiligo cases. areas of skin become pale or white due to the lack of skin pigment called melanin. Vitiligo treatment causes skin repigmentation resulting in a normal skin color. However. it is difficult to determine and quantify the amount of repigmentation visually during treatment because the repigmentation progress is slow and moreover changes in skin color can only be discerned over a longer time frame typically 6 months.

The input images are first decomposed into multiple resolutions by using the contourlet transform which provides a better representation than the conventional transforms. Transformed coefficients are combined with a predefined fusion rules. The resultant image is found by performing inverse contourlet transformation of the composite image.

At its peak. this amounted to over a 7 GW supply-demand gap and caused the electricity grid to be offline for vast swathes of population for many hours daily. Despite major supply-side investments acute shortages persist and a large percentage of relatively affluent households. estimated in millions. have countered this by investing in self-generation and battery storage technologies (usually lead-acid batteries because of their low cost). This paper summarizes the impact of this backup technology on the broader energy system in terms of efficiency losses for households and contribution to low-voltage grid congestion. Research findings suggest that the low efficiency of these backup systems has caused annual losses of around 3–4 TWh for the electric grid in Pakistan as well as overloading of transformers …,True,qmCgNL0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421519300175,9003379269005993490,/scholar?cites=9003379269005993490,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fahad_Mehmood/publication/330412521_Electricity_load-shedding_in_Pakistan_Unintended_consequences_opportunities_and_policy_recommendations/links/5c3f073992851c22a378a3e1/Electricity-load-shedding-in-Pakistan-Unintended-consequences-opportunities-and-policy-recommendations,0,0,0
1196451,Determinants of energy flexibility in residential hot water systems,2019,Attila Balint and Hussain Kazmi,188,Energy and Buildings,,286-296,Elsevier,With increasing proliferation levels of variable energy sources. flexible energy loads will become increasingly important to help stabilize the energy grid. Increasing electrification of heating systems means that the thermal inertia of buildings and hot water vessels can provide a ubiquitous. low cost alternative to electrical storage for providing this energy flexibility. However. it is unclear how this flexibility fluctuates with various factors such as occupant behaviour and ambient conditions in the real world. This paper quantifies the effect of different influencing factors on the energy flexibility of residential hot water systems using data from a large scale real world pilot. All the houses considered in this analysis feature identical air source heat pump hot water systems. along with 200 l storage vessels.

Cham, This study applies model-free reinforcement learning (RL) on a case study based in Utrecht province in the Netherlands to optimize for on-site renewable energy. This aims at reducing the interaction of net zero-energy buildings with the grid as a result of an increase of heat pump installations and renewable energy systems (RES) integration. It is believed that this will become increasingly more important since the regulations regarding 2020 and beyond ascribe significant increase in energy efficiency of the built environment. On-site RES self-consumption is therefore a central lead in this research. The project data comprise air source heat pump and solar energy data of 6 different households for the months June to November 2016.

This. along with higher wealth levels and rise of internet of things. has provided designers and planners the opportunity to reimagine living spaces. The smart homes that have arisen out of this reimagining come in many different shapes; but to gain widespread acceptance they have to increase the utility of building occupants in some meaningful way while not being intrusive. The most straightforward way of achieving this end goal is assumed to be through artificial intelligence. In this paper. we take a critical look at some algorithmic approaches that have been formulated to do so and the opportunities they will create in the short term.

Historically. this has been treated as a local. or single-agent. optimization problem. However. many buildings utilize the same types of thermal equipment eg electric heaters and hot water vessels. During operation. occupants in these buildings interact with the equipment differently thereby driving them to diverse regions in the state-space. Reinforcement learning agents can learn from these interactions. recorded as sensor data. to optimize the overall energy efficiency. However. if these agents operate individually at a household level. they can not exploit the replicated structure in the problem. In this paper. we demonstrate that this problem can indeed benefit from multi-agent collaboration by making use of targeted exploration of the state-space allowing for better generalization. We also investigate trade-offs between integrating human knowledge and additional sensors. Results show that savings of over 40% are possible with collaborative multi-agent systems making use of either expert knowledge or additional sensors with no loss of occupant comfort. We find that such multi-agent systems comfortably outperform comparable single agent systems.,True,qmCgNL0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03491,9710940467592752562,/scholar?cites=9710940467592752562,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03491,0,0,0

1196459,Large-scale transfer learning for data-driven modelling of hot water systems,2019,Hussain Kazmi and Johan Suykens and Johan Driesen,,Building Simulation,,,,Hot water systems represent a substantial energy draw for most residential buildings. For design and operational optimization. they are usually either modelled by domain experts or through black-box models which makes use of sensor data. However. given the wide variability in hot water systems. it is impractical for a domain expert to individually model every hot water system. Likewise. black-box systems typically require an enormous amount of data to converge to a usable model. This paper makes use of transfer learning. a novel machine learning tool. to completely automate the learning process while substantially accelerating the performance of comparable black-box systems. Using real world data from 61 houses employing two different types of hot water systems. the proposed system is shown to work on both homogeneous and heterogeneous hot water systems. Convergence to a reliable model with transfer learning is on the order of a few weeks. as opposed to months or years without transfer. By presenting a detailed account of how transfer learning can be used in different contexts. we hope that it will become a widely used tool in the building modelling and simulation community.,True,qmCgNL0AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hussain_Kazmi2/publication/335526620_Large-Scale_Transfer_Learning_For_Data-Driven_Modelling_Of_Hot_Water_Systems/links/5d6abaa692851c8538837bf0/Large-Scale-Transfer-Learning-For-Data-Driven-Modelling-Of-Hot-Water-Systems.pdf,12140104397070664466,/scholar?cites=12140104397070664466,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hussain_Kazmi2/publication/335526620_Large-Scale_Transfer_Learning_For_Data-Driven_Modelling_Of_Hot_Water_Systems/links/5d6abaa692851c8538837bf0/Large-Scale-Transfer-Learning-For-Data-Driven-Modelling-Of-Hot-Water-Systems.pdf,0,0,0

(2) Geometric attributes provide the event's spatial dip. azimuth. and curvatures. (3) Similarity or dissimilarity attributes measure the event's semblance or (1-semblance) with neighboring events along the geometry. Similarity and dissimilarity also are used to track horizons. faults. and channels. The resolution and fidelity of all attributes depend on spectra of both the seismic signal and noise that vary in time and space. Popular time-domain methods for attribute estimation are limited by their inability to filter frequency-dependent noise and adapt to changes in signal spectrum.

1196469,Data-driven Modelling and Control of Energy Flexible Residential Loads,2019,Hussain Kazmi,,,,,,Burning fossil fuels to meet humanity's insatiable energy demand is one of the leading drivers for anthropogenic climate change. An important means of mitigating the worst impact of climate change is therefore improving efficiency of current energy use and transitioning to a cleaner energy mix to meet the residual demand. This requires a fundamental rethink of how the energy value-chain is organized at present. A key technology to enable the sustainability transition is through employing demand side management to leverage flexibility at multiple scales. Demand side management encompasses both demand reduction and demand response of controllable or flexible loads via automatic control or user engagement. Notable examples of flexible loads at the residential building level-which forms the focus of this thesis-include electric batteries. and thermostatically controllable loads such as hot water systems. Unlike electric batteries. modelling and controlling thermostatically controllable loads (such as electric heaters. heat pumps etc.) poses a more challenging problem. However. they make up for a substantial fraction of energy demand in many European countries. and can provide energy flexibility at a far cheaper price point than electric storage. Controlling thermostatically controllable loads is hard because of the general non-existence of a model which can be used to describe their behaviour. This model is necessary to control the load in a way which is beneficial for both the user and the grid.

1196470,Developing synergies for automated optimal control of residential heat pumps,2017,Hussain Syed Kazmi and Cheaib Farah and Driesen Johan,,,,,,Energy efficiency in the built environment has been identified as one of the key enabling technologies to meet global climate change targets. In this paper. we present promising results from a black box method to automatically characterize various aspects of heat pump operation in residential settings. Experimental data is gathered from heat pumps used to provide spatial heating and domestic hot water in recently refurbished net-zero energy houses. This is done by data-driven determination of the heat pump’s performance and the impact of building occupants. These interactions. typically in the form of hot water consumption profiles and preferences for temperature set points. are learnt from sensor data. This allows the formulation of an explicit Markov Decision Process (MDP). which can be solved with the objective to maximize energy efficiency of local heat pump operation. In doing so. we show substantial gains over default policies (grounded in thermodynamics) but which don’t consider occupant behaviour. Three key short-term benefits are envisaged from this research: first. leveraging such synergies allows the energy efficiency of heat pump operation to be improved by. on average. more than 10%. Second. automation unlocks the potential to circumvent the costly. non-generalizable model building step in model predictive control. Finally. it allows direct. unbiased benchmarking of theoretical performance of different types of heat pumps against real world performance.,True,qmCgNL0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/1928521?limo=0,,,,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/485343,0,0,0

Whillier. Liu and Jordan between diffuse and hemispherical. and between instantaneous (hourly) values and daily totals of solar radiation are recalibrated against pyrheliometer data for five stations in the U.S. The validity of the Liu and Jordan approach is confirmed. and numerical inaccuracies of the original correlations are found to arise from three factors: (i) reliance on uncorrected measurements of diffuse insolation with pyranometer plus shade ring. (ii) use of a single value of extraterrestrial insolation for a whole month. and (iii) neglect of seasonal variations in the diffuse/hemispherical ratio. The new correlation for the daily total ratio of diffuse over hemispherical insolation agrees with results reported for India. Israel and Canada which included the shade ring correction.

It is mostly based on pre-existing. well-validated scientific models that are continuously improved. The motivation for the building of SURFEX is to use strictly identical scientific models in a high range of applications in order to mutualise the research and development efforts. SURFEX can be run in offline mode (0-D or 2-D runs) or in coupled mode (from mesoscale models to numerical weather prediction and climate models). An assimilation mode is included for numerical weather prediction and monitoring. In addition to momentum. heat and water fluxes. SURFEX is able to simulate fluxes of carbon dioxide. chemical species. continental aerosols. sea salt and snow particles. The main principles of the organisation of the surface are described first.

The high precipitation events that occurred during the winter of 2009/2010 have been considered with three main goals: to analyze the main atmospheric characteristics associated with the events; to expand the understanding of the interaction between the island and the atmospheric circulations. mainly the effects of the island on the generation or intensification of orographic precipitation; and to evaluate the performance of high resolution numerical modeling in simulating and forecasting heavy precipitation events over the island. The MESO-NH model with a horizontal resolution of 1 km is used. as well as rain gauge data. synoptic charts and measurements of precipitable water obtained from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS). The results confirm the influence of the orographic effects on precipitation over Madeira as well as the tropical–extratropical interaction. since atmospheric rivers were detected in six out of the seven cases analyzed. acting as a low level moisture supplier. which together with the orographic lifting induced the high rainfall amounts.

Relatively poor correlations and high bias are found for heat/cold wave episodes over the complex topographic areas of Iberia and Mediterranean regions where land surface processes play important role in local climate.

These differences are shown to be correlated mainly with the clearness index. solar zenith angle. mean air temperature. relative air humidity and total water column.

For this purpose. brief regional fog climatology. essentially based on information from the Beja Air Base meteorological station. was produced and several numerical high resolution simulations were performed using the Meso-NH. The ECOCLIMAP database used to generate the model physiography was improved to include the Alqueva reservoir (~250 km2). filled in 2003. The model results were compared with surface and satellite observations. showing good agreement in terms of fog occurrence and persistence. Various forcing mechanisms for formation. development. and dissipation of fog were identified. confirming the influence of two small mountains that block the moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. preventing the fog from reaching innermost regions. The introduction of the Alqueva large reservoir induces changes in the landscape and environment. The effects of the water vapour addition and of the changes in mass and energy surface fluxes on fog formation and evolution were studied. It was found that the reservoir may have a direct impact on fog formation over the lake and its vicinity. Depending on the large scale meteorological conditions. their influence can be both positive and negative. in terms of spatial coverage and temporal persistence.,True,98HIDwQAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C,16,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2017/1276784/abs/,7928392182240390404,/scholar?cites=7928392182240390404,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2017/1276784/abs/,0,0,0

Mainland Portugal is characterised by a very variable terrain between the north and south regions. the latter being much smoother. with sparse mountains that barely reach 1000 m. Conversely. several mountain ranges are distributed over Spain with heights often exceeding 1500 m altitude. A mesoscale non-hydrostatic atmospheric model (MesoNH) is used to study the orographic precipitation during a limited period in spring of 2002 over the Iberian Peninsula. In order to assess the effects of the mountains. case study simulations are done. with and without the orography. MesoNH is initialized and forced by the ECMWF analyses. The effects of orography on precipitation over neighbouring regions are also analyzed. Simulations show that orography is a key factor in determining the spatial distribution of precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula. with enhancements in the regions with mountain ranges and diminution or suppression over certain valleys. The simulated precipitation fields were visually compared with radar observations in central Portugal and quantitatively compared with rain gauge data all over Portugal in order to assess the model performance in the analyzed cases.,True,98HIDwQAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,16,https://adgeo.copernicus.org/articles/25/103/2010/,1685574318198308460,/scholar?cites=1685574318198308460,,https://adgeo.copernicus.org/articles/25/103/2010/adgeo-25-103-2010.pdf,0,0,0

Recent results demonstrated that DNI forecasts have been enhanced. having the potential to be a suitable tool for plant operators that allows achieving higher energy efficiency in the management of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. particularly during periods of direct solar radiation intermittency. The main objective of this work was to assert the predictive value of the IFS forecasts. regarding operation outputs from a simulated central receiver system. Considering a 365-day period. the present results showed an hourly correlation of≈ 0.78 between the electric energy injected into the grid based on forecasted and measured data. while a higher correlation was found for the daily values (≈ 0.89). Operational strategies based on the forecasted results were proposed for plant operators regarding the three different weather scenarios. Although there were still deviations due to the cloud and aerosol representation. the IFS forecasts showed a high potential to be used for supporting informed energy dispatch decisions in the operation of central receiver units.

The Alqueva reservoir. the largest artificial lake in western Europe. located on the south-east of Portugal. was filled in 2004. It is a large natural laboratory that allows the study of changes in surface and in landscape and how they affect the weather in the region. This paper is focused on a 3-day case study. 22–24 July 2014. during which an intensive observation campaign was carried out. In order to quantify the breeze effects induced by the Alqueva reservoir. two simulations with the mesoscale atmospheric model Meso-NH coupled to the FLake freshwater lake model has been performed. The difference between the two simulations lies in the presence or absence of the reservoir on the model surface. Comparing the two simulation datasets. with and without the reservoir. net results of the lake impact were obtained. Magnitude of the impact on air temperature. relative humidity. and other atmospheric variables are shown. The clear effect of a lake breeze (5–7 m s−1) can be observed during daytime on distances up to 6 km away from the shores and up to 300 m above the surface. The lake breeze system starts to form at 09:00 UTC and dissipates at 18:00–19:00 UTC with the arrival of a larger-scale Atlantic breeze. The descending branch of the lake breeze circulation brings dry air from higher atmospheric layers (2–2.5 km) and redistributes it over the lake.

1196529,OpenFOAM solver for 3d modelling of solar thermal volumetric receivers coupled to concentration systems,2019,Germilly Barreto and Paulo Canhoto and Manuel Collares-Pereira,,,,,3rd Iberian Meeting of OpenFOAM R technology users,Over the last few years. the use of porous volumetric receivers in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants is being extensively investigated. In this work. a three dimensional solver is developed in OpenFOAM to model the solar radiation absorption. thermal and hydrodynamic performance of porous volumetric receivers coupled to solar concentration systems. The porous structure is assimilated to a continuous semi-transparent medium. and the volume averaged mass. momentum and energy conservation equations are solved using the local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) approach [1]. The absorbed solar radiation in the solid matrix structure is modelled by coupling a 3D in-house algorithm based on the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method [2] with the CFD mesh. while the thermal radiation transfer is described by P1 spherical harmonics method. To test the model. a cylindrical receiver element (5 cm of diameter and 5 cm of height) made of open-cell SiC ceramic foam coupled to a parabolic dish with a concentration ratio of 500 is considered. The global model (MCRT and CFD) is designed to have as input the concentrated solar radiation and angle of incidence fields at the receiver inlet. and the main results are the spatial distributions of the absorbed solar radiation. temperature of the fluid and solid matrix structure and fluid velocity. The thermal efficiency. mean fluid temperature at the outlet and pressure drop across the receiver for the test conditions are 85.46%. 474.22 K and 103.10 Pa. respectively.

The porous media is composed of a solid matrix with homogeneous porous material and isotropic properties. and the boundary of the medium is characterized through a diffuse albedo. The Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function is used to model the scattering inside the porous media. The model is validated by comparing the results of diffuse reflectance and transmittance with the corresponding values of a long slab geometry and finite thickness present in literature. Then the model is used to determine the absorption of solar radiation in a porous volumetric solar receiver coupled to a solar concentration system. The effect of the incidence angle. optical thickness. asymmetry factor of the phase function and wall properties on the solar radiation absorption is studied. Using a parabolic dish as concentration system coupled to a cylindrical receiver (concentration factor of 500) as test case. a peak of absorbed solar radiation of 156 MW m−3 and absorption efficiency of 91.35% was obtained. by using an asymmetry factor of 0.4 and extinction coefficient of 1 1/cm.,True,MEAJphoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/handle/10174/22986,,,,,0,0,0

1196547,Comparison and assessment of circumsolar ratio models for Évora. Portugal,2020,Edgar FM Abreu and Paulo Canhoto and Maria João Costa,,,,,Jornadas ICT,The sun rays are scattered due to molecules. aerosols and some cloud types. such as cirrus clouds. and a region near to the vicinity of the sun disk. known as circumsolar region. with relatively high diffuse sky radiance is formed [1]. Consequently. this diffuse radiation is called circumsolar normal irradiance (CSNI). Modelling the CSNI is important because pyrheliometers (the instruments that are used to measure direct normal irradiance – DNI). have an aperture angle wider than the circumsolar region. and thus DNI measurements obtained with these instruments cannot resolve the distribution of solar radiance in that region [2]. Moreover. since concentrated solar power (CSP) systems only capture solar radiation from this region but with a narrower aperture angle than that of the pyrheliometers. this leads to an overestimation of the energy reaching the receiver of the CSP systems [1]. This can result in misleading power output estimations. which can harm the bankability of CSP projects. Information on CSNI is also crucial when designing. sizing and operating CSP powerplants.,True,Boy14OUAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/handle/10174/27151,,,,https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/bitstream/10174/27151/1/abreu_et_al_ict_2020.pdf,0,0,0
1196548,Modifying a pyrheliometer to measure direct normal and circumsolar irradiance,2019,Edgar FM Abreu and Paulo Canhoto and Maria João Costa,,,,,,Direct normal irradiance (DNI) is key to concentrating solar power (CSP) systems energy generation. However. pyrheliometric measurements of DNI also include a circumsolar normal irradiance (CSNI) component because the aperture angle of the instrument is larger than the sun disk. CSNI is due to the scattering of the sun rays by molecules. aerosols and some cloud types such as cirrus clouds [1]. As a result. energy is transferred from the direct solar beam to the circumsolar region. i.e.. the region in the vicinity of the sun disk [2]. Typically. CSP systems have a lower aperture angle than that of pyrheliometers. which means that these systems are not able to absorb the same amount of CSNI as the amount that is present in the DNI measurements. leading to an inaccurate forecast of energy generation of CSP systems if DNI measurements are directly used in its sizing and operation. In this way. measuring CSNI for different aperture angles is important to better size. operate and optimize the energy generation of CSP systems. In this work. a conventional pyrheliometer field-of-view is modified through the variation of its collimator length and diameter in order to gather information on the circumsolar irradiance [3]. The modified pyrheliometer is composed by a revolver with four possible combinations of tube lengths and diameters and a stepper motor. which automatically enable varying the field-of-view of the pyrheliometer.,True,Boy14OUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/handle/10174/27082,,,,https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/bitstream/10174/27082/1/abreu_et_al_poster.pdf,0,0,0

1196550,Direct Normal Irradiance and circumsolar radiation: modelling. measurement and impact on Concentrating Solar Power,2017,Edgar FM Abreu and Paulo Canhoto and Maria João Costa,,,,,Jornadas ICT 2017,CONCLUSIONSIn this work. a model able to determine the direct beam and circumsolar irradiance using variables such as the aerosol optical depth. relative humidity and precipitable water is presented. It can be used to model the irradiance that reaches to either pyrheliometers or solar concentrators. It was shown that the circumsolar radiation increases with the increase of relative humidity and aerosol optical depth and decreases with the increase of precipitable water. The model is able to provide both spectral and integrated values. As expected. higher opening angles lead to higher values of circumsolar irradiance measured by the pyrheliometer. However. higher scattering angles also leads to a lower slope of the curve that describes the circumsolar radiation according with the scattering angle. In this way. the model will allows to predict the total DNI that reaches CSP systems depending on the atmospheric conditions. and particularly during events of aerosols such as. for example. high concentrations of desert dust in the atmosphere.,True,Boy14OUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edgar_Fm_Abreu/publication/317721574_Direct_Normal_Irradiance_and_circumsolar_radiation_modelling_measurement_and_impact_on_Concentrating_Solar_Power/links/594a851b0f7e9ba3beafa2f8/Direct-Normal-Irradiance-and-circumsolar-radiation-modelling-measurement-and-impact-on-Concentrating-Solar-Power.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edgar_Fm_Abreu/publication/317721574_Direct_Normal_Irradiance_and_circumsolar_radiation_modelling_measurement_and_impact_on_Concentrating_Solar_Power/links/594a851b0f7e9ba3beafa2f8/Direct-Normal-Irradiance-and-circumsolar-radiation-modelling-measurement-and-impact-on-Concentrating-Solar-Power.pdf,0,0,0

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). for example. only provides DNI forecasts from 2014. Inside the ECMWF model. the solar radiative quantities are computed by the Short Wave (SW) scheme which results from successive developments from the initial Morcrette version [1]. The same radiative code is in use by other NWP models. namely by the French limited area AROME model. which runs operationally at the Portuguese meteorological service (IPMA) for three domains (continental Portugal. Madeira and Açores) and by the non-hydrostatic research Meso-NH model [2]. In order to test and eventually improve the radiative forecasts it is important to compare the model DNI results against observed data.

This study aims at providing a complete characterization of aerosol radiative effects in different spectral ranges within the shortwave (SW) solar spectrum. For this purpose. long-term data sets of aerosol properties from six AERONET stations located in the Iberian Peninsula (southwestern Europe) have been analyzed in terms of climatological characterization and inter-annual changes.

The high precipitation events that occurred during the winter of 2009/2010 have been considered with three main goals: to analyze the main atmospheric characteristics associated with the events; to expand the understanding of the interaction between the island and the atmospheric circulations. mainly the effects of the island on the generation or intensification of orographic precipitation; and to evaluate the performance of high resolution numerical modeling in simulating and forecasting heavy precipitation events over the island.

Spain. mainly for non-precipitating. overcast and relatively homogenous water clouds. Empirical CMF showed a clear exponential dependence on experimental COD values. decreasing approximately from 0.7 for COD = 10 to 0.25 for COD = 50. In addition. these COD measurements were used as input in the LibRadtran radiative transfer code allowing the simulation of CMF values for the selected overcast cases. The modeled CMF exhibited a dependence on COD similar to the empirical CMF. but modeled values present a strong underestimation with respect to the empirical factors (mean bias of 22%). To explain this high bias. an exhaustive comparison between modeled and experimental UV erythemal irradiance (UVER) data was performed. The comparison revealed that the radiative transfer simulations were 8% higher than the observations for clear-sky conditions. The rest of the bias (~14%) may be attributed to the substantial underestimation of modeled UVER with respect to experimental UVER under overcast conditions. although the correlation between both dataset was high (R2 ~ 0.93).

Intended as a text for advanced undergraduates and as a reference for practicing engineers. the book uses the physics of flows in porous materials to tie together a wide variety of important issues from such fields as biomedical engineering. energy conversion. civil engineering. electronics. chemical engineering. and environmental engineering. Thus. for example. flows of water and oil through porous ground play a central role in energy exploration and recovery (oil wells. geothermal fluids). energy conversion (effluents from refineries and power plants). and environmental engineering (leachates from waste repositories). Similarly. the demands of miniaturization in electronics and in biomedical applications are driving research into the flow of heat and fluids through small-scale porous media (heat exchangers. filters. gas exchangers). Filters. catalytic converters. the drying of stored grains. and a myriad of other applications involve flows through porous media. By providing a unified theoretical framework that includes not only the traditional homogeneous and isotropic media but also models in which the assumptions of representative elemental volumes or global thermal equilibrium fail. the book provides practicing engineers the tools they need to analyze complex situations that arise in practice.

1196582,Constructal theory of flow architecture of the lungs,2004,Antonio Heitor Reis and Antonio Ferreira Miguel and M Aydin,31,Medical Physics,5,1135-1140,American Association of Physicists in Medicine,Here we explain the reasons why we have a bronchial tree with 23 levels of bifurcation. Based on Bejan's Constructal Principle we found that the best oxygen access to the alveolar tissues as well as carbon dioxide removal is provided by a flow structure composed of ducts with 23 levels of bifurcation (bronchial tree) that ends with spaces (alveolar sacs) from where oxygen diffuses into the tissues. The model delivers the dimensions of the alveolar sac. the total length of the airways. the total alveolar surface area. and the total resistance to oxygen transport in the respiratory tree. A constructal law also emerges: the length defined by the ratio of the square of the airway diameter to its length is constant for all individuals of the same species and is related to the characteristics of the space allocated to the respiratory process and determines univocally the branching level of the respiratory tree.,True,5RoNSnIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,159,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.1705443,11459560927093307178,/scholar?cites=11459560927093307178,,http://home.uevora.pt/~ahr/C.pdf,0,0,0

Earlier applications of the constructal law recommended it as a self-standing law that is distinct from the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper. we develop a model of heat transport on the earth surface that accounts for the solar and terrestrial radiation as the heat source and heat sink and with natural convection loops as the transport mechanism. In the first part of the paper. the constructal law is invoked to optimize the latitude of the boundary between the Hadley and the Ferrel cells. and the boundary between the Ferrel and the Polar cells.

We show that this observational result may be understood in the light of the Constructal Law (Bejan. 1997). A model of wave run-up and run-down along the beachface (swash) was developed to account for superficial flows together with flows through the porous sand bed of average porosity 0.35. the permeability of which may be related to grain diameter and sphericity (0.9 for sand grains) through the Kozeny–Carmán equation. Then. by using the Constructal Law. we minimized the time for completing a swash cycle. under fixed wave height and sand grain diameter.

We show that particle agglomeration begins in spherical shape and switches to needle-shaped agglomeration. which performs best as a particle collector at long times. The shape of the needle depends on the dipolar moment of the particles. while the critical number of particles prior to switching to needle shape does not depend on the particle properties. We also show how constructal theory leads to the design of air-cleaning devices that achieve maximum performance per unit volume. under the imposed global constrains.

This feature is modelled as convection loops. and added to the earth model as a heat engine heated by the Sun and cooled by the background. It is shown that the dissipation of the power produced by the earth engine can be maximized by selecting the proper balance between the hot and cold zones of the Earth. and by optimizing the thermal conductance of the circulation loops.

Based on Bejan's Constructal Principle we found that the best oxygen access to the alveolar tissues as well as carbon dioxide removal is provided by a flow structure composed of ducts with 23 levels of bifurcation (bronchial tree) that ends with spaces (alveolar sacs) from where oxygen diffuses into the tissues. The model delivers the dimensions of the alveolar sac. the total length of the airways. the total alveolar surface area. and the total resistance to oxygen transport in the respiratory tree. A constructal law also emerges: the length defined by the ratio of the square of the airway diameter to its length is constant for all individuals of the same species and is related to the characteristics of the space allocated to the respiratory process and determines univocally the branching level of the respiratory tree.,True,FwNcf8UAAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC,159,https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.1705443,11459560927093307178,/scholar?cites=11459560927093307178,,http://home.uevora.pt/~ahr/C.pdf,0,0,0

1196613,Constructal law and the unifying principle of design,2012,L Rocha and S Lorente and A Miguel and A Bejan,,,,,Springer,Design happens everywhere. whether in animate objects (eg. dendritic lung structures. bacterial colonies. and corals). inanimate patterns (river basins. beach slope. and dendritic crystals). social dynamics (pedestrian traffic flows). or engineered systems (heat dissipation in electronic circuitry). This “design in nature” often takes on remarkably similar patterns. which can be explained under one unifying Constructal Law. This book explores the unifying power of the Constructal Law and its applications in all domains of design generation and evolution. ranging from biology and geophysics to globalization. energy. sustainability. and security. The Constructal Law accounts for the universal tendency of flow systems to morph into evolving configurations that provide greater and easier access over time. The Constructal Law resolves the many and contradictory ad hoc statements of “optimality”. end design. and destiny in nature. such as minimum and maximum entropy production and minimum and maximum flow resistance. and also explains the designs that are observed and copied in biomimetics. Constructal Law and the Unifying Principle of Design covers the fundamentals of Constructal Theory and Design. as well as presenting a variety of state-of-the-art applications.

We show that particle agglomeration begins in spherical shape and switches to needle-shaped agglomeration. which performs best as a particle collector at long times. The shape of the needle depends on the dipolar moment of the particles. while the critical number of particles prior to switching to needle shape does not depend on the particle properties. We also show how constructal theory leads to the design of air-cleaning devices that achieve maximum performance per unit volume. under the imposed global constrains.

1196628,The physics principle of the generation of flow configuration,2011,António F Miguel,8,Physics of Life Review,,243-245,ELSEVIER,Design – configuration. architecture. shape. structure. pattern. rhythm – is omnipresent in nature [1–4]. The vast majority of natural systems are non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. containing internal flows (e.g.. mass. heat. charges. goods. etc.) with a defined configuration. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved in these systems as it flows through them [5]. while the second law determines that the entropy outflow must be greater than the entropy inflow. The constructal law [5] complements the other two by stating that. for a system to persist. configuration must morph (evolve) towards designs that make it easier for currents to flow. This last self-standing law of design indicates that the acquisition of configuration is a dynamic process that guides and facilitates flowing.,True,FwNcf8UAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC,35,https://dspace.uevora.pt/rdpc/handle/10174/3289,14013537449083747895,/scholar?cites=14013537449083747895,,,0,0,0

Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,5,727-731,North-Holland,Pattern formation and self-organization are phenomena that occur across the board. in animate and inanimate systems. In this paper. we rely on the constructal law to explain the generation of patterns (shapes. structures) in aggregates of organisms–pedestrian crowds and stony corals. In pedestrian crowds a variety of patterns are often observed. from ‘chaotic’ appearances to spontaneous organization in lanes of uniform walking direction. Stony corals and other organisms also present intraspecific variability in shape. We show that flow systems develop in time patterns which provide easier access to the nutrients and space. within a set of constraints imposed by each situation. Flow systems have the freedom to morph their shape in search for architectures that allows them to have greater access to the space that they inhabit.

1196643,The role of synthetic fuels for a carbon neutral economy,2017,Rui Namorado Rosa,3,C—Journal of Carbon Research,2,11,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Fossil fuels depletion and increasing environmental impacts arising from their use call for seeking growing supplies from renewable and nuclear primary energy sources. However. it is necessary to simultaneously attend to both the electrical power needs and the specificities of the transport and industrial sector requirements. A major question posed by the shift away from traditional fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources lies in matching the power demand with the daily and seasonal oscillation and the intermittency of these natural energy fluxes. Huge energy storage requirements become necessary or otherwise the decline of the power factor of both the renewable and conventional generation would mean loss of resources. On the other hand. liquid and gaseous fuels. for which there is vast storage and distribution capacity available. appear essential to supply the transport sector for a very long time ahead. besides their domestic and industrial roles. Within this context. the present assessment suggests that proven technologies and sound tested principles are available to develop an integrated energy system. relying on synthetic fuels. These would incorporate carbon capture and utilization in a closed carbon cycle. progressively relying mostly on solar and/or nuclear primary sources. providing both electric power and gaseous/liquid hydrocarbon fuels. having ample storage capacity. and able to timely satisfy all forms of energy demand.

ISBN:972-9039-75-5,Landscape shape is a result of the combined action of driving forces acting upon the tectonic plates and planetary fluids. The plates’ deformation and faulting. the resistive flow of the atmosphere in its circulation and of the water in its cycle. have all shaped the landforms. either by moving the crust or by removing and depositing crust material. at different rates over long time scales.“External” forcing by the impact of asteroids has also imprinted their marks. Geomorphologic evolution registers variable rates and is punctuated by large scale events. It is therefore a very complex process to be understood. given the very short period and the very limited geographical extent of the direct observation one can rely on. Satellite observation has lately provided an additional very powerful observational tool. Geomorphology for most of the 20th century focused on the role of climate. and climate change has become one of the most important research areas today. This concern is deeply rooted in the geological. geochemical and geophysical evidences and in the progresses achieved so far in the understanding of earth’s paleoclimate.

Despite considerable work on advanced multivariable controllers for MIMO systems. multiloop proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers remain the standard for many industries because of their adequate performance with most simple. failure tolerant. and easy to understand structure. In a multiloop system. once a control structure is fixed. control performance is then determined mainly by tuning each multiple single-loop PID controller. However. because the interactions that exist between the control loops make the proper tuning of the multiloop PID controllers quite difficult. only a relatively few tuning methods are available to the multiloop PID controllers and most of them require nonanalytical forms with complex iterative steps (Loh et al.. 1993; Luyben. 1986; Skogestad and Morari. 1989). The analytical tuning rule is very attractive. with respect to its practicality. but the mathematical complexity attributed to the loop interactions has mainly prevented the analytical approach to the multiloop systems.In this article. we propose an analytical design method for the multiloop PID controllers to give desired closed-loop responses by extending the generalized IMC–PID method for single input/single output (SISO) systems (Lee et al.. 1998) to MIMO systems.

Ltd,The liquefaction of natural gas (NG) in a mixed refrigerant (MR) system is an energy‐demanding process. Much energy is wasted because of its irreversibilities and its nonoptimal execution. The most important factors affecting this process's performance are the refrigerant's composition and flow rate. the suction and evaporation pressures. and the extent of refrigerant vaporization. They should be adjusted to optimize the overall operation. The adjustment of one of these variables will affect the other because of their highly nonlinear interactions. This work reports the optimization of a single MR (SMR) process of NG liquefaction. The SMR process was modeled in the UniSim Design commercial process plant simulator. and the model was optimized for compression energy with nonlinear programming (NLP) while satisfying constraints.

However. from thermodynamics point of view. these processes are still far away from their maximum achievable energy efficiency due to nonoptimal execution of the design variables. Therefore. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) production is considered as one of the energy-intensive cryogenic industries. In this context. this study examines a single-solution-based Vortex Search (VS) approach to find the optimal design variables corresponding to minimal energy consumption for LNG processes. ie. C3MR and SMR. The LNG processes are simulated using Aspen Hysys and then linked with VS algorithm. which is coded in MATLAB. The results indicated that the SMR process is a potential process for offshore sites that can liquefy natural gas with 16.1% less energy consumption compared with the published base case. Whereas. for onshore LNG production. the energy consumption for the C3MR process is reduced up to 27.8% when compared with the previously published base case. The optimal designs of the SMR and C3MR processes are also found via distinctive well-established optimization approaches (ie. genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization) and their performance is compared with that of the VS methodology.

This study examined the environmentally benign separation of zirconium tetrachloride (ZrCl 4) and hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl 4) for nuclear power reactor applications through extractive distillation using a NaCl-KCl molten salt mixture. The vapor–liquid equilibrium behavior of ZrCl 4 and HfCl 4 over the molten salt system was correlated with Raoult’s law. The molten salt-based extractive distillation column was designed optimally using a rigorous commercial simulator for the feasible separation of ZrCl 4 and HfCl 4. The molten salt-based extractive distillation approach has many potential advantages for the commercial separation of ZrCl 4 and HfCl 4 compared to the conventional distillation because of its milder temperatures and pressure conditions. smaller number of required separation trays in the column. and lower energy requirement for separation. while still taking the advantage of environmentally benign feature by distillation. A heat-pump-assisted configuration was also explored to improve the energy efficiency of the extractive distillation process. The proposed enhanced configuration reduced the energy requirement drastically. Extractive distillation can be a promising option competing with the existing extraction-based separation process for zirconium purification for nuclear power reactor applications.

Normally. one has to resort to using sequential updating methods such as the particle filtering approach for effective prognosis and lumen maintenance life prediction of LEDs because of their long lifetime and reliability. However. the performance of the particle filter severely depends on the selection of the initial parameters. Moreover. it cannot deal with situations where there is missing data due to intermittent sensor failure or malfunction.

Stability and performance of a system can be inferred from the evolution of statistical characteristic of system states with random parameters.

For robust manufacturing and reliability of these parts. solving the warpage problem is key. While current finite element methodologies can provide some insights at the design stage. these simulations are only as accurate as the inputs such as the material properties and the stress-free temperatures.

The decrease in thickness reduces the flexural rigidity of the package. resulting in a warpage challenge that must be addressed in the design phase for a high yield assembly process and good reliability. Finite element analysis (FEA) is a useful tool to predict warpage during the design process. However. computational time can be too long. especially when the models are large and the parametric studies are extensive. In this work. the FEA model is replaced with a neural network (NN) to speed up the analysis time. Results show that a single layer NN can replace the high fidelity FEA models for package warpage predictions with good accuracy and significant speed up of more than three orders of magnitude.

The most important factors affecting this process's performance are the refrigerant's composition and flow rate. the suction and evaporation pressures. and the extent of refrigerant vaporization. They should be adjusted to optimize the overall operation. The adjustment of one of these variables will affect the other because of their highly nonlinear interactions. This work reports the optimization of a single MR (SMR) process of NG liquefaction. The SMR process was modeled in the UniSim Design commercial process plant simulator. and the model was optimized for compression energy with nonlinear programming (NLP) while satisfying constraints.

Several metabolic engineering fermentation strategies to enhance the production of 2.3-BDO were developed. However. the recovery of 2.3-BDO from its fermentation broth remains a challenge due to its low concentration and its solubility in water and other components. Thus. a cost-effective recovery process is required to deliver the required purity of 2.3-BDO. This paper presents a new process development and techno-economic analysis for 2.3-BDO purification from a fermentation broth. Conventional distillation and hybrid extraction-distillation (HED) processes are proposed in this study with detailed optimization and economic analysis. Particularly. a systematic solvent selection method was successfully implemented to determine a good solvent for the proposed HED configuration based on numerous experimental data obtained with each solvent candidate. NRTL and UNIQUAC property methods were evaluated to obtain binary interaction parameters of 2.3-BDO through rigorous Aspen Plus regression and validated using experimental data. Total annual cost (TAC)-based optimization was performed for each proposed configuration.

However. from thermodynamics point of view. these processes are still far away from their maximum achievable energy efficiency due to nonoptimal execution of the design variables. Therefore. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) production is considered as one of the energy-intensive cryogenic industries. In this context. this study examines a single-solution-based Vortex Search (VS) approach to find the optimal design variables corresponding to minimal energy consumption for LNG processes. ie. C3MR and SMR. The LNG processes are simulated using Aspen Hysys and then linked with VS algorithm. which is coded in MATLAB. The results indicated that the SMR process is a potential process for offshore sites that can liquefy natural gas with 16.1% less energy consumption compared with the published base case. Whereas. for onshore LNG production. the energy consumption for the C3MR process is reduced up to 27.8% when compared with the previously published base case. The optimal designs of the SMR and C3MR processes are also found via distinctive well-established optimization approaches (ie. genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization) and their performance is compared with that of the VS methodology.

Considering the current energy challenges. coal-enriched countries have focused on the green utilization of coal by converting it to a clean energy source. such as synthetic natural gas (SNG). To fulfill the global clean energy demand. liquefaction is a promising and feasible approach enabling safe storage and transportation. However. the liquefaction of SNG is an energy- and cost-intensive process. primarily owing to the presence of low-boiling impurities such as hydrogen and nitrogen.

The mixed refrigerant liquefaction process is highly nonlinear owing to the involved thermodynamics that increase the computational burden of any optimization algorithm. To address the computational-burden issue and obtain the results in a reasonable time for the complex single mixed refrigerant process. an approximate surrogate model was developed using a radial basis function combined with a thin-plate spline approach. Even with the reduced model. all the results obtained were comparable with those by rigorous first-principle models.

However. from thermodynamics point of view. these processes are still far away from their maximum achievable energy efficiency due to nonoptimal execution of the design variables. Therefore. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) production is considered as one of the energy-intensive cryogenic industries. In this context. this study examines a single-solution-based Vortex Search (VS) approach to find the optimal design variables corresponding to minimal energy consumption for LNG processes. ie. C3MR and SMR. The LNG processes are simulated using Aspen Hysys and then linked with VS algorithm. which is coded in MATLAB. The results indicated that the SMR process is a potential process for offshore sites that can liquefy natural gas with 16.1% less energy consumption compared with the published base case. Whereas. for onshore LNG production. the energy consumption for the C3MR process is reduced up to 27.8% when compared with the previously published base case. The optimal designs of the SMR and C3MR processes are also found via distinctive well-established optimization approaches (ie. genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization) and their performance is compared with that of the VS methodology. The authors believe this work will greatly help the process engineers overcome the challenges relating to the energy efficiency of LNG industry. as well as other mixed refrigerant-based cryogenic processes.

For the ease of transportation and supply. liquefaction of SNG is highly desirable. In the liquefaction of SNG. efficient removal of low boiling point impurities such as hydrogen (H 2) and nitrogen (N 2) is highly desirable to lower the power of the liquefaction process. Among several separation processes. membrane-based separation exhibits the potential for the separation of low boiling point impurities at low power consumption as compared to the existing separation processes. In this study. the membrane unit was used to simulate the membrane module by using Aspen HYSYS V10 (Version 10. AspenTech. Bedford. MA. United States). The two-stage and two-step system designs of the N 2-selective membrane are utilized for SNG separation. The two-stage membrane process feasibly recovers methane (CH 4) at more than 95%(by mol) recovery with a H 2 composition of≤ 0.05% by mol. but requires a larger membrane area than a two-stage system. While maintaining the minimum internal temperature approach value of 3 C inside a cryogenic heat exchanger. the optimization of the SNG liquefaction process shows a large reduction in power consumption. Membrane-assisted removal of H 2 and N 2 for the liquefaction process exhibits the beneficial removal of H 2 before liquefaction by achieving low net specific power at 0.4010 kW· h/kg· CH4.,True,c1K4SD8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/19/5023,9431811699017657729,/scholar?cites=9431811699017657729,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/19/5023/pdf,0,0,0

Ansari and Moonyong Lee Mohd Shariq Khan and Muhammad Abdul Qyyum and Wahid Ali and Aref Wazwaz,13,energies,21,5578,MDPI,Boil-off gas (BOG) from a liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tank depends on the amount of heat leakage however. its assessment often relies on the static value of the boil-off rate (BOR) suggested by the LNG tank vendors that over/under predicts BOG generation. Thus. the impact of static BOR on BOG predictions is investigated and the results suggest that BOR is a strong function of liquid level in a tank. Total heat leakage in a tank practically remains constant. nonetheless the unequal distribution of heat in vapor and liquid gives variation in BOR. Assigning the total tank heat leak to the liquid is inappropriate since a part of heat increases vapor temperature. At the lower liquid level. BOG is under-predicted and at a higher level. it is over-predicted using static BOR. Simulation results show that BOR varies from 0.012 wt% per day for an 80% tank fill to 0.12 wt% per day at 10% tank fill.

Recovery of valuable solvents from waste photoresist strippers is. therefore. very important for thin flat transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) manufactures to reduce the production costs and protect the environment against industrial waste. In the present work. systematic laboratory-scale distillation experiments were carried out to regenerate the organic solvents from the waste photoresist stripper and determine if they are feasible to recycle for commercial TFT-LCD grade chemicals: in particular. 1-hydroxyethylpiperazine and methyl diglycol were mainly tried to retrieve.

For the ease of transportation and supply. liquefaction of SNG is highly desirable. In the liquefaction of SNG. efficient removal of low boiling point impurities such as hydrogen (H 2) and nitrogen (N 2) is highly desirable to lower the power of the liquefaction process. Among several separation processes. membrane-based separation exhibits the potential for the separation of low boiling point impurities at low power consumption as compared to the existing separation processes. In this study. the membrane unit was used to simulate the membrane module by using Aspen HYSYS V10 (Version 10. AspenTech. Bedford. MA. United States). The two-stage and two-step system designs of the N 2-selective membrane are utilized for SNG separation. The two-stage membrane process feasibly recovers methane (CH 4) at more than 95%(by mol) recovery with a H 2 composition of≤ 0.05% by mol. but requires a larger membrane area than a two-stage system. While maintaining the minimum internal temperature approach value of 3 C inside a cryogenic heat exchanger. the optimization of the SNG liquefaction process shows a large reduction in power consumption.

1196850,Energy Efficiency Improvement of Aniline Separation in Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate Production,,Riezqa Andika and Yus Donald Chaniago,,Integration of PEVs into Power Grid in Indonesia,,82,,Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is a compound that mainly used to manufacture polyurethane. one of the most versatile polymers. MDI is formed through the reaction of aniline with formaldehyde in the presence of hydrochloric acid. Aniline is an important intermediate product of MDI production because its purity determines the MDI quality. There are two ways to produce aniline; first is by heating chlorobenzene with ammonia and second is by the reduction of nitrobenzene. Nitrobenzene is the most common source of aniline production hence nitrobenzene reduction is the most widely used process in industrial scale production. To obtain good quality MDI. aniline products have to meet several specifications related to impurity contents. The process also has constraint related to tar concentration in the side stream. Fulfilling the aniline specification and process constraint. distillation is the most suitable and commonly used. However. distillation has problems with its low thermodynamic efficiency and also its requirements of high amounts energy. This study proposes a modification of advanced distillation configuration named mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) to increase the thermodynamic efficiency and reduce the energy requirements by utilizing latent heat and sensible heat. The idea is to reuse heat supply from top stream to distillation that is usually removed in condenser to reheat the bottom section.

We propose a convexification procedure relying on an efficient iterative re-weighted ℓ 1 -minimization algorithm that uses general sparsity inducing priors on the parameters of the system and marginal likelihood maximisation. Using this approach. we also show how convex constraints on the parameters can be easily added to the proposed iterative re-weighted ℓ 1 -minimization algorithm.

1196862,Linear identification of nonlinear systems: A lifting technique based on the Koopman operator,2016,Alexandre Mauroy and Jorge Goncalves,,,,6500-6505,IEEE,We exploit the key idea that nonlinear system identification is equivalent to linear identification of the so-called Koopman operator. Instead of considering nonlinear system identification in the state space. we obtain a novel linear identification technique by recasting the problem in the infinite-dimensional space of observables. This technique can be described in two main steps. In the first step. similar to a component of the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm. the data are lifted to the infinite-dimensional space and used for linear identification of the Koopman operator. In the second step. the obtained Koopman operator is “projected back” to the finite-dimensional state space. and identified to the nonlinear vector field through a linear least squares problem.

If the matrix A satisfies a rank condition. this problem has a unique. sparse solution. Here each row of A comprises one experiment consisting of input/output measurements and cannot be freely chosen. We show that if experiments are poorly designed. the rank condition may never be satisfied. resulting in multiple solutions. We discuss strategies for designing experiments such that A has the desired properties and the problem is therefore well posed. This formulation allows prior knowledge to be taken into account in the form of known nonzero entries of x. requiring fewer experiments to be performed.

These devices are used to replace or to interfere with natural pathways. Alternatively. they may be interlinked with endogenous pathways to create artificial networks of higher complexity. While these approaches have been already successful in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. the implementation of such synthetic cassettes in mammalian systems and even animals is still a major obstacle. This is mainly due to the lack of methods that reliably and efficiently transduce synthetic modules without compromising their regulation properties.To pave the way for implementation of synthetic regulation modules in mammalian systems we utilized lentiviral transduction of synthetic modules. A synthetic positive feedback loop. based on the Tetracycline regulation system was implemented in a lentiviral vector system and stably integrated in mammalian cells. This gene regulation circuit yields a bimodal expression response. Based on experimental data a mathematical model based on stochasticity was developed which matched and described the experimental findings. Modelling predicted a hysteretic expression responsewhich was verified experimentally. Thereby supporting the idea that the system is driven by stochasticity.The results presented here highlight that the combination of three independent tools/methodologies facilitate the reliable installation of synthetic gene circuits with predictable expression characteristics in mammalian cells and organisms.,True,dPnQIkEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,62,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002372,15754869167963704942,/scholar?cites=15754869167963704942,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002372,0,0,0

1196870,Constructive global analysis of hybrid systems,2000,Jorge Manuel Mendes Silva Gonçalves,,,,,,Many systems of interest are dynamic systems whose behavior is determined by the interaction of continuous and discrete dynamics. These systems typically contain variables or signals that take values from a continuous set and also variables that take values from a discrete. typically finite set. These continuous or discrete-valued variables or signals depend on independent variables such as time. which may also be continuous or discrete. Such systems are known as Hybrid Systems. Although widely used. not much is known about analysis of hybrid systems. This thesis attempts to take a step forward in understanding and developing tools to systematically analyze certain classes of hybrid systems. In particular. it focuses on a class of hybrid systems known as Piecewise Linear Systems (PLS). These are characterized by a finite number of affine linear dynamical models together with a set of rules for switching among these models. Even for simple classes of PLS. very little theoretical results are known. More precisely. one typically cannot assess a priori the guaranteed stability. robustness. and performance properties of PLS designs. Rather. any such properties are inferred from extensive computer simulations. In other words. complete and systematic analysis and design methodologies have yet - emerge. In this thesis. we develop an entirely new constructive global analysis methodology for PLS. This methodology consists in inferring global properties of PLS solely by studying their behavior at switching surfaces associated with PLS.

Whilst the case for only two objects can be solved globally. when multiple objects are considered usually iterative methods are used. In practice the iterative methods perform well if the relative transformations between any pair of objects are free of noise. However. if only noisy relative transformations are available (eg due to missing data or wrong correspondences) the iterative methods may fail. Based on the observation that the underlying noise-free transformations can be retrieved from the null space of a matrix that can directly be obtained from pairwise alignments. this paper presents a novel method for the synchronisation of pairwise transformations such that they are transitively consistent.

Japan,This study examines the optimal operation of the dual mixed refrigerant (DMR) process by steady-state optimality analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to discover the optimizing variable that can maintain the DMR process in the optimal compressor duty. First. a rigorous dynamic simulation of the DMR process was built in the Aspen Hysys interface. Second. numerous step tests on the refrigerant ow rate were conducted and the resulting total compressor duty was recorded. The steady-state operational map that correlates the refrigerant ow rate and total compressor duty was drawn to locate the optimal operation region of the DMR process. The map also contains information on the state variables in the DMR process that in particular combinations. will allow the process to be operated at the optimal compressor duty. The comprehensive information on the map makes it an excellent tool for selecting the proper optimizing variable for the DMR process. The resulting steady-state optimality map suggests that. when the ow rate ratio of the two refrigerants (WMR/CMR ratio) is kept constant. the operational of DMR process will remain within optimal region. This suggests that the WMR/CMR ratio is the proper optimizing variable for the DMR process.

Usually biodiesel has these two properties in opposing qualities. Palm stearin biodiesel contains high levels of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in the form of 63% palmitic acid methyl ester. Thus this type of biodiesel has bad cold flow properties and good oxidation stability. On the other hand. soybean biodiesel has a high level of unsaturated FAME in the form of 53% linoleic acid methyl ester. Hence it has good cold flow properties whereas the oxidation stability is bad. According to SNI 7182: 2015 the maximum temperature of cloud point is 18 C and minimum value for oxidation stability is 8 hours. The cloud point of palm stearin biodiesel (PSB) can be lowered to below 18 C. while keeping the oxidation stability at 8 hours. by blending it with soybean biodiesel (SB). In this experiment. cold flow properties and oxidation stability of PSB are 17.4 C and 17 hours respectively while for the cold flow properties of SB are 0.8 C and oxidation stability 4.5 hours. The blending was done continuously for 15 minutes with variations in PSB/SB mass ratio 97.5: 2.5. 95: 5. 92.5: 7.5 and 90: 10. The cloud point and oxidation stability were analyzed using ASTM D 5773 and EN 15751 respectively. The results showed that by lowering the mass fraction of PSB. the biodiesel blend would have lower values for cloud point while still having good properties in term of oxidation stability. In this study the PSB/SB ratio that resulted in the lowest cold flow property ie 16.8 C was 90: 10 with 8.53 hours of oxidation stability,True,VCYOv14AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,2,http://ijop.id/index.php/ijop/article/view/15,16034614865967470036,/scholar?cites=16034614865967470036,,http://ijop.id/index.php/ijop/article/download/15/12,0,0,0

In this work. the effect of adding this hybrid material to vulcanization kinetics of sorghum fibers-filled natural rubber was studied. The rubber compounds were added with hybrid material at various loadings. ie. zero to two phr and thus cured at three different temperatures. ie. 130. 140. and 150 C. The molecular behaviors due to the hybrid addition were investigated by Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The rheological phenomena of the rubber compounds were studied by performing torque analysis in moving die rheometer. The obtained data were utilized to develop the thermodynamic modeling. The compatibility of sorghum fibers-natural rubber blends in the presence of starch-modified natural rubber were characterized using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). FTIR results show noticeable changes in the peak intensity of particular functional groups from rubber and natural fiber as evidence of molecular interaction enhancements between rubber and natural fibers caused by incorporating the starch-modified natural rubber coupling agent to rubber-natural fiber blends. The curing time for these blends was reduced with lower required activation energy. SEM images show no visible gaps in morphology between natural rubber and the filler indicating that the addition of hybrid material to the blends also improves the compatibility between the fibers and the rubber matrix.

Japan,Distillation is a common energy-intensive process. Accordingly. it is the rst process to be addressed to improve the energy e ciency over both the short-and long-term. Recent studies and industrial applications have proven that advanced process integration and process intensi cation techniques such as the use of a thermally coupled distillation sequence (TCDS) and a dividing wall column (DWC) require the lowest amount of energy for the separation of mixtures into pure product streams. This paper reviews some energy-e cient distillation technologies that can be used in a retro t design. The research on and implementation of retro ts using a TCDS and DWC are reviewed. This report proposes coupled schemes as alternatives to using a Petlyuk column that do not have the classical problem of controlling the vapor transfer from one column to another and have not previously been proposed for retro ts. These schemes are expected to make signi cant contributions to improving the energy e ciency and mitigating CO2 emission in the retro tting of distillation systems.

Furfural was listed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory as one of the top 30 potential chemicals arising from biomass. However. the current production of furfural is energy intensive and uses inefficient technology. Thus. a hybrid purification process that combines extraction and distillation to produce furfural from lignocellulosic biomass was considered and investigated in detail to improve the process efficiency. This effective hybrid process depends on the extracting solvent. which was selected based on a comprehensive procedure that ranged from solvent screening to complete process design. Various solvents were first evaluated in terms of their extraction ability. Then. the most promising solvents were selected to study the separation feasibility. Eventually. processes that used the three best solvents (toluene. benzene. and butyl chloride) were designed and optimized in detail using Aspen Plus. Sustainability analysis was performed to evaluate these processes in terms of their energy requirements. total annual costs (TAC). and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The results showed that butyl chloride was the most suitable solvent for the hybrid furfural process because it could save 44.7% of the TAC while reducing the CO2 emissions by 45.5% compared to the toluene process.

Several metabolic engineering fermentation strategies to enhance the production of 2.3-BDO were developed. However. the recovery of 2.3-BDO from its fermentation broth remains a challenge due to its low concentration and its solubility in water and other components. Thus. a cost-effective recovery process is required to deliver the required purity of 2.3-BDO. This paper presents a new process development and techno-economic analysis for 2.3-BDO purification from a fermentation broth. Conventional distillation and hybrid extraction-distillation (HED) processes are proposed in this study with detailed optimization and economic analysis. Particularly. a systematic solvent selection method was successfully implemented to determine a good solvent for the proposed HED configuration based on numerous experimental data obtained with each solvent candidate.

1196949,Synchronous electrical machines,1973,B Chalmers and R Magureanu,,,,,,Brushless synchronous electric machines are described in which the rotor is excited by rectifying ac induced in a rotor winding. Current flowing in the stator winding sets up a magnetic field with a main component and a subsiduary component. In operation the rotor rotates at the speed of the main component and the ac which is rectified. is induced by the subsiduary component. The subsiduary component may be set up for example by a stator-rotor air-gap whose permeance varies with angular position or by supplying the stator from a non-sinusiodal supply. but an additional stator winding is not required.,True,Ju6hBAwAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,11,https://patents.google.com/patent/US3757182A/en,2507013418158207745,/scholar?cites=2507013418158207745,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/96/cf/d5/326d04fcc93aa7/US3757182.pdf,0,0,0

Such a construction has a few advantages: it allows for better sealing. increasing resistance to heavy operating conditions such as humidity. dust. explosive gas. vibration etc. As a disadvantage. in case of coil defection at this motor type. as the coil is not available at both ends of the stator as in normal motors. extraction of the defective coils in order to replace them impose major constructive difficulties. Therefore. the problem is to find a method to extract the ferromagnetic stator core with its windings and insert it back in its place after rewinding and coating. This paper presents two novel constructive solutions: the first solution represents a device for the extraction of the ferromagnetic core from the housing with the purpose of rewinding. and the second is a device for pressing the ferromagnetic core back in its housing once it’s repaired. The two devices have been designed in order to allow the repair of small power electrical motors that have a single removable bearing shield …,True,oOHUgz8AAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,4,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1053.4129&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1724030428357134015,/scholar?cites=1724030428357134015,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1053.4129&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1196984,Dual reciprocity boundary element method,2012,Paul William Partridge and Carlos Alberto Brebbia,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,"The boundary element method (BEM) is now a well-established numerical technique which provides an efficient alternative to the prevailing finite difference and finite element methods for the solution of a wide range of engineering problems. The main advantage of the BEM is its unique ability to provide a complete problem solution in terms of boundary values only. with substantial savings in computer time and data preparation effort. An initial restriction of the BEM was that the fundamental solution to the original partial differential equation was required in order to obtain an equivalent boundary in tegral equation. Another was that non-homogeneous terms accounting for effects such as distributed loads were included in the formulation by means of domain integrals. thus making the technique lose the attraction of its"" boundary-only"" character. Many different approaches have been developed to overcome these problems. It is our opinion that the most successful so far is the dual reciprocity method (DRM). which is the subject matter of this book. The basic idea behind this approach is to employ a fundamental solution corresponding to a simpler equation and to treat the remaining terms. as well as other non-homogeneous terms in the original equation. through a procedure which involves a series expansion using global approximating functions and the application of reciprocity principles.",True,-Vwa2LoAAAAJ:ijdKiLOsEJMC,1456,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=NLjwCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP14&dq=info:rD06K0M6358J:scholar.google.com&ots=bezR9tqIse&sig=JvG2yP3YAzSU0fcbEb_ClbNytu4,11519990431999475116,/scholar?cites=11519990431999475116,,,0,0,0

The book explains the fundamentals of probabilistic processes. the theory or analysis of sea states. and the random-vibration approach to structural response. The text describes the hydrodynamics of water waves. wave forecasting. and the statistical parameters associated with sea-states. The investigator can use Morison's equation to calculate the impact of wave forces acting on slender members such as on lattice-type structures. Or he can employ the diffraction theory to calculate wave forces acting on large-diameter bodies such as concrete gravity-type structures. Other environmental forces he should be concerned with are the effects of currents and winds. The book examines the theory of vibration (including the spectral approach). the theory of vibration on multi-degree-of-freedom structures. matrix analysis of structural response. problems of fatigue. and soil-structure interaction. The book notes the importance of the method of analysis used. with emphasis on the following: dynamic analysis. frequency domain. and linearization of drag. Two types of analysis follow linearization of drag: deterministic analysis (applied in a series of design waves which uses the long-term exceedance diagram for fatigue); or probabilistic analysis (used to study the behavior of the structure during the extreme design storm and its long term behavior for a range of sea states).

Although these integrals do not introduce any new unknowns they detract from the elegance of the formulation and affect the efficiency of the method as integrations over the whole volume are required. Hence. a substantial amount of research has been carried out to find a general and efficient method of transforming volume integrals into equivalent boundary ones.The approaches which have so far been proposed can be divided into three groups.

The DRBEM. recently applied to the solution of problems governed by parabolic and hyperbolic equations. consists in the transformation of the differential equation into an integral equation involving boundary integrals only. the solution of which is achieved by employing a standard boundary element discretization coupled with a two-level finite difference time integration scheme. Contrary to previous formulations for the diffusion equation. the dual reciprocity BEM utilizes the well-known fundamental solution to Laplace's equation. which is space-dependent only.

These techniques are known under different names. such as integral equations. boundary integral methods. etc. and Rizzor seems to have been the first to have used them in classical elastostatics. the work being continued by Cruse2p3 who extended it to elastodynamics both of them basing their work on the socalled direct integral formulation. as opposed to the indirect formulation which was used by Tomlin4 to solve the problem of zoned anisotropic media. All these papers are based on using constant values for the displacements and tractions over part of the boundary.Lachat. 5 following the work of the Southampton University group. developed a technique which allowed for variations of displacements and tractions along parts of the boundary surface or ‘elements’ and hence the term ‘boundary elements’ was adopted to define this particular method. 6 The idea of using interpolation functions to define the variables along these elements is important as it allows for the combination of finite and boundary element regions without any loss of continuity.

The converse piezoelectric effect is produced by an externally applied electric field. which changes the electric polarization. which in turn produces an elastic strain. The most known piezoelectric material is quartz crystal. Many other natural crystalline solids. as Rochelle salt. ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. lithium sulfate. and tourmaline as well as some man-made crystal as gallium orthophosphate. aluminium nitride (AlN). and langasite exhibit piezoelectric properties. A lot of artificial ceramics as barium titanate. lead titanate. lead zirconate titanate (PZT). potassium niobate. lithium niobate. and lithium tantalite have similar properties.The most known technical application is the piezoelectric transducer. In the last years electromechanical AlN resonators emerged as a very efficient solution for mobile communications filters due to the possibility to be integrated at a relatively low cost together with CMOS circuits in systems on a chip and systems in a package. In most applications the piezoelectric devices have a linear behaviour.

Roum. Sci. Techn.–Électrotechn. et Énerg,3,267-276,,The paper proposes a new procedure for magnetic field computation in multiply connected ferromagnetic domains. The magnetic field in ferromagnetic bodies is computed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with Dirichlet boundary conditions and the vector potential normal derivative is obtained. This becomes the boundary condition for the Boundary Element Method (BEM) applied in free space. from which the new value of the vector potential results. The relative high permeability of the ferromagnetic bodies insures the convergence of the procedure.

Applying the fixed-point polarization method to the nonlinear eddy-current field problem. with the magnetization dependent on magnetic induction and on temperature. allows the field computation to be performed for each harmonic separately. Since the fictitious permeability can be chosen to be everywhere that of free space. the matrices of the linear systems to be solved at each iteration remain unchanged even when the nonlinear characteristic changes with the temperature. A simple integral equation is used to compute the eddy currents. the inversion of the matrices corresponding to the harmonics being performed only once. before starting the iterative process.

Direct online start-up and pull-up torque of rather high value represent two of the imposed requirements. Three different structures are analyzed. which involve deep bars. magnetic wedges and double cage respectively. The proposed solution advances a new rotor structure with two different rotor cages. The first cage acts mainly during start-up and is made of iron with both electric and magnetic properties. The second one is made of copper and represents the main rotor winding. It has a particular cross-section of the bars in order to carry into effect the required constraints both during start-up and steady-state.

The mathematical model of an electric machine represents all the equations that describe the relationships between electromagnetic torque and the main electrical and mechanical quantities.The theory of electrical machines. and particularly of induction machine. has mathematical models with distributed parameters and with concentrated parameters respectively. The first mentioned models start with the cognition of the magnetic field of the machine components. Their most important advantages consist in the high generality degree and accuracy. However. two major disadvantages have to be mentioned. On one hand. the computing time is rather high. which somehow discountenance their use for the real-time control. On the other hand. the distributed parameters models do not take into consideration the influence of the temperature variation or mechanical processing upon the material properties. which can vary up to 25% in comparison to the initial state.

Wind power is one of the renewable energy power sources what help in reducing the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Various schemes for generating electricity from the wind have been proposed (Rim & Krishan. 1994). Wind power requires some special electric generator to work under continuously variable speed. In this context. the Switched Reluctance Generator (SRG) is investigated for to maximize wind power efficiency. This machine is robust. easy to construct and to maintain. In many aspects this kind of machine. now available. works better than others like the asynchronous machine. The absence of permanent magnets in the stator and windings in the rotor; low manufacturing costs; low maintenance; robustness; reliability; high efficiency; increased power density are some advantages of SRG side by side with a large range of operational speed. Despite they are somewhat noisy and its control is essentially non linear the SRG was largely benefited with the recent advances on power electronics and micro processing. Torque. current and voltage ripples are inherent to the SRG. but the modern power electronic minimized these disadvantages.

The open loop control type eliminates the need for feedback sensors. and since the cost reduction is a continuous demand in industrial applications. the open loop stepper motors remain suitable in many practical application fields. The main disadvantage of the open loop control mode is the steps lost followed by the motor stall. The proposed method estimates in real-time the motor speed. based on motor currents and voltages measurements. The estimated speed is compared with the speed command. and stall error protection is signalized if the error exceeds a certain range.

The converse piezoelectric effect is produced by an externally applied electric field. which changes the electric polarization. which in turn produces an elastic strain. The most known piezoelectric material is quartz crystal. Many other natural crystalline solids. as Rochelle salt. ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. lithium sulfate. and tourmaline as well as some man-made crystal as gallium orthophosphate. aluminium nitride (AlN). and langasite exhibit piezoelectric properties. A lot of artificial ceramics as barium titanate. lead titanate. lead zirconate titanate (PZT). potassium niobate. lithium niobate. and lithium tantalite have similar properties.The most known technical application is the piezoelectric transducer. In the last years electromechanical AlN resonators emerged as a very efficient solution for mobile communications filters due to the possibility to be integrated at a relatively low cost together with CMOS circuits in systems on a chip and systems in a package. In most applications the piezoelectric devices have a linear behaviour.

An efficient iterative integral technique is proposed. where the material nonlinearity is treated by the polarization method. with the magnetic field determined at each iteration by superposing the contributions of the given electric currents and the polarizations. This computation technique has great advantages over the finite element based procedures. namely. the change in the rotor position does not require the construction of a new discretization mesh. very small airgaps can be taken into consideration without increasing the amount of computation. and the calculated magnetic field in the air is divergenceless and curlless. thus eliminating the introduction of spurious forces.

We tested an original method for finding the efficiency of motion along a pre-specified path. Two mathematical models: the classic point-to-point trajectory planning and the interpolation model for the efficiency of the energy conversion process provide the data for energy cost estimation. First. the interpolation model was built using the electric drive actuator's data specifications. These data are the torque. speed. and efficiency for scattered steady-state operation points. The interpolation model builds the efficiency surface vs. torque and speed. which passes through all specification points of the actuator. If the required trajectory is superposed on the efficiency surface. we can find the incremental values of the efficiency which correspond to trajectories speed and torque. These quantities are necessary and sufficient for energy cost estimation of the motion along the desired trajectory.

The analysis is carried out by means of experiments performed with and without injecting a pulverized cerium nitrate additive in the combustion air. The experimental results show that significant reductions of pollutants and fuel consumption have been achieved by injecting the cerium nitrate additive. The additive utilization reduces the quantity of nitric oxides because the combustion with additives is performed with less excess air coefficient. The excess air coefficient reduction has been obtained with a reduction of oxygen concentration from about 7.1% to about 4.3% in the dry flue gas.

For this reason. it is a permanent research theme for those involved in cardiology. especially as this type of disease is chronic and should be monitored periodically and kept under observation. Methods. systems for monitoring patients with such diseases require time and a great deal of human and financial effort. Patient monitoring systems. especially nonhospitalized. are becoming increasingly used and can provide a solution to problems that arise among the population. especially among the elderly. These systems have the advantage of real-time transmission of vital parameters and. when necessary. effective treatment and rapid medical intervention. reducing health care costs [1]. Preventing and observing these types of illness requires monitoring of vital parameters such as blood pressure (TA). heart rate (Pulse). blood oxygen concentration (SpO2). etc. The article proposes both the analysis and simulation of the functioning of a vital parameter monitoring system and the modeling of its electrical characteristics based on a complete set of measurements. The data acquisition system is designed to determine output voltage. current and power consumed with great accuracy.

Indeed. Pcs are excellent candidates in these fields due to their strong absorbance in the NIR region and high chemical and photo-stability. In particular. this is mostly relevant for their in vivo activation in deeper tissular regions. However. most Pcs present two major limitations. ie. a strong tendency to aggregate and a low water-solubility. In order to overcome these issues. both chemical tuning and pharmaceutical formulation combined with tumor targeting strategies were applied. These aspects will be developed in this review for the most extensively studied Pcs during the last 25 years. ie.. aluminium-. zinc-and silicon-based Pcs.

With these advances. the site density can be increased to levels that support high current densities. One approach is to build a 3D. molecular polymer redox layer on the electrode surfaces.[5] The polymer redox layer includes a molecular catalyst. and this structure results in full access to all species (electrons. protons. and substrates) with increased reaction rates. In our previous studies.[1. 5. 6] we proposed a polymer redox film having a nonnoble-metal complex impregnated with Nafion as a new cathode catalyst layer for PEMFCs. In particular. a non-noble-metal catalyst (metal porphyrins) binds with the sulfonic acid sites of Nafion to form a 3D molecular catalyst. and the polymer redox film is attached to the electrode surface. In the above system. the electrons are transported from the electrode through the catalytic sites. whereas the protons/oxygen atoms migrate along with the hydrophilic domains of Nafion.

The equilibrium binding constant (Kb) and the number of binding sites (n) per surfactant monomer were obtained from Scatchard plots. The change in free energy of binding. and the change in free energy of dissociation of bound complex per binding site were calculated from Kb. It is proposed that ethanol stabilizes the surfactant monomers when compared with hydrophobic hydration and hence enhances hydrophobic binding. Kb values suggest that the binding is driven largely by favourable entropic contribution moderated primarily by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The entropic. hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interaction effects are suggested to go through multiple equilibria steps. For CTAB the results indicate preferential electrostatic interaction between electron rich phenanthroline ligands of the metal complex and the cationic ammonium head group over hydrophobic interaction.,True,4AVI4Y8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,4,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijs/article/view/32239,722784487528947704,/scholar?cites=722784487528947704,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ijs/article/view/32239/32102,0,0,0

Copper (II) and Nickel (II) complexes of β–diketones in which R1= C6H5 and R2= C6H5 (dbm). R2= CH3 (bza) R2= CF3 (tfpbd) and R1= C4H3S. R2= CF3 (tta) were synthesised and characterised using UV.

The probable influence of the substituents on the kinetics and mechanisms of formation of the complexes were investigated with the aid of a Thermostated Schimadu 1800 uv-visible spectrophotometer. The reactions were studied at wavelengths characteristics of each complex. Results show the six coordinate copper (II) and nickel (II) complexes have probable distorted octahedral geometry while the four coordinate Ni (dbm) 2 is tetrahedral. The kinetics data suggests an influence of the diketonate substituents on the copper (II) and nickel (II) complexes in solution is in the order C6H5> CH3> CF3> C4H3S and CF3> C6H5> CH3> C4H3S respectively. Solvent influence (k-1) was constant in the range 0.007–0.008 for fluorosubstituted complexes and least at 0.004–0.005 mol-1s-1 in the alkyl substituted complexes. The steady state approximation gave solvent independent rates k1k2 at 25oC. in the copper (II) complexes. k2 is greater than k1 (k2> k1). with k2 constant while in the nickel (II) complexes. the values of k2 was less than k1 and ascribed to rate determining and varies with the nickel (II)-ligand systems studied.,True,4AVI4Y8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234667111.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234667111.pdf,0,0,0

A large number of synthetic trials are not only cost-ineffective but also time consuming. which involves too many work-ups and often results in increased discharge of environmentally malignant materials into the surrounding. However. a good understanding of the relationship between molecular and electronic structures of organic molecules and their corrosion inhibition potentials can aid the design of new corrosion inhibitors in great stead.

1197589,PV forecasting using support vector machine learning in a big data analytics context,2018,Stefan Preda and Simona-Vasilica Oprea and Adela Bâra,10,Symmetry,12,748,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Renewable energy systems (RES) are reliable by nature; the sun and wind are theoretically endless resources. From the beginnings of the power systems. the concern was to know “how much” energy will be generated. Initially. there were voltmeters and power meters; nowadays. there are much more advanced solar controllers. with small displays and built-in modules that handle big data. Usually. large photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems have sophisticated energy management strategies in order to operate unattended. By adding the information collected by sensors managed with powerful technologies such as big data and analytics. the system is able to efficiently react to environmental factors and respond to consumers’ requirements in real time. According to the weather parameters. the output of PV could be symmetric. supplying an asymmetric electricity demand. Thus. a smart adaptive switching module that includes a forecasting component is proposed to improve the symmetry between the PV output and daily load curve. A scaling approach for smaller off-grid systems that provides an accurate forecast of the PV output based on data collected from sensors is developed. The proposed methodology is based on sensor implementation in RES operation and big data technologies are considered for data processing and analytics. In this respect. we analyze data captured from loggers and forecast the PV output with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and linear regression. finding that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for prediction is considerably improved when using more parameters in the machine learning process.

In order to devise the forecasting solutions. we have developed a series of dynamic neural networks for solving nonlinear time series problems. based on the non-linear autoregressive (NAR) and non-linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) models. In both cases. we have used large datasets comprising the hourly energy consumption recorded by the smart metering device from a commercial center type of consumer (a large hypermarket). while in the NARX case we have used supplementary temperature and time stamps datasets. Of particular interest was to research and obtain an optimal mix between the training algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt. Bayesian Regularization. Scaled Conjugate Gradient). the hidden number of neurons and the delay parameter. Using performance metrics and forecasting scenarios. we have obtained results that highlight an increased accuracy of the developed forecasting solutions.

In the specific case of wind power plants (WPP) forecasting the generated wind power is the most important issue for assuring stability of Romania’s National Power System (NPS) and economic efficiency of wind power plant operation. The wind power plant operator should report daily to National Dispatching Centre. the hourly energy production for the next day. In case of inaccurate energy production prediction. the National System Operator must take additional measures in order to maintain the stability of NPS. The purpose of our research is to develop a solution. based on Artificial Neural Networks. for forecasting the wind energy production of small output power wind farms located in hilly areas of Romania. thus improving the accuracy of the hourly prediction. The case study is based on two-year historical data for a wind power plant comprising two power production groups situated in Tulcea County. in southeastern Romania.

Mainly. the householders are becoming more and more active and interested in diminishing their expenses related to the electricity consumption. considering different rates of the advanced tariffs. Therefore. in the smart grid context. especially for prosumers with energy sources and storage devices (SD). the electricity consumption optimization becomes attractive since they obtain significant benefits. On the other hand. the electricity suppliers design appropriate tariffs in order to reduce the consumption peaks and avoid the occurrence of new peaks. Based on the effect of these tariffs on consumers’ behavior. the stress on generators decreases and the electricity suppliers improve the demand forecast and adjust their strategies on the market. In addition. the grid operators are interested in the minimization of the consumption peak that leads to loss reduction and avoidance of congestions that would ensure at least the delay of the onerous investment in grid capacities. In this paper. we will run several scenarios for electricity consumption optimization in the context of smart grid that includes: sensors. actuators. smart meters. advanced tariff schemes. smart appliances and electricity home control applications.

Therefore. in 2016. a new proposal for 2030 of energy efficiency target of 30% has been agreed. However. during the last years. even if the electricity consumption by households decreased in the EU-28. the largest expansion was recorded in Romania. Taking into account that the projected consumption peak is increasing and energy consumption management for residential activities is an important measure for energy efficiency improvement since its ratio from total consumption can be around 25–30%. in this paper. we propose an informatics solution that assists both electricity suppliers/grid operators and consumers. It includes three models for electricity consumption optimization. profiles. clustering and forecast. By this solution. the daily operation of appliances can be optimized and scheduled to minimize the consumption peak and reduce the stress on the grid. For optimization purpose. we propose three algorithms for shifting the operation of the programmable appliances from peak to off-peak hours. This approach enables the supplier to apply attractive time-of-use tariffs due to the fact that by flattening the consumption peak. it becomes more predictable. and thus improves the strategies on the electricity markets.

These strategies depend on those passive factors characterizing the urban setting that are able to affect the values of local meteorological variables. as the limit surfaces of the urban space (parterre and façades of the buildings). This paper examines the Cloister by Giuliano da Sangallo. which is part of the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The case study compares the present configuration of the Cloister with four other configurations characterized by some vegetation and materials with a high albedo by taking into consideration the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model. Microclimatic variables are calculated through numerical simulations performed by the ENVI-met software. Such a comparison is performed during a typical summer day. While examining the results it can be noticed how the strategy presenting the best results is the one with some vegetation. whereas the materials with a high albedo improve the microclimate if applied on surfaces characterized by a high sky view factor.

A useful solution is to identify the energy performance of buildings through the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). as it provides information for the comparison of buildings with different architectural typology. shape. design technology and geographic location. However. this tool does not assess the real energy consumption of the building and does not always take into account its impact on the environment. In this work. two different types of analysis were carried out: one based only on the energy efficiency and the other one based on the environmental impact. Those analyses were applied on a standard building. set in three different Italian locations. with the purpose of obtaining cross-related information. After the evaluation of the results. interventions on some parameters (walls insulation. windows frame. filler gas in the insulated glazing) have been identified in order to improve the energy behavior of the building with an acceptable environmental impact. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology that integrates the EPC with green building rating systems. leading to a more conscious choice of retrofit interventions as a compromise between energy performances and environmental impact.

This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli. a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300-Part1. which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope. based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the non-alteration of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25%.

1197630,Influence of insulating materials on green building rating system results,2016,Fabio Bisegna and Benedetta Mattoni and Paola Gori and Francesco Asdrubali and Claudia Guattari and Luca Evangelisti and Sara Sambuco and Francesco Bianchi,9,Energies,9,712,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper analyzes the impact of a change in the thermal insulating material on both the energy and environmental performance of a building. evaluated through two different green building assessment methods: Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Istituto per l’innovazione e Trasparenza degli Appalti e la Compatibilità Ambientale (ITACA). LEED is one of the most qualified rating systems at an international level; it assesses building sustainability thanks to a point-based system where credits are divided into six different categories. One of these is fully related to building materials. The ITACA procedure derives from the international evaluation system Sustainable Building Tool (SBTool). modified according to the Italian context. In the region of Umbria. ITACA certification is composed of 20 technical sheets. which are classified into five macro-areas. The analysis was developed on a residential building located in the central Italy. It was built taking into account the principles of sustainability as far as both structural and technical solutions are concerned. In order to evaluate the influence of thermal insulating material. different configurations of the envelope were considered. replacing the original material (glass wool) with a synthetic one (expanded polystyrene. EPS) and two natural materials (wood fiber and kenaf). The study aims to highlight how the materials characteristics can affect building energy and environmental performance and to point out the different approaches of the analyzed protocols.

The Sun represents the main exposure source for all the frequency bands of optical radiation. that is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging between 100 nm and 1 mm. including infrared (IR). ultraviolet (UV) and visible radiation. According to recent studies. outdoor workers have a relevant exposure to SR but few studies available in scientific literature have attempted to retrace a detailed history of individual exposure. Material and Methods: We propose a new method for the evaluation of SR cumulative exposure both during work and leisure time. integrating subjective and objective data. The former is collected by means of an interviewer administrated questionnaire. The latter is available through the Internet databases for many geographical regions and through individual exposure measurements. The data is integrated into a mathematical algorithm. in order to obtain an esteem of the individual total amount of SR the subjects have been exposed to during their lives. Results: The questionnaire has been tested for 58 voluntary subjects. Environmental exposure data through online databases has been collected for 3 different places in Italy in 2012. Individual exposure by electronic UV dosimeter has been measured in 6 fishermen. A mathematical algorithm integrating subjective and objective data has been elaborated.

The value of the city center in a Smart City can increase through urban lighting systems: its elements on the territory can collect and convey data to increase services to city users; the electrical system becomes the so-called Smart Grid. This paper presents a study of smart lighting for a small town. a touristic location inside a nature reserve on the Italian coast. Three different approaches have been proposed. from minimal to more invasive interventions. and their effect on the territory has been investigated. Based on street typology and its surroundings. the work analyzes the opportunity to introduce smart and useful services for the citizens starting from a retrofitting intervention. Smart city capabilities are examined. showing how it is possible to provide new services to the cities through ICT (Information and Communication Technology) without deep changes and simplifying the control of basic city functions.

The case study compares the present configuration of the Cloister with four other configurations characterized by some vegetation and materials with a high albedo by taking into consideration the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model. Microclimatic variables are calculated through numerical simulations performed by the ENVI-met software. Such a comparison is performed during a typical summer day.

Its lighting system provides 24 h of artificial sources only. with a higher amount of electric power used during the day. Due to safety reasons. when there is natural lighting outside the tunnel. the lighting levels in the stretches right after the entrance and before the exit must be high. in order to guide the driver’s eye towards the middle of the tunnel where the luminance must guarantee safe driving. avoid any over-dimensioning of the lighting systems. and produce energy savings. Such effects can be reached not only through the technological advances in the field of artificial lighting sources with high luminous efficiency. but also through new materials for road paving characterized by a higher reflection coefficient than other ordinary asphalts. This case study examines different technical scenarios. analyzing and comparing possible energy and economic savings. Traditional solutions are thus compared with scenarios suggesting the solutions previously mentioned.

A useful solution is to identify the energy performance of buildings through the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). as it provides information for the comparison of buildings with different architectural typology. shape. design technology and geographic location. However. this tool does not assess the real energy consumption of the building and does not always take into account its impact on the environment. In this work. two different types of analysis were carried out: one based only on the energy efficiency and the other one based on the environmental impact. Those analyses were applied on a standard building. set in three different Italian locations. with the purpose of obtaining cross-related information. After the evaluation of the results. interventions on some parameters (walls insulation. windows frame. filler gas in the insulated glazing) have been identified in order to improve the energy behavior of the building with an acceptable environmental impact. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology that integrates the EPC with green building rating systems. leading to a more conscious choice of retrofit interventions as a compromise between energy performances and environmental impact.

This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli. a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300-Part1. which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope. based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the non-alteration of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25%. This work shows how it is possible to improve the energy performance of an existing building achieving a significant energy saving with the respect of the building architecture. shape. function and the surrounding landscape.

When properly lit. monumental buildings can become to onlookers an essential part of the city. Nowadays. for design planners dealing with the improvement of buildings. whose architectural design should be valorized. the real challenge is to combine the lighting artistic requirements with scrupulous economic management in order to limit the energy demand and to respect the environment. For these reasons. this case study examines the lighting of the monumental façade and the cloister of St. Peter in Chains situated in the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The present lighting installation. characterized by metal halides. compact fluorescent and halogen lamps. is compared with an alternative scenario presenting LED lamps and scenographic lighting of the monumental façade. Such comparison is based on the evaluation of the lighting levels for different visual tasks and on energy and maintenance issues; the first analysis was performed through the software DIALux Evo 4.0. whereas the second was performed using ecoCALC. This study leads to the conclusion that the lighting levels of the solution presenting LED lamps are better than those of the present solution. and they comply with current standards. Finally. the higher costs of LED lamp installations and the scenographic lighting of the monumental façade are balanced by lower maintenance costs. with a payback period of seven years.

Due to safety reasons. when there is natural lighting outside the tunnel. the lighting levels in the stretches right after the entrance and before the exit must be high. in order to guide the driver’s eye towards the middle of the tunnel where the luminance must guarantee safe driving. avoid any over-dimensioning of the lighting systems. and produce energy savings. Such effects can be reached not only through the technological advances in the field of artificial lighting sources with high luminous efficiency. but also through new materials for road paving characterized by a higher reflection coefficient than other ordinary asphalts. This case study examines different technical scenarios. analyzing and comparing possible energy and economic savings. Traditional solutions are thus compared with scenarios suggesting the solutions previously mentioned. Special asphalts are interesting from an economic point of view. whereas the high costs of LED sources nowadays represent an obstacle for their implementation.

However the indices used for its evaluation were usually developed for indoor environments assuming still air conditions and absence of solar radiation and were only later adapted to outdoor spaces. For this reason. in a previous study the Mediterranean Outdoor Comfort Index (MOCI) was developed. which is an empirical index able to estimate the thermal perception of people living in the Mediterranean area. In this study it was compared numerically (by using the data obtained through a field survey) with other selected thermal indices. This comparison. performed in terms of Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient. association Gamma. percentage of correct predictions and cross-tabulation analysis. led to identify the MOCI as the most suitable index to examine outdoor thermal comfort in the interested area. As a matter of fact it showed a total percentage of correct predictions of 35.5%.

A useful solution is to identify the energy performance of buildings through the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). as it provides information for the comparison of buildings with different architectural typology. shape. design technology and geographic location. However. this tool does not assess the real energy consumption of the building and does not always take into account its impact on the environment. In this work. two different types of analysis were carried out: one based only on the energy efficiency and the other one based on the environmental impact. Those analyses were applied on a standard building. set in three different Italian locations. with the purpose of obtaining cross-related information. After the evaluation of the results. interventions on some parameters (walls insulation. windows frame. filler gas in the insulated glazing) have been identified in order to improve the energy behavior of the building with an acceptable environmental impact.

Some past researches demonstrated how some devices. useful to this purpose. follow the principles of solar chimneys and are able to move air masses while exploiting the Archimedes thrust. The natural ventilation must be supplied by a flow moving upward. generated by a heat source performing at temperatures slightly higher than the one present in the environment. To have a minimum energetic effect. the heat can be extracted from solar ponds; solar ponds are able to collect and store solar energy in the geographical regions characterized by sufficient values of solar radiation. Thus it is possible. in summer. to provoke a nocturnal natural ventilation useful for the air change in indoor spaces (in those climatic areas where. during the night. there is a temperature gradient).

This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli. a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300-Part1. which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope. based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the non-alteration of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25%. This work shows how it is possible to improve the energy performance of an existing building achieving a significant energy saving with the respect of the building architecture. shape. function and the surrounding landscape.

This is the reason why in the past few years different mitigation strategies for the microclimate have been studied and examined. These strategies depend on those passive factors characterizing the urban setting that are able to affect the values of local meteorological variables. as the limit surfaces of the urban space (parterre and façades of the buildings). This paper examines the Cloister by Giuliano da Sangallo. which is part of the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The case study compares the present configuration of the Cloister with four other configurations characterized by some vegetation and materials with a high albedo by taking into consideration the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model. Microclimatic variables are calculated through numerical simulations performed by the ENVI-met software. Such a comparison is performed during a typical summer day.

Its lighting system provides 24 h of artificial sources only. with a higher amount of electric power used during the day. Due to safety reasons. when there is natural lighting outside the tunnel. the lighting levels in the stretches right after the entrance and before the exit must be high. in order to guide the driver’s eye towards the middle of the tunnel where the luminance must guarantee safe driving. avoid any over-dimensioning of the lighting systems. and produce energy savings. Such effects can be reached not only through the technological advances in the field of artificial lighting sources with high luminous efficiency. but also through new materials for road paving characterized by a higher reflection coefficient than other ordinary asphalts. This case study examines different technical scenarios. analyzing and comparing possible energy and economic savings. Traditional solutions are thus compared with scenarios suggesting the solutions previously mentioned.

A useful solution is to identify the energy performance of buildings through the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). as it provides information for the comparison of buildings with different architectural typology. shape. design technology and geographic location. However. this tool does not assess the real energy consumption of the building and does not always take into account its impact on the environment. In this work. two different types of analysis were carried out: one based only on the energy efficiency and the other one based on the environmental impact. Those analyses were applied on a standard building. set in three different Italian locations. with the purpose of obtaining cross-related information. After the evaluation of the results. interventions on some parameters (walls insulation. windows frame. filler gas in the insulated glazing) have been identified in order to improve the energy behavior of the building with an acceptable environmental impact. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology that integrates the EPC with green building rating systems. leading to a more conscious choice of retrofit interventions as a compromise between energy performances and environmental impact.

This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli. a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300-Part1. which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope. based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the non-alteration of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25%. This work shows how it is possible to improve the energy performance of an existing building achieving a significant energy saving with the respect of the building architecture. shape. function and the surrounding landscape.

When properly lit. monumental buildings can become to onlookers an essential part of the city. Nowadays. for design planners dealing with the improvement of buildings. whose architectural design should be valorized. the real challenge is to combine the lighting artistic requirements with scrupulous economic management in order to limit the energy demand and to respect the environment. For these reasons. this case study examines the lighting of the monumental façade and the cloister of St. Peter in Chains situated in the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The present lighting installation. characterized by metal halides. compact fluorescent and halogen lamps. is compared with an alternative scenario presenting LED lamps and scenographic lighting of the monumental façade. Such comparison is based on the evaluation of the lighting levels for different visual tasks and on energy and maintenance issues; the first analysis was performed through the software DIALux Evo 4.0. whereas the second was performed using ecoCALC. This study leads to the conclusion that the lighting levels of the solution presenting LED lamps are better than those of the present solution. and they comply with current standards. Finally. the higher costs of LED lamp installations and the scenographic lighting of the monumental façade are balanced by lower maintenance costs. with a payback period of seven years.

In particular. in the daytime. the illuminance levels right at the tunnel entrance threshold and exit zones must be higher than those characterizing the inside of the tunnel; in this way. the eye of the driver is able to adapt and be safe while passing from a high natural illumination of the outside to the lighting conditions characterizing the inside of the tunnel. However this causes a high energy demand. Therefore. this case study investigates whether it is possible to minimize the energy demand through the exertion of an automatic new control system regulating the luminous fluxes of artificial sources (guaranteeing the parameters set by the regulation) with respect to the variation of the natural light characterizing the outside. The innovative control systems must be characterized by high reliability levels in order to guarantee conditions which are not dangerous to the driver if an outage occurs and minimize their maintenance costs. To carry out this type of study. the software DIALux was used to simulate a tunnel with a dimming system (with lamps characterized by a high luminous efficiency) regulated by a pre-programmed logic control system (with high Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) values). The savings obtained enabled the amortization of the solution here suggested in a time interval that makes it an advantageous choice economically speaking.

Smart planning models should allow to identify solutions in a coordinated and holistic way. Starting from these considerations. in this paper the authors focused on the quantitative evaluation of the mutual influences among Smart strategies applied at district level. An ideal sustainable district was analyzed and two improved scenarios (Smart interventions on buildings and green areas) were carried out. The aim is to evaluate if and to what extent these actions would have an impact form energy. environment end economy points of view compared to the base case scenario. Simulation results of the three scenarios show significant differences from energy. environmental and economic …,True,l0gb1nkAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7977720/,12981554226113442829,/scholar?cites=12981554226113442829,,,0,0,0

A solution set may vary from one context or location to another and may include any number of technologies. Solution sets have the potential of reducing the cost of currently realised NZEB projects. ie a combination of technologies that support/supplement each other in striving towards NZEB at less investment cost. A solution set reduces the overall investment cost for a NZEB. This is achieved either by introduction of less costly solutions in general or by implementing combinations of cost and performance reductions in combination with other cost and performance improvements.,True,l0gb1nkAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,5,https://checkliste18599.de/images/D5.1_Solution%20sets%20and%20Technologies%20in%20NZEBs%20-%20FinalVersion.pdf,2211190279517907894,/scholar?cites=2211190279517907894,,https://checkliste18599.de/images/D5.1_Solution%20sets%20and%20Technologies%20in%20NZEBs%20-%20FinalVersion.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper these two aspects have been analyzed. Numerical analyses under transient thermal conditions demonstrated that passive design (night ventilation and shadings) allow to minimize the overheating risk in summer season and consequently to avoid the installation of an active cooling system: up to 65% average cooling demand reduction can be obtained; 1.5 air change rate of night ventilation allowed to reduce the overeating risks to 16 hours only.

The biggest challenge for cities is to identify all the issues that actually impact on public safety and comprehend the real perceptions - or misconceptions - that citizens may have. Reassurance describes the confidence a pedestrian might gain from road lighting (and other factors) to walk along a footpath or road after dark. and is intended to describe both perceived safety and fear of crime. Past studies have demonstrated that the presence. level and quality of lighting affect human perception of safety. This article describes a field survey of reassurance carried out in Rome to investigate methods for measuring how changes in illuminance affect reassurance.

Many future city views have been developed to solve these issues such as the Smart City model. In literature several methods have been proposed to plan a Smart city. but. at the best of the authors’ knowledge. only a few of them have been really applied to the urban context. Most of them are indeed theoretical and qualitative approaches. providing scenarios that have not been applied to real cities/districts. Moreover. a comparison among the results of different quantitative planning models applied to real case studies is still missing. In this framework. the aim of the paper is to propose a new quantitative method based on a previous qualitative model developed by the same authors. The feasibility and validity of the method will be tested through the comparison with an existing AHP model and the …,True,l0gb1nkAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720304704,16465990362869998627,/scholar?cites=16465990362869998627,,,0,0,0

This phenomenon occurs in many practical applications. such as passive or ancient buildings not equipped with Heating. Ventilating and Air Conditioning HVAC systems and located in latitudes where the temperature greatly varies with Earth’s daily cycles. Despite that. the study of transient phenomena is often simplified. ie. considering negligible the thermal response of the indoor microclimate. An exact solution to enclosures whose microclimate is free to evolve under a periodic stabilized regime does not exist nowadays. also from an analytical point of view. The aim of this study is to parametrically analyze the thermal variations inside a room when a transient periodic temperature is applied on one side. The phenomenon has been numerically studied through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and analytically validated using a function that reproduces the daily variation of the outdoor temperature. The results of this research would lay the groundwork to develop analytical correlations to solve and predict the thermal behavior of environments subject to a periodic stabilized regime.
