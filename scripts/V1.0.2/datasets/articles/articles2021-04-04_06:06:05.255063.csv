With the integration of thermal storages into systems that utilize renewable energy sources. such mismatch can be evened out. The use of phase-change materials (PCMs) as thermal storage has a theoretical advantage over the sensible one because of their high latent heat that is released or accumulated during the phase-change process. Therefore. the present paper is a review of latent thermal storages in hydronic systems for heating. cooling and domestic hot water in buildings. The work aims to offer an overview on applications of latent thermal storages coupled with heat pumps and solar collectors. The review shows that phase-change materials improve the release of heat from thermal storage and can supply heat or cold at a desired temperature level for longer time periods. The PCM review ends with the results from one of the Horizon2020 research projects. where indirect electrical storage in the form of thermal storage is considered. The review is a technological outline of the current state-of-the-art technology that could serve as a knowledge base for the practical implementation of latent thermal storages.

The focus is on polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells. solid-oxide fuel cells. polymer-electrolyte-membrane water electrolysers and alkaline water electrolysers. An innovative. methodological approach was developed for a preliminary material assessment of the four technologies. This methodological approach leads to a more rapid identification of the most influential or critical materials that substantially increase the environmental impact of fuel-cell and hydrogen technologies. The approach also assisted in amassing the life-cycle inventories—the emphasis here is on the solid-oxide fuel-cell technology because it is still in its early development stage and thus has a deficient materials’ database—that were used in a life-cycle assessment for an in-depth material-criticality analysis. All the listed materials—that either are or could potentially be used in these technologies—were analysed to give important information for the fuel-cell and hydrogen industries. the recycling industry. the hydrogen economy. as well as policymakers. The main conclusion from the life-cycle assessment is that the polymer-electrolyte-membrane water electrolysers have the highest environmental impacts; lower impacts are seen in polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells and solid-oxide fuel cells. while the lowest impacts are observed in alkaline water electrolysers.

To evaluate the environmental impact of in the entire life cycle of an individual technology or process. a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is used. In this paper. a LCA is made for three different typical Slovenian electricity providers for a 1kWh as functional unit. The study covers the scope from the cradle to gate (electricity at the consumer). from provisioning the necessary raw materials. electricity generation. transmission and distribution. The electricity providers use different shares of RES. fossil and nuclear fuel in their electricity generation mix that result in different environmental impacts. In setting up the LCA model. the Gabi Thinkstep software is used. To evaluate the results on global. regional and local level. the CML 2001 methodology is used. The environmental impacts of the three providers are compared with the Slovenian hydroelectricity. The results show that the lowest environmental impact has hydroelectricity followed by a provider A.

Furthermore their location is typically in emission free environment where emission of CO2. noise etc. should be mitigated. Renewable energy sources are therefore a suitable alternative to the most commonly used diesel powered electrical generators. Due to their random nature renewable sources based power supply must also include appropriate energy storage technology. To find suitable and feasible solution numerical simulations of an existing mountain hut were performed with several alternatives for power supply.

The analysis was focused on the development of end of life (EOL) scenarios that will help to reduce environmental impacts during manufacturing stage. Numerical model of the HT-UPS was developed using Gabi software. The scope of analysis was cradle-to-grave with functional unit 1 kWh of produced electrical energy. In operating phase hydrogen is produced with electrolysis on site at two geographical locations. Three EOL scenarios were used in the study. With realistic EOL scenario in average a 68% reduction of all environmental impacts in the manufacturing phase was achieved. while a 74% reduction of GW emissions with was achieved with a feasible EOL scenario. EOL phase of HT-UPS represents low environmental impacts compared with other phases of LCA.

While single users of such technology have already been thoroughly analysed. the effects of connecting individual households into a joint (micro-) grid are less known. The objective of this work is. therefore. to analyse how increasing the number of connected (reference) households to an isolated micro-grid affects the optimal design of the stand-alone renewable combined heat and power system with hydrogen technologies. Eighty actual household’s electricity and heat consumptions have been (numerically) grouped to form different sized energy systems and have been analysed with respect to the optimal energy system design using HOMER energy systems’ analysis tool.

For comparison purposes we also include the Maximum Efficient Power (MEP) regime taking into account the engine time delays. When the system’s dynamic stability is compared with its thermodynamics properties (efficiency and power output). we find that the temperature ratio τ= T1/T2 represents a trade-off between stability and energetic properties. When we take the non-endoreversible case. τ can increases to values greater than R (where R is the non-endoreversible parameter) but not greater than one. We reformulate an important difference between this case and the other two. Maximum Power (MP) and MEP regime. in which τ= R. Finally. we demonstrated that the total time delay does not destabilize the steady state of system. It does not seem to play a role in the dynamic thermodynamic property trade-off.

Langevin's strategy allows one to transform the Langevin equation into a deterministic one associated with mean square displacement (MSD). whose solution is explicitly studied in this work. We calculate the MSD for the z-axis. along which the magnetic field is allowed to point: in this direction. the solution is exactly the same proposed by Langevin. while in the x–y plane orthogonal to the magnetic field the solution for the MSD is obtained with the validity of the Bohr–van Leuuwen theorem in thermal equilibrium.,True,hRwDRKcAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,2,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6404/ab6c2b/meta,3592139775246034332,/scholar?cites=3592139775246034332,,,,0,0,0
1308603,Possible future scenarios for atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases: A simplified thermodynamic approach,2009,Fernando Angulo Brown and Norma Sánchez Salas and MA Barranco-Jiménez and MA Rosales,34,Renewable Energy,11,2344-2352,,Most of the increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere is mainly due to anthropogenic activities. This is particularly significant in the case of CO 2. The atmospheric concentration of CO 2 has systematically increased since the Industrial Revolution (260 ppm). with a remarkable raise after the 1970s until the present day (380 ppm). If this increasing tendency is maintained. the last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that. for the year 2100. the CO 2 concentration can augment up to approximately 675 ppm. In this work it is assumed that the quantity of anthropogenic greenhouse gases emitted to the Earth's atmosphere is proportional to the quantity of heat rejected to the environment by internal combustion heat engines. It is also assumed that this increasing tendency of CO 2 due to men's activity stems from a mode of energy production mainly based on a maximum-power output paradigm. With these hypotheses. a thermoeconomic optimization of a thermal engine model under two regimes of performance: the maximum-power regime and the so-called ecological function criterion is presented. This last regime consists in maximizing a function that represents a good compromise between high power output and low entropy production. It is showed that. under maximum ecological conditions. the emissions of thermal energy to the environment are reduced approximately up to 50%. Thus working under this mode of performance the slope of the curves of CO 2 concentration. for instance. drastically diminishes. A simple qualitative criterion to design ecological taxes is also suggested.,True,hRwDRKcAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,2,https://ipn.elsevierpure.com/es/publications/possible-future-scenarios-for-atmospheric-concentration-of-greenh-2,17298100541375174371,/scholar?cites=17298100541375174371,,,,0,0,0

In the case of a Brownian particle dragged through a fluid by an optical trap. the fluid plays the role of a non-Markovian heat bath characterized by an specific Ornstein–Uhlenbeck friction memory kernel. To achieve our goal. we used an alternative method which transformed the generalized Langevin equation into an equivalent third-order non-Markovian Langevin equation. By means of the exact analytical solution of this Langevin equation. we calculated the statistics of thermodynamic work which established the Crooks relation. and then the Jarzynski equality came immediately.

Due to continuous improvements in semiconductor device fabrication. there is a clear trend in the market towards the development of electronic devices and components that not only deliver enhanced computing power. but are also more compact. Thermal management has emerged as the primary challenge in this scenario where heat flux dissipation of electronic chips is increasing exponentially. but conventional cooling solutions such as conduction and convection are no longer feasible. To keep device junction temperatures within the safe operating limit. there is an urgent requirement for ultra-high-conductivity thermal substrates that not only absorb and transport large heat fluxes. but can also provide localized cooling to thermal hotspots.

Boiling is a process of fundamental importance in many engineering and industrial applications but the maximum heat flux that can be absorbed by the boiling liquid (or CHF) is limited by the boiling crisis. Enhancing the CHF of industrial boilers by surface texturing can lead to substantial energy savings and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale.

The flood disaster does not only generate the direct damage but also brings about various indirect economic losses especially in large river basin where population and economy are concentrated. Therefore. it is essential to estimate direct and indirect economic effect of flooding at the river basin’s level for effective adaptation policy.This paper identifies economic losses of flood in several major river basins in Japan by industries and regions. First. this paper calculates flooded area due to climate change. based on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenario. with the GIS (Geographic Information System)-based analysis.

While many studies have adopted the jump-diffusion model used successfully in traditional financial markets. the distinctive features of energy prices present non-trivial challenges. In particular. electricity price series feature extreme jumps of magnitudes rarely seen in financial markets. and occurring at greater frequency. Standard parametric approaches to estimating jump-diffusion models struggle to disentangle the jump and non-jump variation.

The higher initial cost of renewable. as compared to conventional energy technologies. is often viewed as an obstacle in the rural electrification decision-making process. This study is conducted to examine the techno-economic feasibility of renewable energy generation options to bring electricity to the rural villages in Indonesia with Belu Regency. East Nusa Tenggara (ENT) as a case study. In this study. three village electrification scenarios were generated: basic (with the demand load of 150. 5 kWh/day). moderate (359. 9 kWh/day) and advanced electrification (579 kWh/day). To supply the load. three energy technologies were compared: conventional technology (diesel-powered); renewables technology (solar PV. and wind turbines); and hybrid technology (combination of diesel. solar PV and wind). The Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resource (HOMER) software was selected to model the best-optimised system configuration for the scenarios with defined constraints and sensitivity analysis.

1308675,Efficiency and fuel switching in Norway and New Zealand’s residential electricity sector during droughts,2010,Bart van Campen and Energy Centre,,"33rd International Association for Energy Economists (IAEE) Conference: The Future of Energy: Global Challenges, Diverse Solutions",,,International Association for Energy Economics,Much demand side response work focuses either on long-term efficiency (in light of long-term energy price changes); or on short-term peak demand management. which has come to the forefront in recent years as generation and transmission over-capacity have diminished and markets have shown correspondingly high price signals for peak capacity (often in line with electricity market deregulation). New. cheaper ‘smart metering’technologies offer new opportunities in the latter area for smaller users. Hydro-dominated electricity markets often share a common characteristic of low (historical) electricity prices (and therefore low historical attention to electricity efficiency) and less problems with meeting peak demand due to short-term flexibility of hydro generation capacity. However. they also share a recurrence of energy shortages due to droughts. Demand reduction in these periods can be very useful in reducing the chance of dry year shortages or reducing the need for dry year back-up capacity. but falls between the time-frames of long-term efficiency investments and short peak demand management and therefore often requires different technologies and management mechanisms. It seems that this ‘time-frame’of demand side management is understudied.The present research compares experiences in two hydro-electric markets in Norway and New Zealand. which share many similarities. It specifically focuses on demand side management in the residential sector during droughts in both countries. the potential and the methods for demand reduction.

Cham,Despite serious efforts of the Lesotho Government. Lesotho Electricity Company (LEC) and other stakeholders. the level of rural household electrification and affordability are still low. Whereas in 2015 about 72% of urban households were grid-connected. this was only true for 5.5% of rural households. Furthermore. the vast majority of rural households use fuel wood. while electricity use. where available. represents a small share of the domestic energy consumption. The LEC data shows that the average consumption per household has decreased by over 60% between 2001 and 2016 in urban households. This indicates that the bulk of new connections are to the rural poor households.

Reversal of the flow velocity is achieved when a voltage of 2.0 V is applied to the drive electrodes and we show that the reverse velocity increases non-linearly with voltage above this value. Velocities of more than 250 um/s at a distance of 75 μm above the electrode surfaces have been measured. which is much greater than in the forward direction. A possible mechanism based on faradaic charge injection is proposed to explain the onset and propagation of reverse flow. We have also shown how multi-directional flow control can be utilized to promote mixing of fluids in a microchannel. and suggest a biochip application which can benefit from this new pumping technology.,True,68INxXwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/6112/61120H/Multi-directional-electrokinetic-pumping-for-efficient-transport-and-mixing-in/10.1117/12.646084.short,1989703127871526716,/scholar?cites=1989703127871526716,,,,0,0,0

1308691,Magneto-hydrodynamic Fluid Flow Simulation Tool,2008,Tebello Mathaba and Moeketsi Mpholo and Setho Sebitia and Haim H Bau,1,The African Review of Physics,3,,,The presentation will give a report on the on-going project of enhancing a simulation tool for a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) controlled fluid flow. Microfluid networks are complex systems [1]. To reduce circuit design time and save manufacturing costs an MHD fluid flow simulation tool was developed. The inner workings of MHD fluid flow are not straight-forward. for instance. the mechanism of current flow. The simulation tool hides these complexities from the user since all the user interacts with are the inputs and outputs. The system was built and tested primarily for the experiments carried out by Bau and his colleagues [2. 3]. This was first conceived by Bau’s group as a teaching and demonstration tool for an undergraduate class. We worked primarily on the graphical user interface using MATLAB and carried out modifications on the algorithms such that the system now gives an average error rate of less than 5%. The simulation tool uses Graph Theory to analyse the fluid network. The tool operates on a design mode and a control mode. The design mode calculates the pressure drops and flow rates for a given set of voltages and currents. The control mode performs a reverse calculation to find currents and unknown pressure drops for a given set of flow rates. The simulated results are then compared to experimental results obtained by Bau. et al [2]. The algorithm behind the tool will be discussed and a demonstration of the system will be carried out with a brief summary of the theory. The flow rate.

The demand forecast was modelled using the International Atomic Energy Agency Model for Analysis of Energy Demand. largely because of its proven ability to accurately forecast demand in developing economies based on socio-economic. technology and demography variables. The model correlates well with the actual data. where data exists. and predicts that by 2030 Lesotho will achieve a national electrification rate of 54.2%. with 95% for urban households and 14% for rural households. up from 19.4%. 54.1% and 1.8% respectively in the base year. Moreover. in the same period. the forecast for the most likely scenario gives the following results: the maximum demand will increase to 211 MW from 121 MW; the annual average household energy consumption will continue its decline to 1 009 kWh/household from 1 998 kWh/household; and the total consumption will increase to 1 128 284 MWh from 614 868 MWh. The overall low growth rate is attributed to the consistently declining average household consumption that is contrary to international norms. The forecast results gave a root mean square percentage error of 1.5% and mean absolute percentage error of 1.3%. which implied good correlation with the actual data and. hence. confidence in the accuracy of the results.,True,68INxXwAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S1021-447X2021000100004&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es,,,,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S1021-447X2021000100004&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es,0,0,0

1308697,Electricity use and affordability among rural households in Lesotho,,M Mpholo and M Meyer-Renschhausen and RI Thamae and T Molapo and BM Taelea and L Makhethaa,,,,,,This paper shares the results of a study into Lesotho’s rural households’ electricity usage and affordability. To get a holistic view. results from a number of recent studies are used to compare and/or corroborate the present study. In this study. a survey using a semi-structured questionnaire was conducted in three villages in different parts of Lesotho–Ha Lejone (Leribe District). Ha Seboche (Butha-Buthe District) and Ha Sekake (Qacha’s Nek District). The study revealed that rural households used 26% of their monthly expenditure towards energy costs including 9% on electricity. Similarly to households without electricity. biomass is the predominant energy source for cooking and heating while electricity was mainly used for lighting. It also came out that 75% of households perceived the current electricity tariff to be high and 64% wanted the government to prioritise keeping tariffs low. Also. 42% have reduced the use or switched from electricity to traditional sources due to the past tariff increases while 55% indicated their plans to do the same in future hikes. The severity of affordability accounts for progressive decline of the average usage of about 60% between 2000 and 2016 nationally (from 2.951 kWh/year down to 1.157 kWh/year). On the contrary. connections increased by a factor of 10 from around 25.000 to approaching 210.000 within the same period. The bulk of the new connections are to the rural households as the majority of urban households are already connected (> 70%). This shows that prioritising access without taking affordability into account may not be addressing the energy challenges of the rural households.,True,68INxXwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,http://nul-erc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/documents/reports/electricity-use-and-affordability-among-rural-households-in-lesotho-1614921511.pdf,,,,,http://nul-erc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/documents/reports/electricity-use-and-affordability-among-rural-households-in-lesotho-1614921511.pdf,0,0,0

1308701,Two birds. one stone—reframing cooking energy policies in Africa and Asia,2019,Simon Batchelor and Ed Brown and Nigel Scott and Jon Leary,12,Energies,9,1591,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,For the past 40 years. the dominant ‘policy’on cooking energy in the Global South has been to improve the combustion efficiency of biomass fuels. This was said to alleviate the burdens of biomass cooking for three billion people by mitigating emissions. reducing deforestation. alleviating expenditure and collection times on fuels and increasing health outcomes. By 2015. international agencies were openly saying it was a failing policy. The dispersal of improved cookstoves was not keeping up with population growth. increasing urbanisation was leading to denser emissions and evidence suggested health effects of improved stoves were not as expected. A call was made for a new strategy. something other than ‘business as usual’. Conventional wisdom suggests that access to electricity is poor in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). that it is too expensive and that weak grids prevent even connected households from cooking. Could a new strategy be built around access to electricity (and gas)? Could bringing modern energy for cooking to the forefront kill two birds with one stone? In 2019. UK Aid announced a multi-million-pound programme on ‘Modern Energy Cooking Services’(MECS). specifically designed to explore alternative approaches to address cooking energy concerns in the Global South. This paper outlines the rationale behind such a move. and how it will work with existing economies and policies to catalyse a global transition.

1308702,A review of the behavioural change challenges facing a proposed solar and battery electric cooking concept,2015,Ed Brown and Jon Leary,,,,,Loughborough University,This paper evaluates the behaviour change aspects likely to affect the uptake of a proposed electric cooking concept. which consists of a simple battery and 500W electric hob. The battery storage enables households with unreliable electricity supplies to cook at a time that is convenient to them. The specific focus is on the potential uptake of the eCook concept within the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) context. although where appropriate the paper draws upon relevant examples from other parts of the Global South (and beyond) and also makes some commentary upon the potential prospects for electric cooking within these contexts. The paper is organised into two main sections. The first comprises a literature review focusing on a range of related energy transitions. with the aim of drawing out the key lessons learned and highlighting their relevance to the assumptions underlying the proposed eCook concept. The second section draws on the review of experiences presented in the first section to make recommendations for how the eCook concept might be taken forward in ways that make transition more likely. The main findings of this study indicate that the eCook concept offers significant potential for a transition towards emission free cooking. with time/money saving for adopters and broader environmental benefits from reductions in fuelwood collection/purchase of charcoal/wood. The high upfront cost is predicted to be the most significant barrier that will affect household uptake. however recent developments in micro-loans and fee-for-service business models (particularly when combined with mobile phones) have the potential to overcome this.

1308705,Small wind turbines for decentralised rural electrification: case studies in Peru. Nicaragua and Scotland,2013,Jon Sumanik-Leary,,,,,,This thesis began as an engineering optimisation of Small Wind Turbine (SWT) blades for hand manufacture in developing countries. However. it soon became apparent that many of the SWTs installed in rural communities across the global south were not even in operation. let alone operating efficiently. This thesis reconceptualises SWTs as more than just a piece of technology that exists independent of the people that construct. install. operate and maintain it. The fundamental argument put forward is that in order to truly understand the reasons why so many SWTs are failing to provide the energy services for which they were designed. a holistic viewpoint must be taken that encompasses both social and technical issues.  Case studies in Peru. Nicaragua and Scotland were undertaken to determine the key factors that have led to the success or failure of SWTs in each particular local context. From this evidence. a framework was developed to break down the socio-technical system that exists in each place into its component parts and the interactions between them. facilitating comparison between cases and the identification of the critical factors in wind-based decentralised rural electrification.  The case study evidence has shown that taking this socio-technical perspective is in fact even more important for SWTs than for solar photovoltaics (PV). as almost every stage in the technology life cycle requires more support. Most notably. the wind resource is highly variable in both space and time (making resource assessment particularly difficult and limiting the scalability of the technology) and maintenance requirements are high (making technical …,True,wgfbjZEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,15,http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/6282,3858707555602221876,/scholar?cites=3858707555602221876,,,"http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6282/1/Sumanik-Leary%20(2013)%20-%20Small%20Wind%20Turbines%20for%20Decentralised%20Rural%20Electrification%20-%20Case%20Studies%20in%20Peru,%20Nicaragua%20and%20Scotland.pdf",0,0,0

Loughborough, UK: Low Carbon Energy for Developmen t Network & Wind Empowerment",,,,In the right context. Small Wind Turbines (SWTs) can offer a valuable complement to solar photovoltaics (PV) or diesel generators. offering diversity in power generation sources and the potential for local manufacture. However. the biggest challenges facing small wind are the high variability in the wind resource (in both space and time) and the high maintenance requirements of SWTs. What is more. PV prices have fallen dramatically in the last decade. resulting in the proliferation of an array of desirable and highly modular solar solutions. such as solar lanterns and Solar Home Systems (SHS). Consequently. outside of high wind regions. SWTs are now rarely directly economically competitive against solar PV. Going forward. SWTs are still likely to have a role to play. but in niche contexts and as a complimentary addition to hybridise solar PV or diesel systems. rather than as a standalone alternative.Market assessments are an essential first step to determine the relative viability of PV-wind or wind-diesel hybrid systems with PV or diesel systems in particular contexts. In favourable regions. the high maintenance requirements of SWTs can be tackled by providing stable institutional support to empower local champions. establish a decentralised maintenance network and foster the development of a local small wind industry. End users and local technicians should be empowered to carry out as much maintenance as they are able/willing to. especially in remote regions. where frequent long maintenance trips are likely to lead small wind electrification programmes to failure.

1308739,Modeling Dam-Break Flows Using a 3d Mike 3 Flow Model,2014,Mohammad Zarein and Vahid Naderkhanloo,5,Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences,6,1-6,http://www.innspub.net,Dam-break flows usually propagate along rivers and floodplains. However. the majority of existing threedimensional (3D) models used to simulate dam-break flows are only applicable to fixed beds. In this model. the common 3D shallow water equations are modified. so that the bed evolution on the flood wave propagation can be considered. These equations are based on the numerical solution of the three-dimensional incompressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations invoking the assumptions of Boussinesq and of hydrostatic pressure. Thus. the model consists of continuity. momentum. temperature. salinity and density equations and it is closed by turbulent closure scheme. For this 3D model the free surface is taken into account using a sigma-coordinate transformation approach. The model employs an unstructured finite volume algorithm. A predictor–corrector scheme is used in time stepping. leading to a second-order accurate solution in both time and space. The model was verified against results from existing numerical models and laboratory experiments at the same time it was used to simulate dam-break flows over a fixed bed in the predicted flood wave speed and depth. The results indicate that there is a good correlation between the dam-break flow predictions made over a fixed bed and existing numerical models and laboratory experiments.* Corresponding Author: Mohammad Zarein✉ m. zarein@ yahoo. com,True,x4dOWSsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.684.6107&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6163078735833775575,/scholar?cites=6163078735833775575,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.684.6107&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1308742,Effect of Drying Method and Hydrothermal Treatment on Physicomechanical Properties of Parboiled Rice,2021,Mandana Mahfeli and Aliasghar Zomorodian and Mohammad Zarein,,,,,,Rice grain was obtained from milled paddy. in which the husk and bran are removed. During the milling process. rice varieties having inherent poor milling quality or those have been processed under unfavorable conditions. break and so their head rice yield (HRY) decrease. Parboiling is one of the hydrothermal postharvest treatment before drying and milling processes. After parboiling. the grains become stronger and breakage of rice is very much reduced during milling. leading to often a remarkable increase in the HRY. In this study the paddy was soaked in hot water (70 C) for 1 h and drained. then steaming was done at four periods (0. 5. 10 and 15 minutes) at atmospheric pressure. Drying process was carried out using two driers techniques. solar and continuous. at three inlet air temperature to the chamber dryer of 35. 40 and 45○ C. Results revealed that the effects of drying air temperature and steaming time showed a signi cant effect on HRY and broken kernels for Hashemi rough rice cultivar (p< 0.05) in continuous dryer. In both drying techniques the higher HRY performance was appeared at 35○ C drying air temperature and 10 min steaming time. It was observed that dried kernels in continuous dryer were stronger (more bending strength) than those dried in the solar dryer and had a higher rate of HRY during subsequent processing operations. It was proved that increasing the steaming time to a safe level caused a reduction in broken kernels which was associated with higher HRY.,True,x4dOWSsAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-101296/latest.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-101296/latest.pdf,0,0,0

La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3-δ (LSCF)–Ce 0.8 Sm 0.2 O 1.9-carbonate (SDCC). were investigated as cathode materials for low-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. The LSCF was mixed with the SDC–carbonate (SDCC) composite electrolyte at different weight percentages (ie. 30. 40. and 50 wt%) to prepare the LSCF–SDCC composite cathode. The effect of SDCC composite electrolyte content on the diffraction pattern. microstructure. specific surface area. and electrochemical performances of the LSCF–SDCC composite cathode were evaluated. The XRD pattern revealed that the SDCC phase diffraction peaks vary according to its increasing addition to the system. The introduction of SDCCs within the composite cathode did not change the LSCF phase structure and its specific surface area. However. the electrical performance of the realized cell drastically changed with the increase of the SDCC content in the LSCF microstructure. This drastic change can be ascribed to the poor in-plane electronic conduction at the surface of the LSCF cathode layer due to the presence of the insulating phase of SDC and molten carbonate. Among the cathodes investigated. LSCF–30SDCC showed the best cell performance. exhibiting a power density value of 60.3–75.4 mW/cm 2 at 600 C to 650 C.,True,DUBdjl8AAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,3,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/11/3761,12298458847760957211,/scholar?cites=12298458847760957211,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/11/3761/pdf,0,0,0

As associations. one key task of TMNs is to represent their members through production and dissemination of information and knowledge concerning municipal action for sustainable development. Case studies. often emphasising best practice. are used by many TMNs to fulfil this task.

This thesis aims to contribute to debates on urban sustainability by providing insights as to the role of actors participating in processes of governing for urban sustainability. with particular focus on the municipal organisation. The thesis employs an interdisciplinary approach to illustrate divergent approaches to governing for urban sustainability. with reference to empirical studies of strategic planning processes in municipalities in selected North-western European countries–Sweden. Switzerland and The Netherlands. These studies address themes including climate change. sustainable transport and multi-level governance. The thesis provides a broad overview of theoretical discussions related to governing. strategy and planning. the role of actors in governing for urban sustainability. and the particular importance of climate change as a challenge for urban sustainability.

1308831,The role of port cities and networks: reflections on the World Ports Climate Initiative,2014,Paul David Fenton,,,,,,This paper explores how port cities and municipal networks can contribute to reducing the climate and environmental impacts of shipping. Specifically. the paper reflects on the process of developing the World Ports Climate Declaration during 2007-2008 and the work of the World Ports Climate Initiative (WPCI) in subsequent years.The Declaration was a voluntary undertaking. adopted by 55 of the world’s largest ports. to individually and jointly work to reduce the climate and environmental impacts of port operations. the global shipping industry and related sectors. To do so. the Declaration highlighted a number of themes. The International Association of Ports and Harbours adopted a resolution in support of the Declaration and committed to long-term work on implementation through the WPCI. with thematic working groups and support tools including biannual conferences and a dedicated website. These working groups have subsequently not just implemented measures with regard to particular topics (eg installed onshore power supply systems or hybrid cargo handling equipment. or adopted an index for green shipping). but also developed guidance documents and provided support to other ports attempting to begin work with such measures.,True,okb1FrsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,5,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:727287,5869053129406224442,/scholar?cites=5869053129406224442,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:727287/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

1308834,The intermediary role of transnational municipal networks in governance by diffusion,2015,Paul David Fenton,,,,,,This paper examines the role of Transnational Municipal Networks (TMNs) in processes of “governance by diffusion”(Hakelberg. 2014; Feldman. 2012; Román. 2010). Feldman (2012) suggests the “three vital functions” of TMNs are knowledge creation and diffusion; policy evaluation; and enabling local action. In a similar vein. Bouteligier (2013) categorises the main services of TMNs as knowledge transfer; capacity-building; and representation. A typical function of TMNs is thus to facilitate understanding and integration of “outside-in” influences. whilst supporting members in their “inside-out” actions (Porter and Reinhardt. 2008); that is. to provide services that enhance the quality of processes within member municipal organisations. whilst increasing members’ access to and awareness of relevant generic or specific practices of other municipalities. thereby enabling members to think and work “beyond city limits”(Seitzinger et al.. 2012).In many instances. TMNs act as intermediaries in wider processes of knowledge transfer. translating or adapting experiences from one context to another (Fenton. 2014a; Hamann and April. 2012). Literature from the field of organisational studies provides further insights into this role (see eg Langstrand. 2012; Lillrank 1995). as does recent literature on benchmarking and interorganisational learning in local government (Ammons and Roenigk. 2015). However. whilst there is considerable focus on the type of translation process (ie its intended purpose and focus). its nature as explicit or tacit knowledge. and the “translatability” of practices (Røvik. 2007; see also Langstrand. 2012; Lillrank. 1995). less attention has …,True,okb1FrsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,4,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:823598,13045878000190608173,/scholar?cites=13045878000190608173,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:823598/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

Germany and Switzerland?,2016,Paul David Fenton,,,,,,This report explores the varying ways in which three European cities attempt to increase levels of sustainable mobility. and the extent to which renewable fuels or alternative forms of propulsion are integrated within the cities’ strategic work for sustainable transportation. The report presents findings from document and interview studies in the three cities–Basel. Switzerland; Göttingen. Germany; and Odense. Denmark–in order to highlight approaches. experiences or lessons that may be of value to Swedish municipalities addressing these topics.The report indicates that there is a demonstrable need for municipalities across Europe to more explicitly and deliberately integrate strategies aiming for sustainable mobility with the use of renewable fuels and alternative forms of propulsion. Such integration will enable municipalities to increase levels of walking. cycling and public transport whilst reducing use of vehicles operating on fossil fuels. Where and when journeys by motor vehicles are unavoidable. municipalities should strive to ensure that such vehicles are electric or using high blends of renewable fuels. From a Swedish perspective. there is a need to recognize the important role of sustainable mobility in urban sustainable development and develop bolder and more coherent strategies and policies to reduce levels of vehicle use.,True,okb1FrsAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,1,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:926114,10939156724100111581,/scholar?cites=10939156724100111581,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:926114/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

The first case corresponds to the calibration operating mode which is performed under non irradiation conditions before an irradiation campaign. In that case the nuclear heating is replaced by an electric power imposed in the sample. Moreover the experimental results used to validate the thermal model correspond to a natural convection exchange between the calorimeter and its external surroundings. The second case concerns the in pile experiments. This paper focuses on only the first case. The differential calorimeter and its operating mode are presented. The validated 2-D axi-symmetrical numerical model. based on finite element method and solved iteratively by CAST3M code. is described. A focus on stationary results is presented.

A Design of Experiment (DOE) was defined in order to evaluate the influence of several parameters (air mass flow and air diffusion mode. size of the air extractors. location and type of solar shield) on the passengers' thermal comfort on entry into the car cabin and after a short A/C running time (10 min). Results show that solar shields are more efficient than pre-ventilation. which means that radiative heat transfers are more effective than the convective heat transfers. even with high air flows. The type of solar shields together with their location on the windows is also influential. After preconditioning. 10 minutes of air conditioning might reduce the air temperature at face level of the front passengers. compared to a non preconditioned car cabin.

Higher energy performances of the refrigerating cycle is affordable compared to natural convection evaporators. In Europe. many refrigerators and freezers integrate natural convection heat exchangers.

1309113,Exergoeconomic analysis and optimization of a novel isobaric adiabatic compressed air energy storage system,2017,Youssef Mazloum,20,International Journal of Thermodynamics,1,6-14,,The contribution of the renewable energy sources in the electricity generation mix is greatly increasing. Nonetheless. the intermittence of these sources breaks the balance between supply and demand for electricity. Thus. the integration of the energy storage technologies with the electrical grid is becoming crucial to restore this balance. Hence. this paper discusses the modeling of a novel isobaric adiabatic compressed air energy storage (IA-CAES) system. This system is characterized by the recovery of the compression heat and the storage of the compressed air under fixed pressure in hydro-pneumatic tanks. This allows the improvement of the efficiency of the storage system. A steady state model is then developed to perform energy and exergy analyses of the IA-CAES system. An exergoeconomic model is also carried out in order to optimize the cost-effectiveness of the storage system by using a genetic algorithm. The system efficiency is 55.1% in the base case. it is improved to 56.6% after optimization with a decrease in the capital investment by 5.6%. Global sensitivity analyses are finally carried out to estimate the effects of some key parameters on the system's cost-effectiveness. They show that the system is mostly influenced by the isentropic efficiency of the air turbines.,True,wQTc99MAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC,2,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/ijot/article/297402,2573574613807309111,/scholar?cites=2573574613807309111,,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/282785,0,0,0

With the ban of chlorinated substances. the possible choice of refrigerants is limited. The paper presents different possible blends (using CO2) with refrigerants as R-152a or R-32. and also R-134a. Many of those blends exhibit large temperature glides during the phase change (in the range of 20 to 30K). Such large temperature glides lead to irreversibilities at the heat exchangers. The average condensing temperature is higher compared to usual refrigerant blends (R-407C or R-410A) and the average evaporating temperature is lower. so the COP is also lower.

1309134,THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF MEDITERRANEAN BUILDINGS: EXPERIMENTAL STUDY,,Karim Menoufi and Alvaro de Gracia and Cristian Solé and Albert Castell and Luisa F Cabeza,,,,,,This work presents an experimental and theoretical study to compare the thermal behaviour of different constructive solutions. The experimental set-up consists of several house-like cubicles (with inner dimensions of 2.4 x2. 4x2. 4 m) located in Puigverd de Lleida (Lleida. Spain). Their thermal performance throughout the time was measured and presented for two different types of experiments: free floating and fixed controlled temperature conditions. In order to control the inner temperature an electric radiator and a heat pump were used for heating and cooling. respectively. and the energy consumption was registered. This work is focused on the thermal behaviour of four cubicles: a reference cubicle without insulation. a cubicle insulated with 5 cm of polyurethane foam. a cubicle insulated with 5 cm of mineral wool. and a cubicle with a constructive solution based on alveolar bricks without insulation. The thermal transmittance in steady state. also known as U-value. is theoretically calculated for each cubicle. Dynamic thermal characteristics. such as decrement factor. thermal lag. and dynamic thermal transmittance are also evaluated using the heat transfer matrix to analyze the thermal inertia. The experimental results extracted from the monitored cubicles show that the energy consumption for the insulated cubicles and the alveolar brick one is similar. achieving a reduction in comparison to the reference cubicle of about 38% and 45% during summer and winter. respectively.,True,UXGPRHgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/eurosun2010/eurosun2010-0231-Menoufi.pdf,,,,,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/eurosun2010/eurosun2010-0231-Menoufi.pdf,0,0,0

These extreme observations may significantly impact the obtained model estimates and hence reduce efficiency of the employed predictive algorithms. For markets with only positive prices. the logarithmic transform is the single most commonly used technique to reduce spike severity and consequently stabilize the variance. However. for datasets with very close to zero (like the Spanish) or negative (like the German) prices the log-transform is not feasible. What reasonable choices do we have then? To address this issue. we evaluate 16 variance stabilizing transformations within a comprehensive forecasting study involving two model classes (regression models. neural networks) and 12 datasets from diverse power markets.

Here. we consider two novel extensions of this concept to probabilistic forecasting: one based on Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) applied to a set of point forecasts obtained for different calibration windows. the other on a technique dubbed Quantile Regression Machine (QRM). which first averages these point predictions. then applies quantile regression to the combined forecast. Once computed. we combine the probabilistic forecasts across calibration windows by averaging probabilities of the corresponding predictive distributions. Our results show that QRM is not only computationally more efficient. but also yields significantly more accurate distributional predictions. as measured by the aggregate pinball score and the test of conditional predictive ability.

However. the rapid expansion of renewable generation—mostly wind and solar—have shifted the focus to intraday markets. which can be used to balance the deviations between positions taken in the day-ahead market and the actual demand and renewable generation. A recent EPF study claims that the German intraday. continuous-time market for hourly products is weak-form efficient. that is. that the best predictor for the so-called ID3-Price index is the most recent transaction price. Here. we undermine this claim and show that we can beat the naïve forecast by combining it with a prediction of a parameter-rich model estimated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We further argue. that that if augmented with timely predictions of fundamental variables for the coming hours. the LASSO-estimated model itself can significantly outperform the naïve forecast.

Particle size distribution (PSD) data were obtained through isokinetic sampling and then by electron mobility and light-scattering particle sizing. The sub-micrometer portion of the PSD exhibited an “accumulation” mode at ∼0.3 μm and. in some cases. an additional “nucleation” mode between 0.03 and 0.07 μm. Predictions of the temporal evolution of the sub-micrometer aerosol were made using a sectional coagulation model. A comparison to experimental measurements suggested that the “accumulation” mode was formed by coagulation of vaporized silicon-rich species. which occurred and was completed very close to the parent char particle and not in the mixed flue gas.

1309198,Ethanol policy: past. present. and future,2008,James A Duffield and Irene M Xiarchos and Steve A Halbrock,53,SdL Rev.,,425,,Corn ethanol is one of the fastest growing industries in the United States. with production growing from about 175 million gallons in the early 1980s to almost 6.5 billion gallons in 2007.1 This remarkable growth rate has benefited farmers by pushing corn and other agricultural commodity prices to near-record highs2 and has stimulated economic activity in rural areas. Besides benefiting the farm sector. many US consumers find ethanol appealing for its environmental attributes and because it is made from domestic resources. not imported oil from the Middle East. However. ethanol is beginning to draw attention from critics arguing that using corn for ethanol is driving up world food prices and that further growth could result in land use expansion (eg. cultivating land in rain forests) that would be harmful to the environment.,True,TSkg8l8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,52,https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/sdlr53&section=21,7907399694143683067,/scholar?cites=7907399694143683067,,,,0,0,0

Over the boom and bust in drilling. housing appreciation closely followed the oil and gas property tax base. which expanded the total tax base by 23 percent at its height. The expansion led to a decline in property tax rates while maintaining or increasing revenues to schools. Overall. each $1 per student increase in the oil and gas property tax base increased the value of the typical home by $0.15.

We study how shale gas development affected zip code level housing values in Texas’ Barnett Shale. which splits the Dallas-Fort Worth region in half and is the most extensively developed shale formation in the US We find that housing in shale zip codes appreciated more than nonshale zip codes during peak development and less afterwards. with a net positive effect of five to six percentage points from 1997 to 2013. The greater appreciation in part reflects improved local public finances: the value of natural gas rights expanded the local tax base by $82.000 per student. increasing school revenues and expenditures.

1309204,Solar energy use in US agriculture: Overview and policy issues,2011,Irene M Xiarchos and Brian Vick,,,,,US Department of Agriculture. Office of the Chief Economist. Office of Energy Policy and New Uses,The supply of fossil fuels available for energy on farms and ranches in the United States. such as diesel. gasoline. and natural gas. is decreasing. It is important for farmers and ranchers to use more renewable energy. such as solar. to provide energy for the production of food in the United States. Farmers and ranchers are well aware that solar energy is necessary for growing plants. but this report looks at how solar energy can cost-effectively be used to produce electricity and heat for farms. ranches. dairies. vineyards. and other agricultural-based producers. While this report focused on the use of solar energy for farms and ranches. it also analyzed the trends of solar energy use in the United States and throughout the world. One of the biggest findings addressed in the report concerns how solar energy generated electricity in the United States has transitioned from 68% being used for off-grid systems (eg. livestock watering. fence charging. building lighting) in 1995 to 68% being used for utility grid-tie systems (residential. commercial. and industrial electrical needs. and also large-scale irrigation) in 2008. The transition is even more dramatic around the world because 95% of the solar-generated electricity is being used for grid-tie systems. While it is important to understand the trends in solar energy. a large portion of the report is dedicated to case studies. and various ways to make solar energy economically viable for farmers. ranchers. and rural businesses. This report should help many farmers. ranchers. and rural businesses learn if it is financially viable to use solar energy for all. or a portion. of their energy needs.Technical Abstract: Using solar …,True,TSkg8l8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,23,https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=261180,6788967983808258611,/scholar?cites=6788967983808258611,,,,0,0,0

The study found that States with higher energy prices. more organic acres per farm. and more Internet connectivity adopt renewable electricity at higher rates. For solar systems. full farm ownership and solar resources also have a significant and positive relationship with adoption rates.RPS targets are found to increase renewable electricity adoption at the State level. Our result accords with the literature; however. this is the first study to show an impact at the distributed-generation scale. Our study does not find a systematic relationship for State financial instruments. such as rebates. grants. investment tax credits. and production incentives. at least in the form captured by our policy variables. Similarly. net metering and interconnection policies do not seem to influence renewable electricity adoption at the State level. Conversely. electric cooperative prevalence in the State is found to have a negative relationship to renewable electricity adoption share.

In 2018. about 63 percent of natural gas and 61 percent of crude oil production in the US was from shale resources. The effects of this rapid expansion of shale oil and natural gas extraction may include lease and royalty payments to land and mineral rights owners; increased demand for labor. land. housing. and infrastructure; increased truck traffic. air pollution. surface-level ecological disturbances; and the risk of soil or water contamination. Development is also associated with new sources of tax revenue for States and local governments. as well as strains on government resources to improve and maintain public infrastructure and services.In this article. we review the literature on the environmental. social. and fiscal implications of shale development for residents and the environment in shale areas.

1309218,Energy and Speculation: New Dynamics in Agricultural Commodity Price Volatility,2012,Irene M Xiarchos and James Burnett and Oleg Kucher,,,323-2016-11391,,,RECENT developments in biofuels have altered the relation-ship between agricultural and energy. Historically energy has been an input to agricultural production. As the amount of corn utilized for ethanol production in the US has increased from 5% in 2001 to over 30% by the end of the decade. the correlation of agricultural commodity prices to energy prices has been transformed (Abbott et al. 2008. 2009). A number of authors have suggested a new era in which energy prices will play a more important role in driving agricultural commodity prices (Gohin and Chantret. 2010; Tyner. 2010). However disagreement in literature exists relative to the extent of influence from the energy to the agricultural markets and the existence of long run relationships (Nazlioglu. 2011; Nazlioglu and Soytas. 2011).A new potential connection between energy and agricultural markets will likely manifest itself in short-run volatilities. The volatility of agricultural prices was historically determined by supply side shocks. The recent strengthening of the connection between energy and agriculture markets bears the question whether it has created a shift in the volatility of commodity prices by introducing marketable demand-side volatility in the market. Du. Yu. and Hayes (2009) find evidence of volatility spillovers among crude oil. corn and wheat markets after the fall of 2006. Further. Hertel and Beckman (2010) argue that in the future agricultural price volatility. particularly for biofuel feedstocks. will depend critically on renewable energy policies.,True,TSkg8l8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/124788/files/Burnett.pdf,,,,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/124788/files/Burnett.pdf,0,0,0

1309222,Featured Links,,Jeremy G Weber and J Wesley Burnett and Irene M Xiarchos,,,,,,Oil and natural gas production is experiencing a renaissance in the US with the increased development from shale formations over the past several years. Drilling has created jobs and generated public revenues for local and state governments (Weber. 2012; Pless. 2012; Raimi and Newell. 2014). This study evaluates the medium to long-term effects of shale gas development on zip code level housing values over the 1997 to 2013 period in Texas’ Barnett Shale.[1] As demonstrated in Figure 1. the Barnett Shale formation splits the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area in half. with all of the drilling occurring on the western side and none occurring on the eastern side. In examining the evolution of housing values. we connect the natural resource economics literature on the effects of extractive industries to the public economics literature on local public finances and property values–in Texas the oil and gas development …,True,TSkg8l8AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17002543546151788058&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0
1309223,Spatial considerations on the effect of smoking regulations on restaurant employment: the case of West Virginia.,,Irene M Xiarchos,,,,,,In 1992 EPA declared tobacco smoke a Class A carcinogen and concluded that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (EST) causes substantial health problems. 1 In response to concerns about second hand smoking effects on health. smoking ordinances have been enacted all across the USA. These ordinances regulate smoking in public areas and workplaces. including restaurants. West Virginia has not been an exception. and various regulations have been adopted throughout its counties. What should be pointed out though. is that the severity of the regulations differs from area to area. For example West Virginia. which consists of 55 counties. has substantially different smoking regulations in each of its counties. The variation of the regulation severity between the WV counties can be observed from the differences in the percentage of restaurant space where smoking is allowed.

The use of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) in lean direct injection engines has the potential to reduce carbon-related emissions owing to its simple structure. and it can become an easily stratified mixture because of its higher vapor pressure. In this respect. the effects of the injection and ignition schemes on combustion and emission characteristics. including particle emission of ultra-lean combustion through LPG. were investigated. Four different injections schemes in order for forming stratified mixture and two ignition schemes (single charge ignition and multi-charge ignition) were employed to achieve simultaneous harmful emissions and fuel consumption reduction.The experimental results reveal that the fully stratified injection strategies indicate an …,True,S2gdRDEAAAAJ:gnsKu8c89wgC,39,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261917302271,5541407343327068558,/scholar?cites=5541407343327068558,,,,0,0,0

However. studies have shown that relatively high levels of particulate matter (PM) are emitted by gasoline fuel engines. This is a concern in view of more stringent emission regulations expected in the future. In this respect. the use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) in direct injection engines has the following advantages: (1) lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to its low carbon content; and (2) reduced PM emission because it is a premixed mixture. This study used an LPG direct injection engine that was converted from a 2000-cm3. 4-cylinder gasoline port fuel injection (PFI) engine.

In addition. the efficiency of emission conversion with three-way catalysts in stoichiometric diesel combustion was investigated experimentally. The results showed CO and NOx emissions can be controlled with the three-way catalyst in spite of the fact that CO increases more at high equivalence ratios compared with conventional diesel combustion (ie. lean combustion).

As the reduction of oxygen and chloride initiation play an important part in fili-form corrosion. the idea developed in this work was to use the efficiency of cerium pretreatments (widely described in literature) to prevent development of filiform corrosion for aluminium alloy 1050 coated with a cataphoretic painting.

In North Western Europe. the use of solar energy for domestic heating requires storage systems to ensure a significant solar contribution to the total need. In the last decades. many on-site experiments were achieved in order to assess the performances of different kind of thermal energy storage. In Germany. a monitoring campaign has shown that domestic solar installations (10 m² of solar collectors equipped with a 1 m³ water storage) can provide 30 to 35% of the heat demand for classical houses (150 m² of heated floor)[1]. A similar campaign achieved on collective installations (150 000 m² heated floor) reports a solar contribution to the total heat demand equal to 50%(3 000 m² of solar collectors coupled to a 4 500 m³ water storage). Other storage systems (ie borehold. pebble-bed storage) were studied and the reported results show a maximum solar contribution of 50%(D. Pahud [3]. E. Hanhe [4]). To reach such contributions important investments are needed for the storage system.In this paper we investigate the performances of a ground storage located under the house slab which does not require major investments. It allows storing energy from solar collectors; the energy extraction is performed by a heat pump. The use of a low temperature storage leads to high efficiency of the solar collectors whereas the solar storage should lead to a better coefficient of performances of the heat pump when compared to a classical ground coupled heat pump using the natural soil as heat source …,True,__MnbDEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.4632&rep=rep1&type=pdf,8356190672847898134,/scholar?cites=8356190672847898134,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.551.4632&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Climate conditions. final energy and investment costs. technological maturity and stakeholders’ services quality are key elements for the final choice. This paper presents some results of a more general survey the purpose of which is to study different combinations of heating systems integrated in single-family dwellings under the Belgian climate conditions.  The heating system that is concerned is a solar heating system with a ground heat storage and a geothermal heat pump that exhibits energy performance in agreement with such future building standards. This system works with solar collectors which produce heat for space heating (SH) and domestic hot water preparation (DHW). This thermal energy is distributed to the building - using a short-term storage - when it is needed or stored in the DHW tank. If the production is in excess. the energy is stored into the ground using a borehole heat exchanger. This energy will then be used by a geothermal heat pump when the solar collectors cannot fulfil the building heating needs.

The objective of this research is to investigate the highest efficiency among different types of Pelton turbine through the modification of bucket volume. bucket angle attack. nozzle needle seat ring. and nozzle needle tip. The experiment was conducted at Energy Conversion Laboratory of Sebelas Maret University. The comparative study among the different parameters shows that the value of maximum efficiency was 21.65%. which was obtained at 90 needle seat ring and 45 needle tip. and+ 15% bucket size and 92 angle of attack. It was gained likely due to the lightness of the+ 15% bucket compared to the standard bucket and the collision produced by the jet water in the middle of the bucket. in which the water loading occupied the large area on the surface of the bucket and promoted the increasing speed.

The new Italian regulations strongly suggest the installation of centralized boilers in renovated buildings with more than four apartments. This work aims to investigate the differences in primary energy consumption and efficiency among several independent and centralized heating systems installed in Northern Italy. The analysis is carried out through the following approach: firstly building heating loads are evaluated using the software TRNSYS® and. then. heating system performances are estimated through a simplified model based on the European Standard EN 15316. Several heating systems have been analyzed. evaluating: independent and centralized configurations. condensing and traditional boilers. radiator and radiant floor emitters and solar plant integration. The heating systems are applied to four buildings dating back to 2010. 2006. 1960s and 1930s. All the combinations of heating systems and buildings are analyzed in detail. evaluating efficiency and primary energy consumption. In most of the cases the choice between centralized and independent heating systems has minor effects on primary energy consumption. less than 3%: the introduction of condensing technology and the integration with solar heating plant can reduce energy consumption by 11% and 29%. respectively.

However. as the intermittent demand profiles of a building can only be addressed by a tri-generative unit which can operate at partial loads. the variation of performance of the system at partial loads might affect its corresponding potential benefits significantly. Nonetheless. no previous study has been carried out on assessing the performance of this type of tri-generative systems in such conditions. The present paper is the first of a two part study dedicated to the investigation of the performance of a tri-generative system in which a PEMFC based system is coupled with a desiccant wheel unit.

1309311,DMFC modeling: mass transport phenomena and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,2013,Matteo Zago,,,,,Italy,in italiano Abbinando un’attività sperimentale ad una modellistica. il presente lavoro mira ad approfondire la comprensione dei fenomeni che determinano il trasporto d’acqua e l’impedenza elettrochimica nelle celle a combustibile a metanolo diretto (DMFC). Le DMFC sono dei dispositivi che convertono elettrochimicamente il metanolo in energia elettrica. Grazie ai loro vantaggi. quali l’utilizzo di un combustibile liquido facilmente accumulabile e le ridotte emissioni. le DMFC sono considerate una promettente tecnologia di conversione dell’energia per applicazioni portatili. Tuttavia la commercializzazione delle DMFC è limitata da alcuni problemi. tra cui la complessa gestione del trasporto d’acqua: infatti il cross-over d’acqua attraverso la membrana può causare l’allagamento dell’elettrodo catodico. peggiorando le prestazioni del sistema. Inoltre l'idratazione dei componenti influenza la vita utile della DMFC. che è limitata da diversi ed interconnessi meccanismi di degradazione. La tecnica di misura più diffusa per caratterizzare i diversi fenomeni che ne regolano il reale funzionamento e la degradazione è la spettroscopia di impedenza elettrochimica. Nonostante le potenzialità di questa tecnica in-situ. l'interpretazione delle misure sperimentali è ancora oggetto di studio in letteratura. Solitamente l’analisi degli spettri di impedenza è effettuata con il metodo dei circuiti elettrici equivalenti. ottenendo informazioni prevalentemente qualitative. I risultati principali di questo lavoro sono rappresentati da un modello dei fenomeni di trasporto d’acqua e da un modello fenomenologico dell’impedenza elettrochimica delle DMFC.

1309332,Optimal placement and sizing of distributed generation in distribution system using analytical method,2019,Chin Chia Seet and Jagadeesh Pasupuleti and M Reyasudin Basir Khan,,,,,,The reliability of distribution network can be improved with the penetration of small scale distributed generation (DG) unit to the distribution grid. Nevertheless. the location and sizing of the DG in the distribution network have always become a topic of debate. This problem arises as different capacity of DG at various location can affect the performance of the entire system. The main objective of this study is to recommend a suitable size of DG to be placed at the most appropriate location for better voltage profile and minimum power loss. Therefore. this paper presents an analytical approach with a fixed DG step size of 500 kW up to 4500 kW DG to analyses the effect of a single P-type DG in IEEE 33 bus system with consideration of system power loss and voltage profile. Four scenarios have been selected for discussions where Scenario 1: 3500 kW DG placed at node 3; Scenario 2: 2500 kW DG placed at node 6; Scenario 3: 1000 kW DG placed at node 18 and Scenario 4: 3000 kW DG placed at node 7. Results show that all the four scenarios are able to reduce the power loss and improve the voltage profile however Scenario 4 has better performance where it complies with minimum voltage requirement and minimizing the system power loss. © BEIESP.,True,AKQioNgAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,1,http://dspace.uniten.edu.my/handle/123456789/12787,15233964673752929363,/scholar?cites=15233964673752929363,,,http://dspace.uniten.edu.my/bitstream/123456789/12787/1/Optimal%20Placement%20and%20Sizing%20of%20Distributed.pdf,0,0,0

This is particularly true in the case of buildings with integrated photovoltaics (PV) systems having a wide range of orientations and inclinations defined by the skin of the building. Since solar radiation data at the plane of interest is hardly ever available. this study presents the analysis of two of the most representative transposition models used to obtain the in-plane irradiance using as input data the global and diffuse irradiation on the horizontal plane. which can be obtained by satellite-based models or ground measurements. Both transposition models are validated with experimental measurements taken in Murcia (southeast of Spain) and datasets provided by the photovoltaic geographical information system (PVGIS) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for vertical surfaces facing the four cardinal points. For the validation. the mean bias deviation. root mean square error and forecasted skill were used as indicators. Results show that the error rate decreases slightly for clear days. Better results are also obtained by dismissing data with low solar elevation angles so as to avoid shadowing effects from the surroundings in the early and late hours of the day. which affects mainly the performance of the transposition models for west and east surfaces. The results highlight the potential of equator-facing façades in winter time when the received irradiation can be twice as much as the one collected by the horizontal plane.

We propose a generic measurement protocol for PSC devices to ensure that electrical characterisation under simulated sunlight reflects real life conditions. The approach focusses on determining the steady-state maximum-power output under continuous illumination rather than relying on the I-V characteristics. Given the large variations in device behaviour. this protocol is particularly suitable in cases where a priori information about the devices …,True,12W28kMAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/abd678/meta,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/abd678/pdf,0,0,0

1309371,CALIBRATION PROCEDURE FOR A DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL WITH A SLOW RESPONSE TIME,,Giorgio Bardizza and Diego Pavanello and Harald Müllejans and Tony Sample,,,,,,Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are generally known to possess a slow response time for photocurrent generation by incident light. Electrical power measurements can only be accurately made if sufficient time is allowed to complete photocurrent generation. in contrast to the case of c-Si solar cells. In this work we propose a procedure for precise calibration of slow responding PV devices which allows for a precise evaluation of their response time and. consequently. for a reliable calibration fulfilling all requirements specified in the standards. The spectral responsivity apparatus available at ESTI to work at low chopping frequency (≤ 1Hz) has been already described in detail [1. 2. 3]. The IV characterization requires measurements to be performed at different sweep times and sweep directions. Comparing these two measurements a reliable evaluation of the appropriate sweep time for IV characterization is determined. Combining SR measurements with appropriate IV measurements yields a reliable calibration of the device.,True,12W28kMAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giorgio_Bardizza/publication/282662566_Calibration_procedure_for_a_dye-sensitized_solar_cell_with_a_slow_response_time/links/5616df9308ae90469c611b1e.pdf,,,,,,0,0,0

Modified biochar were produced from oak wood and paprika waste (greenhouse waste) following either chemical treatment of biomass (in-situ modification) or biochar (post modification).

In this study. the gaseous ammonia (NH 3) and aqueous ammonium (NH 4+) sorption capacities have been measured for different types of carbonaceous chars produced under different conditions. The study includes a comparison of an oak-based hydrochar produced from hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) at 250 C with two biochars produced from slow pyrolysis at 450 C and 650 C. respectively. The chars were also chemically modified with H 2 SO 4. H 3 PO 4. H 2 O 2. and KOH to investigate the potential for sorption enhancement. The highest sorption capacities for NH 3 were observed for the hydrochars with typical uptake capacities ranging from 18–28 mg g− 1 NH 3. Sorption capacity for oak biochars is significantly lower and ranges from 4–8 mg g− 1 for biochars produced at 450 C and 650 C. respectively. Hydrochar showed a substantially higher sorption capacity for NH 3 despite its lower surface area. The CaCl 2 extractable NH 4+ following ammonia adsorption is incomplete. Typically. only 30–40% of the N is released upon washing with CaCl 2 in form of NH 4+. Post chemical modification of the chars resulted in only limited enhancement of char NH 3 and NH 4+ sorption. H 3 PO 4 treatment showed the greatest potential for increasing NH 3/NH 4+ sorption in biochars. while KOH and H 2 O 2 treatment increased NH 3 sorption in the hydrochar. As only marginal increases to char surface area were observed following char treatment. these findings suggest that char surface functionality is more …,True,8jYyW_4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,11,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/9/1/16,1409450615398636441,/scholar?cites=1409450615398636441,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/9/1/16/pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. the suitability of alternative feedstocks of agricultural and urban origins are explored. A range of biochars was produced from holm oak and a selection of organic wastes. such as greenhouse wastes. greenwastes. a cellulosic urban waste. municipal press cake and pig manure. They were characterized and assessed for their potential agricultural use. The physicochemical properties of biochars were mainly driven by the characteristics of feedstocks and the pyrolysis temperature. The use of pre-treated lignocellulosic residues led to biochars with a high concentration of ash. macro and micronutrients. whereas raw lignocellulosic residues produced biochars with characteristics similar to traditional wood biochars. All biochars were found to be suitable for agricultural use according to the international standards for the use of biochars as soil amendments. with the exception of a biochar from urban origin. which presented high levels of Cr and Pb. The use of these biochars as soil amendments requires a thorough agronomical evaluation to assess their impact on soil biogeochemical cycles and plant growth.

1309387,An enhanced concept of Q-power management,2018,Sławomir Bielecki and Tadeusz Skoczkowski,162,Energy,,335-353,Pergamon,This paper describes specific issues of reactive (Q) power management. One proposes to enhance the concept of Q-power management to make it more energy-efficiency oriented and to stimulate cost-effective response from end users. Such Q-management shall embrace energy efficiency optimisation on supply and demand sides and become an element of DSM programs to create price signals for investment in Q-management equipment. The current attempts to stimulate the optimal Q-power management are not effective. The present Q-power tariff does not encourage investments in Q-power resources. The methods practically applied in large power systems for estimation of active power losses caused by Q-power are not suitable for energy auditors.The means of Q-power management affecting end users have been divided into reactive and active.

1309392,Technology innovation system analysis of electricity smart metering in the European Union,2020,Maksymilian Kochański and Katarzyna Korczak and Tadeusz Skoczkowski,13,Energies,4,916,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Between 2018 and 2023 the penetration rate of electricity smart meters in the European Union (EU) is expected to grow from approximately 44% to 71%. The unprecedently rapid development of smart metering (SM) as an ICT-enabled technological novelty is progressing in a complex. multi-actor innovation system. which is strongly driven by EU-level institutions and policies. This paper presents the comprehensive Technology Innovation System (TIS) analysis of electricity SM development in the EU. with a focus placed on regulatory aspects. The article identifies the key elements of the SM innovation system (technologies and infrastructures; actors and networks; institutions and policies) and characterises their interaction based on an in-depth desk research and a critical assessment of regulations. statistics and primary and grey literature sources (eg. market reports). The main enablers and barriers for EU-level SM TIS development are studied. The major driving force for EU-level SM TIS is the clear. yet evolving vision of EU-level actors for the SM deployment. founded on the grounds of energy conservation and empowerment of customers. On the other hand. the major inhibitor is the insufficient regulatory framework for roll-outs at the level of a Member State. which does not fully ensure interoperability. data protection and security standards or organisational effectiveness.

A complex surroundings around energy issues in the EU has been briefed. A short history of how the energy efficiency policy developed has been given. Crucial EU documents on energy efficiency have been reviewed. Energy consumption and energy efficiency potential in different sector in the EU and action undertaken to realise the potential have been presented. Qualitative and quantitative goals of energy savings are presented. It has been stresses that the EU has not yet legally binding energy efficiency goals mostly due to the lack of strong political support typical for any demand side initiatives. An urgent need to strengthen EU energy policy on energy efficiency has been marked. The most important factors influencing R&D in the energy sector have been outlined. Special attention has been paid to energy efficient low emission technologies which are to play crucial role in fulfilling the EU goals in energy and climate change policy. The role of 7.

Projecting the future. in this respect. requires a long-term energy modeling which includes a rate of diffusion of novel technologies into the market and the prediction of their costs. The aim of this article has been to project the pace at which RES technologies diffused in the past or may diffuse in the future across the power sector. This analysis of the dynamics of technologies historically as well as in modeling. roadmaps and scenarios consists in a consistent analysis of the main parameters of the dynamics (pace of diffusion and extent of diffusion in particular markets). Some scenarios (REMIND. WITCH. WEO. PRIMES) of the development of the selected power generation technologies in the EU till 2050 are compared. Depending on the data available. the learning curves describing the expected development of PV and wind technologies till 2100 have been modeled. The learning curves have been presented as a unit cost of the power versus cumulative installed capacity (market size). As the production capacity increases. the cost per unit is reduced thanks to learning how to streamline the manufacturing process. Complimentary to these learning curves. logistic S-shape functions have been used to describe technology diffusion. PV and wind generation technologies for the EU have been estimated in time domain till 2100. The doubts whether learning curves are a proper method of representing technological change due to various uncertainties have been discussed.

1309437,Variations in the U-value measurement of a whole dwelling using infrared thermography under controlled conditions,2018,Alex Marshall and Johann Francou and Richard Fitton and William Swan and Jacob Owen and Moaad Benjaber,8,Buildings,3,46,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,U-values of building elements are often determined using point measurements. where infrared imagery may be used to identify a suitable location for these measurements. Current methods identify that surface areas exhibiting a homogeneous temperature—away from regions of thermal bridging—can be used to obtain U-values. In doing so. however. the resulting U-value is assumed to represent that entire building element. contrary to the information given by the initial infrared inspection. This can be problematic when applying these measured U-values to models for predicting energy performance. Three techniques have been used to measure the U-values of external building elements of a full-scale replica of a pre-1920s UK home under controlled conditions: point measurements. using heat flux meters. and two variations of infrared thermography at high and low resolutions. U-values determined from each technique were used to calibrate a model of that building and predictions of the heat transfer coefficient. annual energy consumption. and fuel cost were made. Point measurements and low-resolution infrared thermography were found to represent a relatively small proportion of the overall U-value distribution. By propagating the variation of U-values found using high-resolution thermography. the predicted heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was found to vary between 183 W/K to 235 W/K (±12%). This also led to subsequent variations in the predictions for annual energy consumption for heating (between 4923 kWh and 5481 kWh.±11%); and in the predicted cost of that energy consumption (between£ 227 and£ 281.±24%).

However. when we investigate the field in more detail we recognise that there are a wide number of metrics that we can collect and a complex raft of reasons behind the numbers. Energy use within a property is driven by three main factors: the fabric. the systems and appliances that use energy within the building and the energy consumption choices made by the occupants. While the role of people is important. here we will put more focus on the issues surrounding the physical aspects of energy use. Using evidence to determine a retrofit strategy seems an obvious approach to adopt. but many of the decisions that are made in both new build and retrofit projects are based on energy modelling approaches. commonly the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) and the Reduced Data Standard …,True,U4JzkowAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,6,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781118273463#page=154,5601440776940237824,/scholar?cites=5601440776940237824,,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/44678/1/136.pdf#page=161,0,0,0

A case study is presented for measuring the thermal and acoustic efficiency of tweed curtains on a double sash window as a part of a collaborative. interdisciplinary project involving the Acoustics Test Laboratories and the Energy House at University of Salford. The thermal efficiency was quantified by measuring U-values of the curtain and the window. The acoustic efficiency of the curtain was quantified by its ‘Sound Insulation’. Using the Microflown PU acoustic probe. the insertion loss was measured as well as the noise break-in was assessed for ventilated case-when the window is opened.

1309453,The impact of baseline wall U-value on energy performance of solid wall insulation,2020,Mahsa Seifhashemi and HA Elkadi and Richard Fitton,,"Proceedings of the 5th IBPSA-England Conference on Building Simulation and Optimization (Virtual), Loughborough, UK: 21-22 September 2020",,,International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA) England,Solid wall dwellings are in high energy demand and need to be treated by energy retrofit measures such as internal wall insulation (IWI). U-value is the key parameter for energy saving evaluations. There are uncertainties about the U-values of solid wall properties in literature which has led to under/over estimation of IWI performance. So. this paper investigates the energy performance of IWI pre and post insulation for Salford Energy House (SEH). the replica of a pre-1919 Victorian solid wall terraced house. IES-VE was used to develop a model for SEH and the model was validated against the collected experimental data. The base line solid wall U-values were changed between 0.64-2.48 W/m²K to assess the benefits of insulation for different solid walls. The results showed that annual heating energy saving varies significantly depending on the base line wall U-values ranging from 19% to 46.2%. The cost saving potentials as a result of energy saving varied by £228 per year between the cases with lowest and highest base line wall U-values. Furthermore. thermal comfort (18°C<T<=23°C) was improved and annual reduction of 1248 kg CO2e was achieved. Overheating was not significant for the case study using Manchester weather data since a small increase in %hours in which the temperature was above 23°C was observed after insulation.

Due to the stable gold-sulfur bond. the ligand forms a protective layer around the gold core and subsequently controls the physicochemical properties of the resultant nanogold mononuclear protected clusters (AuMPCs). The choice of ligands to use as surfactants for AuMPCs largely depends on the desired degree of hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of the MPCs. normally dictated by the intended application. Subsequent surface modification of AuMPCs allows further conjugation of additional biomolecules yielding bilayer or multilayered clusters suitable for bioanalytical applications ranging from targeted drug delivery to diagnostics. In this study. we discuss our recent laboratory findings on a simple route for the introduction of Trans-Activator of Transcription (TAT) peptide onto the surface of biotin-derivatised gold MPCs via the biotin-strepavidin interaction. By changing the surface loading of biotin. controlled amounts of TAT could be attached.

While the challenges imposed by e-waste are similar everywhere in the world. disparities in progress to deal with it exist. with developing nations lagging. The increase in e-waste generation highlights the need to develop ways to manage it. This paper reviews global and South African e-waste management practices with a specific case study on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) waste. CRTs present the biggest problem for recyclers and policy makers because they contain lead and antimony. Common disposal practices have been either landfilling or incineration. Research into South African CRT waste management practices showed there is still more to do to manage this waste stream effectively. However. recent developments have placed e-waste into a priority waste stream. which should lead to intensified efforts in dealing with it. Overall. these efforts aim to increase diversion from landfill and create value-adding opportunities. leading to social and environmental benefits.

The application of nanomaterials for water treatment and analysis. point-of-care diagnostics and targeted drug delivery systems or devices could improve the quality of life for people in developing countries. Gold colloids have a long history (dating back to the 4th century AD) and are particularly well known for their aesthetic appeal and their therapeutic properties. Since Faraday published a report on the synthesis and properties of colloidal gold in 1857. a reasonable insight into the nature of gold sols (nucleation. growth and kinetics of coagulation) has been developed. Considerable attention has been drawn during the past few decades to the development and optimization of methods for the preparation of gold nanoparticles. In nanoscience and nanotechnology today. gold nanomaterials appear to be the most widely used material by both academics and industrialists. This is due to the extraordinary properties of gold nanoparticles (eg optical. catalytic. and magnetic—they are also known to act as strong Raman enhancers and may also amplify fluorescence under certain circumstances). Mintek. through Project AuTEK and the DST/Mintek Nanotechnology Innovation Centre (NIC). has been at the forefront of the development of new industrial uses for gold.

A survey of 32 influential Western European forest companies indicates that purely economic factors. such as labour or raw material costs. are not the main reasons these companies refrain from investing. Instead. the companies identify a number of institutional factors: ambiguous legal systems; difficulties in negotiating with local authorities; unfair tax enforcement; and general political instability as the main impediments to FDI in the sector.

1309480,Efficiency of Contracts for Differences (CfDs) in the Nordic Electricity Market,2014,Petr Spodniak and Nadia Chernenko and Mats Nilsson,,Available at SSRN 2496889,,,,This paper presents new and updated evidence on the efficiency of the EPAD contracts in the Nordic financial electricity market. based on a long sample of 14 years. from 2000 to 2013 inclusive. The Electricity Price Area Differentials (EPADs) are used to hedge against price differences between a bidding area and the Nordic system price. The aim of this paper is twofold. First. we estimate the magnitude and significance of ex-post risk premia in EPAD products (season. month. quarter. year) with delivery in 2000-2013. Further. we estimate the relationship between spot and futures prices by vector autoregression (VAR) model. By observing Granger causalities. adjustments to price shocks. and decomposing variance. we aim to shed light on the EPADs’ efficiency.

This issue is regularly raised in connection with the electricity market. especially with respect to the ability to handle extreme situations. A region’s short run adequacy of supply could be susceptible to a major source failure. such as a large power plant breakdown or a grid failure. Examples of a combination of those are the long standstill of Swedish nuclear power plants and the outage of a transmission line in the Oslo fjord during 2009. Further. the cold winter 2009-2010 increased the stress on the adequacy of the Nordic electric supply. Several areas within the Nord Pool market experienced high prices when electricity was scarce. We outline events that lead to these historically highest prices in the history of Nord Pool and we superficially evaluate the market’s ability to handle extreme situations. Using the situation during 2009 as a backdrop we elaborate on the need for defining the society’s acceptable level of adequacy and discuss possible measures to ensure the desired level.

We focus on thermal effects and their influence on the CPV/T’s energy efficiency. Therefore. we develop an electromagnetic-thermal finite element model (FEM) of the CPV/T in 2D and 3D. capable of computing the heat transfer occurring due to the flow of cooling fluid. Furthermore. we use the developed model to evaluate temperature conditions over the different layers of the photovoltaic panel and fluid temperature along the CPV/T. The evaluation shows that it is the CPV/T cooling structure that has a major influence on CPV/T’s performance when it functions in climate zones with very different temperature scales along the year.

However. to ensure the system reliability. adequate collector geometry and appropriate choice of the materials used in these systems will be crucial. The present work focuses on the re-design of the Concentrating Photovoltaic system (C-PV) collector reflector presently manufactured by the company Solarus. together with an analysis based on the annual assessment of the solar irradiance in the collector. An open-source ray tracing code (Soltrace) is used to accomplish the modelling of optical systems in concentrating solar power applications. Symmetric parabolic reflector configurations are seen to improve the PV system performance when compared to the conventional structures currently used by Solarus. The parabolic geometries. using either symmetrically or asymmetrically placed receivers inside the collector. accomplished both the performance and cost-effectiveness goals: for almost the same area or costs. the new proposals for the PV system may be in some cases 70% more effective as far as energy output is concerned.

The main objectives of this paper are:(1) to make the building energetically autonomous. using an integrated system of solar photovoltaic technology;(2) check the system behaviour and comment on possible system impacts on the user’s lifestyle. Two solutions are going to be proposed to cover/substitute the windows of the Tower. one using amorphous silicon panels and the other using crystalline silicon panels. Taking into account this type of solution. it is possible to recognize that there are positive impacts. such as the reduction of transmission lines/grids or the decentralisation of energy supplies. However. there are also disadvantages such as the need to have an energy storage system to guarantee the continuous supply.

Namely. thermal effects focused in how temperature distribution through the bottom layer of the solar panel. which receives the radiation reflected from the reflector. affect the electric efficiency. For this purpose. an electromagnetic-thermal finite element model in 2D and 3D. capable of computing the heat transfer occurring due to the presence of a moving fluid (usually air. water or oil) was developed. This analysis was crucial to the characterization of PV Solarus system since it allowed determining the raise of temperature distribution occurred in the photovoltaic cells and watering under given operation conditions. According to the variables of the system the model allowed us to map the temperature distribution through the different layers of the panel and verify the water temperature. The distribution of photovoltaic cells in the panels of Solarus is made of an asymmetrical shape. since the non-uniformity of temperature and solar radiation occur in the back receiver caused by the reflector geometry.

There are evident and irrefutable examples for nanoantenna applications. They can be used to improve already developed devices or even be used as the device. In both cases. they can be applied in diverse areas. such as medicine. environment. energy. defense. and communications. A square arrayed metallic nanoantenna composed of circular holes is studied by performing simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics. This article aims to study the influence of the nanoantenna’s metal. silver. gold. copper and aluminum. but also the optical response dependence on the nanoantenna’s periodicity. its thickness. the hole diameter. and the number of holes. It is evidenced that the optical response can be tuned using the structure parameters and by choosing an appropriate material. This tuning will allow developers to fulfil the specifications. since it is proven that the response peak can be deliberately shifted. amplified. or attenuated.

1309523,Sensors Based on Nanoantennas: Fundamentals,2020,Ricardo A Marques Lameirinhas and João Paulo N Torres and António Baptista,2,European Journal of Applied Physics,3,,,Nanoscience and nanotechnology are emerging fields where some phenomena were recently discovered. allowing the design of some new devices. One of these phenomena is extraordinary optical transmission-EOT-. which was discovered in 1998 by Ebbesen. He reported that light can be amplified in certain conditions. due to a resonant behaviour. using metallic arrays. Even more. he associated this behaviour to surface plasmon polaritons and suggested that devices. as optical sensors. can be designed based on this phenomenon. To understand the surface plasmon polaritons theory. classical theories will be studied and compared with it. Also. the composite diffracted evanescent waves-CDEW-. model. which is not the most accurate model in comparison with the surface plasmon polaritons. will be presented. in order to cover an important topic on the theoretical foundations. After it. the application of nanoantennas as a sensor is going to be analysed. Finally. stationary simulations for a 16-slit gold array were performed using COMSOL Multiphysics and they are going to be presented in order to observe the occurrence of EOT.,True,TGs1ijwAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,7,https://www.ej-physics.org/index.php/ejphysics/article/view/6,11417621703984168161,/scholar?cites=11417621703984168161,,,https://www.ej-physics.org/index.php/ejphysics/article/download/6/7,0,0,0

Renewable energies are a plausible alternative. because they have lower emissions of toxic gases in comparison with non-renewable ones. In the group of renewable energies. solar technology has the biggest overall potential. mainly because it is cheap and easy to set. Several solar technologies allow to equip their photovoltaic panels with concentrators. mostly to increase the output power and possibly their efficiency. However. some problems related to the use of concentrators have to be dealt in order to improve the entire photovoltaic system performance. One of these issues is the corrosion of the concentrators. leading to a premature ageing and. consequently an increase in maintenance costs.

For validation purposes. results obtained with the HFEM method were compared with those obtained with a recursive finite element method (RFEM) and with two different analytical methods. The domain discretization effect on the results of the new HFEM method was examined using either a uniform distribution of nodes or a Delaunay distribution method. The results show that the Delaunay method. used in the mesh definition. is important. not only to assure the reliability of the method but also to significantly reduce the computation time and memory consumption.

The primary objective of the research was to define the theoretical base supporting measurements of accelerated testing and the connection between ageing and the service life of VIP panels. Arrhenius law of accelerated testing was used as a theoretical support to experimental testing of VIP panels at high temperatures and different exposure times. These results are useful in order to control quality. resistance to ageing and determining the life expectancy of VIP panel products. the characteristics of which can be determined in a significantly shorter time during accelerated testing than during real service life conditions.

This has led to an increased interest in the field of health and well-being of users of buildings and to the development of various assessment schemes dealing with this issue. In this study. LEED O+ M Building Operations and Maintenance (hereinafter LEED O+ M). BREEAM In-Use and DGNB Buildings In-Use were compared with a specialized BCS WELL that is focused on the health and well-being of building occupants. The aim of the comparison was to evaluate to what extent the selected building certification schemes (BCSs) cover the aspects of health and well-being in buildings. Based on the analysis. it was found that the observed BCSs mostly pay attention to indoor air quality. light and thermal comfort. In other areas. only certain topics are covered or the topics have a different focus. Another important finding of the study was that certain aspects that are important for the health and well-being of the occupants are not dependent only on the building design but also on the management of the building and the services provided within the building. This kind of information is especially valuable for building developers. managers and owners so they know how to improve health and well-being in a building.

As a response. a lot of attention has been paid to building envelope characteristics. with an increasing number of studies investigating building envelope solar properties as one of the important factors affecting thermal performance. However. different climate characteristics are the reason why solar properties may have different efficiency at various locations. also because in cold or temperate climates building envelope has to be more thermally insulated. namely having lower thermal transmittance.

The time-dependent changes of different characteristics like haze. transparency. and color are essential for transparent glazing materials. Herein. we aimed to examine whether the laboratory results obtained on the Zr-modified-titania-silica (TiZr) self-cleaning materials would translate to larger-scale outdoor-exposed testing. TiZr thin films were deposited via spraying onto float glass window surfaces and exposed into three different environments for 20 months. For comparison. a commercially available active SGG BIOCLEAN TM glass and standard float glass were simultaneously exposed in the same conditions. It was shown that the self-cleaning property of either a commercial product or TiZr-coated float glass was not considerably effective in real field test conditions. although the previous laboratory tests showed pronounced photocatalytic activity of TiZr thin films. The inclination angle; however. was shown to have a considerable effect on the self-cleaning ability of samples. as did the rain patterns during the testing period. On the other hand. the anti-fogging effect of our TiZr material was very well expressed in controlled laboratory conditions (measuring droplet formation time) as well as in the real outdoor environment.

After accurately determining the relationship between the costs and benefits. an analysis is implemented in order to assess the most basic advantages and disadvantages of the suggested retrofitting action in monetary terms. A two-step approach is adopted. The first step is to define the major categories of the ship operational aggregate costs and benefits (for example. the actual cost of the ATOMOS platform and of equipment not part of the ATOMOS platform but still necessary for its installation and operation. or the expected crew decrease because of the higher degree of automation). The second step is to examine the various basic components of these categories (for example. administration and training cost. required automatic radar plotting aid [ARPA] and electronic chart display and information system [ECDIS) equipment acquisition cost. fuel benefits. and insurance benefits). The cost-benefit analysis performed is followed by a sensitivity analysis of the most important factors affecting the net present value of the investment. It is shown that it takes about 5 years for the ATOMOS retrofit to be fully paid back by the annual savings it offers and it takes about 6.5 years for the net present value of the investment to turn positive. This coupled by the increased vessel safety justifies the decision to: etrofit Frej with the ATOMOS platform. Furthermore. it is found that the cost of the ATOMOS platform. the benefits from crew decrease. and the interest rate are those factors that essentially …,True,36kqsW8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,7,https://www.academia.edu/download/42327607/Cost-Benefit_Analysis_for_Ship_Automatio20160207-26129-1kdgwu0.pdf,17122087767153432470,/scholar?cites=17122087767153432470,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42327607/Cost-Benefit_Analysis_for_Ship_Automatio20160207-26129-1kdgwu0.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper we present the application of this technique in order to obtain useful information regarding future values of the tanker market risk. This is the first attempt to express future tanker market risk in relation to current market fundamentals. We follow a system's analysis seeking for internal and external parameters affecting risk. Therefore we apply dynamic features in risk measurement taking into account all Tanker market characteristics and potential excitations from non-systemic parameters as well as their contribution to freight level formulation and fluctuation. In this way we are able to measure the behavior of future market risk as long as twelve months ahead with very encouraging results.

This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to strategic planning of building energy retrofitting. The approach is based on the urban building energy model (UBEM). using data about actual building heat energy consumption. energy performance certificates and reference databases. Aggregated projections of the energy performance of each building are used for holistic city-level analysis of retrofitting strategies considering multiple objectives. such as energy saving. emissions reduction and required social investment.

Numerous tools are available that in different ways rank available options and actions under the aim to minimize costs or maximize profit. One common definition of economic efficiency is least cost per unit supplied. A definition that becomes problematic if cost take negative values. One model. where negative costs are not uncommon. is expert based/bottom up [marginal abatement] cost curves. This model is used in many contexts for understanding the impact of economic policy as well as optimizing amongst potential actions. Within this context attention has been turned towards the ranking problem when costs are negative.This article contributes by widening the discussion on the ranking problem from the MACC context to the general definition of least cost per unit supplied.

Change is not easily managed though. especially not when relating to production or consumption of energy carriers such as district heating or electric power. These systems do not only have strong dynamics internally. but dynamics between multiple technological systems must sometimes be considered to effectively manage response and strategies in relation to change.During the early 1980s. an optimisation model founded on an expert-based approach was developed based on the partial equilibrium model to enable the evaluation of different actions to reach a target. This model—often referred to as marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) or conservation supply curve (CSC)—is used by academia. industry and policymakers globally. The model is applied for causes such as energy conservation and waste management. but also within the climate change context for optimising CO2 reductions and governmental policy.

1309598,Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC): The need for an evolutionary approach,2013,Fabian Levihn and Cali Nuur and Staffan Laestadius,,,,,,Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC) has become standard decision making tools in evaluating options for CO2 abatement. Originally derived for optimizing investments in energy conservation after the oil crises during the 1970s and early 1980s under the name Conservation Supply Curves (CSC) today the discussions on climate change mitigation has given them renewed relevancy to identify the optimum CO2 abatement options for industry and a decision base to devise emission trading schemes or taxes for policy makers. Historically. the development of MACC adopted an iterative process in revealing the optimal route for energy conservation. However. today the iterative process is often dropped in favour of simpler (stand alone) analysis of individual options without regard to dynamic interrelationships. How does this affect economic and abatement performance? The aim of this paper is to analyse the limits of using the MACC model in circumstances where there are highly interdependent options such as within energy systems. We have conducted simulations to examine possible abatement options for the Stockholm district heating network according to the base production plan of the energy provider Fortum Värme. The base production plan includes options decided on or under consideration and planned to be implemented before 2018. The result shows that if an evolutionary approach is not used. the abatement potential for the Stockholm district heating network is overestimated with 19% or 63 kton CO2 pa At the same time. cost reductions are overestimated with 329% or 197 MSEK pa This means that when the abatement options …,True,8Rc2N7AAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:616775,,,,,,0,0,0

1309629,Exergy Analysis on the Chemical Looping Reforming Process,2007,Fanxing Li and Luis G Velazquez-Vargas and Liang Zeng and Joseph Chen and Liang-shih Fan,,"AIChE Annual Meeting, Conference Proceedings",,,,The Chemical Looping Reforming (CLR) process developed at The Ohio State University (OSU) converts the coal into H 2 or Syngas. In the CLR process. highly reactive metal oxide particles. rather than air or oxygen. are reacted with coal to produce reduced metal particles and an exhaust gas stream containing mainly CO 2 and Steam. By condensing the steam. a sequester-ready CO 2 stream can be obtained. Subsequently. the reduced metal particles are then regenerated with steam or steam/CO 2 mixtures in second reactor to produce hydrogen or syngas gas respectively. This reaction oxidizes back the oxygen carrier particles to their original state. These particles are then cycled back to the first reactor to react with the coal.This study presents the configuration of the CLR process for the production of H 2 from coal. ASPEN plus simulation shows that the energy conversion efficiency of CLR process can be as high as 80%(HHV). which is higher than the 64% efficiency obtained by the conventional Coal Gasification-Water Gas Shift (CG-WGS) route. This increase in efficiency for the CLR process is due to the better energy management strategy. In the conventional CG-WGS process mixtures of CO 2 and H 2 are produced. from which H 2 is obtained after several separation and purification steps. Further. the CLR process offers better exergy recuperation compared to the conventional CG-WGS process. In this study. a comprehensive exergy (availability) analysis on both processes is carried out. The analysis shows that the regenerated particle serves as an exergy carrier. thus. improving the overall energy integration in the CLR process.,True,BO9nh_gAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2007/techprogram/P95674.HTM,16187854459612234518,/scholar?cites=16187854459612234518,,,,0,0,0

1309647,Robust design with error optimization analysis of a CNC micro milling machine,2006,Samir Mekid and Azfar Khalid,,,,,,The emerging interest in micro-machining requires ultra high precision machines with a scale proportional to the components. Portable machines are the new trend today because of various advantages and most importantly some challenges to address. This paper discusses an optimization based robust design method applied to a 3-axis micro-milling machine in its initial design phase. It determines a number of key design parameters that may significantly affect the machine performance. Three methods of optimization are used with the volumetric error as an objective function. The conceptual analysis is made according to various design criteria. The mathematical model encompasses machine design variables and the inherent geometric errors. The resulted designs are then filtered at the optimized design space and are further used to find the tolerance bands of each error variable in the model.,True,H6Xmu64AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Azfar_Khalid2/publication/320637218_Robust_design_with_error_optimization_analysis_of_a_CNC_micro_milling_machine/links/59f31bf7aca272607e27040a/Robust-design-with-error-optimization-analysis-of-a-CNC-micro-milling-machine.pdf,6147017684218659648,/scholar?cites=6147017684218659648,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Azfar_Khalid2/publication/320637218_Robust_design_with_error_optimization_analysis_of_a_CNC_micro_milling_machine/links/59f31bf7aca272607e27040a/Robust-design-with-error-optimization-analysis-of-a-CNC-micro-milling-machine.pdf,0,0,0
1309648,Experimental characterization of gasoline sprays under highly evaporating conditions,2017,MM Khan and NA Sheikh and A Khalid and WA Lughmani,54,Heat and Mass Transfer,5,1531–1543,Springer,An experimental investigation of multistream gasoline sprays under highly evaporating conditions is carried out in this paper. Temperature increase of fuel and low engine pressure could lead to flash boiling. The spray shape is normally modified significantly under flash boiling conditions. The spray plumes expansion along with reduction in the axial momentum causes the jets to merge and creates a low-pressure area below the injector’s nozzle. These effects initiate the collapse of spray cone and lead to the formation of a single jet plume or a big cluster like structure. The collapsing sprays reduces exposed surface and therefore they last longer and subsequently penetrate more. Spray plume momentum increase. jet plume reduction and spray target widening could delay or prevent the closure condition and limit the penetration (delayed formation of the cluster promotes evaporation). These spray …,True,H6Xmu64AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00231-017-2251-9,7658250508738048816,/scholar?cites=7658250508738048816,,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/39372/1/39372_a542_Khalid.pdf,0,0,0

Both of these techniques are used for the suppression of range side lobes that appear during the pulse compression process of the received echo pulse at the receiver for target(s) detection. Golay code is a pair of complementary codes and has an inherent property of zero side lobes when the two auto-correlation results of the complementary code pair are added. On the other side. neural network based pulse compression techniques are also developed to reduce the range side lobes. Both the techniques are different in nature but they share the common objective of range side lobe suppression in target detection.

To meet this rising electricity demand. towns are renovated by smart cities. where the internet of things enabled devices. communication technologies. dynamic pricing servers and renewable energy sources are integrated. Internet of things (IoT) refers to scenarios where network connectivity and computing capability is extended to objects. sensors and other items not normally considered computers. IoT allows these devices to generate. exchange and consume data without or with minimum human intervention. This integrated environment of smart cities maintains a balance between demand and supply. In this work. we proposed a closed-loop super twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) to handle the uncertain and fluctuating load to maintain the balance between demand and supply persistently. Demand-side load management (DSLM) consists of agents-based demand response (DR) programs that are designed to control. change and shift the load usage pattern according to the price of the energy of a smart grid community. In smart grids. evolved DR programs are implemented which facilitate controlling of consumer demand by effective regulation services. The DSLM under price-based DR programs perform load shifting. peak clipping and valley filling to maintain the balance between demand and supply. We demonstrate a theoretical control approach for persistent demand control by dynamic price-based closed-loop STSMC.

To increase the orientation capability of a parallel kinematic machine. a small number of limbs is necessary to reduce limb interference. An innovative algorithm is implemented based on physical limits of the joints and condition number calculation of inverse Jacobians. Larger workspaces are found in the cases where spherical joints are used on the lower end of the limb as compared to other joints. A three legged SPS system is selected for further analysis due to its minimum number of limbs and the use of spherical joints in order to gain maximum degree of freedom.

Natural gas adsorption on porous materials has notable advantages in comparison with the other approaches. Due to the lack of adsorption information about Cu-BDC (copper terephthalate). it was synthesized by two different solvent separation procedures and identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Brunauer-Emmet-Telller (BET) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Moreover. equilibrium adsorption measurements were performed for CH4 and CO2 gases in the pressure range 0-50 bar at two various temperatures (293 and 323 K). and experimental adsorption data were modeled with adsorption isotherms. Also. the sample synthesized by the new solvent separation procedure had 918 m2/gr surface area and 0.42 cm3/gr pore volume which were respectively 45% and 50% higher than the traditional method. In addition. this sample has shown CO2 and CH4 adsorption capacity (16.72 and 13.23 mmol gr-1) were desirable in comparison with other conventional Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and its methane adsorption value was close to DOE (Department of Energy) targets. To investigate the application of the synthesized materials. the selectivity of CO2/CH4 was determined by IAST (ideal adsorbed solution theory) according to the sorption test information of the single components. Finally. adsorption enthalpy of the adsorbates on the two samples was computed using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and the results were in accordance with the isotherms at two various temperatures (293 and 323 K).,True,WU57MQQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://jpst.ripi.ir/article_1080_0.html,,,,,https://jpst.ripi.ir/article_1080_da4954b93125dcdc586baa63dcbfe34b.pdf,0,0,0

Indeed. gas was the subject of the first network infrastructure set up in cities. In Spain. its history is discontinuous because the networks were dismantled in the 1940s and 1950s. The purpose of this paper is to retrace the steps of the development of the gas network in a region where the Spanish gas companies took the form of early modern businesses. They contributed significantly to the dynamism of local financial markets. both in terms of enterprise configuration. technology dissemination and innovative management. However. the development of the gas industry remained subject to local conditions of supply and demand. to conflicts with local government and suffered from competition from electricity.,True,_j1ZmggAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jesus_Miras/publication/259421166_The_city_as_a_business_Gas_and_business_in_the_Spanish_region_of_Galicia_1850-1936/links/5553281108ae6943a86da050/The-city-as-a-business-Gas-and-business-in-the-Spanish-region-of-Galicia-1850-1936.pdf,11698537510790866518,/scholar?cites=11698537510790866518,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jesus_Miras/publication/259421166_The_city_as_a_business_Gas_and_business_in_the_Spanish_region_of_Galicia_1850-1936/links/5553281108ae6943a86da050/The-city-as-a-business-Gas-and-business-in-the-Spanish-region-of-Galicia-1850-1936.pdf,0,0,0

These services were strongly linked to the modernization that came during the second industrialization. both as a vehicle of technological. organizational. and managerial advances and through the impact on modern urban transformations. Some conclusions about the relationship between urban services firms and the development of cities have begun to be established. Research has shown that incentives derived from new technologies were influential. on both the supply and demand sides. During the second half of the nineteenth century. the problems of the Western cities were multiple. as a result of their rapid growth. generating a potential demand for many services. But the second industrialization was also offering the tools to meet those needs.

We evaluated 270 patients with morbid obesity and onset before the age of 14 years and selected 194 due to their phenotypes and family history; 289 control individuals were included. The rs1861868 and rs9939609 variants. located in the FTO gene. were genotyped. Genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls. The A allele of rs9939609 was associated with severe obesity starting in childhood among the Spanish population.

Analysis of the genetic basis of obesity requires rigorous selection of cases. In this study. the association of the rs9939609 SNP with obesity widely described in distinct populations was confirmed among overweight Spanish children.

El recuerdo que permite olvidar,2003,Paola Méndez,,Revista Reflexión,30,4-8,,En torno a la conmemoración de los 30 años del fatídico golpe militar hemos podido observar la apertura del debate con respecto a la noción de memoria histórica y una singular proliferación de información. entendida como aporte a su recuperación; singularidad que radica no sólo en lo insólito de tal ejercicio tras años de oscurantismo mediático. sino sobre todo en el nivel obsesivo que la práctica misma adquirió. sin que ello signifique. por lo pronto. una auténtica recuperación. Prácticamente todos los canales de televisión y la prensa escrita emitieron documentales enfocados a “recuperar la memoria histórica del país”.“entregar la historia lo más fielmente posible”. o lisa y llanamente “evitar la tergiversación de los hechos acontecidos”. Pero en definitiva.¿ qué se entiende por memoria histórica?.¿ cuál es la dimensión simbólica del tratamiento que ésta ha recibido por parte del Estado?.¿ cuáles son las posibilidades de un “nunca más” efectivo a partir de tal tratamiento?

Securing the supply of wood and timber from sustainable sources without competing for agricultural land and food production has already become a challenge in many parts of the world.South America has had the advantage of being a large continent with a relatively small population. of which a large share lives in urban areas. Historically. these conditions have permitted inefficient land-use systems such as extensive livestock grazing for beef production. However. in recent decades export-oriented industrial agriculture has become the main driver of South American land use patterns. increasing the pressure for more efficient and intensive production systems. Specialization and intensification in the land use sector have brought economic and productive benefits at a cost. They have caused the massive destruction of natural ecosystems while at the same time making national economies highly dependent on a reduced number of export products. Therefore opportunities for intensification on extensive grazing land and other inefficient land uses (often on marginal land) have to be considered. Particularly in times of pressing global environmental change and increasingly complex trade relationships. land use intensification has to take into account economic. environmental and social objectives and increase the resilience of the system as a whole.,True,hwt1VuYAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,7,https://publications.iadb.org/en/handle/11319/7928,3482351520004657961,/scholar?cites=3482351520004657961,,,https://publications.iadb.org/en/bitstream/handle/11319/7928/Incremento-de-los-Sistemas-Silvopastoriles-en-America-del-Sur.PDF?sequence=4&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Las últimas dos décadas de reformas fiscales en América Latina han enfatizado la imposición indirecta mientras los impuestos directos. en particular el impuesto a la renta personal. experimentaron leves pero ineficaces reformas. Éste es un lujo que la región no puede permitirse. puesto que. la recaudación promedio en Latinoamérica se encuentra 13 puntos porcentuales por debajo del promedio de la OCDE (22% del PBI versus 34%. de acuerdo a Revenue Statistics in Latin America and the Caribbean). Como resultado. el margen fiscal para llevar a cabo las tan necesitadas inversiones sociales se ve reducido en una región ampliamente reconocida como la más desigual del mundo.El hecho de que el impuesto a la renta personal ha sido un impuesto de bajo rendimiento en ALC ha sido bien documentado.

The mechanism that the IDB foresaw is a three-way process. in which decisions are made in partnership with technical institutions and countries. which share their experience and knowledge of social demands. In this case. the countries of the region played a key role in designing an opinion poll on trade and integration. the results of which we compare with national statistical indicators. This was made possible by the strategic partnership between the Institute for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean (IDB/INTAL). part of the Integration and Trade Sector. and Latinobarómetro. marking the start of the dialogue between two databases with very specific features. The first of these is the highly complete information on trade and integration that INTAL has acquired over its 51-year history.

From the analysis of the resonance condition by means of the quasistatic approximation. it was found that sensitivity is controlled by two main factors: the aspect ratio of the nanorods and their composition (the metal’s bulk plasma wavelength). and it depends linearly on both. The finding was confirmed quantitatively using T-matrix calculations. even for particles with a radius of 40?nm. where the quasistatic approximation is no longer valid. For ease of detection. the intensity of the surface plasmon resonance band of the nanostructures was included along with its full-width at half-maximum in the correction factor C. which on multiplying with the sensitivity (Δλ_SPR/Δn_m) gives a figure of merit.

The stability of several of these configurations is investigated numerically as a function of the thickness of the magnetic film. The depinning mechanism depends on the structure of the domain wall and on the thickness of the magnetic film. In the case of a spin-valve structure. it appears that the stray fields emerging from the hard layer at the notch location influence the stability of the micromagnetic configuration.

Several spectral indices have proven to be valuable tools in describing crop spatial and temporal variability. In this paper. a detailed analysis and comparison of vineyard multispectral imagery. provided by decametric resolution satellite and low altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. is presented. The effectiveness of Sentinel-2 imagery and of high-resolution UAV aerial images was evaluated by considering the well-known relation between the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and crop vigour. After being pre-processed. the data from UAV was compared with the satellite imagery by computing three different NDVI indices to properly analyse the unbundled spectral contribution of the different elements in the vineyard environment considering:(i) the whole cropland surface;(ii) only the vine canopies; and (iii) only the inter-row terrain. The results show that the raw s resolution satellite imagery could not be directly used to reliably describe vineyard variability. Indeed. the contribution of inter-row surfaces to the remotely sensed dataset may affect the NDVI computation. leading to biased crop descriptors. On the contrary. vigour maps computed from the UAV imagery. considering only the pixels representing crop canopies. resulted to be more related to the in-field assessment compared to the satellite imagery.

However. producing maps for managing the spatial and temporal variability of LAI in large croplands with traditional techniques is typically laborious and expensive. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the reliability of LAI estimation by processing dense 3D point clouds as a cost-effective alternative to traditional LAI assessments. This would allow for high resolution. extensive and fast mapping of the index. even in hilly and not easily accessible regions. In this setting. the 3D point clouds were generated from UAV-based multispectral imagery and processed by using an innovative methodology presented here. The LAI was estimated by a multivariate linear regression model using crop canopy descriptors derived from the 3D point cloud. which account …,True,L3rUcP4AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,17,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11119-019-09699-x,14942928535991899199,/scholar?cites=14942928535991899199,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11119-019-09699-x,0,0,0

Moreover. interest in UHF RFID tags adoption is growing in particular applications such as anti-counterfeiting systems. The readability of passive UHF RFID tags is well known to be critical when applied to products at high water content. Nevertheless. the effect on readability of solutions of water and other organic (e.g. ethanol. sugars. organic acids) or inorganic (salts) compounds. which are typical of food and beverage composition. has not yet been studied. Furthermore. as in the case of beverages that must be chilled for their conservation (i.e. fruit juice. fresh milk and other pasteurised beverages). the temperature can compromise tag readability. RFID systems efficiency may also be affected by tag-to-reader antenna misalignment. which often occurs for cylindrical section containers. Experimentation has been conducted to evaluate the effect of temperature. different solute type and tag orientation on the readability of a commercial passive RFID UHF tag (Lab Id UH100) applied to a HDPE (Highdensity polyethylene) bottle. To compare readability. the minimum transmitted power output that allows the tag-backscattered signal (Pmin) to be acquired by the reader was measured in standard controlled conditions.

Several spectral indices have proven to be valuable tools in describing crop spatial and temporal variability. In this paper. a detailed analysis and comparison of vineyard multispectral imagery. provided by decametric resolution satellite and low altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms. is presented. The effectiveness of Sentinel-2 imagery and of high-resolution UAV aerial images was evaluated by considering the well-known relation between the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and crop vigour. After being pre-processed. the data from UAV was compared with the satellite imagery by computing three different NDVI indices to properly analyse the unbundled spectral contribution of the different elements in the vineyard environment considering: (i) the whole cropland surface; (ii) only the vine canopies; and (iii) only the inter-row terrain. The results show that the raw s resolution satellite imagery could not be directly used to reliably describe vineyard variability. Indeed. the contribution of inter-row surfaces to the remotely sensed dataset may affect the NDVI computation. leading to biased crop descriptors. On the contrary. vigour maps computed from the UAV imagery. considering only the pixels representing crop canopies. resulted to be more related to the in-field assessment compared to the satellite imagery.

The resolution and fidelity of all attributes depend on spectra of both the seismic signal and noise that vary in time and space.

A digital representation to support the development. calibration. and training of a physical-based reduced-order model for industrial furnaces is sought by integrating experimental data obtained in energy audits performed at several industrial units with detailed numerical results from computational fluid dynamics simulations of the furnaces. Composite models with two blocks. a physics-based reduced-order block. and a machine learning model block. are proposed in order to simultaneously achieve performance and flexibility in its adaptation to different furnaces. while keeping the computational load in acceptable levels. In this paper. preliminary results of the application of the method to a billet heating furnace are presented. namely the results of the computational fluid dynamics simulations of the furnace and their comparison with the measurements performed in an energy audit. This is the first. essential step of the proposed method.

1309991,Using online tools to assess public responses to climate change mitigation policies in Japan,2011,Sengtha Chay and Nophea Sasaki,3,Future Internet,2,117-129,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,As a member of the Annex 1 countries to the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Japan is committed to reducing 6% of the greenhouse gas emissions. In order to achieve this commitment. Japan has undertaken several major mitigation measures. one of which is the domestic measure that includes ecologically friendly lifestyle programs. utilizing natural energy. participating in local environmental activities. and amending environmental laws. Mitigation policies could be achieved if public responses were strong. As the internet has increasingly become an online platform for sharing environmental information. public responses to the need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be assessed using available online tools. We used Google Insights for Search. Google AdWords Keyword Tool. and Google Timeline View to assess public responses in Japan based on the interest shown for five search terms that define global climate change and its mitigation policies. Data on online search interests from January 04. 2004 to July 18. 2010 were analyzed according to locations and categories. Our study suggests that the search interests for the five chosen search terms dramatically increased. especially when new mitigation policies were introduced or when climate change related events were organized. Such a rapid increase indicates that the Japanese public strongly responds to climate change mitigation policies.

In particular. the notion of incessant growth has come into question (Daly. 1996). Yet. economic policies at the national and state/provincial levels remain oriented around the pursuit of aggregate economic growth. particularly as measured by GDP. That this sentiment underlies economic policies and dominates economic discourses is unsurprising. as the most powerful political and economic institutions are structurally dependent on the growth economy (Magdoff and Bellamy Foster 2009). Nevertheless. the widespread dissatisfaction with the direction of political economic developments in the aftermath of the financial crisis. most notably captured by the Occupy movement. suggests that there is widespread interest in charting an economic future that is more environmental and socially sustainable (Graeber. 2011).The shift from material and energy intensive lifestyles toward more socially and ecologically sustainable forms implies a broad-based shift in social and economic institutions and practices. including cultural norms associated with consumption. prestige. success. and well-being. Numerous movements have sought to model. or pre-figure (Litfin. 2011). these new economic systems.

Problems maintaining the bees were encountered and resolved. and plans are being made to use them in future research and educational efforts. Research of the native Japanese honey bee provides a unique opportunity to have a positive impact on both public attitudes and the environment at the same time.,True,-rUaN-8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://bees.arthurwestover.com/?p=124,,,,,http://bees.arthurwestover.com/?p=124,0,0,0

For this purpose. the BMP test was carried out in batch mode at mesophilic temperature (36 C). Substrates were divided into 2 groups: agricultural substrates (silage. hay. cattle and pig slurry) and food industry residues (milk. brewery and cereal industry residues). Methane yields obtained were between 286–319 L kgVS-1 for silage and hay. 238–317 L kgVS-1 for animal slurry and 272–714 L kgVS-1 for agro-industrial wastes. The highest methane yield was obtained from sour cream (714 L kgVS-1). the lowest (238 L kgVS-1) from cattle slurry. In overall. our results suggest that all tested substrates can be treated anaerobically and are potential sources for the production of methane.,True,J76rfbcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,64,https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/bioche/8/,1714010405794824886,/scholar?cites=1714010405794824886,,,https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=bioche,0,0,0

1310009,Biochemical methane potential of Estonian substrates and evaluation of some inhibitors of anaerobic digestion,2011,Mario Alberto Luna del Risco,,,,,,Energy dependence on fossil fuels has led countries worldwide to find new alternatives for energy production. For this reason. in the late 90’s. EU member states have been very active to promote and support the generation of renewable energies. In 2001. the EU delivered 2001/77/EC directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market which was later modified by directive 2009/28/EU. The main targets of this strategy are set to secure the electricity supply. reduce climate change and promote environmental protection. For this matter. implementation of renewable energies is being considered as a key element to achieve sustainable development without generating any negative impact on the environment.Biogas production is considered nowadays as a potential alternative for the production of energy while simultaneously resolving ecological issues (Chynoweth et al.. 1993. Gunaseelan. 1997). Biogas is the endproduct of a chain of biochemical reactions that occur in an oxygen-free environment. The most common substrates for biogas production in farms are: energy crops. silages and animal manures (Amon et al.. 2007). In Estonia. there is an estimated area of around 286 thousand hectares of abandoned agricultural land that can be considered for cultivation of energy crops and around 128 thousand hectares of semi-natural grasslands (Astover et al.. 2008).

Tests were performed in 500 mL plasma bottles at 36°C. The highest methane yield from all tested substrates was obtained from unconsumed dairy products (557 ± 101 L kg-1 VS) while the lowest was obtained from animal slurries (238 L kg-1 VS ± 42). From tested energy crops. foxtail millet achieved the highest methane yield (320 L kg-1 VS). Silages from different crops presented methane yields from 296 ± 31 L CH4 kg-1 VS to 319 ± 19 L CH4 kg-1 VS. The influence of chemical composition and kinetic rate constants (k) on methane potential was analyzed. Anaerobic digestibility of selected agro-industrial substrates was markedly influenced by their organic content. i.e. total proteins and lignin concentrations. Rate constants were found to correlate negatively with hemicellulose. cellulose and lignin (p < 0.05). Results from this study suggest that an appropriate characterization of the chemical composition of the substrates is important not only for predicting BMP and the kinetics rates. but also for identifying possible inhibitors during the anaerobic digestion process. Results on the BMP and national availability of studied substrates indicate that herbal biomass and agro-industrial residues are promising substrates for biogas production in agricultural biogas facilities in Estonia. © 2017.

The vapor–liquid equilibrium behavior of ZrCl 4 and HfCl 4 over the molten salt system was correlated with Raoult’s law. The molten salt-based extractive distillation column was designed optimally using a rigorous commercial simulator for the feasible separation of ZrCl 4 and HfCl 4. The molten salt-based extractive distillation approach has many potential advantages for the commercial separation of ZrCl 4 and HfCl 4 compared to the conventional distillation because of its milder temperatures and pressure conditions. smaller number of required separation trays in the column. and lower energy requirement for separation. while still taking the advantage of environmentally benign feature by distillation. A heat-pump-assisted configuration was also explored to improve the energy efficiency of the extractive distillation process. The proposed enhanced configuration reduced the energy requirement drastically. Extractive distillation can be a promising option competing with the existing extraction-based separation process for zirconium purification for nuclear power reactor applications.

Hence. to develop a safe and profitable process. uncertainty quantification (UQ) is necessary in a reliability. availability. and maintainability (RAM) analysis. Generalized polynomial chaos expansions can be used as an efficient approach to UQ and work efficiently under the assumption of perfect knowledge with regard to the probability density distribution function of uncertainties. However. this assumption can hardly be satisfied in a real process scenario. mainly because of the limited knowledge regarding the probability density distribution function of uncertainties. To solve these issues. this study investigates the performance of orthogonal polynomial chaos in the UQ of chemical processes. including synthesis gas production and natural gas dehydration.

Japan,The naphtha splitter process is a representative distillation processused in the re nery industry. To improve the fractionation of the naphtha boiling range derived from hydro-treatment. naphtha feedstock is sequentially separated into light naphtha. heavy naphtha. and light kerosene. Conventional naphtha splitting columns can be retro tted to an advanced con guration requiring less energy consumption with consequently less CO2 emission. A systematic design for retro tting naphtha splitting columns for the thermally coupled distillation sequence (TCDS) that addresses the bottleneck phenomenon by integration of existing shells was developed in this study. The results showed that the operating cost could be reduced drastically by novel combination of the TCDS and a side reboiler with minimal process modi cation.,True,Yt4K7j4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jcej/47/8/47_13we324/_article/-char/ja/,17423285715542984981,/scholar?cites=17423285715542984981,,,,0,0,0

However. high thermal energy is required to remove the excess water in the fermentation broth in order to achieve 99% purity.

MMH is getting more industrial and academic interests as a gasoline additive to replace methyl tert-butyl ether. Traditionally. MMH is obtained by carrying out the reaction in the reactor followed by three distillation columns. The high yield of MMH could be achieved by keeping the large reactor size or by using the large excess of 2-methyl-1-heptene (MH).

Sci,3,241-256,,Population growth and economic development in Indonesia have increased the production of municipal solid waste (MSW) in many big cities. causing sanitary problems. The (MSW) disposal problem can be solved by applying an appropriate technology that can reduce the volume of the waste effectively and efficiently. Waste-to-Energy (WTE). or Energy-from-Waste (EFW). is one of the most effective and efficient technologies for reducing the waste volume. Energy recovered from the waste can be used for thermal or electricity generation. This paper deals with a feasibility study of utilizing MSW for generating electricity. A survey and investigation of waste characteristics. including waste composition. chemical and physical composition. and heating value. were carried out for typical Bandung MSW. An average heating value of 1500 kcal/kg can be expected from pre-treated MSW to be used as a fuel for direct combustion in a WTE plant.

Since the cooling is closely related to the safety. water film cooling characteristics of the PCCS should be studied. This paper deals with the experimental study of laminar water film cooling on the containment model wall. The influences of water mass flow rate and wall heat rate on the heat transfer characteristic were studied. This research was started with design and assembly of a containment model equipped with the water cooling system. and calibration of all measurement devices.

MA,Experimental results of saturated nucleate pool boiling on a novel enhanced boiling surface in liquid oxygen. liquid nitrogen. liquid argon and Freon-12 are reported. Measurements of heat transfer coefficient as a function of coating thickness are also presented. The enhanced surface used was a metallic porous coating which is shown to have excellent heat transfer characteristics. The efficiency of the surface is shown to depend on the liquid properties at low heat fluxes (q<lWcm−2) and on the coating thickness at higher heat fluxes. Three regions are identified within the boiling curve and the heat transfer mechanisms associated with each region are discussed. At low heat flux it is suggested that boiling occurs within the porous coating with vapour removal via well defined channels. At high flux boiling is confined to the surface of the coating and the thermal conductivity of the coating dominates the heat …,True,uj95_EMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4613-0639-9_51,1573904356252503169,/scholar?cites=1573904356252503169,,,,0,0,0

1310074,Experimental Study on Utilization of Indonesian Non-Recycled Organic Waste as Renewable Solid Fuel Using Wet Torrefaction Process,2018,Budi Triyono and Pandji Prawisudha and Mardiyati Mardiyati and Ari Darmawan Pasek,22,Engineering Journal,6,81-92,,Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a complex problem in major cities in Indonesia that has not been resolved. MSW is currently only collected and disposed to final landfill. On the other hand. national energy security is also an issue to be solved. Utilization of MSW. which is dominated by organic waste. as solid fuel can be a solution for both problems. This paper discusses an experimental study on utilization of organic waste as renewable solid fuel using a wet torrefaction process. Four types of samples were chosen to represent the four types of organic waste in MSW with the highest mass fraction found in a field survey: leaf litter. food waste. vegetable waste and fruit waste. Each sample was treated with wet torrefaction under four conditions: 150. 175. 200 and 225 ºC with holding time 30 minutes. The experimental results showed that the optimum wet torrefaction temperature for mixed organic waste is between 200 and 225 C. which is predicted to produce a solid product with a heating value (db) of 23.22-24.44 MJ/kg. volatile matter content of 61.18-66.00%. fixed carbon content of 26.04-31.35%. ash content of 7.47-7.96%. and energy yield equal to 58%. A higher operating temperature will increase the calorific value. followed by a decrease in mass yield as a consequence of the process severity degree. However. food waste torrefaction showed different characterisics: the increase in calorific value was followed by an increase in mass yield. This is unique and different from the results of wet torrefaction on other organic wastes.,True,uj95_EMAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,3,https://engj.org/index.php/ej/article/view/2537,9148188182752181265,/scholar?cites=9148188182752181265,,,https://engj.org/index.php/ej/article/view/2537/817,0,0,0

Kondensat yang dihasilkan didinginkan lebih lanjut melewati menara pendingin sebelum disirkulasikan kembali ke dalam kondensor sebagai fluida pendingin. Penurunan tekanan vakum di dalam kondensor saat proses kondensasi memberikan perbedaan entalpi yang semakin besar pada turbin. Diperkirakan. penurunan 0.01 Bar tekanan kondensor akan mampu menghasilkan 1.5-1.6% energi listrik dari kapasitas pembangkit. Begitu juga sebaliknya. jika terjadi kenaikan tekanan kondensor maka energi listrik yang dihasilkan akan semakin berkurang. Energi listrik yang hilang dapat setara dengan suatu PLTP berkapasitas 2 MW. Kandungan gas tak terkondensasi (noncondensable gas–NCG) dan temperatur air pendingin menjadi variabel yang berpengaruh terhadap kinerja kondensor. Kedua variabel ini sangat bervariasi dan sulit untuk dikontrol karena sangat dipengaruhi oleh lingkungannya. Konsentrasi NCG bergantung pada kondisi sumur pembangkit. sedangkan temperatur air pendingin ditentukan oleh temperatur udara di sekitar pembangkit dan performa menara pendingin. Untuk mengetahui pengaruh kedua variabel ini terhadap proses kondensasi dan tekanan kondensor. maka perlu dilakukan studi eksperimental.

1310109,The Effects of Ethanol/Gasoline Blends on Advanced Combustion Strategies in Internal Combustion Engines.,2014,Mohammad Fatouraie,,,,,,This dissertation presents the effects of blending ethanol with gasoline on advanced combustion strategies in internal combustion engines. The unique chemical. physical and thermal properties of ethanol/ gasoline blends can be used to improve the performance and emissions of advanced engine technologies like gasoline direct injection (GDI) also called direct injection spark ignition (DISI). homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) and spark assisted homogenous charge compression ignition (SA-HCCI).  This work used experimental studies to understand the impact of ethanol and ethanol/gasoline blends on advanced engine strategies and on understanding which of the fundamental properties of ethanol and ethanol blends control engine performance.  The technical approach leveraged high speed imaging to study the fuel spray. combustion. ignition. and sooting (where appropriate) properties of the fuels using different optically accessible engine hardware. including HCCI and GDI configurations.  The results of the HCCI work indicated stable operating conditions could be extended to leaner mixtures using the ethanol blends. if the effect of charge cooling due to fuel vaporization was anticipated. Ethanol also improved the stability of flame initiation and growth in SA-HCCI. which affected the global autoignition and performance of the engine.  The effect of ethanol on these chemically-controlled engine modes was dominated by the impact of the fuel on thermal stratification.  Ethanol combustion chemistry appeared to have little impact.   Significant reduction in soot formation was observed in the DISI engine studies using ethanol …,True,AEqCppoAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,5,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/107175,2239487656350524647,/scholar?cites=2239487656350524647,,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/107175/mohfat_1.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1310138,Maintenance - a Solution to Reduce the Environmental Impact of Electrical Machines,2011,Daniel Necula and Nicolae Vasile and Mihai Florin Stan,1,Published online at http://journal.sapub.org/eee,2,55-59,Scientific & Academic Publishing. Electrical and Electronic Engineering,This article is part of a larger work titled „The electrical machines impact on the environment and solutions to reduce it” and it is in fact a case study. Far from being an exhaustive paper. it aims to identify some factors of the impact of electrical machines on the environment throughout the period of their existence. and on the other hand. to propose solutions to reduce such impact. in the context of the sustainable development concept. Generally. asynchronous motors (both three-phase and single-phase) have two demountable bearing shields. There is also a specially designed motor that has a single removable bearing shield. the other being made integral with the stator housing. Such a construction has a few advantages: it allows for better sealing. increasing resistance to heavy operating conditions such as humidity. dust. explosive gas. vibration etc. As a disadvantage. in case of coil defection at this motor type. as the coil is not available at both ends of the stator as in normal motors. extraction of the defective coils in order to replace them impose major constructive difficulties. Therefore. the problem is to find a method to extract the ferromagnetic stator core with its windings and insert it back in its place after rewinding and coating. This paper presents two novel constructive solutions: the first solution represents a device for the extraction of the ferromagnetic core from the housing with the purpose of rewinding. and the second is a device for pressing the ferromagnetic core back in its housing once it’s repaired. The two devices have been designed in order to allow the repair of small power electrical motors that have a single removable bearing shield …,True,k_EIH70AAAAJ:_Re3VWB3Y0AC,4,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1053.4129&rep=rep1&type=pdf,1724030428357134015,/scholar?cites=1724030428357134015,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1053.4129&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Conceptul de dezvoltare durabilă înseamnă acel mod de dezvoltare care se realizeze fără a periclita şansele la existenţă ale generaţiilor viitoare. Conceptul a început să aibă consistenţă odată cu începutul conştientizării epuizabilităţii resurselor Pământului pentru o populaţie în continuă creştere şi cu consumuri din ce în ce mai mari. Modelul matematic se bazează pe teoria entropiei economice. Fundamentele fizico-matematice ale acestei teorii sunt prezentate în lucrarea „The Entropy Law and the Economic Process”. publicată în anul 1968 de către Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1906-1994). matematician şi economist român care a activat în România. înainte de al doilea război mondial şi în SUA după aceea. Omenirea a realizat pentru prima data. în mod serios. pericolul epuizării resurselor convenţionale la scurt timp după aceea. în anul 1971. cu ocazia primei crize mondiale a petrolului. Principiul teoriei constă în stabilirea unei asemănări dintre entropia termodinamică. ca măsura a agitaţiei termice şi o mărime. pe care a numit-o entropie economică. ca măsura a agitaţiei economice. care conduce la degradarea de neevitat a resurselor naturale.

The particle size of the CdSe/ZnS QDs alone are 3.95. 6.02. and 6.66 nm. and are denoted as QD1. QD2 and QD3 respectively. The nonlinear absorption (NLA) properties of the nanoconjugates (InPc–CdSe/ZnS) were investigated with nanosecond laser radiation at 532 nm wavelength. Enhanced NLA properties compared to the InPc alone were observed in the conjugates. The NLA was found to increase with the size of the CdSe/ZnS particles attached to the phthalocyanine. The observed increase was due to the availability of more free-carrier ions in the larger QDs. thus giving rise to the enhanced free-carrier absorption.

From the beginnings of the power systems. the concern was to know “how much” energy will be generated. Initially. there were voltmeters and power meters; nowadays. there are much more advanced solar controllers. with small displays and built-in modules that handle big data. Usually. large photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems have sophisticated energy management strategies in order to operate unattended. By adding the information collected by sensors managed with powerful technologies such as big data and analytics. the system is able to efficiently react to environmental factors and respond to consumers’ requirements in real time. According to the weather parameters. the output of PV could be symmetric. supplying an asymmetric electricity demand. Thus. a smart adaptive switching module that includes a forecasting component is proposed to improve the symmetry between the PV output and daily load curve. A scaling approach for smaller off-grid systems that provides an accurate forecast of the PV output based on data collected from sensors is developed. The proposed methodology is based on sensor implementation in RES operation and big data technologies are considered for data processing and analytics. In this respect. we analyze data captured from loggers and forecast the PV output with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and linear regression. finding that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for prediction is considerably improved when using more parameters in the machine learning process.

In order to devise the forecasting solutions. we have developed a series of dynamic neural networks for solving nonlinear time series problems. based on the non-linear autoregressive (NAR) and non-linear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) models. In both cases. we have used large datasets comprising the hourly energy consumption recorded by the smart metering device from a commercial center type of consumer (a large hypermarket). while in the NARX case we have used supplementary temperature and time stamps datasets. Of particular interest was to research and obtain an optimal mix between the training algorithm (Levenberg-Marquardt. Bayesian Regularization. Scaled Conjugate Gradient). the hidden number of neurons and the delay parameter. Using performance metrics and forecasting scenarios. we have obtained results that highlight an increased accuracy of the developed forecasting solutions.

In this purpose. we have developed a mixed artificial neural network (ANN) approach using both non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) ANNs and function fitting neural networks (FITNETs). We have used a large dataset containing detailed electricity consumption data recorded by sensors. monitoring a series of individual appliances. while in the NARX case we have also used timestamps datasets as exogenous variables. After having developed and validated the forecasting method. we have compiled it in view of incorporating it into a cloud solution. being delivered to the contractor that can provide it as a service for a monthly fee to both the operators and residential consumers.

Mainly. the householders are becoming more and more active and interested in diminishing their expenses related to the electricity consumption. considering different rates of the advanced tariffs. Therefore. in the smart grid context. especially for prosumers with energy sources and storage devices (SD). the electricity consumption optimization becomes attractive since they obtain significant benefits. On the other hand. the electricity suppliers design appropriate tariffs in order to reduce the consumption peaks and avoid the occurrence of new peaks. Based on the effect of these tariffs on consumers’ behavior. the stress on generators decreases and the electricity suppliers improve the demand forecast and adjust their strategies on the market. In addition. the grid operators are interested in the minimization of the consumption peak that leads to loss reduction and avoidance of congestions that would ensure at least the delay of the onerous investment in grid capacities. In this paper. we will run several scenarios for electricity consumption optimization in the context of smart grid that includes: sensors. actuators. smart meters. advanced tariff schemes. smart appliances and electricity home control applications. Our goal is to analyze the effect of the Renewable Energy Systems (RES) distributed generation (such as photovoltaic panels—PV) and storage on the consumption curve.

Therefore. in 2016. a new proposal for 2030 of energy efficiency target of 30% has been agreed. However. during the last years. even if the electricity consumption by households decreased in the EU-28. the largest expansion was recorded in Romania. Taking into account that the projected consumption peak is increasing and energy consumption management for residential activities is an important measure for energy efficiency improvement since its ratio from total consumption can be around 25–30%. in this paper. we propose an informatics solution that assists both electricity suppliers/grid operators and consumers. It includes three models for electricity consumption optimization. profiles. clustering and forecast. By this solution. the daily operation of appliances can be optimized and scheduled to minimize the consumption peak and reduce the stress on the grid. For optimization purpose. we propose three algorithms for shifting the operation of the programmable appliances from peak to off-peak hours. This approach enables the supplier to apply attractive time-of-use tariffs due to the fact that by flattening the consumption peak. it becomes more predictable. and thus improves the strategies on the electricity markets.

This is the reason why in the past few years different mitigation strategies for the microclimate have been studied and examined. These strategies depend on those passive factors characterizing the urban setting that are able to affect the values of local meteorological variables. as the limit surfaces of the urban space (parterre and façades of the buildings). This paper examines the Cloister by Giuliano da Sangallo. which is part of the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The case study compares the present configuration of the Cloister with four other configurations characterized by some vegetation and materials with a high albedo by taking into consideration the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model. Microclimatic variables are calculated through numerical simulations performed by the ENVI-met software. Such a comparison is performed during a typical summer day. While examining the results it can be noticed how the strategy presenting the best results is the one with some vegetation. whereas the materials with a high albedo improve the microclimate if applied on surfaces characterized by a high sky view factor.

This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli. a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300-Part1. which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope. based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the non-alteration of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25%. This work shows how it is possible to improve the energy performance of an existing building achieving a significant energy saving with the respect of the building architecture. shape. function and the surrounding landscape.

When properly lit. monumental buildings can become to onlookers an essential part of the city. Nowadays. for design planners dealing with the improvement of buildings. whose architectural design should be valorized. the real challenge is to combine the lighting artistic requirements with scrupulous economic management in order to limit the energy demand and to respect the environment. For these reasons. this case study examines the lighting of the monumental façade and the cloister of St. Peter in Chains situated in the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The present lighting installation. characterized by metal halides. compact fluorescent and halogen lamps. is compared with an alternative scenario presenting LED lamps and scenographic lighting of the monumental façade. Such comparison is based on the evaluation of the lighting levels for different visual tasks and on energy and maintenance issues; the first analysis was performed through the software DIALux Evo 4.0. whereas the second was performed using ecoCALC. This study leads to the conclusion that the lighting levels of the solution presenting LED lamps are better than those of the present solution. and they comply with current standards. Finally. the higher costs of LED lamp installations and the scenographic lighting of the monumental façade are balanced by lower maintenance costs. with a payback period of seven years.

Aiming for energy efficiency and energy saving in end uses. there are wide and diversified improvement strategies. which include interventions on the building envelope and Heating. Ventilation. and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. with the introduction of renewable energy sources. The research aims at evaluating the building energy consumptions and Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). varying the airflow rates handled by the HVAC system. A Case Study (the Aula Magna of a university building) is analysed; an in-situ monitoring campaign was carried out to evaluate the trend of some environmental parameters that are considered to be significant when varying the external airflow rates handled by the HVAC system. Additionally. dynamic simulations were carried out. with the aim of evaluating the energy savings coming from the airflow rates reduction. The results of this case study highlight the opportunity to achieve significant energy savings. with only slight variations in IEQ; a 50% reduction in airflow rate would decrease energy consumption by up to 45.2%. while increasing the carbon dioxide concentration from 545 ppm to 655 ppm. while the Particulate Matter and Total Volatile Organic Compounds increase is insignificant.

An evaluation of the stimulation provided by the field of view can be performed by measuring the spectral radiance with a spectroradiometer and weighting this data with an efficiency curve. Different weights (physical. physiological and psychological) can lead to different analyses and consequently to different results. The proposed method allows an overall and simplified evaluation of the field of view based on spectral and luminance measures and a script that processes the luminous information. The final aim of this approach is to provide further information about the light stimulation reaching the retina and to supply a qualitative evaluation of the field of view. allowing to know how much stimulation is coming from a certain area within the visual field depending on the type of surface. basing on spectral and directional information.

However. the closure assumptions of the turbulence usually employed in CFD codes are not always physically based and adequate for all the flow regimes relating to practical applications. The starting point of this work is the performance assessment of the V2F (i.e..  − f) model implemented in Ansys Fluent for simulating the flow field in an idealized array of two-dimensional canyons. The V2F model has been used in the past to predict low-speed and wall-bounded flows. but it has never been used to simulate airflows in urban street canyons. The numerical results are validated against experimental data collected in the water channel and compared with other turbulence models incorporated in Ansys Fluent (i.e.. variations of both k-ε and k-ω models and the Reynolds stress model). The results show that the V2F model provides the best prediction of the flow field for two flow regimes commonly found in urban canopies. The V2F model is also employed to quantify the air-exchange rate (ACH) for a series of two-dimensional building arrangements. such as step-up and step-down configurations. having different aspect ratios and relative heights of the buildings. The results show a clear dependence of the ACH on the latter two parameters and highlight the role played by the turbulence in the exchange of air mass. particularly important for the step-down configurations. when the ventilation associated with the mean flow is generally poor.,True,SiRcte8AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,5,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2018/2189234/abs/,3538263294943925262,/scholar?cites=3538263294943925262,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2018/2189234/abs/,0,0,0

This phenomenon occurs in many practical applications. such as passive or ancient buildings not equipped with Heating. Ventilating and Air Conditioning HVAC systems and located in latitudes where the temperature greatly varies with Earth’s daily cycles. Despite that. the study of transient phenomena is often simplified. ie. considering negligible the thermal response of the indoor microclimate. An exact solution to enclosures whose microclimate is free to evolve under a periodic stabilized regime does not exist nowadays. also from an analytical point of view. The aim of this study is to parametrically analyze the thermal variations inside a room when a transient periodic temperature is applied on one side. The phenomenon has been numerically studied through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and analytically validated using a function that reproduces the daily variation of the outdoor temperature. The results of this research would lay the groundwork to develop analytical correlations to solve and predict the thermal behavior of environments subject to a periodic stabilized regime.

Dairy production process has considerable effect on climate change in various ways. and the scale of these effects depends on the practices of dairy industry. dairy farmers and feed growers. This study examined the life cycle of production of dairy products in Kermanshah city. For this purpose. the whole life was divided in two sections: production of raw milk in dairy farm and dairy products in dairy industry. In each section the energy consumption patterns and environmental burdens were evaluated. Based on the results. the consumed energy in dairy farm was 6286.29 MJ for amount of produced milk in month. Also animal feed was the greatest energy consumer with the value of 45.12% that the maximum amount of this value was for concentrate. The minimum consumption of energy was for the machinery with 0.92 MJ in a month. Results of life cycle assessment of dairy products showed that in dairy industry raw milk input causes most of impact categories especially land use. carcinogens and acidification. In dairy farms. concentrate was effective more than 90% in production of impact categories included: land use and carcinogens.

In order to stay within the Paris Agreement’s temperature rise limits. current and growing energy consumption will need to be significantly underpinned by deployment of low/non-carbon power generation. This work promotes power generation at the megawatt scale from solar photovoltaics (PV) systems deployed in untapped car parking areas. which are estimated to represent up to~ 6.6% of the urban footprint within cities. The methodology developed is globally applicable to support PV development. including site selection and PV array configuration. It is underpinned by a case study in a university campus. which has a similar footprint as assigned in cities for vehicle parking. The methodology demonstrates that less than 1% of the available parking spaces are affected by shadows from surrounding buildings or vegetation. The work shows that by utilising such parking areas within the selected campus a PV installation with a capacity of~ 36.4 MWp. which can generate~ 66.2 GWh of electricity annually. would be feasible. Financial analysis based on multiple scenarios indicates that a 50% return on investment is achievable over 25 years at an export tariff of USD¢ 4.5/kWh. which is commensurate with the latest granted bids for a similar export tariff.

A microgrid is usually comprised of small units of renewable energy sources. battery storage. combined heat and power (CHP) plants and most importantly. an energy management system (EMS). An EMS is responsible for the core functioning of a microgrid. which includes establishing continuous and reliable communication among all distributed generation (DG) units and ensuring well-coordinated activities. This research focuses on improving the performance of EMS. The problem at hand is the optimal scheduling of the generation units and battery storage in a microgrid. Therefore. EMS should ensure that the power is shared among different sources following an imposed scenario to meet the load requirements. while the operational costs of the microgrid are kept as low as possible. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem. To solve this problem. this research proposes an enhanced version of the most valuable player algorithm (MVPA) which is a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm. inspired by actual sporting events. The obtained results are compared with numerous well-known optimization algorithms to validate the efficiency of the proposed EMS.

This paper reports on an investigation into the relationship between the moisture content of epoxy resin samples and the phase resolved partial discharge activity measured during tree growth. The measured phase resolved partial discharge patterns showed a moisture dependent phase shift in the partial discharge activity relative the phase of the applied ac voltage. It was found that the conductivity increases with increasing the moisture content in the samples and the observed phase shifts in the partial discharge activity were attributed to increased electrical conductivity of the epoxy resin.,True,SuagepUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4290890/,1160497407098701514,/scholar?cites=1160497407098701514,,,,0,0,0

In regions such as the Middle East where dust is prevalent and rainfall is scarce. remedial measures are needed to reduce such impacts. Currently. various techniques are being employed to address such sand soiling ranging from mechanical (brushing) to active and passive electrical interventions. This research focuses on mechanical approaches encompassing module vibration. air and water jets. and combinations of these. A reconfigurable pilot-scale testbed of 8 kWp PV plant was installed on a carport shading system within the campus of King Abdulaziz University (KAU). Jeddah. Saudi Arabia. The functional PV carport was configured to allow water recovery and re-use within the testbed. Here. we discuss the overall cleaning design philosophy and approach. systems design. and how multiple cleaning configurations can be realised within the overall PV carport. Results indicate that in this location. sand soiling has a significant effect on performance of PV modules on a timescale of days. In addition. water jets optimised for high volume and low pressure were effective at reducing sand soiling with array power output increasing by over 27%. whilst air jets and module vibration were less effective in reducing soiling to an acceptable level. Overall. the testbed has provided a new approach to testing a combination of cleaning solutions in the field coupled with used water recovery. The proposed approach is important. as currently …,True,SuagepUAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,8,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/15/2923,1535085231283439409,/scholar?cites=1535085231283439409,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/15/2923/pdf,0,0,0
1310239,Potential for rooftop-mounted pv power generation to meet domestic electrical demand in saudi arabia: Case Study of a villa in jeddah,2019,Abdulsalam S Alghamdi,12,Energies,23,4411,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a large solar and wind energy resource. Through its Vision 2030 to exploit such resources. KSA is planning to install 9.5 GW of renewable energy power generation systems by 2030. through a mix of solar and wind energy. The government is planning to invest 109 billion US $ over the next 20 years for solar energy. The focus will be on solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar technologies at a national level. So far. the electricity demand in KSA is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels for generating power. This paper addresses the potential to utilize the solar radiation resource at a different scale and reduce the power demand from the grid. bringing collateral benefits for householders and the government alike. The work presents the results from monitoring the electricity consumption of two typical domestic buildings (villas) in Jeddah. KSA. The electricity consumption observations were associated with indoor environmental conditions to study how and when cooling demand affects final demand. The study investigated options to serve the observed demand profile of the villas with simulated power generation from arrays of PV panels installed on two buildings’ roofs. Finally. a model of dynamic solar radiation simulation was developed to assess the hourly electricity generation. and a cost-benefit analysis was conducted for different capacity PV systems scenarios. The results indicate that locally used rooftop PV output could reduce the household electrical demand from the grid by around 80% at the housing level and in combination with building refurbishment solutions. could result in additional …,True,SuagepUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,7,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/23/4411,14769193025548904171,/scholar?cites=14769193025548904171,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/23/4411/pdf,0,0,0

It is based on the supposition that dry band formation can be likened to the abrupt interruption of an electrical circuit by a switch. An arc is formed in this instance as in the breakdown of a dry band. It is proposed that methods used to suppress contact arcing and damage in a switch can be applied with equal validity to the suppression of dry band arcing and its damaging effect on surfaces. The energy in a switching transient can be removed from the sensitive contact breaker region by inclusion of capacitance.

Images of EL for 200 micron thick virgin and aged epoxy samples at different voltages were recorded using a CCD camera. The images were obtained by applying ac electric fields across the samples and exposing the CCD for 600s. The images were constructed from the read-out data using the same grey level for comparison. Images of the virgin and aged samples showed a difference in the emission with the virgin sample producing a more homogeneous emission compared with a rather inhomogeneous emission from the aged sample.

KSA,2017,Mostafa Mahdy and AbuBakr S Bahaj and Abdulsalam S Alghamdi,,Solar World Congress,,,,Under its Vision 2030. the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) announced an ambitious strategy to diversify their economy from oil dependency. One of the goals of the vision is an initial target to produce 9.5 GW of electricity from renewable energy sources. Offshore wind energy conversion is considered to be mature technology with more than 12 GW of installed capacity globally. Offshore wind has advantages when compared with onshore wind. such as. higher wind speed. reduced turbulence. minimal visual and noise impacts. KSA has two shorelines. one is laying on the Arabian Gulf and the other is on the Red Sea. The work presented here evaluates offshore wind potentials in in the East Coast of the Red Sea in KSA which was chosen due minimum restrictions and has no close oil extraction facilities. The evaluation was based on a Boolean Mask model linked coupled analysis undertaken in Geographical Information System developed for the Red Sea area.Using the UK’s London Array wind farm as a minimum required area for offshore wind farms. the work identifies ten different locations as possible areas for the first offshore wind farms in KSA. The analysis considered the deployment of two types of turbine of capacities 3.6 MW and 5MW. The results for the higher capacity turbine indicate that over 12.3 GW of offshore wind power can be generated from the identified sites. These results and the produced location maps could be used to help stakeholders in KSA in planning for the exploitation of offshore wind energy in KSA.

The material chosen for investigation was a clear casting polyester resin. whose mechanical properties could be systematically modified by the progressive plasticization of the material through the addition of controlled amounts of a plasticizing polyester resin. The erosion and tracking resistance of polyester resin appear to be influenced by the mechanical properties of the material. As the tensile strength and fracture toughness of the material are reduced by plasticization. the rate of erosion of material from the surface under dry conditions and the rate of tracking under wet conditions are both increased.

We focus on two key aspects that Vattenfall must address in its wind farm design process. The first is determining where to locate the turbines. This aspect is important because the placement of each turbine creates interference on the neighboring turbines. causing a power loss at the overall farm level. The optimizers must minimize this interference based on the wind conditions; however. they must also consider the other costs involved. which depend on factors such as the water depth or soil conditions at each position.

1310300,Mathematical optimization for social distancing,2020,Martina Fischetti and Matteo Fischetti and Jakob Stoustrup,,,,,,The spread of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 brought new challenges to our society. including a stronger focus on safety across all businesses. In particular. many countries have imposed a minimum social distance between people in order to ensure their safety. This brings new challenges to many customer-related businesses. such as restaurants. offices. etc.. on how to located their facilities under distancing constraints. We propose a parallelism between this problem and the one of locating wind turbines in an offshore area. Even if the two problems may seems very different. there are many analogies between them. In particular. both problems require fitting facilities (turbines or customers) in a given area while ensuring a minimum distance between them. Similarly to nearby customers who can infect each other. also nearby turbines “infect” each other by casting wind shadows (the so-called “wake effect”) that cause production losses. In both problems we want to minimize the interference/infection. The solution of both problems will therefore favor solutions where facilities are as spread as possible. The discovery of this parallelism between the two applications allowed us to apply a recently published approach for wind-farm layout design to produce optimized facility layouts subject to social distancing constraints as those arising in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. These methods allow us to challenge the current (manual) layouts and provide new insights on how to improve them. In particular we show that optimized layout are far from trivial to design and that Mathematical Optimization can make an impact. helping businesses while ensuring safety.,True,gUhWLEwAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matteo_Fischetti/publication/341708793_Mathematical_optimization_for_social_distancing/links/5ecfc64b92851c9c5e65affa/Mathematical-optimization-for-social-distancing.pdf,16463681940326320731,/scholar?cites=16463681940326320731,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matteo_Fischetti/publication/341708793_Mathematical_optimization_for_social_distancing/links/5ecfc64b92851c9c5e65affa/Mathematical-optimization-for-social-distancing.pdf,0,0,0

Being a new and still more competitive field. it is of major interest to investigate new techniques to solve the design challenges involved. In this paper. we consider optimization of the inter-array cable routing for offshore wind farms. taking power losses into account. Since energy losses in a cable depend on the load (ie wind). cable losses are estimated by considering a possibly large number wind scenarios. In order to deal with different wind scenarios efficiently we used a precomputing strategy. The resulting optimization problem considers two objectives: minimizing immediate costs (CAPEX) and minimizing costs due to power losses. This makes it possible to perform various what-if analyses to evaluate the impact of different preferences to CAPEX versus reduction of power losses. Thanks to the close collaboration with a leading energy company. we have been able to report results on a set of real-world instances. based on six existing wind parks. studying the economical impact of considering power losses in the cable routing design phase.,True,gUhWLEwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2017/61907/61907.pdf,15539415306882886628,/scholar?cites=15539415306882886628,,,https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2017/61907/61907.pdf,0,0,0

Proximity search is an alternative approach. still aimed at improving a given feasible solution: instead of modifying the constraints of the MIP at hand with the aim of reducing search space. one modifies the objective function to make the search easier. More specifically. proximity search replaces the objective function by a “proximity” one. with the goal of enhancing the heuristic behavior of the MIP black-box solver. The approach can be quite effective in quickly improving a given starting feasible solution. at least when the landscape of feasible solutions is not too irregular.

Communities living in remote and off-grid locations are often characterized by low access to resources and infrastructure facilities in general. besides the lack of access to electricity. Therefore. it is also observed that quite often. such communities have limited paying capacities and lower energy demand at the outset compared to communities where the grid has been extended. It is therefore important to think carefully about the ways in which end-users of off-grid solar PV pay for the services they are procuring from these systems.

De Montfort University,Scaling up of off-grid electrification is one of the key priorities of developing countries across the world trying to meet SE4ALL objective of universal energy access by 2030. However. scaling up off-grid electrification projects is beset with many challenges as most such projects end up becoming islands of excellence without being able to expand and deliver impacts at a larger scale. There are several reasons for this inability to scale up including lack of resources. lack of finance. policy and regulatory barriers. and lack of champions to steer the project. However. despite some evidence on the reasons for the success and failure of energy access projects and the abundance of literature on the subject of scaling up (as applied in other sectors). the concept of scaling up off-grid electrification is still nebulous. Through an intensive study of scaling up literature and selected case studies on off-grid electrification. this paper provided a systematic understanding of the concepts of scaling up and replication in the context of electricity access. The paper finds that financial assistance or support for an energy enterprises and or project implementation agencies is one of the critical factors for scaling up. The type of financial assistance is also depended on the stage where the entity is on its scaling up trajectory. Another key learning on the financing aspect is the need for ‘flexibility’both in terms of debt repayment terms as well as conditions that are tied it. The study also observes that performance milestones should incentivize the project developer to sustain a project and scale it up.

Emissions and Health Impacts,2010,AS Nagpure and RK Sharma and R Gurjar Sharma and Kumar BR,5,,1,014007,Nova Science Publisher,Most of the South Asian cities are experiencing rapid economic development. leading to a swift growth across infrastructure sectors. This growth in infrastructure has enhanced service delivery and improved quality of life of city inhabitants but is also the cause of severe air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO). 13 of the top 20 most polluted cities in the world are from India. Similarly. the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study indicates that outdoor air pollution was responsible for about 0.65 million premature deaths in India during the year 2010. Several of the available studies. including GBD and WHO. suggest that rising concentrations of particulate matter (PM) in the local air atmosphere in South Asian cities are responsible for most of the outdoor air pollution-related premature mortalities and other health risks. The level of PM concentration in many cities rivals the levels that existed in Europe and North America in the first decades of the 20th century. The rising PM pollution in South Asian region emerged as serious hazards for human health in South Asian cities during the last few decades. In this chapter. we aim to understand the contributions of various growing infrastructure sectors in local air pollution. especially for PM pollution for better policy interventions and sustainable growth.

While the links between energy and economic development are well understood. the authors bring new perspectives to the field (s). first. by explicitly linking energy and the environment by defining Energy-Based Economic Development (EBED) activities as focused on advanced. efficient. or lowemissions sources/technologies. This is important for two reasons: one. because it implies a long-term objective of emissions reductions for energy. and. two. because it links the environment and economic development. This builds helpfully on the existing literature on policy integration that underscores the importance of thinking beyond one’s discipline. one sector. and across uncoordinated policies to achieve sustainable development (Briassoulis. 2004). A positive interpretation of environmental and energy policies as underlying and supporting economic development is a powerful tool to foster political support. Second. EBED recognizes the different scales and distributed nature of many low-emissions technologies. This can signal an important shift in energy system design. planning. and operation. moving from the centralized legacy systems to a possibly new paradigm of distributed energy resources that could promote the democratization of energy decisionmaking. production. and use. This could shift the way people view access to energy and change the development possibilities they can envisage. making energy production a resource. a subtle …,True,v4jhG7AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karnamadakala_Rahul_Sharma/publication/303867393_Energy-Based_Economic_Development_How_Clean_Energy_Can_Drive_Development_and_Stimulate_Economic_Growth_by_SanyaCarley_and_SaraLawrence_London_UK_Springer-Verlag_2014_165_pp_12900_hardcover_Book_Review/links/5f775708458515b7cf62a3f9/Energy-Based-Economic-Development-How-Clean-Energy-Can-Drive-Development-and-Stimulate-Economic-Growth-by-SanyaCarley-and-SaraLawrence-London-UK-Springer-Verlag-2014-165-pp-12900-hardcover-Book.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karnamadakala_Rahul_Sharma/publication/303867393_Energy-Based_Economic_Development_How_Clean_Energy_Can_Drive_Development_and_Stimulate_Economic_Growth_by_SanyaCarley_and_SaraLawrence_London_UK_Springer-Verlag_2014_165_pp_12900_hardcover_Book_Review/links/5f775708458515b7cf62a3f9/Energy-Based-Economic-Development-How-Clean-Energy-Can-Drive-Development-and-Stimulate-Economic-Growth-by-SanyaCarley-and-SaraLawrence-London-UK-Springer-Verlag-2014-165-pp-12900-hardcover-Book.pdf,0,0,0

1310364,A Manifesto for Patchwork Ethnography,2020,Gökçe Günel and Saiba Varma and Chika Watanabe,,Society for Cultural Anthropology,,,,Even prior to the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic.“traditional” anthropological fieldwork was in trouble. For some time now. ethnographers have been questioning fieldwork truisms: separations between “field” and “home.” the gendered (masculinist) assumptions of the always available and up-for-anything fieldworker. and anthropology’s proclivities toward suffering subjects (Anjaria and Anjaria 2020; Robbins 2013). At the same time. neoliberal university labor conditions. the “feminization” of anthropology. expectations of work-life balance. environmental concerns. and feminist and decolonial critiques of anthropology have demanded a rethinking of fieldwork as a process that entails spending a year or longer in a faraway place. Family obligations. precarity. other hidden. stigmatized. or unspoken factors—and now Covid-19—have made long-term. in-person fieldwork difficult. if not impossible. for many scholars. The pandemic has evaporated many a future fieldwork plan and the prospect of continued ethnographic research in the same vein seems uncertain. A growing number of medical experts and observers believe that we might never return to “normal.” suggesting that long-term “traditional” fieldwork could become an impossibility.While ethnographers have been adapting to various fieldwork challenges through methods such as online research. multi-sited fieldwork. auto-ethnography. and by attending to research subjects who are mobile. familiar. or themselves experts (Harrison 1991; Marcus 1995; Gupta and Ferguson 1997; Amit 2000; Burawoy 2000; Faubion 2009; Faubion and Marcus 2009; Nagar 2014; Papacharissi 2015; Huang 2016 …,True,lPPk6twAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,10,https://www.academia.edu/download/63609064/A_Manifesto_for_Patchwork_Ethnography___Society_for_Cultural_Anthropology20200612-63472-1ehbn5c.pdf,381436489507426317,/scholar?cites=381436489507426317,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/63609064/A_Manifesto_for_Patchwork_Ethnography___Society_for_Cultural_Anthropology20200612-63472-1ehbn5c.pdf,0,0,0

Globalization has failed to create a just society; while enriching a minority. it left the masses dissatisfied. As a result. income inequalities and rising levels of poverty continue to persist in different parts of the globe. especially in the less developed countries. although the industrialized countries are not immune from the poverty problems. Poverty is by no means a new phenomenon. However. in recent decades it is very much on the international agenda with the impact of organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). World Bank (WB). International Labor Organization (ILO) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The emergence and spread of microcredit programs as a new strategy of poverty alleviation. through which the poor receive small loans on the basis of their membership to self-regulating groups. has been inspired by this new concern on the part of global actors. Governments. NGOs and the private sector have worked in accordance in order to supply microcredit to the poverty stricken. This type of poverty alleviation mechanism emphasizes the unavailability of financial resources to the poor as a significant factor that induces poverty. Microfinance helps the poor become self employed and thus generates income and reduces poverty. This paper focuses on the microcredit operations in the context of Turkey.

This is due to various advantages they present. particularly the possibility of working in either autonomous mode or grid connected. which makes them highly versatile structures for incorporating intermittent generation and energy storage. However. they pose safety issues in being able to support a local island in case of utility disconnection. Thus. in the event of an unintentional island situation. they should be able to detect the loss of mains and disconnect for self-protection and safety reasons. Most of the anti-islanding schemes are implemented within control of single generation devices. such as dc-ac inverters used with solar electric systems being incompatible with the concept of microgrids due to the variety and multiplicity of sources within the microgrid.

1310389,Adaptive Protection System for Microgrids Based on a Robust Optimization Strategy,2018,Oscar Núñez-Mata and Rodrigo Palma-Behnke and Felipe Valencia and Patricio Mendoza-Araya and Guillermo Jiménez-Estévez,11,Energies,2,308,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The development of a proper protection system is essential for the secure and reliable operation of microgrids. In this paper. a novel adaptive protection system for microgrids is presented. The protection scheme is based on a protective device that includes two directional elements which are operating in an interleaved manner. namely overcurrent and undervoltage elements. The proposed protection scheme can be implemented in microprocessor-based relays. To define the settings of the protective device. a robust programming approach was proposed considering a finite set of fault scenarios. The scenarios are generated based on the predictions about the available energy and the demand. For each decision step. a robust optimization problem is solved online. which is based on forecasting with a confidence band to represent the uncertainty. The system is tested and compared using real data sets from an existing microgrid in northern Chile. To assess the performance of the proposed protection system. fault scenarios not considered in the optimization were taken into account. The results obtained show that the proposed protective device is able to manage those failure scenarios. as well as those included in the tuning of the settings. Practical considerations are also discussed.

Until recently. only diesel generators were able to assure a safe and reliable supply in exchange for very high costs for fuel transportation and system operation. Transmission system operators (TSOs) are increasingly seeking to replace traditional energy models based on large groups of conventional generation units with mixed solutions where diesel groups are held as backup generation and important advantages are provided by renewable energy sources. The grid codes determine the technical requirements to be fulfilled by the generators connected in any electrical network. but regulations applied to isolated grids are more demanding. In technical literature it is rather easy to find and compare grid codes for interconnected electrical systems. However. the existing literature is incomplete and sparse regarding isolated grids. This paper aims to review the current state of isolated systems and grid codes applicable to them. specifying points of comparison and defining the guidelines to be followed by the upcoming regulations.

The existing approaches to studying and ensuring the stability of microgrids are largely incapable of providing the structural certainty to promote true plug-and-play operation. particularly with changing network conditions. Thus. there is a need and an opportunity to develop a stability criterion that can truly promote the plug-and-play capabilities of a microgrid.

Recent work has shown that microgird stability can be determined by analysis of small signal impedances at the point of interconnection. The purpose of small signal impedance measurement is to verify the analytical models of single devices and to provide measured impedances where analytical models are not available. so that stability may be established. Small signal impedance measurement typically involves in-situ injection of currents or voltages superimposed upon the operating system.

An aggregation of microgrids can enable the participation of these resources in the main system’s energy and ancillary services market. The traditional minimum-cost operation. however. can undermine microgrid’s ability to hold reserve capacity for operation in islanded mode and can rapidly degrade distributed batteries. This paper studies the impacts of various operational strategies from distributed energy storage plants on their revenues and on market prices. considering an array of microgrids that act in a synchronized fashion. The operational model minimizes the entire electric power system cost. considering transmission-connected and distributed energy resources. and capturing capacity degradation of batteries as part of the cost function. Additionally. microgrid-based. distributed batteries can provide energy arbitrage and both system-level and microgrid-level security services. Through several case studies. we demonstrate the economic impacts of distributed energy storage providing these services. including also capacity degradation. We also demonstrate the benefits of providing reserve services in terms of extra revenue and battery lifespan. Finally. we conclude that limitations in the provision of system-level services from distributed batteries due to degradation considerations and higher microgrid-level security requirements may. counterintuitively. increase system-level revenues for storage owners. if such degradation considerations …,True,N-ZnXtoAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/19/5235,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/19/5235/pdf,0,0,0

Water desalination plants emerged as one of the most important alternatives to overcome the shortage of water resources especially in desertified countries like Libya. Boilers are the main part in thermal desalination plants which depends on steam as the working fluid to heat and evaporate the seawater.  with a capacity of 80 tons/hr of superheated steam at . Due to operating conditions. there was a decrease in steam boilers productivity and low efficiency. Heavy black smoke in chimneys was also detected. This work investigates the performance of the above mentioned boilers to determine the actual causes of these negative results by comparing the design values ​​with different operating readings data. The results show a decrease in the efficiency of the boilers for low loading rates. which is affected by the air/fuel ratio. The deviation of this ratio from the design values ​​leads to low efficiency and the emergence of heavy smoke in the chimneys. which causes deposits on the boiler pipes reducing the effectiveness of heat exchanger and therefore the thermal efficiency. The study also shows that the long operation suspension of the boilers in the first years of its life. due to the lack of discharge network and electricity cutoffs resulted in bad effect on the pipes conditions. The last led to the pipes deterioration resulting in water leaks and thus low boilers evaporation rates.,True,fAyA9j0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://dspace.elmergib.edu.ly/handle/123456789/45,,,,,http://dspace.elmergib.edu.ly/bitstream/handle/123456789/45/CEST_3_077.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Zuara desalination plant contains three production units of a multi-effect type with a design capacity of 40.000 𝑚3 𝑑𝑎𝑦⁄. The plant has 28 housing units for the staff of the plant. The location of the housing units near the beach gives it an amazing weather in the summer. but in winter it needs heating. Due to the availability of hot water in the desalination plant. it can be used to heat these units. This work studies the extent of hot water produced in the heating of housing units. This could be done by calculating the heating loads of residential buildings and selecting the appropriate types of heating units and the design of the network of pipes; including the calculation of size. type of pipes used. valves and fittings needed for the delivery of hot water to the residential buildings. Furthermore. the appropriate flow rates and pressures of the system and the choice of type. quantity and capacity of the necessary pumps are also demonstrated.

Two cultivation technologies are taken into account: the open raceway pond and the flat panel photobioreactor. For each technology. the model is able to evaluate the microalgae areal and volumetric productivity and the energy production and consumption. Differently from the most common existing models in literature. which deal with a specific part of the overall cultivation process. the model presented here includes all physical and chemical quantities that mostly affect microalgae growth: the equation of the specific growth rate for the microalgae is influenced by CO2 and nutrients concentration in the water. light intensity. temperature of the water in the reactor and by the microalgae species being considered. All these input parameters can be tuned to obtain reliable predictions.

Layout improvement can be proposed by combining system analysis with engineers’ judgments; however. optimal flowsheet synthesis is not trivial and can be best addressed by mathematical programming. In addition. multiple objectives are always involved for decision makers. Therefore. this paper reviews progressively the methodologies of system evaluation. optimization. and synthesis for the conceptual design of energy systems. and highlights the applications to thermal power plants. which are still supposed to play a significant role in the near future. For system evaluation. both conventional and advanced exergy-based analysis methods. including (advanced) exergoeconomics are deeply discussed and compared methodologically with recent developments. The advanced analysis is highlighted for further revealing the source. avoidability. and interactions among exergy destruction or cost of different components. For optimization and layout synthesis. after a general description of typical optimization problems and the solving methods. the superstructure-based and-free concepts are introduced and intensively compared by emphasizing the automatic generation and identification of structural alternatives.

In this paper. a new systematic approach to select and rank different biorefinery conversion pathways is proposed using the Integer-Cut Constraint (ICC) method applied to a MILP problem.

Thermal and Flow Engineering Laboratory,Ethanol production sites utilizing sugarcane as feedstock are usually located in regions with high land availability and decent solar radiation. This offers the opportunity to cover parts of the process energy demand with concentrated solar power (CSP) and thereby increase the fuel production and carbon conversion efficiency. A plant is examined that produces 1st and 2nd generation ethanol by fermentation of sugars (from sugarcane) and enzymatic hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic residues (bagasse). respectively. Enzymatic hydrolysis is a promising alternative for 2nd generation biofuels due to its high conversion efficiency and low environmental impact. In conventional ethanol production processes. electrical and thermal power is delivered to the system by burning parts of the feedstock to drive a steam based cogeneration cycle (between 400 and 800K). Introducing high temperature thermal power (at 800K) from a solar trough field coupled with sensible heat storage. for continuous operation. offers the opportunity to replace the heat generated from biomass burning. and thus increase the product yield. In this work. the potential for process integration of a solar trough field coupled with packed bed thermal storage to a 1st and 2nd generation ethanol production site is evaluated by means of pinch analysis. Decision parameters such as the solar fraction. the percentage of bagasse to 2nd generation. and the solar field size are optimized via multiobjective optimization based on evolutionary algorithms to maximize the carbon conversion efficiency and minimize the total annual cost for a plant located in Ribeirao Preto.

The performance of a power-to-methane system is almost defined by the type and the design point of the electrolyzer. The inherent high electrical efficiency of solid oxide electrolyzer makes it rather promising for a highly efficient power-to-methane system. However. the large amount of heat needed for steam generation limits the overall efficiency of a standalone electrolyzer. Fortunately. the strong exothermic methanation reaction offers a good opportunity for heat integration. thus possibly increasing the overall HHV efficiency above 85%. Regarding to this context. a power-to-methane test rig based on a full stack of solid oxide electrolyzer is currently under design and demonstration. In this paper. the critical issues related to the design of such an integrated system are addressed:(1) selecting the nominal operating point of the electrolyzer to minimize electrical heating at no cost of efficiency and (2) maximizing the benefit from the system integration at no cost of operation flexibility. A quasi 2D model of the electrolyzer considering detailed mass transport across the electrodes has been developed and calibrated to understand the electrolyzer performance that is not revealed by experiments.

Chapters,Cement production is an energy intensive industrial process that requires heat to be supplied at high temperature levels under the constraints of gas-solid heat exchange phenomena and the kinetics of chemical reactions. In this paper. the use of Pinch Analysis and Process Integration techniques to optimize the energy efficiency of the cement production will be explored. The aim is to use process modeling to characterize cooling and heating requirements of the process. focusing on the gas-solid heat exchanges while including waste fuel utilization. The heat cascade model is adapted to account for gas-solid and gas-gas heat recovery used to calculate the heat recovery in the process.

Inc.,Distric Energy System (DES) represents a promising opportunity to improve energy efficiency and boost the decarbonization of the European energy sector. If most of the studies focus on small consumers typically located within urban areas. large energy users like hospitals. university campuses or airports. constitute complex and unique systems with great potential for energy and cost savings. The aim of this work is to propose a robust method to optimize the preliminary design and operation of local DES characterized by complex non-residential buildings. Decision variables include the optimal set of technologies to be installed (type. size. location). their operating schedule. together with temperature and configuration of the thermal network. Focus is given to heat pumping technologies and in particular to the comparison between different degrees of centralization and respectively. decentralization. The mathematical model is based on a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation including a set of heat cascade constraints to ensure the feasibility of the heat exchanges. A case study is generated to represent a building-stock constituted by large non-residential buildings. connected to a central plant through an existing network infrastructure. The users differ for power and temperature demand. both estimated as linear function of the ambient temperature. Results show that the optimum degree of decentralization is highly influenced by the distribution of the heat demand among the users at the different temperatures.

Notestein,10,ACS Catalysis,,13008–13018,,Lewis acidic Ti-SiO2 materials are workhorse oxidation catalysts. and they range from microporous substituted zeolites to meso/macroporous materials. often with tradeoffs between steric accessibility and activity. In this study. SiO2 is deposited over the active sites of a macroporous. highly dispersed Ti-SiO2 catalyst. with or without an organic template. SiO2 deposition is shown to impact the local environment around epoxidation active sites without altering the active site or introducing diffusion limitations for the representative bulky alkene limonene. Thus. intrinsic activation enthalpies remain nearly constant (45 ± 3 kJ/mol) across all materials and controls. but templated SiO2 deposition gives an apparent activation enthalpy (9 kJ/mol) much lower than that of the other materials tested because of its strong limonene adsorption. This demonstrates independent control of the active site. its immediate surroundings. and …,True,qK1BX5MAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,2,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.0c02937,16993499437854821443,/scholar?cites=16993499437854821443,,,,0,0,0

Wilcox and Changming Liu and Christopher Paolucci and Rajamani Gounder and David W. Flaherty,,ChemRxiv,,,,Cu-exchanged zeolites activate dioxygen to form active sites for partial methane oxidation (PMO). nitrogen oxide decomposition. and carbon monoxide oxidation. Apparent rates of O2 activation depend both on the intrinsic kinetics of distinct Cu site types and the distributions of such sites within a given zeolite. which depend on the density and arrangement of the framework Al atoms. Here. we use hydrothermal synthesis methods to control the arrangement of framework Al sites in chabazite (CHA) zeolites and. in turn. the distinct Cu site types formed. Time-resolved in situ resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals the kinetics of O2 adsorption and activation within these well-defined Cu-CHA materials and the concomitant structural evolution of copper-oxygen (CuxOy) complexes. which are interpreted alongside Cu (I) oxidation kinetics extracted from in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Raman spectra of several plausible CuxOy species simulated using density functional theory suggest that experimental spectra (λex= 532 nm) capture the formation of mono (μ-oxo) dicopper species (ZCuOCuZ). Transient experiments show that the timescales required to form CuxOy structures that no longer change in Raman spectra correspond to the durations of oxidative treatments that maximize CH3OH yields in stoichiometric PMO cycles (approximately 2 h). Yet. these periods extend well beyond the timescales for the complete conversion of the initial Cu (I) intermediates to their Cu (II) states (< 0.3 h. reflected in XANES spectra). which demonstrates that CuxOy complexes continue to evolve structurally following rapid oxidation.

Surendranath,,ChemRxiv,,,,Heterogeneous aqueous-phase aerobic oxidations are an important emerging class of catalytic transformations. particularly for upgrading next generation bio-derived substrates. The mechanism of these reactions and the precise role of O2 in particular remains unclear. Herein. we test the hypothesis that thermochemical aerobic oxidation proceeds via two coupled electrochemical half-reactions for oxygen reduction and substrate oxidation. We collect electrochemical and thermochemical data on common noble metal catalysts under identical reaction/transport environments. and nd that the electrochemical polarization curves of the O2 reduction and the substrate oxidation half-reaction closely predict the mixed potential of the catalyst measured in operando during thermochemical catalysis across 13 diverse variables spanning reaction conditions. catalyst composition. reactant identity. and pH. Additionally. we nd that driving the oxidation half-reaction reaction electrochemically in the absence of O2 at the mixed potential leads to very similar rates and selectivities as for the thermochemical reaction in all cases examined. These ndings strongly indicate that the role of O2 in thermochemical aerobic oxidation is solely as an electron scavenger that provides an incipient electrochemical driving force for substrate oxidation. These studies provide a quantitative and predictive link between thermochemical and electrochemical catalysis. thereby enabling the rational design of new thermochemical liquid-phase aerobic oxidation schemes by applying the principles of electrochemistry.,True,qK1BX5MAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-241905/latest.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-241905/latest.pdf,0,0,0

Shukla and David W. Flaherty,,ChemRxiv,,,,Solvent structures that surround active sites reorganize during catalysis and influence the stability of surface intermediates. Within the pores of a zeolite. H2O molecules form hydrogen-bonded structures that differ significantly from bulk H2O. Spectroscopic measurements and molecular dynamics simulations show that H2O molecules form bulk-like three-dimensional structures within 1.3 nm cages. while H2O molecules coalesce into oligomeric one-dimensional chains distributed throughout zeolite frameworks when the pore diameter is smaller than 0.65 nm. The differences between the motifs of these solvent structures provide opportunities to manipulate enthalpy-entropy compensation relationships and significantly increase rates of catalytic turnover events. Here. we explain how the reorganization of these pore size-dependent H2O structures during alkene epoxidation catalysis gives rise to entropy gains that increase turnover rates by up to 400-fold.

1310504,A robust optimization model for lot sizing with dynamic demands,2016,Aurora Rostenila and Carles Sitompul,,"Proceedings Asia Pacific Industrial Engineering and Management Society (APIEMS), Taipei",,,,In today’s competitive world. it is imperative that a manufacturer possesses a good production and inventory planning model because customer demands are becoming more dynamic and difficult to forecast. To model the uncertainties of demands at each period. we use three different scenarios of demands mimicking a symmetric triangle distribution. In theory. a larger number of scenarios would bring about a closer look to the real world. Unfortunately. it would also exacerbate the problem exponentially. We propose a lot sizing model with stochastic and dynamic demands using a well-known robust optimization approach. We implement the model using AMPL (A mathematical programming Language) program and test it for different parameters. The result shows that the robust optimization approach provides small variances of cost functions even when we used only three scenarios at each period of demands.,True,JtJKCRoAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,2,http://apiems2016.conf.tw/site/userdata/1087/papers/0254.pdf,8074325562543416304,/scholar?cites=8074325562543416304,,,http://apiems2016.conf.tw/site/userdata/1087/papers/0254.pdf,0,0,0

It is observed that the annual demand in the first stage (semi-finished product) is stable while the weekly demand in the second stage (item product) is lumpy. A typical hierarchical production planning model considers the holding costs at the aggregate level and setup costs at the operational level. In this practical case. the setup cost in the first stage is considerably higher than the setup cost in the second stage. An integrated hierarchical planning is proposed to solve this problem where the semi-finished production in the first stage (i.e. aggregate level) is disaggregated into item production in the second stage (i.e. detailed level).

Wind speed forecasting is a vital problem in wind power industry. However. individual forecasting models ignore the significance of data preprocessing and model parameter optimization. which may lead to poor forecasting performance. In this paper. a novel hybrid [k.

The fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition technique is initially conducted in the preprocessing stage to reconstruct data. while a novel modified FPA (flower pollination algorithm) incorporating a conjugate gradient (CG) is proposed for searching for the optimal parameters of the [k.

However. wind energy potential assessment and forecasting remain difficult and challenging research topics at present. Traditional wind energy assessment and forecasting models usually ignore the problem of data pre-processing as well as parameter optimization. which leads to low accuracy. Therefore. this paper aims to assess the potential of wind energy and forecast the wind speed in four locations in China based on the data pre-processing technique and swarm intelligent optimization algorithms. In the assessment stage. the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. ant colony (AC) algorithm. firefly algorithm (FA) and genetic algorithm (GA) are used to estimate the two unknown parameters in the Weibull distribution. Then. the wind energy potential assessment results obtained by three data-preprocessing approaches are compared to recognize the best data-preprocessing approach and process the original wind speed time series. While in the forecasting stage. by considering the pre-processed wind speed time series as the original data. the CS and AC optimization algorithms are adopted to optimize three neural networks. namely. the Elman neural network. back propagation neural network. and wavelet neural network. The comparison results demonstrate that the new proposed wind energy assessment and speed forecasting techniques produce promising assessments and predictions and perform better than the single assessment and forecasting components.

1310522,Data analysis and forecasting of tuberculosis prevalence rates for smart healthcare based on a novel combination model,2018,Jiyang Wang and Chen Wang and Wenyu Zhang,8,Applied sciences,9,1693,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In recent years. healthcare has attracted much attention. which is looking for more and more data analytics in healthcare to relieve medical problems in medical staff shortage. ageing population. people living alone. and quality of life. Data mining. analysis. and forecasting play a vital role in modern social and medical fields. However. how to select a proper model to mine and analyze the relevant medical information in the data is not only an extremely challenging problem. but also a concerning problem. Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem despite recent and continued progress in prevention and treatment. There is no doubt that the effective analysis and accurate forecasting of global tuberculosis prevalence rates lay a solid foundation for the construction of an epidemic disease warning and monitoring system from a global perspective. In this paper. the tuberculosis prevalence rate time series for four World Bank income groups are targeted. Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests are conducted to determine whether the differences of tuberculosis prevalence rates for different income groups are statistically significant or not. and a novel combined forecasting model with its weights optimized by a recently developed artificial intelligence algorithm—cuckoo search—is proposed to forecast the hierarchical tuberculosis prevalence rates from 2013 to 2016. Numerical results show that the developed combination model is not only simple. but is also able to satisfactorily approximate the actual tuberculosis prevalence rate. and can be an effective tool in mining and analyzing big data in the medical field.

1310524,Reliability analysis and overload capability assessment of oil-immersed power transformers,2016,Chen Wang and Jie Wu and Jianzhou Wang and Weigang Zhao,9,Energies,1,43,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Smart grids have been constructed so as to guarantee the security and stability of the power grid in recent years. Power transformers are a most vital component in the complicated smart grid network. Any transformer failure can cause damage of the whole power system. within which the failures caused by overloading cannot be ignored. This research gives a new insight into overload capability assessment of transformers. The hot-spot temperature of the winding is the most critical factor in measuring the overload capacity of power transformers. Thus. the hot-spot temperature is calculated to obtain the duration running time of the power transformers under overloading conditions. Then the overloading probability is fitted with the mature and widely accepted Weibull probability density function. To guarantee the accuracy of this fitting. a new objective function is proposed to obtain the desired parameters in the Weibull distributions. In addition. ten different mutation scenarios are adopted in the differential evolutionary algorithm to optimize the parameter in the Weibull distribution. The final comprehensive overload capability of the power transformer is assessed by the duration running time as well as the overloading probability. Compared with the previous studies that take no account of the overloading probability. the assessment results obtained in this research are much more reliable.

1310525,Research on combined model based on multi-objective optimization and application in wind speed forecast,2019,Shenghui Zhang and Yuewei Liu and Jianzhou Wang and Chen Wang,9,Applied Sciences,3,423,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Wind power is an important part of a power system. and its use has been rapidly increasing as compared with fossil energy. However. due to the intermittence and randomness of wind speed. system operators and researchers urgently need to find more reliable wind-speed prediction methods. It was found that the time series of wind speed not only has linear characteristics. but also nonlinear. In addition. most methods only consider one criterion or rule (stability or accuracy). or one objective function. which can lead to poor forecasting results. So. wind-speed forecasting is still a difficult and challenging problem. The existing forecasting models based on combination-model theory can adapt to some time-series data and overcome the shortcomings of the single model. which achieves poor accuracy and instability. In this paper. a combined forecasting model based on data preprocessing. a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) with three objective functions and four models (two hybrid nonlinear models and two linear models) is proposed and was successfully applied to forecasting wind speed. which not only overcomes the issue of forecasting accuracy. but also solves the difficulties of forecasting stability. The experimental results show that the stability and accuracy of the proposed combined model are better than the single models. improving the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) range from 0.007% to 2.31%. and the standard deviation mean absolute percentage error (STDMAPE) range from 0.0044 to 0.3497.

However. it is difficult to achieve a good forecasting performance due to the randomness and intermittency characteristics of wind speed time series. Current forecasting models based on neural network theory could adapt to various types of time series data; however. these models ignore the importance of data pre-processing and model parameter optimization. which leads to poor forecasting accuracy. In this paper. a new hybrid model is developed for short-term multi-step wind speed forecasting. which includes four modules:(1) the data pre-processing module;(2) the optimization module;(3) the hybrid nonlinear forecasting module and (4) the evaluation module. In order to estimate the forecasting ability of the proposed hybrid model. 10 min wind speed data were applied in this paper as a case study. The experimental results in six real forecasting cases indicate that the proposed hybrid model can provide not only accurate but also stable performance in terms of multi-step wind speed forecasting can be considered an effective tool in planning and dispatching for smart grids.

As a clean and renewable resource. wind energy plays an increasingly vital role in reducing air pollution and wind power generation becomes an important way to produce electrical power. Therefore. accurate wind power and wind speed forecasting are in need. In this research. a novel short-term wind speed forecasting portfolio has been proposed using the following three procedures: (I) data preprocessing: apart from the regular normalization preprocessing. the data are preprocessed through empirical model decomposition (EMD). which reduces the effect of noise on the wind speed data; (II) artificially intelligent parameter optimization introduction: the unknown parameters in the support vector machine (SVM) model are optimized by the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm; (III) parameter optimization approach modification: an improved parameter optimization approach. called the SDCS model. based on the CS algorithm and the steepest descent (SD) method is proposed.

Different from large-scale hydropower. GWVPP is a micro hydropower plant that harvest energy from water vortex formed in a cylindrical basin. It is advantageous due to its low hydraulic head requirement as well as positive impacts on both environments and social. Experimental approach was taken in this paper to study the effects of inlet flow rate and penstock’s geometry of GWVPP on performance of GWVPP. The outlet and basin diameter were fixed at 72mm and 400mm respectively. Inlet flow rates were varied from 5.6 m3/h to 8.8 m3/h while three penstock model A to C have increasing feeding width but same model length while penstock D to F have same feeding width as penstock A but reducing model length. It was discovered that penstock B and C reduced the overall performance of GWVPP while the rest of the penstock have insignificant effects on GWVPP’s efficiency. Also. higher inlet flow rate was also discovered to generally increase the efficiency of GWVPP.

But due to inefficient use of the same the country is loosing a large amount of energy every year. The available source is rice husk. wheat husk. sawdust. rice straw etc. These residues have low heat release rate per unit volume and high transportation and storage costs when used as received condition. In Bangladesh biomass residues are conventionally used as roofing material. cattle feed. raw material for paper mills. direct burning (for cooking) etc. Briquetting of biomass is an economically viable solution to these problems. The information obtained from the physical survey suggests that about 3.537 thousand Metric Tons of rice husk 117 thousand Metric Tons of sawdust. 1.470 thousand Metric Tons of wheat straw. 2.607 thousand Metric Tons of bagasse and 22.928 thousand Metric Tons of rice straw are produced annually. At present about 907 briquetting machines are running in Bangladesh. In a robust calculation it is found that about 18.500 machines can run with the available source of biomass residue. In Bangladesh mainly heated–die screw–press type machine is normally used. The main problem of this machine is the life of screw. Mainly the tips of the screw wear within a very short time (3–4 hours). Resurfacing by XHD N6715 and Chrom Carb N6006 increase the life of the screw. Finally two electrodes are selected for resurfacing of the screw (Duroid 650R and hard craft 650 N). which shows good result and locally available in the market.

Most experimental studies on water jet pumps mainly carried out to assess the maximum efficiency. But maximum efficiency occurs when the suction lift is relatively small for a given head loss through the pump. which implies. when the suction flow rate is maximum. However. suction lift is inversely proportional to flow rate. But in the field of application there are many cases (such as drainage. dredging. well-pumping and other systems) where suction lift is more important factor than any other for water jet pumps. which gives importance to the assessment of depending factor of suction lift of water jet pumps. Six different jet pumps of two different nominal diameter each of three different nozzle to throat area ratio were made to carry out this experiment. The results revealed that the nozzle-to-throat area ratio was an important parameter to characterize the suction lift of the jet pumps. but nominal diameter had a negligible play role.,True,S_qEOb4AAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC,3,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.656.1013&rep=rep1&type=pdf,17260346395085869687,/scholar?cites=17260346395085869687,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.656.1013&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Solar chimney creates air flow due to stack effect caused by temperature difference between ambient and inside wall. In the solar chimney. solar energy is harvested by the inner wall that cause temperature rise compare to ambient. Therefore. the efficiency of the solar chimney depends on the availability of solar energy as well as the solar intensity. In addition. it is very hard to get good ventilation at night time by using a solar chimney. To overcome this problem one of the suitable valid option is to integrate solar chimney with turbine ventilator. A new type of solar chimney is designed and fluid flow analyzed with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software.

The objective of this work was to develop a real-time assessment framework for evaluating air-temperature inside an insect-proof net-screen greenhouse in tropical lowlands of Malaysia prior to cultivation of tomato. Mathematical description of a growth response model was implemented and used in a computer application. A custom-designed data acquisition system was built for collecting 6 months of air-temperature data. during July to December 2014. For each measured air-Temperature (T). an optimality degree. denoted by opt (T). was calculated with respect to different light conditions (sun. cloud. night) and different growth stages.

A practical control strategy for filling (charging) and emptying (discharging) of the buffer. based on a virtual value (co-state) of the stored heat (the state). is suggested and illustrated by simulation. Heating and ventilation decisions are obtained by maximizing. at each time step. the virtual increase in value of the greenhouse system (including stored heat). As long as the heat buffer is neither empty nor full. the virtual value (co-state) of the stored heat remains constant. When the buffer is full (towards the end of a day). this value is gradually decreased. until the buffer starts to discharge.

Collected data from a net-screen covered greenhouse were processed by a computer model that utilized a mathematical approach to simulate tomato's growth responses (GR) to air temperature at early growth and development growth stages. Orthogonal projection was applied on three-dimensional GR plots to create top-view sketch to demonstrate variations with respect to changes in hours and days.

1310608,Energy management in wastewater treatment systems: biogas energy recovery management application,2015,Luke Hellgren and Olga Kavvada and Cody Phelps,,Energy Systems and Control,,1-13,,Anaerobic digestion is an established technology for the treatment of wastewater. This process utilizes bacteria to break down organics in wastewater under oxygenfree conditions. which naturally creates biogas as a byproduct. Primarily a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide. biogas is a valuable resource that can potentially be used for electricity generation. By capturing and recovering this typically flared waste stream. some of the grid electricity demand of the wastewater treatment plant can be offset through a combined cycle natural gas electricity generation technology. Because biogas generation does not always match the energy demand of a wastewater treatment plant. electricity consumption must be optimized with respect to energy source (biogas and grid) in order to minimize cost. This report plans to model the energy potential of a wastewater treatment plant and optimally manage the energy resources to minimize the variable electricity costs. Environmental pressures on low carbon policies and sustainable energy sources enhance the potential for biogas reuse at the wastewater treatment facilities. especially if the economics are favorable. Our results showcase that optimal biogas energy management can significantly reduce costs. with up to a 90+% reduction in electricity charges.,True,62LZa2wAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,3,http://ecal.berkeley.edu/files/ce295/projects/S15/kavvada--olga_4891467_57249569_CE%20295%20Final%20Report%20-%20Biogas%20Generation.pdf,5246129012751575756,/scholar?cites=5246129012751575756,,,http://ecal.berkeley.edu/files/ce295/projects/S15/kavvada--olga_4891467_57249569_CE%20295%20Final%20Report%20-%20Biogas%20Generation.pdf,0,0,0

This expectation. however. comes with a large cost as water and wastewater are inherently energy intensive services. In the United States (US). the energy for treatment and delivery of water emits more than 45 million tons of greenhouse gases (GHG) annually. 2 This is equivalent to 10% of all the annual GHG emissions occurring in California per year3. In California. 7.7% of electricity consumption is dedicated to energy for pumping and treatment of water. not accounting for the electricity used inside the households. 4Understanding the relationship between water. energy and GHG emissions is important for decision-making. especially when in the context of managing our limited water sources. Energy is used throughout the water sector. for collection. treatment and conveyance and it leads to production of GHG emissions. Several authorities have created initiatives to reimagine how water infrastructure might comply with GHG mitigation strategies. 5 For example. the California Water Plan promotes maximum efficiency in water management through identifying. developing and researching new technologies and implementation potentials. 6 Efficiency can be further improved though better data management and decision support tools that provide valuable insight on the benefits and impacts of implementing future redesigned systems.,True,62LZa2wAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Kavvada_berkeley_0028E_17470.pdf,,,,,https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/etd/ucb/text/Kavvada_berkeley_0028E_17470.pdf,0,0,0

Evidence for the European Union,2018,Tobias D Ketterer,41,The World Economy,4,1111-1130,,In this paper. we examine the hypothesis that anti‐dumping actions may contribute to trade liberalisation by serving as a “safety valve” for protection‐seeking pressures. Using microlevel trade and tariff data at the HS 8‐digit level for the European Union. we investigate whether the use of anti‐dumping measures has acted as a catalyst in subsequent multilateral tariff negotiations. Our findings suggest that anti‐dumping policies may have reduced the resistance of domestic protectionist forces towards major tariff reforms. as they show significantly larger tariff cuts for products previously involved in an anti‐dumping investigation.,True,nkQMPEkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,3,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/twec.12634,12060926356335283414,/scholar?cites=12060926356335283414,,,https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/gep/documents/papers/2015/2015-11.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. we study the effects of single and multiple export market entry. and additionally differentiate between the effects of export market entry by destination country. To isolate the impact of participation in foreign markets we employ matching techniques. Using micro-level trade and balance sheet data for firms in Lithuania. we show that single export market entry is linked with larger post-entry productivity growth for new export market entrants. relative to similar non-exporting firms.

The results of the econometric analysis. covering 249 NUTS2 regions for the period between 1999 and 2013. suggest that: a) government quality matters for regional growth; b) relative improvements in quality of government are a powerful driver of development; c) one-size-fits-all policies for lagging regions are not the solution; d) government quality improvements are essential for low growth regions; and e) in low income regions basic endowment shortages are still the main barrier to development. In particular. low growth regions in Southern Europe stand to benefit the most from improvements in government quality. while in low income regions of Central and Eastern Europe. investments in the traditional drivers of growth remain the main factors behind successful economic trajectories.,True,nkQMPEkAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3383970,,,,,,0,0,0

There are. however. a limited number of studies that examine neighborhood design types. In this research. we examine four types of neighborhood designs: traditional development. suburban development. enclosed community. and cluster housing development. and assess their level of walkability and their effects on physical activity and wellbeing. We examine significant associations through a questionnaire (n= 486) distributed in Tucson. Arizona using the Walkability Model. Among the tested neighborhood design types. traditional development showed significant associations and the highest value for walkability. as well as for each of the two types of walking (recreation and transportation) representing physical activity. Suburban development showed significant associations and the highest mean values for mental health and wellbeing. Cluster housing showed significant associations and the highest mean value for social interactions with neighbors and for perceived safety from crime. Enclosed community did not obtain the highest means for any wellbeing benefit. The Walkability Model proved useful in identifying the walkability categories associated with physical activity and perceived crime.

The notion of this research is to develop an integrated façade technology that interacts and adapts with the changing climatic conditions. in hot arid regions. in order to improve occupants’ thermal comfort in mixed mode office buildings through the use of natural ventilation and evaporative cooling techniques. thereby reducing mechanical cooling energy loads. In this research. façade design decisions were based on two main computer simulation results; thermal comfort levels and the reduction in energy consumption. The authors propose a double skin façade system that consists of an external skin which works on multiple operating modes. This skin integrates passive cooling strategies with the building envelope depending on the data collected by external and internal sensors. My previous investigations showed that shading. natural ventilation and evaporative cooling are the most effective passive cooling strategies for hot and arid regions In conclusion. this research will contribute in reducing energy consumption in commercial buildings. and help provide a productive work environment.

1310738,A multi-slack Optimization Model for Scheduling Energy Hubs in Smart Grids.,2018,Iman Gerami Moghaddam and Mohsen Saniei and Elaheh Mashhour,98,Journal of Power Technologies,3,,,This paper provides a multi-slack optimization model in order to manage the operation of an energy hub in smart grids. This model is centralized on a multi-slack one in which the proposed slack variables are in line with actual energy providers. Both electrical and thermal loads are considered in this model. An external grid and boilers are respectively used for slackgeneration units for satisfying electrical and thermal loads. In order to reduce the penalty factors in the optimization model. we addressed fair and suitable slack variables in the optimization model. In a real power system. energy storage devicescould effect optimal operation in short-term planning. The main role of such devices in smart grids is to reduce the operatingcosts because of their state of charge (SOC) in peak. medium and base loads. Such devices could also handle load andgeneration uncertainties in the real world. In this model. we implement this feature to handle the uncertainties in the randomvariable generation sector of optimization algorithm. The proposed method could handle this challenge by discharging thestored energy if the slack unit is unable to satisfy the demanded load and vice versa. In order to evaluate the effectivenessof the proposed method. a benchmark is provided in this paper. The hourly electrical and thermal demands were extractedfrom DesignBuilder® for a commercial building.

This paper brackets VRE transmission capital costs using multiple approaches based on interconnection studies. actual transmission projects. capacity-expansion simulation models. and aggregated U.S. VRE-related transmission expenditures. Each approach possesses advantages and drawbacks. and combining the approaches lends confidence to the results. The resulting range of average levelized VRE transmission costs is $1–$10/MWh. which is generally lower than earlier estimates in the literature.

ERCOT proposed FAS to efficiently maintain grid reliability as inverter-based generation displaces traditional generation and as new technologies offer new ways to provide ancillary services.The essential differences between FAS and ERCOT’s Current Ancillary Services (CAS) design are that FAS unbundles ancillary services and fine-tunes service requirements to system conditions and resource capabilities. FAS unbundles CAS’s Responsive Reserve service (RRS)—the service used to arrest frequency decay and restore frequency to 60 Hz in the event of the two largest contingencies—into three distinct services: Fast Frequency Response. Primary Frequency Response. and Contingency Reserve. as described in Section II. B.

Some of the most prominent changes over the last decade in the United States include growth in wind and solar. a reduction in the price of natural gas. weakened load growth. and an increase in the retirement of thermal power plants. Here we empirically assess the degree to which wind and solar—among other factors—have influenced wholesale electricity prices. We show that wind and solar have contributed to reductions in overall average annual wholesale electricity prices since 2008. but that natural gas prices have had the largest impact. More notable is that expansion of variable renewable energy has led to significant changes in locational. time of day. and seasonal pricing patterns in some regions.

A market for smart home appliances is emerging. electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to become more prevalent. and a nationwide rollout of smart meters is underway. Retail tariff structures may also evolve as part of this trend. A possibility that is receiving particular interest is the provision of time-of-use (TOU) retail tariffs to domestic customers.TOU tariffs more accurately reflect the time-varying nature of electricity costs than current tariff offerings. Rather than charging customers a flat price regardless of when electricity is consumed. prices in TOU tariffs vary by time of day.

Prior research addressing this issue focused on average electricity tariffs. solar profiles. and demand without considering detailed customer heterogeneity. This paper fills the gap by analyzing how electricity tariffs that shift cost recovery away from variable charges towards fixed charges influence a customer’s decision to disconnect from utility service.

Using a pro forma financial model. we estimate the financial impacts of different DPV deployment levels on a prototypical Western US investor-owned utility under a varied set of operating conditions that would be expected to affect the value of DPV. Our results show that the financial impacts on shareholders and ratepayers increase as the level of DPV deployment increases. though the magnitude is small even at high DPV penetration levels. Even rather dramatic changes in DPV value result in modest changes to shareholder and ratepayer impacts. but the impacts on the former are greater than the latter (in percentage terms). The range of financial impacts are driven by differences in the amount of incremental capital investment that is deferred. as well as the amount of incremental distribution operating expenses that are incurred. While many of the impacts appear relatively small (on a percentage basis). they demonstrate how the magnitude of impacts depend critically on utility physical. financial. and operating characteristics.

Various strategies have been proposed for preserving this value. We analyze the net value (accounting for both cost and grid value) of these strategies in the United States. We find that established and emerging strategies designed to shift the timing of standalone PV generation at the expense of total generation—including orienting monofacial PV modules west or bifacial modules vertically—result in minor net-value benefits or penalties. Adding energy storage to such systems magnifies the net-value loss. because configurations that change the timing of PV production become redundant when the energy-shifting capabilities of storage are added. The largest net-value gains come from strategies that maximize generation (solar tracking plus oversized PV arrays) in conjunction with storage. especially at high PV penetrations. PV systems are long-lived assets. Our results suggest that efforts to promote generation-maximizing strategies today may yield increasing net-value benefits as US PV and storage deployments continue to accelerate over the coming decades.,True,x4NpZS4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3732356,,,,,,0,0,0

We show that self-reported performance in enforcing the One Child Policy predicts mayoral promotion in China.

Compilers should rely on an adaptive runtime decision to choose which optimizing and parallelizing transformations will lead to the best performance in any execution context.We present a new adaptive framework solving two drawbacks of existing methods: it is effective since the very first execution. and it handles slight variations of input data shape and size. In our proposal. different code versions of parallel loop nests are statically generated by the compiler. At install time. each version is profiled in different execution contexts. At runtime. the execution time of each code version is predicted using the profiling results. the current input data shape and the number of available processor cores. The predicted best version is then run. Our framework handles several versions of possibly tiled parallel loops. using the polytope model for both the profiling and the dynamic selection phases. We show on several benchmark programs that our runtime system selects one of the most efficient version with a very low runtime overhead. This quick and efficient selection leads to speedups compared to the usage of a unique version in every execution context.,True,lqIZEcoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,19,https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00564311/,2360442822188052397,/scholar?cites=2360442822188052397,,,https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/56/43/11/PDF/papier.pdf,0,0,0

Energy savings are typically achieved by setting a well-chosen frequency during some program phases. However. determining suitable program phases and their associated optimal frequencies is a complex problem. Moreover. hardware is constrained by non negligible frequency transition latencies. Thus. various heuristics were proposed to determine and apply frequencies. but evaluating their efficiency remains an issue. In this paper. we translate the energy minimization problem into a mixed integer program that specifically models most current hardware limitations. The problem solution then estimates the minimal energy consumption and the associated frequency schedule.

1310802,Static and dynamic methods of polyhedral compilation for an efficient execution in multicore environments,2011,Benoit Pradelle,,,,,,Many automatic software parallelization systems have been proposed in the past decades. but most of them are dedicated to source-to-source transformations. This paper shows that parallelizing executable programs is feasible. even if they require complex transformations. and in effect decouples parallelization from com- pilation. e.g.. for closed-source or legacy software. where binary code is the only available representation. We propose an automatic parallelizer able to perform advanced parallelization on binary code. It first parses the binary code and extracts high-level information. From this information. a C program is generated. This program captures only a subset of the program semantics. namely loops and memory accesses. This C program is then parallelized using existing. state of the art parallelizers. including advanced polyhedral parallelizers. The original program semantics is then re-injected. and the transformed parallel loop nests are recompiled by a standard C compiler. We show on the PolyBench benchmark suite that our system successfully detects and parallelizes almost all the loop nests from the binary code. using a recent polyhedral loop parallelizer as a backend. The paper ends by elaborating a strategy to parallelize more complex programs. such as those containing non-linear accesses to memory. and provides a few example case-studies.,True,lqIZEcoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,3,https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00733856/,2256862479467132968,/scholar?cites=2256862479467132968,,,https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/73/38/56/PDF/thesis_prefinal.pdf,0,0,0

Bi-reforming studies using a feed ratio of 3:1:2 for CH4:CO2:H2O. respectively. showed that the H2:CO ratio neared the desired ratio of 2 between 500 and 600 °C for the 0.16Pt catalyst and consistent with bi-reforming at more traditional conditions. This H2:CO ratio was desirable (near 2) compared to dry or steam reforming alone. as well as to other CH4:CO2:H2O ratios. Reaction studies showed that CH4 conversion decreased with increasing GHSV (68.000–272.000 h−1) at 500 °C and increased with increasing temperature at a GHSV of 136.000 h−1 for both catalyst systems.

Amongst several noted CO2 conversion routes. solar thermochemical (STC) based approaches [1] have demonstrated promising results. However high temperatures of operation (usually above 1200 C). have plagued large scale implementation of STC processes. Reverse water gas shift chemical looping (RWGS-CL) process [2] using mixed metal oxides like perovskite oxides (ABO3) presents the benefits of STC along with the advantages of low temperature operation. Perovskite oxides have the potential to accommodate different elements in their ‘A’and ‘B’sites. thus presenting a perfect platform for tailoring desired material properties.Oxygen vacancy formation is a crucial step in RWGS-CL. and oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evac) of the perovskite oxides has proved to be an appropriate descriptor for this process. We hereby investigate the Evac of perovskite oxides of different elemental composition and explore their CO2 conversion capabilities in RWGS-CL process.

The physicochemical properties of as-prepared ternary oxides were comprehensively characterized by SEM. EDS. XPS. XRD and UV-vis spectroscopy techniques. The catalytic performance of the ternary oxides was examined in a fixed-bed reactor with gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 75.000 mL g-1 h-1. The results disclosed the formation of amorphous structure of ternary oxides with dome-top-shaped morphology which supplied abundant sites for oxygen evolution. The optical bandgap energies (1.5 and 2.05 eV) of asprepared ternary oxides were lower than their base metal oxide counterparts (2.15-2.18 eV). which enhanced their reducibility due to easier lattice oxygen mobility.

Thin film of the Cu-Co binary oxide was coated on stainless steel mesh (SSM). The prepared Cu-Co-O/SSM was located in two annular dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactors. Toluene removal exhibits two-stage characteristics in the 60-mm DBD reactor. In the first stage. both full locating SSM and Cu-Co-O/SSM could equally improve the toluene removal. indicating that SSM dominates the catalytic role on toluene conversion resulting from its conductivity. In the second stage. Cu-Co-O/SSM could improve the the complete conversion of toluene. as the specific energy density is above 153 J/L by providing a reactive surface. Toluene removal exhibits one stage characteristics in the 200-mm DBD reactor. The removal efficiency and CO 2 selectivity could respectively achieve 100% and 64% as the specific energy density being around 20 J/L.

This study focuses on simultaneous removal of phosphate (P) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from real urban wastewater using developed electrocoagulation (EC) system. A comparative study of developed EC process (anode iron scrap) with a conventional EC process (anode iron plate) was performed. When developed EC process was used. the results revealed that the removals efficiencies of P and COD have been improved from 82% to 94% for COD and from 85% up to 97% for P. thus led to reduce energy consumption from 7.6 x10-3 to 5.4 x10-3 kWh/g COD and from 5.8 x10-1 to 4.3 x10-1 kWh/g P. The higher treatment efficiency obtained from the developed EC process can be directly attributed to the higher effective surface area of the Fe scrap. Moreover. the characterization of generated EC by-products revealed the existence of P. C and O confirming that such pollutants were adsorbed on the surface of iron hydroxides and oxyhydroxides. where the removals of P and COD were taken place.

The porous catalysts were characterized before calcination by FTIR and TGA and after calcination by XRD. FESEM-EDX and BET techniques. The selectivity of phenol production from the one-step oxidation of benzene over porous gold catalysts can be enhanced by concise tuning of pore diameter and pore surface morphology.

The best protection (94.09%) is obtained by adding DEB at 10-4 M. Polarisation curves show that DEB and DPB acts as a mixed type inhibitor. The degree of the surface coverage of the adsorbed inhibitors is determined by weight loss measurement. and it was found that the adsorption of the two compounds on the mild steel surface obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The effect of the temperature on the corrosion behaviour with addition of DEB and DPB at various concentrations was studied in the temperature range 303–333 K.

The nitrogen isotopomer site preference of N2O (15N-SP) indicated the contribution of producing and consuming pathways in response to changes in oxygenation level (from 0 % to 21 % O2 in the gas mix). temperature (from 13.5 to 22.3 ∘C) and ammonium concentrations (from 6.2 to 62.1 mg N L−1). Nitrite reduction. either nitrifier denitrification or heterotrophic denitrification. was the main N2O-producing pathway under the tested conditions. Difference between oxidative and reductive rates of nitrite consumption was discussed in relation to  concentrations and N2O emissions. Hence. nitrite oxidation rates seem to decrease as compared to ammonium oxidation rates at temperatures above 20 ∘C and under oxygen-depleted atmosphere. increasing N2O production by the nitrite reduction pathway. Below 20 ∘C. a difference in temperature sensitivity between hydroxylamine and ammonium oxidation rates is most likely responsible for an increase in N2O production via the hydroxylamine oxidation pathway (nitrification). A negative correlation between the reaction kinetics and the apparent isotope fractionation was additionally shown from the variations of δ15N and δ18O values of N2O produced from ammonium. The approach and results obtained here. for a nitrifying biofilm reactor under variable environmental conditions. should allow for application and extrapolation of N2O emissions from other systems such as lakes. soils and sediments.,True,kVykZzMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/979/2020/,,,,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/979/2020/,0,0,0

The data used in the performance analyses were obtained experimentally for varying flow and geometrical conditions. It was found that the solid blocks generated a net energy loss despite significantly enhanced heat transfer due to the increased heat transfer surface area. When the blocks were perforated. the loss in the net energy was recovered and depending on the geometrical and flow conditions. a net gain in energy. up to 20%. was achieved.

One of the most important of them is borax obtained from tincal. During borax production a large quantity of the boron oxide (B 2 O 3) is lost with the reactor waste. Also. this waste causes different environmental problems when it discharged directly to the environment. In this study. the evaluation of the reactor waste in borax production was investigated to recover B 2 O 3 and therefore to reduce the toxic effect of the waste. For this purpose. the reactor waste was leached by SO 2-saturated water. It was found that about 90% of B 2 O 3 in the waste was recovered. In addition. about 80% of CaO in the waste was dissolved in the leaching solution. A part of the dissolved CaO precipitated as CaSO 3. 1 2 H 2 O and CaSO 4. 2H 2 O. and the other part remained as Ca (HSO 3) 2 in the solution.

The tracer gas method is the reference technique but its implementation is difficult and the interpretation of results is not straightforward. In the present work. the concentration decay method by multiple CO2 transmitters is experimentally validated in the case of cross-ventilation. It is observed that in-situ CO2 transmitters lead to ACR values in good agreement with reference measurements obtained from mechanically controlled values. Whereas multiple transmitters in different sampling positions show the imperfect mixing. a sensor located at the outlet or an averaged value of all sensors can provide an accurate measure of the ACR. Moreover. the spatial variation of CO2 concentration can be used to assess the ventilation efficiency in the test chamber.

This turbulent zone behind the building increases the air mixing at the leeward openings between entering and leaving air. As a consequence the effective temperature difference is reduced at the opening. counteracting the stack effect. Therefore. the air change rate is lower than that in absence of wind.Some empirical correlations have been set up to assess the airflow rate due to the combination of stack and wind effects. However these correlations do not take into account the reduction of airflow rate in leeward conditions.This paper aims to improve the existing correlations and in particular to confront the issue related to leeward openings.

In view of this. this paper first focuses on the involved key techniques including the optimal design of multi-branch well type and well trajectory. composite local diameter enlargement. inter-connection between horizontal wells and caved holes. trajectory control. and the air and underbalanced drilling. etc. Then. in combination with the field cases for the pilot tests and their results. an overall study draws the following conclusions:(1) The No. 3coal bed in the Qinshui Basin is in stable and flat distribution. where the mechanical strength of coal rocks is relatively high with a steady cap rock integrity. All these provide good conditions and the possibilities for the multi-branch horizontal drilling there by use of the existing domestic technology and equipment.(2) The air and underbalanced drilling there should adopt a minimum underbalance value or remain the near balance condition. Much concern should be paid to the purpose of cuttings carrying through the clean water as the drilling fluids. 3) High-rank coals are brittle and natural fractures are perpendicular to each other. which results in downhole collapse and sticking. even the wellbore abandonment.

Most MOF-based desiccants exhibit exceptional properties such as remarkable water vapour uptake capacity and gentle regeneration conditions. which make them very competitive for the adsorption air-conditioning system in comparison with conventional desiccants. for example. zeolite etc. The paper aims at investigating the performance of MOF-based adsorption system in comparison with the conventional zeolitebased system. The isotherms of MOF-based desiccants unºCder different temperature have been investigated to estimate the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbed vapour. The experimental results indicate that there is more than 0.4 g/g of mass difference between 20 and 50 ºC at 2000 Pa of water vapour pressure. which means the MOF-based adsorption cooling system can be powered by using low-grade energy around 50-70 ºC temperature range.

Two methods are used to model the subgrid-scale (SGS) stresses:(a) the Smagorinsky model; and (b) the modulated gradient model. To parameterize the effects of the VAWT on the flow. two VAWT models are developed:(a) the actuator swept-surface model (ASSM). in which the time-averaged turbine-induced forces are distributed on a surface swept by the turbine blades. ie. the actuator swept surface; and (b) the actuator line model (ALM). in which the instantaneous blade forces are only spatially distributed on lines representing the blades. ie. the actuator lines. This is the first time that LES has been applied and validated for the simulation of VAWT wakes by using either the ASSM or the ALM techniques. In both models. blade-element theory is used to calculate the lift and drag forces on the blades. The results are compared with flow measurements in the wake of a model straight-bladed VAWT. carried out in the Institute de Méchanique et Statistique de la Turbulence (IMST) water channel. Different combinations of SGS models with VAWT models are studied. and a fairly good overall agreement between simulation results and measurement data is observed.

1310941,A large-eddy simulation study of vertical axis wind turbine wakes in the atmospheric boundary layer,2016,Sina Shamsoddin and Fernando Porté-Agel,9,Energies,5,366,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In a future sustainable energy vision. in which diversified conversion of renewable energies is essential. vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) exhibit some potential as a reliable means of wind energy extraction alongside conventional horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs). Nevertheless. there is currently a relative shortage of scientific. academic and technical investigations of VAWTs as compared to HAWTs. Having this in mind. in this work. we aim to. for the first time. study the wake of a single VAWT placed in the atmospheric boundary layer using large-eddy simulation (LES). To do this. we use a previously-validated LES framework in which an actuator line model (ALM) is incorporated. First. for a typical three-and straight-bladed 1-MW VAWT design. the variation of the power coefficient with both the chord length of the blades and the tip-speed ratio is analyzed by performing 117 simulations using LES-ALM. The optimum combination of solidity (defined as N c/R. where N is the number of blades. c is the chord length and R is the rotor radius) and tip-speed ratio is found to be 0.18 and 4.5. respectively. Subsequently. the wake of a VAWT with these optimum specifications is thoroughly examined by showing different relevant mean and turbulence wake flow statistics. It is found that for this case. the maximum velocity deficit at the equator height of the turbine occurs 2.7 rotor diameters downstream of the center of the turbine. and only after that point. the wake starts to recover. Moreover. it is observed that the maximum turbulence intensity (TI) at the equator height of the turbine occurs at a distance of about 3.8 rotor diameters downstream of the …,True,JoXCYtoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,51,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/5/366,9377161999970579398,/scholar?cites=9377161999970579398,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/5/366/pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we develop an analytical framework to analyse turbulent axisymmetric wakes under different pressure gradient conditions. Specifically. we develop a model to predict how an arbitrary imposed pressure gradient perturbs the evolution of the zero-pressure-gradient wake. The starting point of the model is the basic mean conservation of the streamwise momentum equation. We take advantage of the self-similarity of the wake velocity deficit and the assumption that the ratio of the maximum velocity deficit to the wake width is independent of the pressure gradient; such an assumption is supported experimentally for planar wakes. and numerically for axisymmetric wakes in this study …,True,JoXCYtoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,11,https://search.proquest.com/openview/c325da53166c19116e8193fa03ef418c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=34769,1879347585536473470,/scholar?cites=1879347585536473470,,,,0,0,0

Although these two topics may seem too distant to be reconciled in one thesis. as the title of the thesis suggests. the common feature that they share with each other is that both of them are among the topics that have benefited from relatively little research and development in the wind energy community.In the VAWT part. first. we adapt and implement two actuator-type VAWT parameterization models (ie the actuator swept-surface model and the actuator line model) for use in numerical flow simulations with the purpose of studying the wakes of VAWTs and their performance in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and eventually predicting the flow in sizable wind farms. These models are implemented in a large-eddy simulation (LES) framework. and the results are validated with experimental data. After validating the model. we investigate the energetic performance and wake structure of a megawatt-VAWT which is placed in the ABL. We characterize. in particular. the energetic performance of such a turbine by calculating the power coefficient of the turbine for more than 100 different combinations of tip-speed ratios and blade chord lengths (ie different solidities).

The XRD spectra reveal the polycrystalline nature of all the CdTe thin films with preferential cubic orientation along (111) directions. Raman Spectra show the dominant peak at 163.5 cm-1 and its overtone at 328.7 cm-1 which corresponds to the longitudinal optical (LO) phonon of CdTe. The SEM microscopy exhibits the uniform growth of CdTe films onto the entire glass substrate. Improved spectral response is observed for CdS: O layer and CdS: O/CdS bilayer in comparison with the CdS layer. The optical transmission of the CdTe films begins at the edge of 800 nm wavelength and shows interference fringe in the transmission spectra. The thickness of the deposited films and the optical constants are calculated from the fringe pattern. The thicknesses of the CdTe films are found to be increasing from 2.34 µm to 2.82 µm with the increasing substrate temperature ie from 150 to 250 C. Thereafter. the CdTe film thickness decreases to 2.24 µm while the temperature increases further up to 350 C. The optical bandgap of the deposited CdTe films follows an increasing trend of 1.48 eV to 1.54 eV with the increase of substrate temperature 150 to 250 C after that the bandgap decreases to 1.51 eV for 350 C.

Azores,2019,M Alves and R Segurado and M Costa,182,Energy,,502-510,Pergamon,The implementation of renewable energy sources (RES) in isolated power systems. as is the case of islands. constitutes both a challenge and an opportunity. The intermittency of some RES. namely wind and solar. originates problems of grid stability and a mismatch between power demand and supply. The interconnection between isolated power systems can decrease the RES variability and. thereby. minimize the problems associated with their intermittency. In this work. the endogenous resources of the islands of Pico and Faial. in Azores. were characterized and their power systems modelled.

1310985,Integrated energy and water planning on an arid island. case of S. Vicente. Cape Verde,2010,Raquel Segurado and Luís Alves and Neven Duić and Goran Krajačić,4,JJMIE,1,,,In general. most islands depend for energy supply mainly on the imports of fossil fuels. Arid islands also depend on water desalination. again often depending on fossil fuel imports. On the other hand. most of the islands present a considerable potential in renewable energies. Several initiatives have been carried out in some islands. mostly in Europe. for the use of this potential in the production of electricity and fresh water. Due to high energy costs. the islands present an excellent experimentation platform for the introduction of new energy technologies. Some islands are trying to become renewable islands. to satisfy their energy and water demand mainly or entirely from indigenous and renewable sources. thus increasing the security of supply and employment opportunities. without necessarily increasing the costs. Islands that have renewable energy sources. such as hydro or geothermal energy. can easily integrate them into the power system. but those with mainly intermittent renewable energy sources (wind. solar) have to tackle the need of energy storage. Here. advanced energy planning must be used to combine different intermittent and regular sources in order to match electricity demand and assure security of supply. The main objective of this paper is to analyse different scenarios for increasing the penetration of renewable energies in the energy system of S.

1310986,Modelling soot formation during biomass gasification,2020,AI Ferreiro and R Segurado and M Costa,134,,,110380,Pergamon,Biomass gasification offers a significant potential to close the loop of agriculture and many other activities that produce biomass residues. However. the presence of tars and impurities. such as soot. in the gasification products is still a major bottleneck causing operational problems. particularly blocking or fouling of equipment and low syngas quality. Numerical modelling is a very attractive solution to enhance the understanding of the physical and chemical phenomena occurring in gasifiers and thereby to overcome these barriers. In addition. understanding the biomass gasification fundamentals in laboratory-scale devices. such as drop tube furnaces (DTF). is crucial to evaluate its relevance for industrial applications. The main objective of this study is to develop a model able to predict soot formation during the gasification of biomass in a DTF.

1310987,Is Renewable Energy-Powered Desalination a Viable Solution for Water Stressed Regions? A Case Study in Algarve. Portugal,2019,Gil Azinheira and Raquel Segurado and Mário Costa,12,Energies,24,4651,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,With a severe seasonal concentration of precipitation and unevenly distributed water resources. the water supply in Portugal is under stress. and the problem is expected to increase with climate change. Water desalination is increasingly becoming the preferred solution to fight water scarcity. but. because it is energy-intensive. the underlying costs and sustainability concerns over the power sources chosen remain a challenge to its implementation. This study aims to assess if the introduction of renewable energy sources (RES) powered desalination in mainland Portugal is viable and can contribute to guarantee water security. The Portuguese Algarve region is a viable case study to be considered because it is particularly water stressed and subject to highly varying demographics depending on the season. Taking the region’s freshwater demand. hourly RES production and power demand. a cost analysis was performed in order to obtain the levelized cost of water (LCOW) for two different strategies (centralized and decentralized). Two models were developed to estimate the LCOW: a simplified model and a subsequent optimization model. minimizing electricity costs. The resulting LCOW of 72.66 c€/m 3. obtained for the decentralized solution. fits within the industry standard rate despite being 61.3% higher than the estimated conventional water supply production cost.

This is due to technical constraints of the conventional generating units and the dynamic penetration limit that is usually applied for grid stability. This problem can be tackled with energy storage. namely. pumped hydro. when the topography is suitable. In addition. when an island has few or no freshwater resources and the desalination of seawater is a necessity. excess wind power can be provided to desalination units that can produce desalinated water to be used in the pumping and hydrostation and later be supplied to the population.

Nearly a third (29%) of the UK gas and electricity consumption is used in homes. of which 80% is for space heating and hot water provision [1]. The DEFACTO project (Digital Energy Feedback And Control Technology Optimisation) is a five year EPSRC-funded project (2012-2017) which is investigating how the use of digital heating control and feedback devices can enable the reduction of this domestic energy use. In particular the project is investigating the implications of domestic heating systems with zonal control. identifying the potential savings incurred. In the UK. digital technology has the potential to provide householders with feedback on their heating energy use and an ability to control where and when this energy is used. However. it is not yet known how much energy these digital technology devices will save and in which households they will work best.This paper introduces the DEFACTO project and reports some of the initial findings which discuss the use of these feedback and control systems within domestic properties. The project has three main phases: an initial planning and testing phase to explore the technology in unoccupied homes and to prepare for in-home trials. followed by two stages of real home studies. one smaller. more detailed pilot study and then a substantial. longitudinal trial involving hundreds of homes. This paper covers findings from the planning and testing phase as well as early findings from the pilot in-home study. but also discusses issues relating to the complexity of conducting the large scale trial.,True,zjCDvC8AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Becky_Mallaband/publication/265345776_Saving_energy_in_the_home_through_digital_feedback_and_control_systems_An_introduction_to_the_DEFACTO_project/links/54097d440cf2718acd3d1f54/Saving-energy-in-the-home-through-digital-feedback-and-control-systems-An-introduction-to-the-DEFACTO-project.pdf,16565368907810420470,/scholar?cites=16565368907810420470,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Becky_Mallaband/publication/265345776_Saving_energy_in_the_home_through_digital_feedback_and_control_systems_An_introduction_to_the_DEFACTO_project/links/54097d440cf2718acd3d1f54/Saving-energy-in-the-home-through-digital-feedback-and-control-systems-An-introduction-to-the-DEFACTO-project.pdf,0,0,0

Case studies formed the basis of the study and helped substantiate the complexity of integrating DGNB’s criteria as design parameters in practice.The framework for the study is the increased focus in recent decades on minimizing the energy consumption used for operating buildings. because the building industry accounts for 40% of the total energy consumption in the EU. This focus has led to more optimized design processes within the framework of the Integrated Energy Design (IED) method. in which many decisions related to indoor climate and energy consumption are made in the early stages of the design process and have therefore become an important design factor for both architects and engineers. The tendency is now to widen the perspective to design decisions in all phases of the entire lifecycle of a building. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) moves to the fore in the design process to make it possible to meet the overall purpose of reducing CO2 emissions and the general environmental impact of the entire building industry.,True,ajMwKNsAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7158446907494571475&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

However this perception is changing. Engineering is fundamentally a design discipline. Having a structured approach to design methods. a design methodology. is a fundamental aid in decisionmaking and resource management through design. At DTU Civil Engineering experiments are made in crossdisciplinary collaboration between engineers of different specializations and outside collaborators. Designmethodologies are invented addressing urban and building design issues. making performance. resourceuse and environmental impacts transparent. This talk discusses how design methods can be used for decision support in urban and building design. based on quantitative modelling and qualitative research. Examples from practice will serve as cases. whereresearch based design methods have been developed into innovative design tools and services.

In this study the effect on the outcome of the daylight simulations was investigated if the designer uses one weather data file in lieu of another for the same location. Furthermore the effect of using weather data sets of an hourly resolution compared to a one minute resolution was investigated. The results showed that the lighting dependencies varied up to 2% dependent on the chosen weather data file and indoor illuminance threshold. The energy consumption for artificial lights was underestimated when simulating with time steps of hourly means compared to one minute resolution. The findings from this comparison show that the dynamic. short-term effects of the weather have a surprisingly small impact on the simulation outcome.,True,ajMwKNsAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,http://www.byg.dtu.dk/-/media/Institutter/Byg/publikationer/PhD/byg-r256.ashx?la=da#page=113,,,,,http://www.byg.dtu.dk/-/media/Institutter/Byg/publikationer/PhD/byg-r256.ashx?la=da#page=113,0,0,0

Inc.,Epitaxial growth on planar substrates has been pursued for creating single crystal layers of new materials. In many important materials systems. such as heteroepitaxy onto planar substrates leads to phase segregation and misfit dislocations due to lattice mismatch-induced stresses and strain. Recently. our group showed that using hetero-epitaxy on nanowire substrates grow thick layers (~ 200 nm) without the problems associated with planar substrates due to the lower interfacial contact area and stress relaxation. Specifically. using hetero-epitaxy. we were able to obtain single crystalline layers of InxGa1-xN alloys with composition over the entire range for indium from 0 to 100%. 1 InxGa1-xN alloys with indium composition from 45-65% can have the right band gap between 1.7-2.2 eV necessary for photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.The hetero-epitaxial growth of InGaN alloys on GaN nanowire substrates exhibited different growth morphologies depending upon nanowire growth direction. Typically. the “c” planeoriented GaN nanowires exhibit stacking faults perpendicular to growth direction where as the “a” plane-oriented GaN nanowires exhibit stacking faults parallel to growth direction. Similarly. the hetero-epitaxial InGaN layers on “c” plane oriented nanowires developed stacking faults perpendicular to growth direction. The photocurrent for InGaN epilayers on GaN nanowire arrays was found to be on the order of only 100-150 μA/cm2. In some cases. there was no photoactivity. This “poor” photoelectrochemical performance is attributed to the extension of defects in the epilayers grown using “c” wires and the corresponding poor …,True,OXYWWSkAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://ecs.confex.com/ecs/223/webprogram/Abstract/Paper17332/H9-1310.pdf,,,,,,0,0,0

For comparison purposes tests were also conducted for pine wood. The experiments were performed in a laboratory reactor. Preheated nitrogen (up to 65 ºC) was used to purge the reactor before each experiment and to drag the pyrolysis products during the reaction. The bio-char was collected at the end of the reactor and the liquid products of the pyrolysis were condensed in two stages using ethylene glycol as refrigerator. All biomass fuels were successfully converted to carbon-rich bio-oils and biochars using fast pyrolysis. Bio-oil yields varied between 51 wt% for pine wood and 31 wt% for olive bagasse and the bio-char between 42 wt% for straw and 23 wt% for pine wood. The heating value of the bio-chars is lower than the one of the original biomass fuels because oxygen and ashes are concentrated in the solid pyrolysis products.

The time-resolved thermoelastic deformation equation is solved and compared to the semi-infinite solution. To determine the applicability of the semi-infinite model. experiments were performed in optical glasses and the quantitative results compared to both models. The analytical results presented here were found to be in excellent agreement with the numerical finite elemental analysis model. Modeling and experiment showed that the TM transient signal is strongly affected as the sample thickness is reduced. The results of the finite-size model demonstrate that it is intrinsically more accurate to characterize physical properties of low optical absorption thin samples. which suggests that the model and the TM method could even be applied to study very thin films down to the micrometer scale.,True,0dNi5aQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,31,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josab-28-7-1735,6195194252811294155,/scholar?cites=6195194252811294155,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.727.7524&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1311145,7 Project risk management using fuzzy theory,2019,Daniel Wright and Prasanta Kumar Dey,,Risk Management in Engineering and Construction: Tools and Techniques,,130,Routledge,Risk and uncertainty is an inherent and common characteristic of any project. The best possible way to mitigate the negative impact of an occurring project risk is to employ efficient and effective project risk management (PRM) practices. There are numerous benefits for adopting risk management techniques. with the overall goal being to ensure that project cost. schedule and safety are controlled. Despite the clear advantage. early work in the industry by Perry and Hayes (1985) highlighted that many projects. not just large capital projects. were still subject to cost and time overruns. A recent survey of construction companies and consultants in the UK still found that a large proportion still experience significant cost and time overruns despite having numerous control techniques at their disposal (Yakubu and Sun 2009). The issue lies not with the PRM tools and techniques as the strengths and weaknesses of an approach are clearly known in advance of adoption. but likely reside with the decision-maker. Seminal work conducted by Akintoye and MacLeod (1997) highlighted that construction and project management practices. in their survey. overwhelmingly utilised intuition. judgement and experience over any other risk management technique. Moreover. the theory that not all risk management techniques are equally effective in increase in performance has been examined in a paper by Raz and Michael (2001). They surveyed software and high-tech Israeli project management companies to measure both the perceived value of PRM tools and a tools impact on overall performance.

1311152,Resilience strategies to counteract supply chain risk: a simulation analysis.,,Daniel Wright and Pavel Albores,,,,,,The purpose of this paper is to study the concept of resilience in supply chains. In order to do this. a simulation using Arena was constructed of a four echelon supply chain and three resilient measures were applied: added redundancy. acceleration agility and velocity agility. An explanatory experimental design was employed to deduce whether the added resilience enhancement measures reduced the vulnerability of a supply chain with supplier failure risks. The only resilience enhancement measure to significantly reduce the vulnerability of the control SC was the velocity agility enhancement.,True,4Ij6N-4AAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16273218275718281794&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

This necessitates cooling the metal through internal or external means and/ or protecting the metal with coatings that have higher material limits. Film cooling is one of the major technologies allowing today’s gas turbines to operate at extremely high turbine inlet temperatures. consequently higher power density. and extend the cooled components life. Film cooling is a technique where a coolant is blown over the surface exposed to hot gas and a film of low temperature gas is maintained that protects the metal surface from the hot gas.

Furthermore. the gas turbine industry is being pushed to shorten engine length with the goal of reducing weight. This results in a need to design very aggressive inter-turbine-ducts (ITD’s) that have high endwall slopes. The gas turbine design cycle typically begins with conceptual design where many engine configuration iterations are made. During conceptual design. there usually is little firm geometric definition or time for detailed CFD studies on aggressive ITD’s. This can cause a large amount of risk to the engine development schedule and cost if the space allocated for the ITD during conceptual design is found to be insufficient later in the design cycle.

In this paper. we present a process to analyze worn and unworn seals with honeycomb lands using the CFX suite of software. Honeycomb structure poses an additional challenge due to disparate length scales. This was addressed by using separate meshes for the honeycomb and the seal tooth and by connecting them with a generalized grid interface in CFX. The challenges involved in modeling worn seals and an approach for quality meshing of the same was discussed. Comparisons were made with the test data from seals with unworn honeycomb lands.

It was necessary to have a low TOBI exit pressure to control excess leakage across adjacent labyrinth seals with a trade-off of maintaining adequate pressure to supply blade cooling. Consequently. pumping vanes were needed on the seal-plate to restore pressure. which adds parasitic work to the turbine and a corresponding loss of engine efficiency. Engine testing revealed recirculation zones attached to the radial pumping vanes. Subsequent numerical simulation corroborated the recirculation and resulting circumferential asymmetry in flow distribution to the cooled airfoils. As a consequence. excess cooling air is supplied to the HP rotor with some airfoils receiving the minimum amount of cooling air.

Under certain engine operating conditions oil in the lubrication system is likely to enter the compressor or turbine wheel crossing the piston rings which are used to arrest the undesirable oil flow. Compressor side oil leakage can cause white smoke and particulate emissions. Limited experimental and analytical methods are available to aid the designers in developing the oil flow path.

Higher efficiency requirement on turbocharger translates into tighter tolerances on the various geometrical dimensions. While this is applicable for all the components. in this study. the focus is on the compressor wheel. Compressor wheels are either cast or milled and variations are possible in either of the processes. Even small changes in the dimensions of compressor wheel (like diameter. angle distribution. thickness distribution. axial length and blade width etc.). cause the performance losses in Turbo charger. Loss in Performance of turbocharger affects Low-end torque. power rating. fuel economy as well as increasing compressor exit temperature.

In developing countries. however. many of such targets are either abandoned or fall far short of the target date. primarily due to issues of financing. cost of electricity. and level of unmet demand. This paper presents a Generation Expansion Planning model that can be used to assess such issues when setting a renewable electricity generation target. In particular. the model can be used by developing countries to set renewable electricity generation targets that are in line with their financial ability and thus. stand a higher chance of being achieved.

To assure quality in learning outcomes was preserved. we implemented the transition using a randomized experiment. Participating students were randomly assigned to blended (treatment) and traditional (control) groups. Performance was measured by pre-and post-knowledge assessment and quizzes. Attitude was measured by the results of a survey administered at the end of the course. The results show that students’ performance in a purely face-to-face instructional class was not significantly different from that based on a blend of online and face-to-face instruction. In addition. the blended type had significantly more consistently favorable ratings than the purely face-to-face instruction.

One is the interplay of various socio-economic factors being a major driving force behind the commission of cybercrime. These include peer recruitment and training. poverty. unemployment. low level of education and low income. The uniqueness of this study stems from the fact that it deviates from previous studies to investigate cybercrime from the perspective of the perpetrators.

Alberta. Canada. The project intends to demonstrate safe in situ production from a shallow bitumen reservoir and evaluate the commercial viability of combining different subsurface technologies to optimize bitumen production while minimizing water use. The project may produce up to 4.500 bpd of bitumen with a maximum of 7.000 bpd of high quality steam injection. The paper describes the reservoir design for the in situ recovery of oil sands bitumen by use of Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) technology. The McMurray Formation in the project area comprises a high-quality bitumen deposit of some 35 metres underlain by a bitumen rich lower permeability layer of some 15 metres thick. Six SAGD well pairs will be placed at the bottom of the high-quality deposit and infill wells will be placed at the bottom of the McMurray Formation to effectively recover the bitumen. The reservoir simulation results based on reservoir models from the geological. petrophysical and geostatistical work provide a significant range of outcomes for steam injection and bitumen production rates. The base of the cap rock is located at a depth of some 65 metres. The details of the geomechanical field measurements and special studies that were executed to describe the cap rock materials and determine the safe maximum steam injection pressure of 1.000 kPa are presented in the paper. The application of SAGD at the lower pressure of 1.000 kPa results in both lower bitumen production rates and lower cumulative steam oil ratios compared with more conventional SAGD applications.The analysis …,True,OKxmiSkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,11,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike_Carlson6/publication/330832834_Reservoir_Design_of_a_shallow_lp-sagd_project_for_in_situ_extraction_of_Athabasca_bitumen/links/5c55f33092851c22a3a46b84/Reservoir-Design-of-a-shallow-lp-sagd-project-for-in-situ-extraction-of-Athabasca-bitumen.pdf,6399628195338905817,/scholar?cites=6399628195338905817,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mike_Carlson6/publication/330832834_Reservoir_Design_of_a_shallow_lp-sagd_project_for_in_situ_extraction_of_Athabasca_bitumen/links/5c55f33092851c22a3a46b84/Reservoir-Design-of-a-shallow-lp-sagd-project-for-in-situ-extraction-of-Athabasca-bitumen.pdf,0,0,0

A scaled vacuum model for studying the displacement process in the laboratory has been designed and constructed. The temperature field in the scaled model is measured by an infrared camera. The measurements clearly show heat transported into the oil zone by an underrunning tongue of water of condensation. We show that the underrunning watertongue in itself has a negligible effect on the amount of oil produced during a steamdrive. However. the heat conveyed into the downstream region does influence the behavior of the SCF. and thus affects the amount of oil produced. Moreover. heat losses to cap- and baserock also strongly influence the behavior of the SCF and postpone steam breakthrough. The two- dimensional stream fuction model is used to calculate the SCF displacement. The model has been extended to incorporate heat losses. and heat transfer into the oil zone by the water tongue. We use the results of the calculations in combination with the results from scaled vacuum models to evaluate the importance of the two aspects in a typical field situation. 8 refs.. 6 figs.. 3 tabs.,True,OKxmiSkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/7817921,6580144569999190697,/scholar?cites=6580144569999190697,,,,0,0,0

Inspite of the amount of fundamental and practical work carried out in this field many problems still remain unresolved.[2]The success of an enhanced recovery method depends (a) on the recovery from the swept zone and (b) on the sweep efficiency. The recovery from the steam swept zone is high owing to the favourable film flow behaviour and distillation effects. These aspects have been discussed previously.[3. 4] The sweep efficiency is defined as the fraction of the reservoir covered by a certain well pattern area that is affected by the steam at the end of a project.

1311267,An approach based on remedial action scheme to increase resiliency under failures in the central american power grid,2017,Wilfredo C Flores and Javier Barrionuevo and Ezequiel Atlas and Santiago P Torres,,,,1-6,IEEE,Central America is electrically interconnected from Panama thru Guatemala by a 230 kV electric power transmission line with a committed capacity among countries of 300 MW. Due to its radial configuration and a set of constraints in the equipment. the network is prone to collapse in case of the occurrence of some disturbances. Generally. these disturbances occur in one of the interconnected countries and drag the whole Central American system to regional failures. For this reason. the implementation of regional protection systems that avoid a power grid collapse is necessary. Hence. in this work the simulation results of a Remedial Action Scheme is shown. which considers the main constraints in the Central American electric power grid for a certain season. It is proven that the implementation of this regional protection will increase network resiliency under failures that could cause regional blackouts.

One of these alternatives has been the promotion of improved cooking stoves. which achieve a large reduction in firewood consumption. This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis for an improved cooking stove adoption strategy for Honduras. The methodology uses the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System. LEAP. a tool used globally in the analysis and formulation of energy policies and strategies. The energy model considers the demand for firewood as well as the gradual introduction of improved cooking stoves. according to the premises of a National Strategy for improved cooking stoves adoption in Honduras. Hence. it is demonstrated that the costs of implementing this adoption strategy are lower than the costs of not implementing it. taking into consideration representative scenarios up to and including the year 2030.

1311286,Circular urban systems: moving towards systems integration,2013,ABH Vernay,,,,,,Today. most cities function linearly. One way to improve their environmental performance is to make a transition from linear to Circular Urban Systems (CUS) so that part of the waste streams becomes valorised locally. This does not only require technical but also organisational and institutional changes. Moreover it implies that links have to be created between systems that were previously separate (wastewater treatment and transport for instance). This is called systems integration. This research aims to better understand how systems integration comes about. To be able to reconstruct processes of systems integration. a conceptual framework is developed that combines Actor-Network Theory with insights from structuration theory. A method is also suggested that helps visualising integration processes. These are then applied to the study of three urban areas: EVA-Lanxmeer in Culemborg (NL). Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm (SE) and Lille Métropole (FR). In total ten attempts at systems integration are analysed. Researchers earlier pointed out that systems integration could potentially lock systems in a sub-optimal situation. This study however shows that systems integration can foster innovation and open up new technological pathways. Moreover. this research highlights that systems integration often faces barriers due to the structural incompatibilities of the systems involved. Creating bridging systems can be a way to lift these incompatibilities. It also shows that the presence of an organisation able to provide inter-sectorial coordination is often necessary.

However. how individual firms enact a process of cluster renewal and consider possible response options is not well understood.

Understanding the impact of cluster policy on the development of a cluster,2018,Anne-Lorène Vernay and Beatrice D’Ippolito and Jonatan Pinkse,30,Entrepreneurship & Regional Development,7-8,901-919,Routledge,Research has debated to what extent policy measures can facilitate or contribute to the development of clusters. This article contributes to this debate by questioning how the government can create a cluster that is self-organizing and vibrant but also maintain sufficient influence to continue using the cluster as a policy instrument. Taking the perspective of cluster members. the article investigates how members perceive the ambiguous role of the government in a government-supported cluster.

1311289,Integrating functions for a sustainable urban system: A review of multifunctional land use and circular urban metabolism,2018,Saskia Van Broekhoven and Anne Lorène Vernay,10,,6,1875,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Cities pose environmental challenges but also offer possibilities to close material and energy loops and connect multiple societal and ecologic services. This article reviews and brings together the literature on two important new research directions that address urban sustainability by integrating functions or material flows: Circular Urban Metabolism (CUM) and Multifunctional Land Use (MLU). We focus on challenges to MLU and CUM and strategies to facilitate their realization. The review shows that although MLU and CUM differ in what they integrate. they face partly similar integration challenges. In both fields. the collaboration between actors related to particular functions (water safety. recreation). high investment costs and uncertainties about costs and benefits. and legislation that hampers integration are identified as challenges. In both fields. strategies are proposed to facilitate the collaboration between actors. However. other challenges and strategies are specific. Whilst MLU scholars mostly highlight socio-economic aspects of realizing integration. CUM scholars focus more on technical aspects. We find limited cross-fertilization between both fields so far. To stimulate discussion and knowledge exchange. we introduce ‘integration of urban functions’ as a shared idea for a sustainable urban system. To find further solutions for integration challenges. we propose conceptualizing MLU or CUM initiatives as processes of change. which requires connecting across previously separate ‘worlds’ and changing previously established monofunctional ways of working.

We can question. however. whether these cities can be considered as sustainable cities. The eco-city concept usually includes criteria regarding energy and water consumption. transport. waste management. amount of green spaces. etc. However. food consumed in the cities is usually marginally taken into account. Moreover. implementation strategies necessary to successfully make a transition to sustainability are rarely mentioned. The goals of this paper are twofold. First. we will ask attention for urban agriculture and include food in the eco-city equation.

However. urban symbiosis requires the integration of different systems. which is hard to achieve. Actors involved in existing systems can hardly develop ‘the bridges’ that are required to connect the thus far unrelated worlds of pre-existing systems. This paper analyses two cases of urban symbiosis and focusses on the process of building new actor networks. Urban symbiosis projects are generally complex and involve various stakeholders.

However. in the literature. it is poorly conceptualized. and current research fails to address systems integration as a process of change. This paper proposes a conceptual framework and operationalization for assessing processes of systems integration. This includes a typology of systems integration inspired by organizational theory together with an empirical methodology for identifying types (or degrees) of systems integration. This paper also proposes a method for visualizing the integration process in order to uncover its dynamics. The typology as well as the visual mapping tool is applied to an empirical case. The analysis shows that six forms of integration exist. It also shows that systems integration is dynamic and highlights that systems integration sometimes requires systems that bridge others.

When regional and urban features influencing energy yield. transport and usage are taken into consideration in the planning and design process. a better basis is laid for energy-effectiveness. Therefore. the context needs to be analysed on various characteristics. These can be elaborated into so-called energy potential maps. Subsequently. the energy potential maps can be translated into proposed spatial interventions. indicating spots which are suited most. in terms of energy. for developments. When basing building design on directives evolving from this larger scale. the energy demand will commence already on a lower level. Smart and bioclimatic design will further improve the energy performance of the building. making it possible to close the energy cycle locally.

Forum,,1-30,,The metabolism of cities bears important anomalies: high levels of resources flow in cities while large quantities of (hazardous) wastes flow out of cities. In order to decrease cities’ environmental footprint. Girardet [1] and Rogers [2] suggested making a transition from a linear to a circular urban metabolism. Even though the concept was coined a few decades ago. it still holds prominence among academics and practitioners (see for instance [3–6]).However. few cities have made such a transition. This shows that creating a circular urban metabolism is complex and challenging. Research so far mainly considered the creation of a circular urban metabolism as a technical endeavour. We would like to argue that organisational and institutional aspects are also of crucial importance for understanding why there is an implementation gap.

1311295,Exploring energy transition pathways: insights from Denmark and Sweden,2010,Linda M Kamp and A-L Vernay and Wim Ravesteijn,,,,,Delft University of Technology; The Hague University of Applied Sciences; TNO,This paper explores energy transition pathways that are broadly considered successful in terms of technology development and implementation. From that. it aims to derive insights for better understanding transition processes and to improve management and governance methods for steering these processes. Recently. theoretical work on transition processes has evolved from static representations of uniform unilinear pathways (eg Rotmans. 2003; Geels. 2002) into the recognition that transition pathways are of a more diverse nature–still unilinear but not uniform (ao Geels and Schot. 2007. Berkhout et al.. 2004). This work however. is so far strongly theoretical and hypothetical and asks for an empirical underpinning of the notions presented. This paper aims to make such an empirical contribution. It presents case study material on the successful development of wind power in Denmark and the implementation of hydropower in Sweden. The data show that these transitions are not unilinear. Instead. they change in character through time and therefore show to escape the static typologies presented in Geels and Schot (2007) and Berkhout et al.(2004). Consequently. the paper argues. appropriate and successful management methods also have to vary in time. parallel to the changes in transition characteristics.,True,iH13DhQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,4,https://repository.tudelft.nl/view/conferencepapers/uuid:ac67ef79-86e6-40e1-a7b2-38baf82a14af,17047749561432422118,/scholar?cites=17047749561432422118,,,,0,0,0

This is due to. on the one hand. a need to secure energy supply. It is especially true in Europe since our reserves in fossil fuel are rather limited. On the other hand. increased energy consumption based on fossil fuel causes tremendous emissions of CO 2 that may lead to climate change and cause dramatic environmental. social and economic impacts (IPCC). Moreover. the necessity to decrease CO 2 emissions gained more importance since the ratification of the Kyoto protocol the 16 th of February 2005 (wikipedia).

Eth-Zentrum. Ch-8092 Zurich. Switzerland.Retrieval and dissemination of natural language (NL) information is a major problem of the''information age''. Given modern office environments. we have to take into account that queries to an information system are often given as NL texts--texts which the user has already available in his computer (eg letters). Therefore. the search for information should be done by comparing texts. requiring a suitable description of the texts involved. In this thesis we present such a description which is a combination of semantic and syntactic methods.

The transformation process is characterised by the interplay of old and new technologies from the energy sector as well as structural coupling with other sectors. such as the information and communications technology (ICT). enabling the technology transfer as well as market entry by information technology (IT) actors. Blockchain-based technologies have the potential to play a key role in this transition by offering decentralised interfaces and systems as well as an alternative approach to the current organisation form of the energy market.

1311315,C2 compiler concepts,2012,Bernd Teufel and Stephanie Schmidt and Thomas Teufel,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Writing a compiler is a very good practice for learning how complex problems could be solved using methods from software engineering. It is extremely important to program rather carefully and exactly. because we have to remember that a compiler is a program which has to handle an input that is usually incorrect. Therefore. the compiler itself must be error-free. Referring to Niklaus Wirth. we postulate that the grammatical structure of a language must be reflected in the structure of the compiler. Thus. the complexity of a language determines the complexity of the compiler (cf. Compilerbau. BG Teubner Verlag. Stuttgart. 1986). This book is about the translation of programs written in a high level programming language into machine code. It deals with all the major aspects of compilation systems (including a lot of examples and exercises). and was outlined for a one session course on compilers. The book can be used both as a teacher's reference and as a student's text book. In contrast to some other books on that topic. this text is rather concentrated to the point. However. it treats all aspects which are necessary to understand how compilation systems will work. Chapter One gives an introductory survey of compilers. Different types of compilation systems are explained. a general compiler environment is shown. and the principle phases of a compiler are introduced in an informal way to sensitize the reader for the topic of compilers.,True,qbDNhzgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,13,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=It2oCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:i_bMi4n7hNEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=uitJwI2tOq&sig=IoeGGHyaOeFnY6IfSZ89nNncVOU,15097468419027302027,/scholar?cites=15097468419027302027,,,,0,0,0
1311316,Organization of programming languages,2012,Bernd Teufel,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Beside the computers itself. programming languages are the most important tools of a computer scientist. because they allow the formulation of algorithms in a way that a computer can perform the desired actions. Without the availability of (high level) languages it would simply be impossible to solve complex problems by using computers. Therefore. high level programming languages form a central topic in Computer Science. It should be a must for every student of Computer Science to take a course on the organization and structure of programming languages. since the knowledge about the design of the various programming languages as well as the understanding of certain compilation techniques can support the decision to choose the right language for a particular problem or application. This book is about high level programming languages. It deals with all the major aspects of programming languages (including a lot of examples and exercises). Therefore. the book does not give an detailed introduction to a certain program ming language (for this it is referred to the original language reports). but it explains the most important features of certain programming languages using those pro gramming languages to exemplify the problems.

It was found that the diminishing influence of dilatation rate with increasing Karlovitz number has significant influences on the statistical behaviors of the first. second. and third invariants (ie. P. Q. and R) of the velocity gradient tensor. These differences are reflected in the distributions of the flow topologies within the flames considered in this analysis.

The DNS code. S3D. solves compressible flow conservation equations using a high order finite difference and explicit time integration schemes. The ethylene/air flame behavior is described by employing a reduced mechanism that accurately describes up to C4 chemistry by the directed relation graph (DRG) method along with stiffness removal.

The scope of the work includes several advances in computational algorithms such as improved Navier-Stokes Characteristic Boundary Conditions (NSCBC) for mass additive systems and advanced soot models. In addition. detailed investigations into the effects of thermal quenching were conducted in an effort to understand ways of accurately describing the nature of flame extinction comprehensively.  As an application to fundamental and practical combustion problems. the study investigates the interaction of water spray and turbulence with nonpremixed diffusion flames. The simulations incorporate detailed chemistry of ethylene flames. the chemistry of which is recognized as an important chemical pathway for combustion processes. A unified extinction condition that accounts for thermal quenching and strain induced quenching simultaneously is demonstrated to be effective at capturing the moment of extinction and tracking extinction holes in turbulent flames. The findings show that in the formation of edge flames. the evolution leading to the flame recovery or total extinction is found to depend strongly on the temporal history of the local strain rate as well as the presence of the spray droplets.

It is illustrated that not only PM 10 concentration but also many other social economic factors influence PM 10-related health economic losses. which makes health economic losses show a time lag discrepancy compared with the decline of PM 10 concentration. In conclusion. health economic loss evaluation is imperative in the pollution indemnity system establishment and should be considered for the urban planning and policy making to control the burgeoning PM 10 health economic loss.

1311378,Dual-level material and psychological assessment of urban water security in a water-stressed coastal city,2015,Yajing Huang and Linyu Xu and Hao Yin,7,Sustainability,4,3900-3918,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The acceleration of urbanization and industrialization has been gradually aggravating water security issues. such as water shortages. water pollution. and flooding or drought disasters and so on. Water security issues have become a great challenge to urban sustainable development. In this context. we proposed a dual-level material and psychological assessment method to assess urban water security. Psychological security coefficients were introduced in this method to combine material security and residents’ security feelings. A typical water-stressed coastal city in China (Dalian) was chosen as a case study. The water security status of Dalian from 2010 to 2012 was analysed dynamically. The results indicated that the Dalian water security statuses from 2010 to 2012 were basically secure. but solutions to improve water security status and solve water resource problems are still required. This dual-level material and psychological assessment for urban water security has improved conventional material assessment through the introduction of psychological security coefficients. which can benefit decision-making for urban water planning. management and protection.

Daegu and Nairobi,2020,Hao Yin and Zhu Liu and Daniel M Kammen,,medRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,Background  COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented public health crisis and economic shock to the global economy. While many countries were affected. regions with an older population and weaker public health interventions tended to suffer more morbidity and mortality. Here we model and quantify the age-specific incidence of COVID-19 in four pandemic cities under different interventions.  Methods We developed an age-specific and multiple-stage susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-hospitalized-quarantined-dead (SEIR-HQD) dynamical systems model expanded from the more basic SEIR model by incorporating location- and age-specific contact matrices to estimate the outcomes of COVID-19. Utilizing latest estimates of epidemiological parameters and demographic data. we model the potential effects of various interventions in four representative cities with different population structures - New York. Los Angeles. Daegu and Nairobi. We compared the effects of different interventions in the age-structure populations specific to each city. These policy options are then applied to determine the potential for effective containment. We model these dynamic policy scenarios to assess the risks of less-stringent social distancing. as has been proposed by those arguing to enhance economic activity over public health and safety. Finally. we explored the health impacts of different policy action timelines to understand the benefits of early interventions.

While all people are exposed to air pollution. older individuals tend to be disproportionally affected. As a result. there is growing concern about the public health impacts of air pollution as many countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the health economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution. and its interaction with population ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global and regional levels.   Methods We developed an age-adjusted measure of the value of a statistical life year (VSLY) to estimate the health economic cost attributable to ambient PM2.5 pollution using the Global Burden of Disease 2017 data and country-level socioeconomic information. First. we estimated the global age- and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to PM2.5 pollution using the global exposure mortality model (GEMM) and global estimates of exposure derived from ground monitoring. satellite retrievals and chemical transport model simulations at 0.1 by 0.1 degree (~11 km at the equator) resolution. Second. for each year between 2000 and 2016. we translated the YLL within each age-group into a health-related economic cost using a country-specific. age-adjusted measure of VSLY. Third. we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the temporal change in health costs related to PM2.5. Finally. we conducted a sensitivity test to analyze the variability of the estimated health costs to four alternative valuation measures.

1311381,The interaction between population age structure and policy interventions on the spread of Covid-19,2020,Zhu Liu and Hao Yin and Daniel Kammen,,,,,,COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented public health crisis and economic shock to the global economy. After months of worldwide pause. countries and cities are facing growing pressure to lift restrictions on economic activity. The optimal reopening strategy may vary signi cantly between cities depending on their demographics and social mixing. In this study. we explore the interaction between population age structure and various containment interventions in four cities with different age distributions that have been or are currently local epicenters of the epidemic. Our model quanti es that earlier interventions avoided an additional 13%. 58%. 70% and 86% of the infections in Los Angeles. New York. Daegu and Nairobi. respectively. compared to what has been observed in the four cities. Critically. we nd that not only can social-distancing policies exhibit strong age-differential effects. but that even age-targeted interventions can have signi cant spillovers. Speci cally. 50% reduction in the contact rates of population under 20 and older than 60 avoids 5%. 11%. 11% and 28% of infection among the elderly than the policy targeting the older adults alone in New York. Daegu. Los Angeles and Nairobi. respectively. In particular. to protect the elderly. it is essential to increase social distancing among the younger population. especially those under 20 years old. An older population structure results in a higher fatality risk while might decrease the infection risk. This is particularly critical as colleges and universities. in both cities and small towns. plan for on-campus activities with students drawn from a globalized pool.

Despite expectations that access to energy for productive uses empowers women by enabling them to generate an income. women in developing countries face a range of barriers when establishing and operating enterprises. including access to energy. The literature reviewed in this paper suggests that. although improved access to energy for women in the informal food sector may create a range of benefits for women. the empirical evidence base upon which such claims are made is limited.

1311388,Implementing the South African free basic alternative energy policy: a dynamic actor interaction,2014,Nthabiseng Mohlakoana,,,,,,The majority of households without grid electricity in South Africa are located in low-income rural and urban areas. Being located in the remote rural areas makes it expensive to extend the grid and often locks such households into energy poverty where they are forced to use traditional fuels which expose them to unhealthy and difficult living conditions. The Free Basic Alternative Energy (FBAE) policy is aimed at providing alternative energy service to households without grid electricity with the hope of alleviating their energy poverty burden. This study examines how the FBAE policy is implemented in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape by the five local municipalities under the jurisdiction of the OR Tambo District. Through the use of the Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT) this study analyses how the three-actor groups (implementing actors. target actors and linking actors) and their characteristics (motivations. cognitions. capacity and power) influence the FBAE policy implementation process. Through this analysis. the complexity of policy implementation processes is revealed by highlighting the influence of the dynamic actor-interaction. By focusing on several actors and the influencing factors. this study moves away from the often accepted assumption that policy implementation processes mainly fail due to lack of resources. The analysis shows that actor motivations in terms of goals. their cognitions in terms of information as well as their capacity and power all play an important role in the success and failure of a policy implementation process.,True,pi4pmGIAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,12,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/implementing-the-south-african-free-basic-alternative-energy-poli,11278230412973280,/scholar?cites=11278230412973280,,,,0,0,0

Despite the importance of this sector. many micro- and informal enterprises are labelled as “survivalist”. beyond the reach of common development policies. which give priority to so-called growth-oriented enterprises. When given the chance to speak for themselves. do enterprises express any aspirations to grow? Contrary to the literature. our findings show that necessity-driven enterprises do aspire to grow and that this is true for both those owned by men and women.

Yet. as explored in this article. inadequate access to water and electricity services has a disproportionately negative effect on women. This is because there is a sexual division of labour within most households meaning that. in addition to typically being singly responsible for childcare. washing. cooking and cleaning. women must usually also take on the role of managing water and energy supplies. In this role. women experience multiple obstacles in accessing these goods. related to the availability. affordability and amount of water and electricity supplied.

The cuts came as a shock and customers were loud in their criticism of Eskom and the City of Cape Town's failure to provide a reliable electricity supply. The utility Eskom's responses included the introduction of an aggressive Demand Side Management (DSM) programme with the goal of saving electricity and reducing the need to shed customers. In Khayelitsha. Cape Town. the DSM programme entailed an exchange and subsidy programme: households were encouraged to swop their two-plate electric stoves for Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) stoves.

Since the country relies mostly on coal-generated electricity because of its cheap nature. it was hard to adjust and find alternative and sustainable ways of providing energy services. especially for households. During this time. the Western Cape Province suffered the worst of times due to a number of reasons such as a mechanical failure of a major power station which made it clear to the Government and the state electricity utility company (Eskom). that urgent action was needed.The paper will discuss energy services provided to people living in low-income households and communities of South Africa. It will further show that in most cases. people living in such conditions do not often have a choice of the type of fuel to use. especially when living in an urban area.

Indonesia,2017,Helmi Gunawan and Hans Bressers and Nthabiseng Mohlakoana and Thomas Hoppe,4,Environments,3,45,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Climate policy has a strong influence on policy processes at national levels in Indonesia. while other policies with a focus on air quality improvement are being implemented at local levels. Indonesia as a developing country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29 percent by the year 2030. This calls into question the extent to which cities and local governments can cope with the challenges of climate change mitigation. The purpose of the research is to find out the extent to which local air pollution reduction policies can contribute to the climate change mitigation program. The research design involved an empirical case study on governance and policy relevant to climate change efforts to lower GHG in Bandung City. Indonesia. The study evaluated the air quality improvement and the climate change mitigation programs using the actor-based framework of the Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT). The governance and stakeholder characteristic of climate change mitigation were also analysed using the structural context part of the CIT framework. The result shows that air quality improvement policy is implemented separately from climate policy; the latter operates at the national level and the former at the local level. By looking at the actor interaction analysis. the study concludes that a more holistic environmental policy approach would be more efficient at reducing local air pollution and contributing to the mitigation of climate change.

AICAD seeks to achieve poverty reduction by means of promoting the utilisation of existing and new knowledge and technologies. including local and indigenous technologies. in part by facilitating the sharing of information. Up to now. AICAD has involved the participation of only three countries in East Africa. Although in the first instance AICAD-SA is focused on South Africa. in effect it sows a seed of AICAD in Southern Africa as well. One of the first steps DST has identified towards making AICAD-SA a reality is to establish what is presently happening by way of technologically-oriented poverty reduction initiatives in South Africa. Having a clear picture of the status quo will assist DST to figure out how it should position itself to make the greatest possible difference in the fight against poverty. What are the gaps? What is relatively well covered?

Electricity can introduce new services such as light. mass media and refrigeration. bringing positive impacts to education and health. The research is. therefore. based on the premise that access to electricity contributes to improving livelihoods amongst low income urban households.However. high connection costs have been identified as a major barrier to improved access to and affordability of electricity supplies (eg DFID Guidance note “Energy for the Rural Poor”). Within the urban context. with high user density. there should be scope for reducing connection costs. Nevertheless. high costs may be due to circumstances at any level of the industry eg limited generation or transmission capacity. dilapidated local distribution infrastructure. lack of investment in efficient equipment etc. These. in turn. may be attributable to players throughout the vertical structure of the industry eg lack of political will to liberalise markets. inability to attract investment. inflexible utility attitudes to customer requirements. irresponsible behaviour of customers etc. Where utility companies (and,True,pi4pmGIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,7,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08c62e5274a31e00011a6/R8146.pdf,2428447231499893769,/scholar?cites=2428447231499893769,,,https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08c62e5274a31e00011a6/R8146.pdf,0,0,0

The assessment takes the experiences of an international network on gender and sustainable energy that aims to get gender onto the energy policy agenda. Since there is no standard audit methodology. the network developed its own.The paper uses an analysis of qualitative data. reviews of audit reports and key informant interviews to answer two questions.

1311399,The predicament of women,2015,Joy S Clancy and Soma Dutta and Nthabiseng Mohlakoana and Ana Victoria Rojas and Margaret Njirambo Matinga,24,International energy and poverty: the emerging contours,,,,Two assumptions underlie assertions about energy and poverty: firstly. that the poor form a homogeneous group; and secondly. that the poor will benefit equally from energy interventions. Work on poverty has increasingly recognized that the poor are not homogeneous. Indeed. the poor have multiple identities differentiated in terms of a number of social characteristics including gender. The poor vary not only in terms of the extent of their poverty but also their reasons for being poor. The processes through which people become poor have a distinct gender dimension (Narayan 1999). For men. unemployment and illness (which can be linked) are common reasons for entering poverty. For women. divorce. widowhood. and desertion are cited reasons. The routes out of poverty for women and men are different due to their different assets. Women tend to be more disadvantaged than men in similar circumstances; for example. women’s access and control over assets such as land. cash. and credit is more limited than men’s. Women’s technical skills are often less than men’s; for example. compared to men. women’s reading levels are lower and they have less experience with hardware (WDR 2012).These differences in women’s and men’s assets mean that interventions promoting energy access aimed to help the poor are likely to benefit men differently from women. in part due to their different capacities to respond and partly because they have different needs linked to the socially determined division of labor between women and men. In general. women tend to have a greater range of tasks and responsibilities than men.

The experiments were performed at different engine operating regimes with the injection timing prescribed by the engine manufacturer for diesel fuel. The engine characteristics with Jatropha biodiesel were compared against those obtained using diesel fuel. From the results. it is observed that the biodiesel performance and emissions are lower than that of diesel fuel. However. the NOx emission of Jatropha biodiesel is more than that of diesel fuel. These high NOx emissions are due to the presence of unsaturated fatty acids and the advanced injection caused by the higher bulk modulus (or density) of Jatropha biodieselFurthermore. the possibility for reduction of NOx emissions without expensive engine modifications (hardware) was investigated. Keeping this in mind. the Jatropha biodiesel was preheated. The experimental results show that the retarded injection timing is necessary when using Jatropha biodiesel in order to reduce NOx emission without worsening other engine characteristics. Results also indicate improved performance with the application of preheated biodiesel. The only penalty for using preheated biodiesel is the increase of smoke (soot).,True,f0tYHbYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,114,https://www.academia.edu/download/37362381/v75-153_WASET.pdf,8073593192244097617,/scholar?cites=8073593192244097617,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/37362381/v75-153_WASET.pdf,0,0,0

Present work reports an optimized protocol for the production of methyl ester through alkaline catalyzed transesterification of cotton seed oil. Three principal variables. molar ratio of methanol to oil. amount of catalyst. and reaction temperature affecting the yield of alkaline catalyzed production of methyl ester from cotton seed oil were investigated. The reaction variables used were methanol/oil molar ratio (4: 1–8: 1). catalyst concentration (0.5–2%). temperature (50–70 C). and catalyst type. The rate of transesterification in a batch reactor increased with temperature up to 60 C. The methyl ester with best yield and quality was produced with cotton seed methyl ester at 6: 1 mole ratio and 1 wt% of catalyst (NaOH) the yield was 93%.

It is an environmentally friendly fuel and has potential to provide comparable engine characteristics. The present study was focused to examine the performance. combustion. emission and vibration characteristics of constant speed water cooled stationary direct injection diesel engine. Biodiesel produced by transestirification process from waste chicken fat is used to test the engine. The engine was tested at ¼. ½. ¾ and full load conditions with pure chicken fat bio diesel (CFBD) and its diesel blends B20 (20% CFBD+ 80% Diesel). B40 (40% CFBD+ 60% Diesel) and results were compared with standard base line Diesel B0 (PD). The results of the experiments revealed that performance and combustion characteristics of CFBD are almost similar to diesel fuel. The significant reduction in emissions were also observed with CFBD. The vibration parameter is significantly affected by the fuel and axis of measurement. The magnitude of vibration acceleration in vertical axis was more than that in other two axes for all fuels. All the results obtained with CFBD fuel were comparable with diesel and also CFBD fuel satisfies all the requirements as per standards.

Japan,The problem of high viscosity of vegetable oils has been approached in several ways. such as esterification. preheating. and blending or dilution with diesel fuel. In this paper the oil that is preheated and tested on the engine is Pongam Methyl Ester (PME). In spite of the esterification process. the viscosity (5.9 cSt) of PME remains high compared to the viscosity (3.1 cSt) of diesel fuel at room temperature of 30o C. To eliminate the fuel injection problems due to its higher viscosity. the PME is heated to 52oC to meet the viscosity of diesel fuel. Neat PME (B100) and neat preheated PME (PME 52) are tested in a laboratory based DI diesel engine replacing the conventional diesel fuel. The engine is tested with PME and PME 52 to verify the change in performance and the exhaust emission aspects at the selected loads (0. 1/4. 1/2. 3/4. and Full) and the results are compared with the base line diesel fuel. It is observed that there is marginal improvement in the performance and the emissions in case of PME 52. The vibration spectrum of the engine cylinder head is studied to investigate the knocking and the detonating characteristics of the engine at all loads. SFC decreased considerably and thermal efficiency has increased with PME 52. Emissions of CO increased and NO decreased in both the cases of PME and more in the case of PME 52. No knock/detonation is observed in the frequency plots recorded on the cylinder head. The heating is conducted in the fuel line close proximate to the injector with a 50 W heating element with a programmable temperature controller.

Turkey. The optimum tilt angle of solar collector is determined between 0° and 61° and changed by the time period through the year. In winter (December. January. and February) the tilt should be 55.7°. in spring (March. April. and May) 18.3°. in summer (June. July. and August) 4.3°. and in autumn (September. October. and November) 43°. Annually. optimum tilt is found to be 30.3° as a fixed tilt throughout the year. Also. these measured values are compared with other equations put forward for calculating the optimum tilt angles. Small deviations are observed between 2.87o and 5.90o. The equations that give a result higher then 3o as a deviation are not suitable to calculate the optimum tilt angle. If solar collector is installed on the monthly optimum tilt angle. optimum azimuth angle (γ) has to be 0o for all months of the year. However. azimuth angle of the solar collector has to be (γ=± 60°) if the slope is chose (β≥60°) in April.

The textile sewage sludge activated carbon (TSSAC) was prepared by chemical activation with potassium hydroxide using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The most influential factor on each experimental design responses was identified via ANNOVA analysis. Based on the central composite design (CCD). quadratic model was developed to correlate the preparation variables for one response which is the Brunauer-Emmelt-Teller (BET) surface area. RSM based on a three-variable CCD was used to determine the effect of pyrolyzed temperature (400-700 degrees C). carbonization time (45-180 min) and KOH: weight of TSS (wt%) impregnation ratio (0.5:1-1.5:1) on BET surface area. According to the results. pyrolyzed temperature and impregnation ratio were found as the significant factors for maximizing the BET surface area. The major effect which influences the BET surface area was found as pyrolyzed temperature. Both carbonization time and impregnation ratio of KOH had no significant effect. The optimum conditions for preparing TSSAC. based on response surface and contour plots. were found as follows: pyrolyzed temperature 700 degrees C. carbonization time of 45 min and chemical impregnation ratio of 0.5.

The maximum adsorption yield (12.11 mg/g) was obtained at 500 degrees C for 1 h carbonization conditions with impregnation ratio of 1:1. The affecting parameters were analyzed by using central composite design method. The selected parameters were initial pH. temperature. initial strontium concentration and carbon dosage. The analysis of variance was performed in 95% confidence level and checked to fitting of experimental value and predicted value. The significant F was P < 0.05 with a model F value of 19.94 which revealed that this regression is statistically significant. The results of regression analysis indicated that pH and temperature parameters were not individually statistically significant for Se+2 sorption.

The insulating property of the glass while in contact with molten salt was verified by observing the independence of electrochemical signals with adjustments in the WE position. The integrity of the glass coating was also confirmed by observing the stability of electrochemical signals (±1.9%) over several hours. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and normal pulse voltammetry (NPV) were applied at 10 different concentrations of UCl3. Above 0.17 mol dm−3 UCl3. the electrochemical signals from CV and NPV deviate significantly from linearity with concentration. but in opposite directions.

1311481,Electrochemical concentration measurements for multianalyte mixtures in simulated electrorefiner salt,2016,Devin Spencer Rappleye,,,,,,The development of electroanalytical techniques in multianalyte molten salt mixtures. such as those found in used nuclear fuel electrorefiners. would enable in situ. real-time concentration measurements. Such measurements are beneficial for process monitoring. optimization and control. as well as for international safeguards and nuclear material accountancy. Electroanalytical work in molten salts has been limited to single analyte mixtures with a few exceptions. This work builds upon the knowledge of molten salt electrochemistry by performing electrochemical measurements on molten eutectic LiCl-KCl salt mixture containing two analytes. developing techniques for quantitatively analyzing the measured signals even with an additional signal from another analyte. correlating signals to concentration and identifying improvements in experimental and analytical methodologies.Five binary-analyte mixtures are studied with varying degrees of signal overlap; two mixtures are simulated and three are experimentally investigated. The two simulated mixtures are: UCl3-PuCl3-LiCl-KCl and UCl3-ThCl4-LiCl-KCl. The simulated data demonstrates the capabilities of multivariate analysis in determining concentration. even when electrochemical signals almost completely overlap. The three experimentally measured mixtures are: GdCl3-LaCl3-LiCl-KCl. LaCl3-ThCl4-LiCl-KCl. and UCl3-MgCl2-LiCl-KCl.

1311521,Behavior Watersheds: Examining the Geospatial Distribution and Impact of Behavior Change Programs,2014,Susan Mazur-Stommen and Kate Farley,,,,,,The Behavior Program staff at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy looked at the geographic distribution of utility-run behavior-based programs using a “hydrological” metaphor to account for potential anomalies of effect on energy savings. We hypothesized that. in areas of overlap across utility territories where different entities have responsibility over gas. electricity. and water distribution. a “flood” or “drought” model will prevail. The ability to represent the spread of behavior programs geographically using geographic information systems (GIS) software is an exciting development. We used Quantum GIS (commonly called QGIS). which is an open-source equivalent of the industry-standard software package. ArcGIS. When we looked at the “watersheds” for each utility running behavior-based interventions. an interesting picture emerged. Utilities in some areas. such as California and the Northeast. have implemented behavioral programs across large territories. These overlap to some degree. especially when gas and electric utilities share the same customer base and geographic territories. While it may come as no surprise that some areas of the country are experiencing a “drought” with respect to behavior programs. the idea that other areas are receiving overwatering may be new. There is a potential danger that message fatigue might set in for customers in regions with a high concentration of programs. and that savings may go in retrograde due to overload—what has been called “message fatigue.” Our recommendations are that. when designing a behavior-based program. utility implementers should take the environmental …,True,PU952LUAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC,0,https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/7-185.pdf,,,,,https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/7-185.pdf,0,0,0

The purpose of this task was to collect methodologically grounded insights into how and why consumers chose the cool roofing material they selected. These nine households comprised fifteen respondents. and their dependents. They were selected from among a pool of respondents to a mail solicitation of all Sacramento Municipal Utility District and Pacific Gas and Electric customers who had received a rebate for their cool roof retrofit. Consumers are uniformly happy with their cool roof retrofits. Consumers typically stayed very close to the aesthetic of the original roof style. Price was not a primary concern. while longevity was paramount. Consumers did not use roofing price. nor energy savings(with one exception). in tracking return on investment through energy savings. The utility rebate had little role to play in terms of incentivizing customers to choose cool materials.

While such a system has long been possible in areas of sufficient water supply and/or sparse population. it is now becoming possible and economical for municipal systems in virtually any modern watershed. through the use of emerging direct potable reuse (DPR) technology. In fact. current implementations are producing design and operating data. Moreover. distributed NZW systems recycling at a high rate are projected to be capable of energy-positive operation. saving more domestic hot water energy than is consumed in treatment. However. NZW and DPR approaches vary widely in terms of source water. source segregation. treatment. and recycling rate. In this study. a workshop was convened to assemble and synthesize a broad crosssection of current NZW and DPR experience. to develop recommendations for water management planning. It was concluded that technology is currently emerging to support widespread NZW management. Recommendations included the introduction of NZW systems into new construction. to be supported by controlled demonstration projects over periods of two years or more; development of supporting regulatory structure with public engagement; development of real-time water quality monitoring devices; and retention of the term “net-zero water” to signify a new water management vision to advance water and energy autonomy.,True,vpjXBCsAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Englehardt/publication/296703704_Net_Zero_Workshop_2016/data/56d99f2f08aebe4638bb90ed/Net-Zero-Workshop-2016.pdf,14876439182187144784,/scholar?cites=14876439182187144784,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Englehardt/publication/296703704_Net_Zero_Workshop_2016/data/56d99f2f08aebe4638bb90ed/Net-Zero-Workshop-2016.pdf,0,0,0

DPR systems. which include the original water distribution and wastewater treatment systems. may represent a potential low-energy replacement for aging water/wastewater infrastructures. However. centralized DPR system would require high energy of distribution of treated water. raising questions as to optimal system scale. In this study. results of the study of the optimal scale of DPR systems. considering population density and topography of the study area are presented. Fractal landscapes were simulated using a modified preferential growth algorithm. Treatment plants were allocated by agglomerative hierarchical clustering. networked to homes by minimum spanning tree. Annual capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were discounted to constant 2012 US dollars. with multiple samplings averaging across simulated population distributions. The cost of energy for residential hot water was also included as a cost of providing water. to evaluate the overall cost of distributed systems considering retention of wastewater thermal energy. Based on these results. distributed DPR systems show great advantage in rural areas due to high piping and conveyance cost.

The underneath of the SPV module is attached with a tray with a length of 1580 mm. a width of 640 mm. and a depth of 100 mm. It is filled with 40-70 litres of water. Accouters are made for water overflowing from the tube over the front surface of the module and cooling of the rear surface by spraying water. The rear surface cooling. front surface cooling. and simultaneous cooling of both the surfaces reduce the average operating temperature of the module by 15.52°C (maximum 18.6°C). 24.29°C (maximum 28.7°C). and 28.52°C (maximum 34.7°C). respectively. This temperature reduction leads to the increase in the power output of the 150 W module by 10.70 W. 18.48 W. and 20.56 W and percentage increase in efficiency by 8.778%. 15.278%. and 16.895% for rear. front. and simultaneous cooling of surfaces. respectively. The net power output of the module with the front surface cooling by overflowing (0.9 litre/min) water is higher. i.e.. 15.88 W/150 W. and produces installation capacity of 0.4234 watt-hour (Wh) of more energy per watt during the test period 10 AM to 2 …,True,or2RkIcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/8826966/,,,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/8826966/,0,0,0
1311562,Application of heat pipes in HVAC systems: a review,2017,N Nethaji and S Tharves Mohideen,11,,9,277-285,American-Eurasian Network for Scientific Information,The recent investigations show that the application of heat pipes in HVAC systems such as pre cooling the return air. reheating the supply air on the evaporator side and heat recovery from the condenser side result in more energy savings. Heat pipes incorporated in HVAC systems control the humidity at an optimum level which results in better comfort and optimum utilization of energy resource. A literature review on the studies and applications of heat pipes in HVAC system has been conducted. Based on the investigation of theoretical and experimental studies. it is found that the heat pipes are more suitable as an effective way to recover heat. control humidification and for reducing the heat load on HVAC systems and thereby saving precious energy.

1311563,Experimental studies on improvement of coefficient of performance of window air conditioning unit,2017,Mohideen Sheik Ismail Tharves and Nagachari Nethaji,21,Thermal Science,3,1349-1358,,This paper presents the performance analysis of a window air conditioner unit incorporated with wick less loop heat pipes (WLHP). The WLHP are located on the evaporator side of the air conditioning unit. The working medium for the WLHP is R134a refrigerant gas. an alternate refrigerant. The supply and return humidity of room air. the heat removal rat. and the coefficient of performance of the unit are analyzed for various ambient and room temperatures before and after incorporation of WLHP. The performance curves are drawn by comparing the power consumption and humidity collection rates for various room and ambient temperatures. The results show that coefficient of performance of the unit is improved by 18% to 20% after incorporation of WLHP due to pre-cooling of return air by WLHP. which reduces the thermal load on compressor. Similarly. the energy consumption is reduced by 20% to 25% due to higher thermostat setting and the humidity collection is improved by 35% due to pre-cooling effect of WLHP. The results are tabulated and conclusion drawn is presented based on the performance.,True,or2RkIcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0354-98361500139T,,,,,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0354-98361500139T,0,0,0
1311564,Simulation studies on performance of micro heat pipes used in laptops,2013,R Sureshkumar and S Tharves Mohideen,9,International journal of energy technology and policy,1,65-81,Inderscience Publishers Ltd,In this work. a computational analysis is used to study the thermal performance of a heat pipe utilising conventional fluids. Three of the most common fluids namely. acetone. methanol and water are considered as the working fluid. The analysis was made under different operating conditions with the parameters such as effective length. condenser length. and ratio of outer to vapour core diameter. The influence of these operating parameters on the performance parameters namely mass of the heat pipe. heat transfer rate and number of heat pipe was obtained. A substantial change in performance parameters of the heat pipe is observed when using acetone as working fluid. due to its high evaporation rate and high vapour pressure.,True,or2RkIcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJETP.2013.055815,,,,,,0,0,0
