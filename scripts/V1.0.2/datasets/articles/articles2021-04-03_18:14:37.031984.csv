A PFC BLBBR worked in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to offer a good PFC at AC mains. The main advantages of the designed model have purging of front-side diode bridge rectifier that can lead to minimize the ON/OFF losses connected with it. speed control is done without sensing speed feed-back and good PFC. The classical linear proportional integral (PI) controller is not able to manipulate the output voltage and produces poor dynamic characteristics during the large line and large disturbances. In order to improve the good output voltage/speed regulations and dynamic characteristics of a PFC BLBBR fed BLDC motor drive. a ICs is designed. The ICs are fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and neuro controller (NC). The FLC rules are framed with help of the converter behaviour without analytical modelling. The NC data’s are arrived from the conventional controller and then these data’s are trained using feed-forward back propagation algorithm. The performance of the PFC BLBBR fed same motor drive with designed NC is validated at different operating conditions by making of MATLAB/Simulink models in comparison with fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and PI controller.

Therefore. the number of power electronic devices. converter losses. size. and cost are reduced. The proposed multilevel converter topology consists of two H-bridges connected in cascaded configuration. One H-bridge operates at a high frequency (high frequency inverter) and is capable of developing a two level output while the other H-bridge operates at the fundamental frequency (low frequency inverter) and is capable of developing a multilevel output. The addition of each power electronic switch to the low frequency inverter increases the number of levels by four. This paper also introduces a hybrid switching algorithm which uses very simple arithmetic and logical operations. The simplified hybrid switching algorithm is generalized for any number of levels.

A HVDC link is connected in parallel with an existing AC tie-line to stabilize the frequency oscillations of the AC tie-line system. Any optimum controller selected for load frequency control of interconnected power systems should not only stabilize the power system but also reduce the system frequency and tie line power oscillations and settling time of the output responses. In practice Load Frequency Control (LFC) systems use simple Proportional Integral (PI) or Integral (I) controller. The controller parameters are usually tuned based on classical or trial-and-error approaches.

Due to the penetration of advanced electronics in industrial and commercial applications many utility net works fall into the problem of inefficient operations. Though the advanced technologies are used to improve the productivity and improving the facility of the consumers. they will cause severe problems to the quality of the power through many factors. If the power quality problems are not taken care then the energy usage will be more for providing the same service.

Referring to previous energetic analyses. exergetic models are set up in order to quantify the exergy destruction and efficiencies in each type of engine. The repartition of the exergy fluxes in each part of the two engines are determined and represented in Sankey diagrams. using dimensionless exergy fluxes. The results show a similar proportion in both engines of destroyed exergy compared to the exergy flux from the hot source.

Cham,In this chapter. a computational fluid dynamics (CFD numerical model) of the air flow through a 300 cm3 Beta Stirling engine has been used to characterize the pressure drop and heat transfer through the regenerator. The Stirling engine had two moving parts (i.e. piston and displacer) which were at a certain phase difference but reciprocated at same frequencies. First. particular specific mesh motion strategies were developed using the software STARCCM+. to describe the motion of the power piston and the displacer.

That is not the case. however. when an element is designed. among others. to improve building energy performance by harnessing renewable energy in a process that requires a source of external energy. Harnessing renewable energy is acquiring growing interest in Mediterranean climates as a strategy for reducing the energy consumed by buildings. When such reduction is oriented to lowering demand. the strategy consists in reducing the building’s energy needs with the use of construction elements able to passively absorb. dissipate. or accumulate energy. When reduction is pursued through M&E services. renewable energy enhances building performance. The efficiency of construction systems that use renewable energy but require a supplementary power supply to operate can be assessed by likening these systems to regenerative heat exchangers built into the building. The indicators needed for this purpose are particularly useful for designers. for they can be used to compare the efficiency or performance to deliver an optimal design for each building. This article proposes a series of indicators developed to that end and describes their application to façades bearing phase change materials (PCMs).

1305002,Design of the refurbishment of historic buildings with a cost-optimal methodology: A case study,2019,José Sánchez Ramos and Servando Álvarez Domínguez and MCarmen Pavón Moreno and MCarmen Guerrero Delgado and Laura Romero Rodríguez and José Antonio Tenorio Ríos,9,Applied Sciences,15,3104,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The transformation of existing buildings into Near Zero Energy Buildings or even positive energy buildings remains a major challenge. In particular. historic buildings are an important cultural heritage that. in most cases. may be rehabilitated and reused for new purposes. However. achieving higher efficiencies in those buildings presents many difficulties. since there is a need to preserve aesthetic values and minimize impact on the buildings’ initial construction. In this work. a roadmap that allows rehabilitating a building from the eighteenth century is developed. turning it into a landmark building. to be used as a museum in the near future. The procedure is based on 3D models using REVIT software and detailed energy simulations supported by a cost-optimal methodology. The results reveal how conventional methodologies shown in the literature may improve the energy performance of the buildings during the heating regime. but performance may deteriorate during the cooling season. For that reason. the present study includes the design of a night ventilation system which allows not only solving this problem but also to reducing the cooling demands by more than 43% with little additional costs. In conclusion. historic buildings (which traditionally have a high thermal mass) have increased thermal storage potential by using the structures of the buildings themselves as well as passive cooling techniques.

Current trends involve the use of simulation tools which obtain the buildings’ energy performance to support the development of possible solutions to help reduce energy consumption. However. simulation tools demand considerable amounts of data regarding the buildings’ geometry. construction. and frequency of use. Additionally. the measured values tend to be different from the estimated values obtained with the use of energy simulation programs. an issue known as the ‘performance gap’. The proposed methodology provides a solution for both of the aforementioned problems. since the amount of data needed is considerably reduced and the results are calibrated using measured values. This new approach allows to find an optimal retrofitting project by life cycle energy assessment. in terms of cost and energy savings. for individual buildings as well as several blocks of buildings. Furthermore. the potential for implementation of the methodology is proven by obtaining a comprehensive energy rehabilitation plan for a residential building. The developed methodology provides highly accurate estimates of energy savings. directly linked to the buildings’ real energy needs. reducing the difference between the consumption measured and the predictions.

The combined use of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems and Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS) has a great energy saving potential. allowing an efficient integration and management of renewable energy sources in buildings. This study describes the experimental campaign carried out to characterise different Phase Change Material (PCM)-based mortars and slurries for incorporation in precast building components actively controlled by means of an integrated hydronic radiant system. Specifically. this work focuses on the effects of the direct incorporation of different amounts of microencapsulated PCM on fresh and hardened material properties. such as workability. thermal conductivity and density. Results show that increasing PCM amounts significantly reduces the workability of the mixtures. leading to the use of high water-to-cement ratios. Regarding the properties in hardened state. increasing the PCM dosage increases the latent heat storage capacity. but both thermal conductivity and density drastically decrease. reducing the thermal effusivity of the mixture.

Conventional measures have been shown to be insufficient for tackling climate change and must be supplemented with ecofriendly approaches. Hence. the scientific community’s endeavor to develop natural cooling techniques that lower energy consumption while delivering satisfactory comfort levels. For its simplicity and low cost. evaporative cooling has gained in popularity in recent years. The substantial cooling power to be drawn from evaporative mist cooling. makes it an attractive alternative to conventional systems. Research conducted to date on the technique has focused on producing cold air. whilst cooling the water involved has been neither assessed nor experimentally validated. No readily applicable simplified model for the system able to use operating parameters as input variables has been defined either. The present study consequently aimed to experimentally assess the cooling power of the evaporation of sprayed water and experimentally validate a simplified model to assess and design such systems. The findings confirmed the cooling power of the technique. with declines in water temperature of up to 6 C. and with it the promise afforded by this natural air conditioning method.

The solution is based in layers of mortars and slurries for incorporation in precast building components actively controlled by means of an integrated hydronic radiant system.

The idea is to be able to activate or control the thermal inertia of the material at will for the development of the experiment as well as future applications. The models were devised to be monitored in order to obtain a detailed study of their thermal properties and performance. such as temperature profiles. heat flux. dampening or phase shift.

Why cannot real life be as rich in cultural dynamics? This paper puts forward the idea that it can be. and will be. It poses the question ‘Are the performing arts ready for playing a key role in the enrichment of everyday life in the 21st century’? It deals with the topic from an inter-disciplinary perspective and as such there is some trade-off in depth to assist horizontal connectivity.The development of new enterprises in advanced consumer economies. especially those based upon new dynamic computer technologies. requires the perspective of creative designers knowledgeable and skilled in culturally rich design. The use of products and performance of services together with the experience of them by people involves the design of particular functional and cultural characteristics. In the recent book ‘The Experience Economy’.(Pine and Gilmore. 1999) this notion is examined from a business perspective. We are on the threshold. say the authors of a new economic era in which all businesses must orchestrate memorable events for their customers that will transform the value of what they produce. Pine and Gilmore urge managers to look beyond traditional pricing factors like time and cost. and consider charging for the value of the transformation that an experience offers. Goods and services. say Pine and Gilmore. are no longer enough. experiences and transformations are the basis for future economic growth. They put these in the context below.(Pine and …,True,dDFELlgAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,7,https://www.bstjournal.com/articles/287/,5188445022410455406,/scholar?cites=5188445022410455406,,,https://www.bstjournal.com/articles/287/,0,0,0

The electric generation efficiency is always less than 100% due to resistive. transmission and distribution losses. which can be quantified as heat sent to the environment. This waste heat determines the quantity of energy that can be used by other systems in order to improve the process efficiency.A comfortable climate is required in offices. houses. and sport facilities.

The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has emerged as a promising technology to convert medium and low-grade waste heat into mechanical power and electricity. This paper presents the energy and exergy analyses of three ORC–WHR configurations that use a coupling thermal oil circuit. A simple ORC (SORC). an ORC with a recuperator (RORC). and an ORC with double-pressure (DORC) configuration are considered; cyclohexane. toluene. and acetone are simulated as ORC working fluids. Energy and exergy thermodynamic balances are employed to evaluate each configuration performance. while the available exhaust thermal energy variation under different engine loads is determined through an experimentally validated mathematical model. In addition. the effect of evaporating pressure on the net power output. thermal efficiency increase. specific fuel consumption. overall energy conversion efficiency. and exergy destruction is also investigated. The comparative analysis of natural gas engine performance indicators integrated with ORC configurations present evidence that RORC with toluene improves the operational performance by achieving a net power output of 146.25 kW. an overall conversion efficiency of 11.58%. an ORC thermal efficiency of 28.4%. and a specific fuel consumption reduction of 7.67% at a 1482 rpm engine speed. a 120.2 L/min natural gas flow. 1.784 lambda. and 1758.77 kW of mechanical engine power.

Therefore. it is useful to carry out research to improve the thermal efficiency of the ICE through a WHRS based on the organic Rankine cycle (ORC). since this type of system takes advantage of the heat of the exhaust gases to generate electrical energy. The organic working fluid selection was developed according to environmental criteria. operational parameters. thermodynamic conditions of the gas engine. and investment costs. An economic analysis is presented for the systems operating with three selected working fluids: toluene. acetone. and heptane. considering the main costs involved in the design and operation of the thermal system. Furthermore. an exergo-advanced study is presented on the WHRS based on ORC integrated to the ICE. which is a Jenbacher JMS 612 GS-N of 2 MW power fueled with natural gas. This advanced exergetic analysis allowed us to know the opportunities for improvement of the equipment and the increase in the thermodynamic performance of the ICE. The results show that when using acetone as the organic working fluid. there is a greater tendency of improvement of endogenous character in Pump 2 of around 80%.

1305050,Evaluation of an integrated household refrigerator evaporator with two eutectic phase-change materials,2018,Juan A.Tangarife JonathanCofré-Toledo and Diego A.Vasco and César A.Isaza-Roldán,,International Journal of Refrigeration,,,,Domestic refrigerators are among the most energy-consuming appliances. In many countries. efforts have been undertaken to enhance the thermal efficiency of domestic refrigerators. and such improvements have been focused mainly on compressor operation and electronic control. The use of phase change materials (PCMs) in domestic refrigerators decreases the cycling period of the compressor and reduces internal temperature fluctuations. Two eutectic PCMs are thermally characterised (PLUSICE E-10 and 19.5 wt% NH4Cl). Their phase-change temperatures and latent heat values are determined. and their thermal conductivity and density are measured at 20 °C. The main goal of the present work is to study the behaviour of an integrated modified-evaporator of a household refrigerator with two different eutectic PCMs by performing standardised tests.

These factors affect the timing and magnitude of climate-change impacts associated with bioenergy in ways that cannot be clearly communicated with a single metric. This is critical as key comparisons that determine incentives and policy for bioenergy are based upon climate-change impacts expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent calculated with GWP100.

1305111,Greenhouse gases (GHG) performance of refurbishment projects–lessons,,ECW Lou and A Lee and A Welfle,44,Building and Environment,12,2510-2520,Date 2017,There is growing scientific and political consensus that climate change represents the greatest environmental threat and challenge of modern times. The key driver of climate change is the robust link between the generation of greenhouse gases (GHG) and rising global temperatures (CCC. 2016). GHG emissions from UK buildings have been reported to contribute up to 37% of the UK’s total GHG emissions (TSB. 2014). Notwithstanding GHG emissions generated during the design. material manufacture. distribution and on-site construction of UK buildings can reflect up to 18% of a building’s whole lifecycle carbon footprint (BIS. 2010). A clear link has been identified between the whole life cycle environmental and GHG performance of a building and the focus and investment during the construction phase–for example less initial capital investment spent on insulation or plant may result in increased operation or maintenance expenditure and reduced environmental performance over the buildings whole lifecycle (Bribián et al.. 2009). Therefore. if the UK is to meet its climate change targets whilst maintaining a vibrant construction sector. emphasis should focus on reducing the impact of buildings. and particularly construction practices.The UK Department for Environment. Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirm that improvements driven by construction industry players will be crucial for reducing emissions (DEFRA. 2013). Considering that 87% of existing buildings in the UK will likely be standing in 2050 (UK GBC. 2016). a large focus of construction projects in the future will be retrofitting and/or refurbishment of existing buildings.

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are promising candidates to coach the energy transition. Yet. SOFC performance are markedly affected by fuel composition and operative parameters. In order to optimize SOFC operation and to provide a prompt regulation. reliable performance simulation tools are required. Given the high variability ascribed to the fuel in the wide range of SOFC applications and the high non-linearity of electrochemical systems. the implementation of artificial intelligence techniques. like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). is sound. In this paper. several network architectures based on a feedforward-backpropagation algorithm are proposed and trained on experimental data-set issued from tests on commercial NiYSZ/8YSZ/LSCF anode supported planar button cells. The best simulator obtained is a 3-hidden layer ANN (25/22/18 neurons per layer. hyperbolic tangent sigmoid as transfer function. obtained with a gradient descent with adaptive learning rate backpropagation). This shows high accuracy (RMS= 0.67% in the testing phase) and successful application in the forecast of SOFC polarization behaviour in two additional experiments (RMS in the order of 3% is scored. yet it is reduced to about 2% if only the typical operating current density range of real application is considered. from 300 to 500 mA· cm− 2).

The high operating temperature permits to reach optimal conductivity and favours kinetics without requiring noble metal catalysts. The SOFC behaviour analysis is fundamental to optimise operating conditions and to obtain the best performance. For this purpose. specific models are studied to investigate the electrochemical kinetics. which is the most critical aspect in the simulation. This is closely linked to cell materials and structure. as well as to operating conditions (feed composition and temperature above all) that influence cell polarization effects. The present work aims at evaluating these contributions by means of a semi-empirical kinetic formulation based on both theoretical and experimental approaches. A dedicated experimental campaign on an anode-supported NiYSZ/8YSZ/GDC-LSCF button cell is performed to identify experimental parameters. Each working variable is changed singularly to understand its specific effect. avoiding the overlap of multiple effects. The studied kinetics is validated using a 0D model to evaluate global cell operation. and a 1D model to estimate occurring mechanisms along anode thickness.

1305134,How to Power the Energy–Water Nexus: Coupling Desalination and Hydrogen Energy Storage in Mini-Grids with Reversible Solid Oxide Cells,2020,Arianna Baldinelli and Linda Barelli and Gianni Bidini and Giovanni Cinti and Alessandro Di Michele and Francesco Mondi,8,Processes,11,1494,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Sustainable Development Goals establish the main challenges humankind is called to tackle to assure equal comfort of living worldwide. Among these. the access to affordable renewable energy and clean water are overriding. especially in the context of developing economies. Reversible Solid Oxide Cells (rSOC) are a pivotal technology for their sector-coupling potential. This paper aims at studying the implementation of such a technology in new concept PV-hybrid energy storage mini-grids with close access to seawater. In such assets. rSOCs have a double useful effect: charge/discharge of the bulk energy storage combined with seawater desalination. Based on the outcomes of an experimental proof-of-concept on a single cell operated with salty water. the operation of the novel mini-grid is simulated throughout a solar year. Simulation results identify the fittest mini-grid configuration in order to achieve energy and environmental optimization. hence scoring a renewable penetration of more than 95%. marginal CO 2 emissions (13 g/kWh). and almost complete coverage of load demand. Sector-coupling co-production rate (desalinated water versus electricity issued from the rSOC) is 0.29 L/kWh.

They can easily switch from fuel cell to electrolyzer mode in order to guarantee the production of electricity. heat or directly hydrogen as fuel depending on energy demand and utilization. The proposed modeling is able to calculate effectively SOC performance in both operating modes. basing on the same electrochemical equations and system parameters. just setting the current density direction. The identified kinetic core is implemented in different simulation tools as a function of the scale under study. When the analysis mainly focuses on the kinetics affecting the global performance of small-sized single cells. a 0D code written in Fortran and then executed in Aspen Plus is used. When larger-scale single or stacked cells are considered and local maps of the main physicochemical properties on the cell plane are of interest. a detailed in-home 2D Fortran code is carried out. The presented modeling is validated on experimental data collected on laboratory SOCs of different scales and electrode materials. showing a good agreement between calculated and measured values and so confirming its applicability for multiscale approach studies.

1305137,SOFC direct fuelling with high-methane gases,,A Baldinelli and L Barelli and G Bidini and A Di Michele and R Vivani,,,,,,Low-carbon gases such as natural gas or biogas are very attractive fuels since they give rise to moderate GHG emissions and they represent easy-to-handle hydrogen vectors. For stationary applications. natural gas is commonly used for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) and. generally. external reforming is performed before the SOFC unit. Similarly. biogas has been claimed to be a good alternative to feed a SOFC. However. since SOFCs are operating at high temperature. methane decomposition could occur directly in the fuel cell; thus the external reformer can be avoided with advantages in terms of system complexity and cost reduction. Nonetheless. unlike the use of reformate fuels. the direct exposure to large amount of methane favours the occurrence of degradation mechanisms on conventional NiYSZ SOFC anodes. To this concern. as a mitigation measure. the coexistence of either air or carbon dioxide in the fuel mixture is helpful in the prevention of rapid degradation.,True,lPw_HcMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arianna_Baldinelli/publication/305656569_SOFC_direct_fuelling_with_high-methane_gases_Optimal_strategies_for_fuel_dilution_and_upgrade_to_avoid_quick_degradation/links/57e290e208ae427e2959dfb3/SOFC-direct-fuelling-with-high-methane-gases-Optimal-strategies-for-fuel-dilution-and-upgrade-to-avoid-quick-degradation,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arianna_Baldinelli/publication/305656569_SOFC_direct_fuelling_with_high-methane_gases_Optimal_strategies_for_fuel_dilution_and_upgrade_to_avoid_quick_degradation/links/57e290e208ae427e2959dfb3/SOFC-direct-fuelling-with-high-methane-gases-Optimal-strategies-for-fuel-dilution-and-upgrade-to-avoid-quick-degradation,0,0,0

This paper is intended to contribute to fill this gap by presenting a new method based on a genetic algorithm which is able to search for optimum urban forms in mid-latitude climates (35−50°). Here. more energy efficient urban forms are defined as those which have high building absorptance in winter and low summer building absorptance. These forms can be designed by choosing among regular tri-dimensional building geometries with fixed floor space index. which can be parameterized by adjusting the following variables: number of floors. building length ratio. grid azimuth. and aspect ratio on both directions.

1305156,Air flow exchange velocity of urban canyon cavities due to thermal spatial differences,2006,Marta Oliveira Panão and Helder Gonçalves and Paulo Ferrão,,"PLEA2006, The 23rd Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture",,,,In this paper. the air exchange velocity between the urban canyon cavity and the air layer above roof level is quantified. using a two-dimensional k-ε model. and correlated with the air cavity mean temperature. for two cases: leeward and downward wall heating. The spatial thermal differences are evaluated by assuming a wall temperature higher than the air temperature. with this difference ranging between 0 and 16 K. The undisturbed wind velocity above the roof level is varied from 1 to 6 ms-1 and the canyon aspect ratio is 1.5. which corresponds to a skimming flow regime. The model predicts two situations. which correspond to air flow regimes where one or two eddies are formed. respectively: (a) for high wind speed. the air inside the cavity is negligible affect by the buoyancy effect and the air exchange velocity linearly increases with the increase of wind velocity; (b) for low wind speed. when the buoyancy forces are stronger than the wind induced forces. the air exchange velocity is not a linear function with the wind velocity. The transition wind velocity between (a) and (b) is a function of the wall-air temperature difference. The situation of windward heated wall and two eddies air flow regime is the most favorable to extract heat from the cavity. On the contrary. the heated air is hardly extracted from the cavity when only the wind induced eddy is predicted and windward wall is heated. In this situation an increase of 10 K on the wall temperature increases by 1 K the in-cavity air temperature.,True,k-EwT5wAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2,https://repositorio.lneg.pt/handle/10400.9/538,8338597587650058619,/scholar?cites=8338597587650058619,,,https://repositorio.lneg.pt/bitstream/10400.9/538/1/AIRFLOWEXCHAMARTA.pdf,0,0,0

The presence of external obstacles. such as natural topography. other buildings. overhangs. or side fins. may significantly decrease solar gains. Simplified methods to evaluate shading on windows throughout the year use the shading correction factor concept. i.e.. the ratio between the surface solar irradiation in the presence of external obstacles and in their absence. This paper presents a photographic method using a low-cost fisheye lens attached to a smartphone to quantify the shading correction factor. It is based on image processing. solar geometry. and climate databases and does not require 3D building design or angle measurement of external obstacles.

1305163,Lessons learnt from using energy poverty expenditure-based indicators in a mild winter climate,2021,Marta JN Oliveira Panão,,Energy and Buildings,,110936,Elsevier,Several Southern European countries are paradoxical examples of high energy poverty. revealed by multiple indicators. despite their mild winter climates. Energy poverty may be quantified by using expenditure-based indicators that compare energy expenditure to net income. as a measure of how elastic is the net income to pay for energy. Because of the mild winter season and low efficient buildings. paying for space heating is not a top priority expense for most of the households. This cultural behavior exposes people to continuous cold conditions. This paper aims at a better understanding of the performance of energy poverty expenditure-based indicators in the Portuguese case-study. using national statistics raw data from 2015. The main conclusions of this study are twofold. First. a moderate heating cost is calculated by the difference between the median actual energy expenditure for households with a central heating system and those without any. Calculated equivalised values range from 116 (Lisbon region area) and 202€(central region). The same order of magnitude is found for the difference between very low and very high incomes total energy expenses. which is 285€. Therefore. a reliable energy poverty indicator should rely on its capacity to evaluate net-income elasticity to pay for expected energy expenditure. From the evaluated indicators. the minimum income standard (MIS) is the more stable. identifying 27.8% households potential energy-poor. Still. this figure should be complemented with tracking MIS households where actual is significantly below expected energy expenditure (15.6%).

1305164,New energy performance indexes for energy-efficient interactive buildings,2013,Marta Oliveira Panão and Susana Camelo and Helder Gonçalves,,EfS2013 Conference-Energy for sustainability: Sustainable cities: Designing for people and the planet,,1-8,,This paper argues that promoting energy supply by Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in buildings. namely residential. requires additional informative indexes to be included in buildings Energy Performance Certificates. The load-generation approach for the energy balance is here discussed. and compared with the current recommended by CEN/TR 15615. i.e. the delivered-exported approach. Besides the Energy Performance Index. which takes the same value for both approaches. other indexes are studied. From the analysis considering two variants for a single-family house with six solutions for energy systems. it is suggested to include: i) L/R (building load vs benchmark load) and ii) G/L (RES supply vs building load). On the one hand. L/R distinguishes the solutions where the building envelope is optimized from those where the driver to reduce EPI is the RES supply installation. On the other hand. G/L quantifies the RES share in the building demand and goes in line with what is recommended for the principles defining nearly Zero Energy Buildings. The breakdown of G/L into on-site and off-site RES will be also very helpful in differentiating local RES supply from imported renewables fuels. such as biomass. Moreover. considering smart cities. not only energy flows are important but also information flows (e.g. energy forecast. energy management). thus. new energy performance indexes are required for energy-efficient interactive buildings.,True,k-EwT5wAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://repositorio.lneg.pt/handle/10400.9/2030,,,,,https://repositorio.lneg.pt/bitstream/10400.9/2030/1/EnergySustainability2013-MPanao.pdf,0,0,0

Data were collected for 125 Pakistani textile firms listed at Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) for the period of 2006 to 2011. Results revealed that both short term and long term debt borrowings are negatively associated with profitability. These negative relationships. however. are less severe in case of cost leadership comparatively. We argue that debt covenants imposed by creditors enforce managers for operational efficiencies and restrict them from taking riskier decisions required for innovative performance. We also found that the benefits of debt covenants in cost leadership strategy are more prominent for long term debt borrowings as compared to short term debt financing.

The residual effects of nitrogen ie 60. 120 and 180kg per ha applied to previous maize crop. were studied by planting barley variety sanober on the plots of maize experiment.

Residual effects of rates of nitrogen significantly affected plant height. grains per spike. spikes m-2. 1000 grains weight and grain yield. Tallest plants (101 cm). more spikes m2 (276) and maximum grain yield (1957 kg per ha) of barley were noted in plots to which nitrogen was applied at the rate of 180 kg per ha.

We have investigated the laminar and steady flow of an incompressible Eyring-Powell fluid through a wall jet with viscous dissipation. To obtain the numerical solution of the problem by the RK coupled with the shooting method. we have utilized boundary layer approximation to reduce the governing equations along with appropriate boundary conditions. Fluid parameter m acts as a resistive force for the flow of the fluid. Variation in the temperature profile due the Prandtl number also predicts that for its higher values the rate of heat transfer decreases. The viscous dissipation parameter known to be the local Eckert number helps to obtain increased thermal boundary layer thickness and a decrease in the rate of heat transfer.,True,8lRkdYsAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjp/i2018-12182-y,11252463508352592306,/scholar?cites=11252463508352592306,,,,0,0,0

The Global Fund for Muslim Women reports that while Muslims constitute 25 percent of the world’s population. Muslim nations contribute only 11.2 percent to the Global GDP. Data from the World Economic Forum and the United Nations suggests that much of this gap can be attributed to gender inequality despite Islamic teachings that support gender symmetry and equality of all people. While the educational system in the modern Middle East is dilapidated and anemic compared to similarly situated developing countries in parts of Latin America and East Asia. this essay asserts that the single-largest impediment to future regional prosperity in the Middle East is the lack of female education.

But after the Soviet Union collapsed. disputes over the use of biological (lucrative fish. primarily sturgeon. stocks) and hydrocarbon supplies (the development of coastal and offshore oil and gas fields) have become particularly aggravated.The biological resources are mostly found in the fresh and shallow waters of the Northern Caspian. The rich biogenic river runoff. the extraordinarily favorable spawning and cultivation conditions. and the limited role of carnivorous predators make this part of the sea a kind of “kindergarten” for its most valuable species of fish: great sturgeon. stellate sturgeon. and barbel sturgeon.

We adapted the Shockley-Queisser radiative flux balance framework to account for a variation of the spectrum and intensity of the incoming light. We find that the ideal band gap and the maximum efficiency depend on the spectral albedo of the surroundings and that optimal cell performance cannot be assessed when only accounting for a spectrally independent albedo. With a spectral albedo model. we predict that the power output for a bifacial silicon solar cell surrounded by green grass is 3.1% higher than for a wavelength-independent albedo. and even 5.2% higher for white sand.

The most common heat source to combine with district heating in Sweden is an exhaust air heat pump. On average. the exhaust air heat pump covers 31% of the yearly heat load and is given full load priority.

1305251,Smart Energy Grids,2017,Johan Kensby,,,,,,Buildings are the largest energy-using sector in the world. Since the generation of energy is highly associated with greenhouse gas emissions. contributing to climate change. there is a large focus on reducing energy use in buildings. However. reducing the end use of energy is not an end goal in itself: it is also important to take into consideration how the energy used in buildings is generated. In most district heating systems. the conditions for generating heat are constantly changing. and the marginal cost and environmental impact can vary greatly within a single day. It is therefore of interest to take a step back and study the energy use in buildings with a system boundary that includes the energy supply system. eg. a district heating system.The objective of this work is to study how the control of space heating in buildings can be adapted to a system boundary that includes the energy supply system in order to gain a total cost improvement. Heat use flexibility is therefore important. and two types of flexibility are studied: First. the thermal inertia in buildings can be used as short-term thermal energy storage for shifting heat use from hours with high cost of heat generation and environmental impact to more favorable hours. Second. in buildings with both district heating and heat pump as heat sources. the heat load can be shifted between them to favor the heat source with the lowest cost of generation at any given time. In order to utilize these flexibilities. there needs to be some type of control system with integration towards the energy supply system. For this purpose. hourly heat prices based on the marginal cost of heat generation in a district heating …,True,S61mzVAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81669391.pdf,12976147894504757929,/scholar?cites=12976147894504757929,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81669391.pdf,0,0,0
1305252,Building Automation Systems Design. Guidelines for Systems with Complex Requirements,2012,Johan Kensby and Rasmus Olsson,,,,,,Buildings today are becoming more and more advanced and the demands on building services are increasing. A modern building is expected to provide a number of services with high security. energy efficiency and convenience. For a building with complex requirements due to the activity. such as a hospital. the services provided are even more advanced and the requirements on them are higher. This implies for the need of a building automation system. These systems come with a cost and have some drawbacks. This thesis will take on the task to study how to benefit from the possibilities with building automation systems while minimizing the drawbacks. The aim is to find guidelines for how to design. procure and manage a building automation system in a hospital in an effective way. The thesis contains a theoretical part. describing the general architecture and functions of a building automation system. Further treated is the different technologies that supply this function and handles communication. Interviews and participation in meetings with people working with building automation systems in hospitals and other buildings with complex requirements due to the activity has been carried out. This has resulted in a part that contains their collection of knowledge. experiences and opinions on these systems. Many of the main issues with building automation systems are treated. like how to avoid dependency on a small group of people and how to ensure the function of several systems that integrate with each other.

Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure. with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However. supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue. we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus. we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility.

1305273,Method to accurately estimate Tesla turbine stall torque for dynamometer or generator load selection,2010,Tamir A Emran and Ryan C Alexander and Chris T Stallings and Mark A DeMay and Matthew J Traum,9,ASME Early Career Technical Journal,,7,,For experimental Tesla turbine measurements and characterization. conventional dynamometer diagnostics meant for small IC engines are challenging because Tesla turbines produce power at high angular velocity and low torque. Moreover. similar challenges arise when sizing generators for Tesla-turbine-based power generation. Often the minimum cutin torque of a conventional dynamometer or generator exceeds the stall torque of the Tesla turbine at a desired set-point. To facilitate proper sizing of dynamometers/generators for Tesla turbine diagnostics and power generation. a simple. inexpensive. and accurate method is introduced to experimentally assess a Tesla turbine’s static torque under a prescribed series of inlet conditions using a simple spring force gauge. This static torque measurement technique is validated by using it to select an appropriate brushed DC motor at the heart of a customized dynamometer to be used in future research. The Tesla turbine used in this current study successfully spun up the motor as anticipated.Additionally an analytical technique is introduced. applicable to Tesla turbine configurations with four equally spaced inlet ports. to estimate the static torque produced by the turbine based on its measured un-loaded rotational velocity.

Although similar in appearance to a helicopter rotor. the autogyro’s main rotor operates by a different aerodynamic principal. and it inclines rearward with respect to the flight direction under normal conditions1. As no power is transmitted from the airframe to the main rotor. a torque-balancing tail rotor. familiar in most helicopters. is not necessary. A powered propeller. aligned in the flight direction. provides propulsive thrust. Despite the autogyro’s robust and safe flight stability against stall situations. this aircraft type has incurred a particularly high accident rate as compared to other sport aircraft2.

Accusations were levied against the Patriots that game footballs had been intentionally deflated to make them easier to handle. Cheating allegations induced months of intense media coverage and earned the moniker “Deflategate”. After investigation and trial. the Patriots were censured. However. they never admitted guilt. leaving the facts unresolved. Instead of tampering. might observed football deflation have an underlying alternative thermophysical explanation? For locker-room-inflated (~296 K) game footballs played in cold Foxboro stadium (~283 K). Gay-Lussac’s Law predicts a 4.4% pressure drop. corresponding to 4.1 kPa below full ball inflation.

Conductance is reported to increase by several orders of magnitude following immersion of alkanethiol-stabilized gold nanoparticle monolayers in a solution containing conjugated thiol-functionalized molecules. Typically. this observation is attributed to molecular exchange. Less attention has been paid to the role of the solvent alone.

In this study we explore the potential of taking advantage of the inherent magnetic properties associated with the metal (alloy or oxide) incorporated in CNTs during their production. The as-received CNTs are refined by applying a permanent magnet to a suspension of CNTs to separate the high-magnetic fraction; the low-magnetic fraction is discarded with the solvent. The collected MCNTs were characterized by a suite of 10 diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. A key discovery is that metallic nano-clusters of Fe and/or Ni located in the interior cavities of the nanotubes give MCNTs their ferromagnetic character. After refinement using our method. the MCNTs show saturation magnetizations up to 10 times that of the as-received materials. In addition. we demonstrate the ability of these MCNTs to repeatedly remove atrazine from water in a cycle of dispersion into a water sample. adsorption of the atrazine onto the MCNTs. collection by magnetic attraction and regeneration by ethanol. The resulting MCNTs show high adsorption capacities (> 40 mg-atrazine/g). high magnetic response. and straightforward regeneration.

In the potential region controlled by kinetics. such a lower ECSA is counterbalanced by the high specific activity.

The PEMFC costs can be reduced by decreasing the size of Pt nanoparticles in the catalyst layer. thereby increasing the Pt dispersion and utilization. Furthermore. high-power performance loss due to O2 transport resistance is alleviated by decreasing the particle size and increasing dispersion.

To arrive at guidelines to decide on the cost effectiveness of an improvement in collector design. the changes in collector parameters resulting from the design change have to be related to the change in a load fraction supplied by solar energy. For this it is essential that the collector array is considered as part of a complete system and the analysis must relate the changes in collector parameters to changes in annual load fraction supplied by the system.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) investigated possible future oil demand scenarios for China in the 2006 World Energy Outlook. The debate on whether oil supplies will be constrained in the near future. because of limited new discoveries. raises the concern that the oil industry may not be able to produce sufficient oil to meet this demand.This paper examines the historical relationship between economic growth and oil consumption in a number of countries. Logistic curve characteristics are observed in the relationship between per capita economic activity and oil consumption. This research has determined that the minimum statistical (lower-bound) annual oil consumption for developed countries is 11 barrels per capita.

Improvements to model accuracy rely primarily on the refinement of parameter sensitivities and on plausible future carbon emissions trajectories. Carbon emissions are the leading cause of global warming. yet current considerations of future emissions do not consider structural limits to fossil fuel supply. invoking a wide range of uncertainty.

In addition to intrinsic uncertainty associated with the natural climate. projections of climate change are subject to the combined uncertainties associated with selection of emissions scenarios. GCM ensembles and downscaling techniques. In particular. unknown future greenhouse gas emissions contribute substantially to the overall uncertainty. We contend that a reduction in uncertainty is possible by refining emissions scenarios. We present a comprehensive review of the growing body of literature that challenges the assumptions underlying the high-growth emissions scenarios (widely used in climate change impact studies). and instead points to a peak and decline in fossil fuel production occurring in the 21st century. We find that the IPCC's new RCP 4.5 scenario (low-medium emissions). as well as the B1 and A1T (low emissions) marker scenarios from the IPCC's Special Report on Emissions Scenarios are broadly consistent with the majority of recent fossil fuel production forecasts. whereas the medium to high emissions scenarios generally depend upon unrealistic assumptions of future fossil fuel production. We use a simple case study of projected climate change in 2070 for the Scott Creek catchment in South Australia to demonstrate that even with the current suite of climate models. by limiting projections to the B1 scenario. both the median change and the spread of model results are reduced relative to equivalent projections under an unrealistic high emissions scenario (A1FI).,True,D_B1nxsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,18,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/1879/2011/,8406185020105709430,/scholar?cites=8406185020105709430,,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/1879/2011/hess-15-1879-2011.pdf,0,0,0

Although this apparent disconnect between action and concern has been the topic of much debate. little progress has been made towards the resolution of causal factors across the various disciplines of scientific knowledge related to the human condition. Many scholars have. however. contributed towards the notion that the human development trajectory is lacking a rational basis and emphasized that reigning conflicts in societal objectives cannot be resolved without a unifying ethical reference.

Provision of a heat exchanger arrangement 31 which can be associated with a traditional open flame stove utilised in third world countries would be advantageous. However. such heat exchanger arrangements must be lightweight and robust to withstand operational use. By creating a heat exchanger arrangement formed from plates having apertures which develop a folded conduit to act as a resonance tube of appropriate length it is possible to more easily accommodate thermo-acoustic electrical power generation and cooling effects in a traditional stove configuration.,True,06xMAx4AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,7,https://patents.google.com/patent/US20110162827A1/en,12455798641794870066,/scholar?cites=12455798641794870066,,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/77/fa/89/2980f9674dd932/US20110162827A1.pdf,0,0,0

Results from the theoretical model are compared with an experimental device in order to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The measured impedance and phase response of the linear alternator show distinct evidence of a thermo-acoustic interaction which is consistent with the predictions of the model. The measured results show that significant mechanical loss is present in the system which prevents the rig from self-starting.

In these cases. the Stirling engine ideal efficiency is not as is normally reported equal to the Carnot cycle efficiency but is significantly lower. A new equation for ideal Stirling engine efficiency when the heat is obtained through external combustion without pre-heating the air. is presented and results for various fuels tabulated. The results show that petrol and diesel. internal combustion engines (Otto cycle) have a higher ideal efficiency than the Stirling engine. When comparing thermoacoustic engines heated by wood. efficiency should not be quoted as a percentage of the Carnot efficiency. but against a figure 48% lower than Carnot.

This prototype was limited to an operating temperature of about 300oC and due to excessive leaks could not operate continuously above ambient pressure. To absorb a thermal heat input of 4.4 kW from the burning wood so as to fulfil the required acoustic power. the Hot Heat Exchanger (HHX) requires heating to the highest possible temperature. Therefore. a corrugated stainless steel plate HHX design that maximises heating surface area was adopted to the current Demo2 TAE design. In addition. the system is often pressurised to achieve higher acoustic intensity. Rigorous sealing of the system at high temperature is also required. A Demo2. 1 TAE design based on the Demo2 TAE design and its prototype which is developed recently by the SCORE™ Centre in Malaysia was successfully constructed and well integrated with the stove. During the early construction and assembly process. fabrication difficulties and serious leak problems around the HHX’s edges were found when the apparatus operated at high temperatures. This is because the uneven geometrical HHX (convolution profile) makes it difficult and relatively costly to be sealed. The Demo2. 1 TAE is focused on the sealing efficiency and effective manufacturing cost by meantime to allow further modification variation. The design was made to adopt the local manufacturing technologies and materials available or easy to access in Malaysia.

In order to control the power flows of each loop independently. at the first. the minimum need of PST sets is determined as the number of co-trees to the entire network. For the reason that the co-tree patterns are not unique. there are many PST allocations that exist and can be found as the co-tree patterns. In this paper. since the correlation between power-flow deviations to the control angles of PSTs allocating in one co-tree pattern can be characterized into one matrix. the features of the controllable area of power flows corresponding to all PSTs allocation candidates can be extracted by the eigenanalysis of those matrices.

Coalbed methane is viewed as a cleaner energy source versus petroleum and coal combustion because methane extraction. transport and use are more efficient and less polluting. However. coalbed methane contains high amounts of CO2 that induce solidification during liquefaction. Therefore. CO2 has to be reduced below 2% to meet the pipeline transportation standards. In addition. CO2 capture would reduce the amount of gas emissions to the atmosphere. thus mitigating global warming. Here. we review membrane absorption. which is an advanced method for CO2 capture from coalbed methane. by controlling the gas and liquid phases separately during the operation process.

This process paves a production path through melting industrial waste and subsequently cooling the casting in water. The idea erases the need to reduce the environmental impact of the cement industry in terms of natural resources consumption as well as the re-utilization of abandoned wastes from other industries. The recycled industrial wastes were selected according to the amount of waste produced in the industrial field and its suitable chemical composition. such as construction and demolition waste and/or shells from shellfish. As a main result. the mechanical properties showed by our novel material were worse than those reported by blast furnace slag (25–28 MPa for two different proportions) for seven days and better (43–52 MPa for two different proportions) for 28 days. The rest of the properties evaluated were in agreement with the standards’ requirements.

Co-production of biomethane and urea from biogas as case study,2020,Francisco M Baena-Moreno and D Sebastia-Saez and Qiang Wang and Tomas Ramirez Reina,220,Energy Conversion and Management,,113058,Pergamon,In this paper we present a techno-economic analysis of a novel route for biomethane – urea co-production from biogas. The idea emerges as an alternative path for improving the profitability of biogas upgrading plants. The profitability of four different biogas plant sizes (100. 250. 500. and 1000 m3/h) in four European countries (Spain. Italy. United Kingdom and Germany) is studied under the current policy schemes for biomethane production of each country. Our study evidences that with the present policy schemes for biomethane production. only medium and large scale plants (500 and 1000 m3/h) in Italy would be profitable. The reason is the current strong support for biomethane production in Italy through feed-in tariffs subsidies. In this sense. we analysed the potential benefits of governmental incentives through bio-methane subsidies (feed-in tariffs and investment percentage). Feed-in tariffs proved to be a …,True,jIHx4R4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890420306026,4609714434064306226,/scholar?cites=4609714434064306226,,,,0,0,0

Burning and gasification of coal. however. generate environmental problems. Clean coal technologies address this problem. which include a new generation of abatement techniques. some currently available and others being developed. These techniques have the ability to sharply reduce CO2 and pollutant emissions into the atmosphere. The most important pollutants to air from coal are nitrogen and sulfur oxides (NOx and SOx) and particulate matter.

Differently to traditional Power-to-Gas processes. the process configuration herein proposed allows to produce biomethane even if a source of hydrogen is not available. The novelties of this work are both the new process configuration and the comparison among results for several plant sizes (100. 250. 500. and 1000 m3/h) under two representative EU scenarios (Spain and Germany). The main finding of this work is that no profitable results can be obtained at the present natural gas prices. evidencing the need of incentives. Largest plant could reach profitability under reasonable subsidies (12–15 €/MWh). The forecasted cost reduction for H2 production and CO2 methanation are also analysed.

It is well known that the catalytic and optical properties of NMNs can be effectively tailored by tuning their size and shape. Therefore. a number of synthetic routes have been developed for morphology-controlled synthesis of NMNs. Among these synthetic methods. wet chemical synthesis is probably the most powerful approach to the preparation of noble metal nanostructures in large quantity with controlled shapes. sizes. and compositions. To achieve control over shape and size during synthesis. capping ligands such as polymers. surfactants. dendrimers. or small organic molecules are generally employed. However. the presence of ligands on the surface of NMNs may drastically affect their catalytic activity. stability. and suitability for biological applications. Especially for catalysis. bare NMNs free of capping ligands are highly desirable. But without capping ligands. it is difficult to tailor the size and morphology of the nanoparticles since they would all grow into the most thermodynamically stable form. In addition. ligand-free NMNs are highly unstable and easily aggregate in solution.Therefore. the objective of the current research is to design synthetic methods for ligandfree NMNs with controllable size. shape. composition and exposed facets.

However. HCCI has no direct combustion initiator and. when achieved by reinducting or trapping residual exhaust gas with a variable valve actuation (VVA) system. becomes a dynamic process as the temperature of the residual gas couples one cycle to the next. These characteristics of residual-affected HCCI present a challenge for control engineers and a barrier to implementing HCCI in a production engine. In order to address these challenges. this paper outlines physics-based control strategies for both the VVA system and the HCCI combustion process.

Dilution limits are explored with various valve profiles in order to gain insight into the best way to use exhaust residual to achieve and control HCCI. The tests repeatedly point out the importance of delayed combustion phasing to reduce thermal losses and maximize efficiency. Combustion phasing is not significantly affected by charge in-cylinder residence time. but is strongly influenced by both the level of exhaust residual and by valve strategies that aim to affect homogeneity. Further dilution with air shows little promise for reaching lower loads. but does suggest that operation near the lean limit can maximize efficiency while minimizing NO and CO emissions.

We propose a simple alternative procedure to compensate for any variation (smooth or abrupt) in crystal field parameters. Four examples taken from the literature. plus the complete set of unpublished data for Ln DOTMA are discussed in detail to illustrate the power and limitation of the conventional Reilley treatment and to demonstrate the power and scope of our alternative approach.,True,NyVVh7kAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,45,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010854511001573,5391102017036281350,/scholar?cites=5391102017036281350,,,,0,0,0

For this reason. MSW management is generally one of the most expensive services provided by municipalities. In this paper. we analyze the Japanese MSW management system and estimate the cost elasticity with respect to the waste volumes at three treatment stages: collection. processing. and disposal. Although we observe economies of scale at all three stages. the collection cost is less elastic than the disposal cost. We also examine whether source separation at home affects the cost of MSW management. The empirical results show that the separate collection of the recyclable fraction leads to reduced processing costs at intermediate treatment facilities. but does not change the overall waste management cost …,True,NyVVh7kAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X17300156,16588656149447581670,/scholar?cites=16588656149447581670,,,,0,0,0

Here we show that these predictions. which range between 240 and 450 million hectares (Mha). underestimate the potential extension of irrigation by ignoring basic parametric and model uncertainties. We found that the probability distribution of global irrigated areas in 2050 spans almost half an order of magnitude (∼300–800 Mha. P2.5.P97.5). with the right tail pushing values to up to ∼1.800 Mha.

While silver-paste use in photovoltaics cell metallization is becoming more efficient. solar photovoltaics power capacity installation is growing at an exponential pace. Along photovoltaics. silver is also employed in an array of industrial and non-industrial applications. The trends of these uses are examined up to the year 2050. The technical coefficients for the expansion in photovoltaics power capacity and contraction in silver paste use have been assessed through an expert-consultation process. The trend of use in the non-PV sectors has been estimated through an ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) model. The yearly and cumulative silver demand are evaluated against the technological potential for increasing silver mining and the estimates of its global natural availability. respectively. The model implemented is tested with a quasi-random Monte Carlo variance-based global sensitivity analysis. The result of our inquiry is that silver may not represent a constraint for a very-large-scale deployment of photovoltaics (up to tens TW in installed power capacity) provided the present decreasing trend in the use of silver paste in the photovoltaics sector continues at an adequate pace. Silver use in non-photovoltaic sectors plays also a tangible influence on potential constraints.

It is not unusual to consider a variance-based sensitivity analysis as informative if it produces at least the first order sensitivity indices S_j and the so-called total-effect sensitivity indices T_j for all the uncertain factors of the mathematical model under analysis. Computational economy is critical in sensitivity analysis. It depends mostly upon the number of model evaluations needed to obtain stable values of the estimates. While efficient estimation procedures independent from the number of factors under analysis are available for the first order indices. this is less the case for the total sensitivity indices. When estimating T_j. one can either use a sample-based approach. whose computational cost depends fromon the number of factors. or approaches based on meta-modelling/emulators. eg based on Gaussian processes. The present work focuses on sample-based estimation procedures for T_j and tries different avenues to achieve an algorithmic improvement over the designs proposed in the existing best practices. We conclude that some proposed sample-based improvements found in the literature do not work as claimed. and that improving on the existing best practice is indeed fraught with difficulties.

One of the most authoritative measures in global sensitivity analysis is the Sobol'total-order index (). which can be computed with several different estimators. Although previous comparisons exist. it is hard to know which estimator performs best since the results are contingent on several benchmark settings: the sampling method (). the distribution of the model inputs (). the number of model runs (). the test function or model () and its dimensionality (). the weight of higher order effects (eg second. third. ). or the performance measure selected (). Here we break these limitations and simultaneously assess all total-order estimators in an eight-dimension hypercube where  are treated as random parameters. This design allows to create an unprecedentedly large range of benchmark scenarios. Our results indicate that. in general. the preferred estimator should be Razavi and Gupta's. followed by that of Jansen. or Janon/Monod. The remainder lag significantly behind in performance.

Our objections can be summarized by noting that the scenario has arbitrarily framed the issue of food security as one. where food production is unbalanced and unhealthy. and too much land is being used. Thus. the scenario offers a solution based on better diets and precision agriculture. We submit that a better framing should consider global unbalances and injustices and that applying to the issue a developed world perspective of techno-optimism is possibly unethical. We perceive here the substitution of a political problem (power asymmetries) with a technical one (a mismatch between what the world needs for everyone to enjoy a nutritious diet and what the world is actually producing). Asymmetries in the political power of trade patterns are exactly at the root of the issue of diet quality in several areas of the world. a phenomenon that has been recently named caloric unequal exchange (Falconí et al.. 2017) whereby although the export of Latin America and the Caribbean to the rest of the world are more expensive than those imported. the ratio of the two is decreasing with time. with the global south subsidizing the diet of the global north.

1305574,Is VARS more intuitive and efficient than Sobol’indices?,2021,Arnald Puy and Samuele Lo Piano and Andrea Saltelli,137,Environmental Modelling & Software,,104960,Elsevier,The Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS) has been proposed by Razavi and Gupta as a new comprehensive framework in sensitivity analysis. According to these authors. VARS provides a more intuitive notion of sensitivity and is much more computationally efficient than Sobol’ indices. Here we review these arguments and critically compare the performance of VARS-TO. for total-order index. against the total-order Jansen estimator. We argue that. unlike classic variance-based methods. VARS lacks a clear definition of what an “important” factor is. and we show that the alleged computational superiority of VARS does not withstand scrutiny. We conclude that while VARS enriches the spectrum of existing methods for sensitivity analysis. especially for a diagnostic use of mathematical models. it complements rather than replaces classic estimators used in variance-based sensitivity analysis.,True,NyVVh7kAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815221000037,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815221000037,0,0,0

The statistical evaluation of the life cycle GHG emissions (expressed in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour. gCO 2 e/kWh) for biomass electricity generation systems was based on the review of 19 life cycle assessment studies (representing 66 biomass cases). The mean life cycle GHG emissions resulting from the use of agriculture residues (N= 4). dedicated energy crops (N= 19). forestry (N= 6). industry (N= 4). and wastes (N= 2) in biomass-only electricity generation systems are 291.25 gCO 2 e/kWh. 208.41 gCO 2 e/kWh. 43 gCO 2 e/kWh. 45.93 gCO 2 e/kWh. and 1731.36 gCO 2 e/kWh. respectively. The mean life cycle GHG emissions for cofiring electricity generation systems using agriculture residues (N= 10). dedicated energy crops (N= 9). forestry (N= 9). industry (N= 2). and parks and gardens (N= 1) are 1039.92 gCO 2 e/kWh. 1001.38 gCO 2 e/kWh. 961.45 gCO 2 e/kWh. 926.1 gCO 2 e/kWh. and 1065.92 gCO 2 e/kWh. respectively.

Statistical evaluation of the life cycle GHG emissions is conducted to assess the role of different PVs and CSPs in reducing GHG emissions. The widely-used parabolic trough and central receiver CSP electricity generation systems emitted approximately 50% more GHGs than the paraboloidal dish. solar chimney. and solar pond CSP electricity generation systems. The cadmium telluride PVs and solar pond CSPs contributed to minimum life cycle GHGs. Thin-film PVs are also suitable for wider implementation. due to their lower Energy Pay-Back Time (EPBT) periods. in addition to lower GHG emission. in comparison with c-Si PVs.

Although the overall environmental impact of wind energy is miniscule in comparison to fossil-fuel energy. the early stages of the wind energy life cycle have potential for a higher environmental impact. This study attempts to quantify the relative contribution of individual stages toward life cycle impacts by conducting a life cycle assessment with SimaPro® and the Impact 2002+ impact assessment method. A comparative analysis of individual stages at three locations. onshore. shallow-water. and deep-water. in Texas and the gulf coast indicates that material extraction/processing would be the dominant stage with an average impact contribution of 72% for onshore. 58% for shallow-water. and 82% for deep-water across the 15 midpoint impact categories. The payback times for CO 2 and energy consumption range from 6 to 14 and 6 to 17 months. respectively. with onshore farms having shorter payback times. The greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) were in the range of 5–7 gCO 2 eq/kWh for the onshore location. 6–9 CO 2 eq/kWh for the shallow-water location. and 6–8 CO 2 eq/kWh for the deep-water location. A sensitivity analysis of the material extraction/processing stage to the electricity sourcing stage indicates that replacement of lignite coal with natural gas or wind would lead to marginal improvements in midpoint impact categories.

Because lignocellulosic biomass resources are abundant and renewable. various technologies are applied to using lignocellulosic biomass to derive biofuel and electricity. This paper focuses on power generation from lignocellulosic biomass and comparison of the effects of different feedstocks. transportation. and power generation technologies evaluated through life cycle assessment (LCA). The inputs and boundaries of LCA vary with different feedstocks. such as forestry wood. agricultural residues. and fast-growing grass. For agricultural residues and fast-growing grass. the transportation cost from field to power plant is more critical. Three technologies for power generation are analyzed both with and without pelletization of lignocellulosic biomass. The GHG emissions also vary with different feedstocks and depend on burning technologies at different plant scales. The daily criteria pollutant emissions of power generation from different lignocellulosic biomass were evaluated with a life cycle assessment model of GREET. net 2014.

A parameterized 3D CAD models for National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Phase VI wind blade are used for the analyses. The verification of CFD results are performed by comparing with experimental data. which were obtained from NREL. The calculated and verified aerodynamic loads are applied to the wind blade structural model. The effective structural stiffness was derived from the frequency based eigen-value analysis.

In the stress-erection process. post-tensioning is performed by installing a jacking tendon force inside the bottom chord member to determine the structural shape and initial stability. Before erection is completed. the structural system of a Strarch frame is unstable. The prestress installation process of the Strarch system is similar to that of a cable dome. which is also an unstable structure. Therefore. the dynamic relaxation method with kinetic damping. which is a stabilizing process for unstable structures. can be used for the Strarch system. The stabilizing process was verified by comparing the results of simple calculations and an experimental study using an actual-scale Strarch frame unit.

The emissions that are analyzed include greenhouse gases. volatile organic compounds. sulfur oxide. carbon monoxide. nitrous oxide. particulate matter with the size less than 10 and 2.5 microns. Furthermore. various blends of bio-ethanol and gasoline are studied to learn about the impacts of higher blend on emissions. The Greenhouse Gases. Regulated Emissions. and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model software are used to simulate for emissions. The research analyzes two pathways of emissions: Well-to-Pump and Pump-to-Vehicle analyses. It is found that the fuel cell vehicles using 100% bio-ethanol have shown the most reduction in the amount of all the pollutants from the Pump-to-Vehicle emission analysis. The Well-to-Pump analysis shows that only greenhouse gases (GHGs) reduce with higher blends of bio-ethanol. All other pollutants VOC. CO. NOx. SOx.

1305600,Assessment of bioethanol applications on transportation vehicles in houston,2016,H Du and RR Kommalapati and Z Huque,6,Journal of Fundamentals of Renewable Energy and Applications,3,,,A large amount of emissions from area industry and transportation causes severe air pollution problems in the Houston metro area in Texas. Bioethanol has been added in gasoline for many years in the US and the aim is to not only reduce the consumption of the fossil fuels. but also to improve air quality. Life cycle assessment is carried out to evaluate energy and water use. and emissions from transportation vehicles fueled with gasoline and blended fractions of bioethanol in Houston metro area. The emissions examined include greenhouse gases (GHG). VOC. SOx. CO. NOx and PM2. 5 and PM10. Some blends of gasoline and bioethanol derived from corn. such as E0. E10. E20. high octane fuel (HOF) E25. HOF E40. E50. E85 and E100 were investigated to study the effects of the blends on the criteria emissions. The emissions were analyzed for three pathways. well-to-pump. pump-to-vehicle and wellto-wheel using the GREET 1 2015 model. The well-to-pump analysis generally showed that only GHGs emissions reduce with the increase of bioethanol blend rates. not other pollutants. The pump-to-vehicle study verified that HOF E25 and HOF E40 are excellent for the vehicles equipped with traditional SI engines and E85 is better for Fuel flexible vehicles (FFV). The well-to-wheel study showed that GHG and CO emissions are reduced with the increase of the bioethanol in the fuel blends; the use of energy and water increases at higher bioethanol ratios; and HOF E25 and HOF E40 are competing fuels to E10 with excellent performance. lower CO2 emissions and slightly increase of other emissions.,True,IPiWZcUAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hongbo_Du3/publication/303899390_Assessment_of_Bioethanol_Applications_on_Transportation_Vehicles_in_Houston/links/5a902b5f0f7e9ba4296b7a63/Assessment-of-Bioethanol-Applications-on-Transportation-Vehicles-in-Houston.pdf,12345694777757278398,/scholar?cites=12345694777757278398,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hongbo_Du3/publication/303899390_Assessment_of_Bioethanol_Applications_on_Transportation_Vehicles_in_Houston/links/5a902b5f0f7e9ba4296b7a63/Assessment-of-Bioethanol-Applications-on-Transportation-Vehicles-in-Houston.pdf,0,0,0

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Phase VI wind turbine was used for the study. which the wind tunnel and structural test data has publicly available. The near wall treatment and turbulent characteristics have important role for proper CFD simulation. Most of the CFD development in this area is focused on advanced turbulence model closures including second moment closure models. and so called Low-Reynolds (low-Re) number and two-layer turbulence models. However. in many cases CFD aerodynamic predictions based on these standard models still show a large degree of uncertainty. which can be attributed to the use of the ϵ-equation as the turbulence scale equation and the associated limitations of the near wall treatment. The present paper demonstrates the y+ definition effect on SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulent model with advanced automatic near wall treatment model and Gamma theta transitional model for transition from lamina to turbulent flow using commercial ANSYS-CFX.

Major pollutants. such as VOCs. CO. . PM. . CH4. and CO2. are released from the transportation fleets. To decrease fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions from fleet vehicles. more and more biodiesel is used in vehicles in the Houston metropolis. The GREET model was used for simulating the fuel cycle emissions of diesel vehicles using different biodiesel blends in Houston. The fuels examined were diesel-biodiesel blends of B0. B5. B20. B50. B80. and B100. The energy and water use and emissions from vehicles fueled with the blends were investigated. The study shows that the reductions in GHG emissions are significant at the Well-to-Pump stage. and all the emissions. except GHGs and . reduce at the Pump-to-Wheel stage. The overall Well-to-Wheel analysis shows that biodiesel is beneficial for both passenger cars and heavy duty trucks. However. the benefits are more pronounced for passenger cars compared to heavy duty vehicles. When 50% of diesel passenger cars and HDDTs are switched to B20 in the Greater Houston area in 2025. the daily GHG emissions will be reduced by 2.0 and 712.1 CO2-equivalent tonnes. respectively.,True,IPiWZcUAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,3,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jre/2018/7350715/abs/,5800722222410894246,/scholar?cites=5800722222410894246,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jre/2018/7350715/abs/,0,0,0

At the extreme conditions of highly diluted guest concentrations the direct measurements of the cage occupancy ratio representing the competitive inclusion of multiguest species appear to be so difficult because of spectroscopic intensity limitation. but its thermodynamic significance might be considerable due to the fact that the infinite-dilution value of the cage occupancy ratio can provide the valuable thermodynamic information as a very unique and guest-specific parameter. To experimentally identify gaseous guest populations in structure I (sI) and structure II (sII) cages. we used the solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). gas chromatography. and direct gas measurements.

If the CH4 hydrates could be converted into CO2 hydrate. they would serve double duty as CH4 sources and CO2 storage sites in the deep ocean sediments. As preliminary investigations. both the phase behavior of CH4 hydrates and kinetic behavior of CO2 hydrate were measured at versatile conditions that can simulate actual marine sediments. When measuring three-phase equilibria (H-LW-V) containing CH4 hydrate. we also closely examined pore and electrolyte effects of clay and NaCl on hydrate formation.

Here. a key question arises as to whether the small alkali metals such as Na+ can be entrapped because they are considered to be too small to be stabilized in the hydrate cages. In this study. we first suggested spectroscopic evidence for the enclathration of Na+ in a small cage of sII propane hydrate. First. we checked the overall structure of sII propane hydrate incorporated with NaSO3CH3 and NaSO3NH2 with powder XRD and 13C NMR.

The 13C NMR spectra of C2H6 + ([Co(NH3)6]Cl3 + 6NaOH in D2O) hydrate confirmed a new peak at 6.5 ppm matching with C2H6 in sII-L cages. The retarded appearance of metastable sII phase is due to brine rejection of the cobalt complex occurring during solution freezing. The anions of OH− and F− were found to be incorporated in the host water cage framework. providing proton-deficient sites. The ionic conductivity of the frozen [Co(NH3)6]3+ solution increased up to 20-fold after ethane hydrate formation. implying the incorporation of F− into the host lattice.

ETHF). 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (C6H10O. 14ECH). and 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane (C6H10O. 12ECH) as novel promoters for gas hydrates. According to the outcomes of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and synchrotron high-resolution powder diffraction (HRPD). all CH4 hydrates formed with ETHF. 14ECH. and 12ECH were identified to be sII (Fd3-m) hydrates with lattice parameters of 17.195. 17.330. and 17.382 Å. respectively. It was also clearly demonstrated that CH4 molecules are accommodated in the sII-S cages through solid-state 13C NMR and Raman spectra. Consequently. we clearly concluded that the three compounds are large guest molecules (LGMs) that occupy the sII-L cages. Moreover. the thermodynamic stability of each LGM + CH4 (and N2) hydrate system was remarkably improved to compare with that of the simple CH4 (and N2) hydrate. In particular. 14ECH manifested several unique features compared to the other two promoters. First. the 14ECH + CH4 hydrate was not dissociated up to room temperature (298 K). even at a moderate pressure of approximately 60 bar. At a given pressure. 14ECH increased the dissociation temperature of CH4 hydrate by ~18 K. indicating that its promotion capability is as strong as that of tetrahydrofuran (THF). currently considered to be the most powerful promoter.

1305662,Non-conventional energy and propulsion methods,1991,Thomas Valone,,,,,,[en] From the disaster of the Space Shuttle. Challenger. to the Kuwaiti oil well fires. we are reminded constantly of our dependence on dangerous. combustible fuels for energy and propulsion. Over the past ten years. there has been a considerable production of new and exciting inventions which defy conventional analysis. The term non-conventional was coined in 1980 by a Canadian engineer to designate a separate technical discipline for this type of endeavor. Since then. several conferences have been devoted solely to these inventions. Integrity Research Corp.. an affiliate of the Institute. has made an effort to investigate each viable product. develop business plans for several to facilitate development and marketing. and in some cases. assign an engineering student intern to building a working prototype. Each inventor discussed in this presentation has produced a unique device for free energy generation or highly efficient force production. Included in this paper is also a short summary for non-specialists explaining the physics of free energy generation along with a working definition. The main topics of discussion include: space power. inertial propulsion. kinetobaric force. magnetic motors. thermal fluctuations. over-unity hat pumps. ambient temperature superconductivity and nuclear battery,True,UHq20HsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,7,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:23052202,6462731354416515922,/scholar?cites=6462731354416515922,,,,0,0,0

1305669,Progress in electrogravitics and electrokinetics for aviation and space travel,2006,Thomas F Valone,,STAIF Mtg,,,,An analysis of the 87-year old science of electrogravitics (or electrogravity) necessarily includes an analysis of electrokinetics. Electrogravitics is most commonly associated with the 1928 British patent# 300.311 of T. Townsend Brown. the 1952 Special Inquiry File# 24-185 of the Office of Naval Research into the “Electro-Gravity Device of Townsend Brown” and two widely circulated 1956 Aviation Studies Ltd. Reports on “Electrogravitics Systems” and “The Gravitics Situation.” By definition. electrogravitics historically has had a purported relationship to gravity or the object’s mass. as well as the applied voltage. It also was tested recently by the Honda Corporation which published experimental results and proposed theory of a correlation between electricity and gravity. Electrokinetics. on the other hand. is more commonly associated with many patents of T. Townsend Brown as well as Agnew Bahnson. starting with the 1960 US patent# 2.949.550 entitled.“Electrokinetic Apparatus.” Electrokinetics. which often involves a capacitor and dielectric. has virtually no relationship that can be connected with mass or gravity. The Army Research Lab has recently issued a report on electrokinetics. analyzing the force on an asymmetric capacitor. while NASA has received three patents on the same design topic. To successfully describe and predict the reported motion toward the positive terminal of the capacitor. it is desirable to use the classical electrokinetic field and force equations for the specific geometry involved.

The 1982 Koch discovery that certain solid state devices exhibit measurable quantum noise has also recently been labeled a finding of dark energy in the lab (Beck and Mackey. 2004). Tunnel diodes are a class of rectifiers that are qualified and some have been credited with conducting only because of quantum fluctuations. Microwave diodes are also good choices since many are designed for zero bias operation.

Dragon Heads are agro-businesses that control value chains stretching far into the countryside and help farmers link up with the market.

We posit that the party-state coopts Dragon Heads to play an important role—willingly or unwillingly—in rural political and social organization in addition to their core business activities. The Dragon Heads. in casu dairy companies. are seen as useful partners when it comes to addressing the “three rural problems.” ie the need for stable rural development. agricultural development and modernization. and improvement of farmers’ livelihoods. which is a top political priority for the leadership in Beijing. 1In 2008.

1305684,Energy policy design and China’s local climate governance: energy efficiency and renewable energy policies in Hangzhou,2019,Ting Guan and Jørgen Delman,,,,695-719,Palgrave Macmillan. Singapore,This study probes climate policy design at city level in China. with Hangzhou’s energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) policies between 2005 and 2014 as a case. The study applies a political action arena approach to accentuate the importance of different normative preferences behind climate change policies in relation to Hangzhou’s emerging urban climate governance regime. Three main categories of policy instruments are identified—that is. command-and-control. market-based. and collaborative governance instruments—and their development over time is examined. It is concluded that in Hangzhou EE is a more mature and comprehensive political action arena than RE. The study also finds that there has been a significant shift away from preferences toward command-and-control to more market-based instruments. while cooperative governance instruments are still in their infancy.

This is done through an analysis of Chinese climate politics and China’s engagement in international climate negotiations and governance. especially its behavior during and after the Copenhagen Climate Summit in December 2009 and the Chinese regime’s efforts to legitimate this behavior. While China’s role in international climate governance was disputed at the Copenhagen Summit. China contributed constructively to brokering a deal with significant implications for a new climate governance architecture suiting China’s preferences and being aligned with China’s core interests.

It develops in response to both globalization and market reforms which promote accelerated individualisation and disembedding of citizens anchored in the new capitalist economy. such as private business people. It is argued that informal political agency is part of the political dynamics of the nexus and that it develops through critical tension between private business people and the autocratic party-state. This is illustrated through the case of Sun Dawu. a Hebei businessman turned political activist. Referring to both Bech and Bech-Gersheim's and Baumann's discussions about the effects of the twin processes of globalisation and individualisation. one of the main conclusions is that Sun Dawu has engaged in 'self-politics' through creating a sub-political or 'peg' community where he and others can exert …,True,qBY2AdkAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,10,https://brill.com/view/journals/ejea/7/1/article-p39_4.xml,6870984284345929109,/scholar?cites=6870984284345929109,,,,0,0,0

It is argued that whereas the formal political participation of private entrepreneurs and the shared interests between the party-state and large segments of private business people are well documented. the dynamics in the state–private business nexus would be difficult to understand if informal political organiza tion and representation are not factored in. We use Beck and Beck-Gernsheim’s notion of ‘self politics’(Beck-Gernsheim 2003: 30–53. 184) to explain new types of individual political identity and agency. and Bauman’s ‘peg community’concept (Bauman 2001: 151–52). understood here as iterative. loose and temporary networks. to explain how processes of individualization. identity-shaping and the re-embedding of individualized business people into new collectivist structures merge in sub-political processes in the state–private business nexus.Our focus is on a singular yet symbolic case. namely that of Sun Dawu. a private businessman from Hebei who has turned political activist. Sun first tried his political luck as a representative on the local county people’s congress. Later. he opted out to pursue his own politics by creating and participating in a sub-political community. a new type of informal political platform that emerged as an alternative to the official channels controlled by the party-state.,True,qBY2AdkAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,7,https://www.academia.edu/download/31995027/iChina_versionfoerindex.pdf#page=114,8466572228036663549,/scholar?cites=8466572228036663549,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31995027/iChina_versionfoerindex.pdf#page=114,0,0,0

On a range of critical environmental parameters. China is now the world’s ‘biggest’ or ’worst’ and it contributes considerably to the decline in the health of the globe as well as of China and its people (Liu and Diamond. 2005). Effectively. the growth-oriented model. dubbed the ‘China model’.1 which has been pursued during the first three decades of reform. has become environmentally untenable.

Most dramatically. the Communist Party decided to let capitalists become members in 2002. which definitively opened the doors for direct political influence for the old arch-enemy.

Denmark has become one of China’s preferred “strategic energy policy interlocutors.” 1 The strategic partnership promotes a relational and collaborative approach to bilateral relations. 2 primarily through cooperation between specialized government agencies (China–Denmark Programme. 2016). The collaboration on energy is a key component in the partnership that aims to contribute to China’s long-term energy transition3 by increasing the share of renewable energy (RE) in China’s energy portfolio. thus helping China to reduce its CO 2 emissions and keep the global temperature increase below 2 C in 2100. In 2017. the Danish Head of the Clean Energy Ministerial Secretariat at the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris noted that the desire for an energy transition reflects a new reality in clean energy globally where the world’s major emerging economies are moving to center stage (Zinglersen. 2017). Still. according to the Danish Energy Agency (DEA). Even though China has committed to the Paris Agreement. it still faces challenges with setting targets that are in line with a 2-degree world scenario.

1305732,Climate variability. climate change and water resource strategies for small municipalities,2005,P Mukheibir and D Sparks,,,,,University of Cape Town,In many parts of the world. variability in climatic conditions is already resulting in wide ranging impacts. especially on water resources and agriculture. Climate variability is already being observed to be increasing. although there remain uncertainties about the link to climate change. However. the link to water management problems is obvious. Water is a limiting resource for development in South Africa and a change in water supply could have major implications in most sectors of the economy. especially in the agriculture sector. Factors that contribute to vulnerability in water systems in southern Africa include seasonal and inter-annual variations in rainfall. which are amplified by high run-off production and evaporation rates. Current modelling scenarios suggest that there will be significant climate change1 impacts in South Africa (Hewitson et al. 2005). Climate change is expected to alter the present hydrological resources in southern Africa and add pressure on the adaptability of future water resources (Schulze & Perks 2000). During the past 20 years. most of Africa has experienced extensive droughts. the last three being 1986-88. 1991-92 and 1997-98 (after Chenje & Johnson 1996). If the occurrence of drought became more frequent. the impact on water resources and consequently agriculture would be significant.,True,GJ_FknoAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,17,https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/17141,16571788170160930582,/scholar?cites=16571788170160930582,,,https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/handle/11427/17141/Mukheibir_Climate_variability_climate_2005.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

It is required in various stages of the energy production chain including fuel acquisition. processing and transportation. However. there are growing concerns about the mounting demand for water arising from population and industrial growth. especially in water-stressed regions. Climate change and environmental pollution are exacerbating the situation. and the exploitation of renewable energy resources is perceived as one pillar of mitigating the negative effects of climate change. In this regard. solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power plants are promising renewable energy technologies. and previous studies have demonstrated that these two energy technologies are less water-intensive. However. the effect of available water on the optimization of a hybrid PV–wind system has not been extensively explored.

Since the early 1970s. water consumption in municipal Cape Town has grown at an average annual rate of about 3 per cent. As the population of the metropolitan Cape Town region grows. the competition for water in the basin has become intense. and farmers have responded by dramatically improving their irrigation efficiencies and shifting even more land into the production of high-value export crops. Meanwhile. over the past two decades. a number of national and regional commissions have been set up to investigate options for coping with the long-term water supply problems in the basin. One outcome of these efforts was the authorization of the Berg River Dam. In June 2004. after almost 20 years of debate about its economic feasibility and environmental impacts. final agreement was reached on construction of the dam. It will consist of a 130.1 million cubic metre storage reservoir and a pumping site to pump water from below the dam back to it. The dam is expected to be operational sometime during the period 2008–2010. The region has also recently experienced a number of unusually dry years. the most recent in the summer of 1994–1995. when peak storage in the upper basin was only about one-third of average.

1305737,Assessing the energy and carbon footprints of exploiting and treating brackish groundwater in Cape Town,2019,Aumashvini Gobin and Debbie Sparks and John Okedi and Neil Armitage and Fadiel Ahjum,45,Water SA,1,63-74,Water Research Commission (WRC),South Africa has been facing significant challenges in meeting demands in its water and energy sectors in recent years and planning for both sectors has mostly been done separately. The City of Cape Town has started to supplement its dwindling conventional freshwater supplies with groundwater. wastewater and seawater. in light of the drought that commenced in 2015. The Cape Flats Aquifer in Cape Town represents an important resource whose yield could be increased to 85 000 m 3/day through artificial stormwater recharge in the Zeekoe Catchment alone. The abstraction and treatment of this water would require significant amounts of energy and thus this paper explores the links between energy usage in the water sector and its carbon footprint. The three alternatives investigated were ‘centralised’.‘desalination’and ‘decentralised’approaches. The former two are centralised treatment mechanisms to produce potable water utilising existing and new treatment infrastructure. respectively. and the latter proposed minimal treatment for non-potable end-users. The energy intensities of the alternatives were evaluated by identifying energy-intensive components and carrying out a preliminary design of the networks and the required treatment mechanisms. South Africa’s future potential electricity mixes were used to conceptualise the significance of the associated energy demand. The centralised approach’s energy intensity was found to be the lowest of the three. ranging from 1.16 to 1.57 MJ/m 3. while those of the decentralised and desalination approaches ranged from 3.57 to 7.31 MJ/m 3 and 7.41 to 9.62 MJ/m 3. respectively.

1305741,Renewable energy choices and water requirements in South Africa,2013,Amos Madhlopa and Samantha Keen and Debbie Sparks and Mascha Moorlach and Anthony Dane,,,,,University of Cape Town.,South Africa (SA) is an arid country. where water supply is often obtained from distant sources. There is also increasing pressure on the limited water resources due to economic and population growth. with a concomitant increase in the energy requirement for water production. This problem will be exacerbated by the onset of climate change. Recently. there have been concerns about negative impacts arising from the exploitation of energy resources. In particular. the burning of fossil fuels is significantly contributing to climate change through the emission of carbon dioxide (major greenhouse gas). In addition. fossil fuels are getting depleted. thereby decreasing energy security. Consequently. the international community has initiated various interventions. including the transformation of policy and regulatory instruments. to promote sustainable energy. In view of this. SA is making policy and regulatory shifts in line with the international developments. Renewable energy is being promoted as one way of achieving sustainable energy provision in the country. However. some issues require scrutiny in order to understand the water footprint of renewable energy production. Due to the large gap that exists between water supply and demand. trade-offs in water allocation amongst different users are critical. In this vein. the main objective of this study was to investigate renewable energy choices and water requirements in SA. Data was acquired through a combination of a desktop study and expert interviews.

1305743,Scenarios of energy supply and associated water demands,2014,Amos Madhlopa and Mascha Moorlach and Debbie Sparks and Samantha Keen and Pieter Krog,,,,,,Climate change is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. Consequently. different countries are making policy shifts to mitigate the impacts of this environmental problem. and South Africa is no exception. At present. the major source of energy in South Africa is coal. which contributes to carbon emissions and hence climate change. In view of this. the country needs to make a transition to low-carbon sources of energy. Water is required in the production chain of energy. but South Africa is a water-stressed country. with water resources that are increasingly being placed under pressure. It is therefore important to minimise the water demand in the energy and other economic sectors.The supply of energy under different scenarios has been reported in previous work. For instance. the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) of 2011 and the IRP draft update of 2013 articulate different scenarios of energy supply in South Africa in time-frames up to 2030 and 2050 (DoE 2013). The electricity plan plays a vital role in promoting sustainable development. Water is recognised as a key constraint and risk in the provision of energy. especially in the face of climate change.

It would be a mistake. however. to assume that public support for decarbonization can be gained automatically by pointing out threats from climate change. particularly in light of the role coal plays in the local and national economy and in energy security. In this article we search for factors affecting public support for a coal phase-out in media content. According to the theory of agenda setting. the media establishes problems calling for solutions and influences public perceptions of the (un)importance of those problems. We illustrate this case on the example of the Czech Republic. The paper demonstrates that Czech media has cultivated a discursive environment in which coal mining is separated from coal combustion. neglecting the inevitable interconnection of these two processes; coal consumption is not characterized as an …,True,LvzvytkAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC,17,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421519301557,14042258031769089641,/scholar?cites=14042258031769089641,,,,0,0,0

Three distinguished frames have been reconstructed. The risk frame. which connects the project with a number of predominantly environmental threats. is counter-balanced by the responsibility frame that uses the ‘Not-In-My-Back-Yard’ label to delegitimize the local opposition. The third frame then portrays the siting process as a display of general distrust towards political elites and state institutions. It is argued that the distinguished frames stem from a deeper ideological conflict about the nature of democratic governance and the value attributed to environment. further stressing the importance of a siting process’ institutional arrangement that goes beyond technocratic solutions.,True,LvzvytkAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC,17,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517301696,5990153932262013865,/scholar?cites=5990153932262013865,,,,0,0,0

In the country of ten million people. six commercial reactors are on line and two to four new units have been envisaged by recent official documents. The Czechs seem to be committed to nuclear despite the contemporary trends in both the regional and European energy policies. which clearly favor renewable and/or more flexible conventional sources. In this article we examine the main drivers behind the Czech Republic's enduring interest in nuclear energy. The main line of reasoning is informed by Jack Snyder's strategic culture concept. which stresses cultural factors and factors related to the structural characteristics of a country's decision-making process in explaining how concrete policies come into existence.

Another positive aspects of this publication is the attempt to better understanding of recent political developments related to national issues in central Europe. This attempt can be considered as a reaction towards the Europeanization of central European politics and its manifestations at the common European level. The undertaken research did not only focus on radical and extremist parties but on all relevant political parties and forces within these countries. with specific emphasis on the inclusion of politically irrelevant parties which represent nationalistic currents within the respective societies. The phenomenon of nationalism is thus researched in the political context. The publication maps the different approaches towards identity politics and to understanding of nation within the political scene of each country and the region as a whole. This could be helpful. for example. for media investigations and could also stimulate further political research in this area.

Faculty of Social Studies. International Institute of Political Science. IIPS,The rise of shale gas is probably the most important event of the world energy industry in the last decade. The story of how only within the course of several of years it changed the potentially largest import market in the world to nearly exporting producer is already notorious. A lot has been written on the implications which this originally purely domestic American phenomenon had on the global markets with natural gas. as well as with other energy commodities. and more broadly about its effects in the field of energy and climate policies set by a vast number of countries which take part in these markets. Attention is currently devoted to the matter whether it will be possible to develop the extraction of unconventional gas resources in other areas of the world as well. Europe has ideal conditions in this sense–the growing market. developed infrastructure. nearly liberalized market and the willingness to pay high prices. However. even if the geological conditions prove favourable. the development of shale gas in Europe is far from being granted. NIMBY issues. controversial environmental impact of the extraction process at the peak of its development. a number of national markets being tied by long-term contracts and/or by the protectionist tendencies. and a strong lobby of the competing branches of the energy industry or within the gas sector itself present a considerable challenge for shale gas.This study focuses on the current development of the events associated with shale gas in the Czech Republic and Poland with regard to their possible mutual cooperation.

Its main findings are as follows:• The analysis of stakeholders’ perceptions of Energiewende reveals that the grid stability is a key issue that both Czech and Polish stakeholders connect to Energiewende. The grid issue then affects the ways the stakeholders perceive also other issues including the very viability of the large-scale RES deployment or regional market setting.(Chapter 2)• There are several pathways Energiewende could further develop along. The project’s success would emerge as a result of either governmental policy designed to ensure the adequate development of a wide portfolio of renewable technologies. or a more spontaneous development of decentralized technologies driven by the consumers themselves. The less optimistic scenarios include a delay of the project due insufficient pace of the grid development. and a complete failure resulting from loss of the public support.(Chapter 3),True,LvzvytkAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC,4,http://www.mzv.cz/file/2232825/CENERS_Energiewende_2016.pdf,12498271677517892751,/scholar?cites=12498271677517892751,,,http://www.mzv.cz/file/2232825/CENERS_Energiewende_2016.pdf,0,0,0

Until comparatively recently. European countries were accustomed to a predictable business environment with relatively low energy prices and stable supplies of raw materials. The beginning of the new millennium. however. brought with it a new global situation characterized by decreasing domestic production. ambivalent relations with the biggest natural gas supplier. the Russian Federation. and a fierce effort towards the decarbonization of European energy. This new situation. therefore. encourages us to devote very close attention to energy-related questions. With regard to the Czech Republic and the wider central European region represented by the Visegrad Four. one of the main problems in this area is the question of natural gas supplies. which are historically tied to the main (and at times. the only) supplier. Russia. Without questioning the reliability of this energy source. which has been satisfactory from a historical perspective. the presence of several transit countries and the overall effort towards at least rudimentary diversification have encouraged the V4 countries to consider the possible need for more transit routes or suppliers. This situation could be significantly influenced by planned projects as well as facilities that are already under construction: Nord Stream. Nabucco. South Stream and the LNG terminals–all redraw the gas pipeline map of Europe and all may have a substantial impact on natural gas supplies to Central Europe.,True,LvzvytkAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Petr_Ocelik/publication/303033608_The_Future_of_Natural_Gas_Security_in_the_V4_Countries_A_Scenario_Analysis_and_the_EU_Dimension/links/5735e1cf08ae9f741b29c2f5/The-Future-of-Natural-Gas-Security-in-the-V4-Countries-A-Scenario-Analysis-and-the-EU-Dimension.pdf,15679443035413279894,/scholar?cites=15679443035413279894,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Petr_Ocelik/publication/303033608_The_Future_of_Natural_Gas_Security_in_the_V4_Countries_A_Scenario_Analysis_and_the_EU_Dimension/links/5735e1cf08ae9f741b29c2f5/The-Future-of-Natural-Gas-Security-in-the-V4-Countries-A-Scenario-Analysis-and-the-EU-Dimension.pdf,0,0,0

Characterization of these residues shows that their calorific values are suitable for their energy recovery. However. the high mineral contents and the low bulk densities limit their direct use as biofuel. Therefore. a blending process using sawdust followed by densification into pellets is proposed for the recovery of these agri-food residues. Such strategy allows the pellets to meet standard requirements of the biofuels market. Furthermore. the performance of the pellets is evaluated during combustion tests in domestic boiler.

For this purpose. different mass percentages of OMSW and binder were considered; 100%-0%. 90%-10%. 85%-15%. and 70%-30%. respectively. The briquetting process of the raw mixtures was carried out based on high pressures. Physico-chemical and mechanical characterizations were performed in order to select the best conditions for the briquettes production. It was observed that during the densification process. the optimal applied pressure increases notably the unit density. the bulk density. and the compressive strength. Mechanical characterization shows that the prepared sample with 15% of corn starch shows the best mechanical properties. Moreover. the corn starch binder affects quietly the high heating value (HHV) which increases from 16.36 MJ/Kg for the 100%-0% sample to 16.92 MJ/Kg for the 85%-15% sample. In addition. the kinetic study shows that the binder agent does not affect negatively the thermal degradation of the briquettes. Finally. the briquettes characterization shows that the studied samples with particles size less than 100 μm and blended with 15% of corn starch binder are promising biofuels either for household or industrial plants use.

1305798,Combustion Characteristics of Raw Olive Pits for Energy Recovery in a counter-current Fixed Bed Reactor,,Mohamed Ali Mami and Marzouk Lajili and Hans-Joachim Gehrmann and Dieter Stapf and Rainer Bolduan,,,,,,Mediterranean areas produce a large amounts of solid biofuels coming from agriculture and industrial activities mainly olive oil by-products. This biomass is characterized by its high energy content. Moreover. it is suitable for clean power and thermal energy production. Our main object consists at studying the combustion characteristics of olive pits (OPi) in a counter-current fixed bed reactor of 40 kW nominal power. Experiments were conducted under a constant primary air flow rate. The fixed bed reactor was fed by a given mass (about 5. 75 kg) of OPi up to a given height. The fuel bed temperature evolution was measured using thermocouples well placed inside the reactor. The mass loss rate and the reaction front positions were determined. Besides. some crucial characteristics such as the reaction front velocity uRF. the ignition rate IR. the mass conversion rate MCR and the specific heat release rate HR were evalated. Results show that the temperature increases from the ambient value to a maximum value ranging from 750 C to 1000 C in accordance with what was reported in the literature for solid biofuels. The mass of the biofuels decreases linearly with time. The obtained characteristics appear as scale independent numbers.

Desde las más cercanas al continente africano. con unas precipitaciones cercanas a 120 mm; hasta las meridionales. con datos cercanos a los 700 mm y con una masa forestal importante en sus zonas de relieve y medianías.Una característica del Archipiélago son los llamados vientos Alisios. un aire seco producido por el anticiclón de las Azores. que somete a las islas a una estabilidad climática con temperaturas moderadas. Las lluvias. aunque escasas. llegan cuando el anticiclón se desplaza y deja pasar frentes polares de aire frío. La estructura vertical del Alisio presenta en la troposfera una superposición de dos capas: una fresca y húmeda inferior y otra cálida y seca superior; entre estas dos capas se sitúa una inversión térmica de subsidencia. es decir. una franja en la que la temperatura aumenta con la altura. lo contrario a lo que debería suceder en condiciones normales. La altitud. espesor y el gradiente térmico de esta inversión varían a lo largo del año pero. por lo general. su base está por encima de los 800 my su cima en torno a los 1.500 m de altitud. La presencia de esta inversión térmica genera estabilidad en las Islas. ya que impide que se produzcan movimientos de convección y limita el crecimiento vertical de las nubes; en consecuencia. sólo se forman nubes estratiformes como los estratocúmulos. que forman el llamado «mar de nubes». más frecuente en el invierno.,True,X8MoPbkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,16,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan_Santamarta/publication/255947442_Fundamentos_y_tecnologias_para_la_captacion_y_uso_del_agua_procedente_de_la_lluvia_horizontal_en_los_montes_canarios/links/00b49520e2132ad4bd000000/Fundamentos-y-tecnologias-para-la-captacion-y-uso-del-agua-procedente-de-la-lluvia-horizontal-en-los-montes-canarios.pdf,10890260140914024122,/scholar?cites=10890260140914024122,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan_Santamarta/publication/255947442_Fundamentos_y_tecnologias_para_la_captacion_y_uso_del_agua_procedente_de_la_lluvia_horizontal_en_los_montes_canarios/links/00b49520e2132ad4bd000000/Fundamentos-y-tecnologias-para-la-captacion-y-uso-del-agua-procedente-de-la-lluvia-horizontal-en-los-montes-canarios.pdf,0,0,0

Sin embargo. los alumnos. tras finalizar la práctica presencial no disponen de un soporte físico que les permita reproducir lo realmente plasmado durante su desarrollo. Con el fin de subsanar esta deficiencia. durante los últimos tres años. desde nuestro ámbito de conocimiento. hemos venido implementando una serie de mejoras en la metodología docente relacionadas con las nuevas tecnologías. Ello ha permitido que el alumnado pueda reproducir algunas prácticas de laboratorio de forma deslocalizada (tanto en el tiempo como en el espacio). a través de la conexión a los sitios web implementados a tal efecto. Sin embargo. algunas prácticas. tales como las de reconocimiento de materiales pétreos o incluso las de campo. no se adaptan bien a la metodología anteriormente citada. Es por ello. que en este trabajo se plantea implementar una nueva propuesta metodológica. más interactiva. exportable fácilmente incluso a las prácticas de campo.

1305834,Silver buckshot or bullet: Is a future “energy mix” necessary?,2018,Barry W Brook and Tom Blees and Tom ML Wigley and Sanghyun Hong,10,Sustainability,2,302,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,To displace fossil fuels and achieve the global greenhouse-gas emissions reductions required to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change. the prevalent argument is that a mix of different low-carbon energy sources will need to be deployed. Here we seek to challenge that viewpoint. We argue that a completely decarbonized. energy-rich and sustainable future could be achieved with a dominant deployment of next-generation nuclear fission and associated technologies for synthesizing liquid fuels and recycling waste. By contrast. non-dispatchable energy sources like wind and solar energy are arguably superfluous. other than for niche applications. and run the risk of diverting resources away from viable and holistic solutions. For instance. the pairing of variable renewables with natural-gas backup fails to address many of the entrenched problems we seek to solve. Our conclusion is that. given the urgent time frame and massive extent of the energy-replacement challenge. half-measures that distract from or stymie effective policy and infrastructure investment should be avoided.

1305835,Economic feasibility of energy supply by small modular nuclear reactors on small islands: case studies of Jeju. Tasmania and Tenerife,2018,Sanghyun Hong and Barry W Brook,11,Energies,10,2587,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) offer the promise of providing carbon-free electricity and heat to small islands or isolated electricity grids. However. the economic feasibility of SMRs is highly system-dependent and has not been studied in this context. We selected three case-study islands for such an evaluation: Jeju. Tasmania and Tenerife based on their system complexity. We generated 100.000 electricity-mix cases stochastically for each island and examined the system-level generation-cost changes by incrementing the average generation cost of SMRs from USD $60 to 200 MWh− 1. SMRs were found to be economically viable when average generation cost was< $100 MWh− 1 for Jeju and< $140 MWh− 1 for Tenerife. For Tasmania the situation was complex; hydroelectric power is an established competitor. but SMRs might be complementary in a future “battery of the nation” scenario where most of the island’s hydro capacity was exported to meet peak power demand on the mainland grid. The higher average generation cost of SMRs makes it difficult for them to compete economically with a fossil fuel/renewable mix in many contexts. However. we have demonstrated that SMRs can be an economically viable carbon-free option for a small island with a limited land area and high energy demand.

However. the South Korean Government announced an energy transition roadmap aiming to reduce nuclear shares and increase renewable shares. However. given the nation's high population density. the maximum share of renewable sources for electricity generation in South Korea is constrained. The roadmap was silent on how to fill the gap between a reduced nuclear output and the limited renewable potentials. The tacit alternatives are fossil fuels. and their deployment will become the key determining factor on how South Korea approaches the problem of greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

1305838,Evaluating the sustainability of future energy mixes.,2014,Sanghyun Hong,,,,,,For effective mitigation of greenhouse-gas emissions and their ensuing climate disruption. the worldwide consumption of fossil fuels for energy production must be curtailed deeply and urgently. Yet historical evidence shows that energy efficiency typically fails to reduce energy consumption while maintaining economic growth. and large-scale renewable resources. excluding hydroelectric power. are difficult to harness economically at large scales. Moreover. in many East Asian and European countries with large demand and high population densities. there is limited land for energy production. In this thesis I look at the problem of fossil-fuel replacement by nuclear and renewables. focusing on three relevant case studies (South Korea. Japan and Australia). I first calculate the maximum limits of renewable-energy sources in South Korea. revealing that geophysical constraints mean that renewable energy could only supply < 35% of electricity consumption. I then compared the current electricity mix with six alternative scenarios using multi-criteria decision-making analysis (MCDMA); the factors included electricity cost. greenhouse-gas emissions. land transformation. water consumption. heated-water discharge. air pollution. radioactive waste. solid waste and safety issues. The relative MCDMA rank ranges from 0 (most sustainable) and 3 (least sustainable). This evaluation showed that a high-penetration nuclear-power scenario yielded the fewest negative environmental. economic and social impacts for South Korea (score = 0.26 out of 3). whereas maximising renewable energy led to the second-worst impacts (1.81) (Chapter II).

However. approaches estimating required capacity and role of energy storage for a future energy mix involve intensive economic and technological modelling. In this study. we propose a multi-criteria assessment framework to evaluate the future application of energy storage for a future electricity grid. We have selected six energy applications for a grid that can be provided by electrical energy storage: 1) bulk energy applications. 2) transmission related applications. 3) distributed network applications. 4) ancillary energy applications. 5) renewable energy integration applications. and 6) customer energy quality applications. We. then. identify the role of energy storage for each energy scenario using a quantitative multi-criteria assessment. Criteria are defined based on the technical characteristics of selected energy mixes. The proposed framework effectively presents energy storage applications for future energy scenarios. and identifies ‘no-regret’ options. Although the proposed framework is tested here against National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios for the United Kingdom. the methodology can be applied to any other scenarios and countries with some modifications.,True,1sUV8yEAAAAJ:p__nRnzSRKYC,0,http://ecite.utas.edu.au/120962,,,,,,0,0,0

Many photons incident on conventional Solar cells do not generate current due to reflection of the photons by metallic contacts formed on the Surface of the Solar cells. By replacing conventional strip contacts with contacts shaped to reflect incident light onto photoabsorbing surfaces of the solar cells. the overall efficiency with which the solar cell converts incident solar energy into electricity can be increased.

Raleigh. NC (United States),The design and characterization of a system used for the power drawn in a stirred tank with multiple impellers is described. This determination is carried out by means of a strain gauges/telemetry system. which is able to measure the power drawn of each impeller. The strain gauges produce an electrical signal which is proportional to the mixing torque. This system can be operated under two sensitivity levels depending on the expecting torque values. This device was characterized in terms of the signal hysteresis. drift and precision of the measurements. The energy losses due to friction were quantified.

1305884,Ready-to-use and advanced methodologies to prioritise the regionalisation effort in LCA,2015,Laure Patouillard and Cecile Bulle and Manuele Margni,,,,,,The spatial dimension is an important aspect in life cycle assessment (LCA). Indeed life cycle processes. and therefore also elementary flows. are most likely to be geographically scattered due to global supply chains. The environmental impacts related to an elementary flow can be different across the globe depending on the spatial variability of ecosystem sensitivity. Integrating spatial dimension seems to be a promising way to increase LCA results’ reliability by reducing spatial uncertainties. LCA regionalisation refers to the integration of the spatial variability that really exists to improve result representativeness and reduce spatial uncertainties. As regionalisation requires additional effort for LCA practitioners. it is necessary to ensure the interest of such an effort and to prioritise it.

It differs from traditional LCA because its inventory includes all the processes affected by the decision which are identified by accounting for causal links (physical. economic. etc.). However. C-LCA results could be quite uncertain which makes the interpretation phase harder. Therefore. strategies to assess and reduce uncertainty in C-LCA are needed. Part of uncertainty in C-LCA is due to spatial variability that can be reduced using regionalization. However. regionalization can be complex and time-consuming if straightforwardly applied to an entire LCA model.The main purpose of this article is to prioritize regionalization efforts to enhance interpretation in C-LCA by assessing the spatial uncertainty of a case study building on a …,True,xDNHqYIAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-020-01785-x,6066282142306070816,/scholar?cites=6066282142306070816,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre-Collet-2/publication/342669385_Prioritizing_regionalization_to_enhance_interpretation_in_consequential_life_cycle_assessment_Application_to_alternative_transportation_scenarios_using_partial_equilibrium_economic_modeling/links/602299ac299bf1cc26b51959/Prioritizing-regionalization-to-enhance-interpretation-in-consequential-life-cycle-assessment-Application-to-alternative-transportation-scenarios-using-partial-equilibrium-economic-modeling.pdf,0,0,0

The mean GHG emissions of both second (G2) and third generation (G3) biofuels and the effects of factors influencing these estimates are identified and quantified by means of specific statistical methods. 47 LCA studies are included in the database. providing 593 estimates. Each study estimate of the database is characterized by i) technical data/characteristics. ii) author's methodological choices and iii) typology of the study under consideration. The database is composed of both the vector of these estimates–expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of biofuel (g CO2eq/MJ)–and a matrix containing vectors of predictor variables which can be continuous or dummy variables. The former is the dependent variable while the latter corresponds to the explanatory variables of the meta-regression model. Parameters are estimated by mean of econometrics methods. Our results clearly highlight a hierarchy between G3 and G2 biofuels: life cycle GHG emissions of G3 biofuels are statistically higher than those of Ethanol which. in turn. are superior to those of BtL.

The total marketing costs of auctioneer. wholesaler. retailer. vendor. marine fishermen cooperative society and contractor/freshwater fishermen cooperative society have been found to be Re 0.98. Rs 8.89. Rs 6.61. Rs 4.50. Rs 6.00 and Rs 3.51. respectively. The marketing efficiencies for Indian major carps (IMC). sardine and seer fish have been found to vary from 34 per cent to 74 per cent. depending on the length of market channel. The marketing efficiency has been found more in the case of marine species than freshwater species. since the latter travel longer distances from the point of production to consumption centre. passing many intermediaries as compared to the former. The fisherman’s share in consumer’s rupee has shown variations across species. marketing channels and markets. The infrastructure facilities at most of the surveyed landing centres. fishing harbours and wholesale and retail markets have been found grossly inadequate and poorly maintained. The study has highlighted the need for formulating a uniform market policy for fishes for easy operation and regulation so that the country’s fish production is efficiently managed and delivered to the consuming population. ensuring at the same time remunerative prices to the fishers.,True,tpureIoAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,71,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/47884/,11475749102464891127,/scholar?cites=11475749102464891127,,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/47884/files/5-B-Ganeshkumar.pdf,0,0,0

1305907,Synthesis. characterization and application of zero valent iron nanoparticles for the removal of toxic metal hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] from aqueous solution,2013,SH Rashmi and GM Madhu and A Kittur and R Suresh,1,Int J Curr Eng Technol,,37-42,,Hexavalent chromium is a heavy metal used in a variety of industrial applications which is highly toxic to humans. animals. plants and microorganisms. Moreover. it is a well-established human Carcinogen by the inhalation route of exposure and by the oral route of exposure. Therefore. it should be removed from contaminated waters. Its reduction to trivalent chromium can be beneficial because a more mobile and more toxic chromium species is converted to a less mobile and less toxic form. The reduction of hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] by nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) has received considerable attention in recent years because of large surface to volume ratio. A considerable volume of research has been carried out in order to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of Cr (VI) reduction with nZVI. as well as the influence of various parameters controlling the reduction efficiency. This paper aims at synthesising zero valent iron nano particles by chemical reduction method using FeCl3. 6H2O with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducer. The crystalline size of the nZVI particles was determined through XRD. Morphology of the particles was observed using SEM. The chromium stock solution was treated with nZVI by varying time and amount of nanoparticles in batch studies. And in the column studies. the chromium stock solution was treated with the scrap iron. The solution was then tested using UV-Vis spectrophotometer and the percentage removal of chromium was studied. The present experimental results revealed that Cr (VI) is considerably adsorbed on nZVI nanoparticles and it could be a cost effective method for the in situ remediation …,True,tpureIoAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,23,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14162690633134137026&hl=en&oi=scholarr,14162690633134137026,/scholar?cites=14162690633134137026,,,,0,0,0

1305930,Techno-economic feasibility study of ammonia plants powered by offshore wind,2013,Eric R Morgan,,,,,,Ammonia production with offshore wind power has the potential to transform energy and fertilizer markets within the United States. The vast offshore wind resource can be converted directly into liquid ammonia using existing technologies. The liquid ammonia can then be transported around the country via rail. truck. barge or pipeline and used as either a fertilizer or a fuel. This thesis reviews the technologies required for all-electric. wind-powered ammonia production and offers a simple design of such a system. Cost models based on the physical equipment necessary to produce ammonia with wind power are developed; offshore wind farm cost models are also developed for near-shore. shallow. wind farms in the United States. The cost models are capable of calculating the capital costs of small industrial-sized ammonia plants coupled with an offshore wind farm. A case study for a utility-tied. all-electric ammonia plant in the Gulf of Maine is used to assess the lifetime economics of such a system. Actual utility grid prices and offshore wind are incorporated into a systems-level simulation of the ammonia plant. The results show that significant utility grid backup is required for an all-electric ammonia plant built with present-day technologies. The levelized cost of one metric ton of ammonia is high relative to ammonia produced with natural gas or coal. but is not as susceptible to spikes in ammonia feedstock prices. A sensitivity analysis shows that the total levelized cost of ammonia is driven in large part by the cost of producing electricity with offshore wind.

Predicting PV variability using one irradiance sensor does not account for the smoothing of irradiance over the area of a power plant. Smoothing is examined using two methods: averaging measurements from many irradiance sensors. and using the Wavelet Variability Model developed by Lave et al. (2013). This work provides new experimental testing: comparison of the smoothing over a 30 MW power plant using the average of 25 sensors to the WVM. The results show that an aggregation of 25 sensors predicts more variability than the WVM on short timescales. suggesting that more than 25 sensors would be required in order to predict the same power variability as the WVM.

1305945,Comparison of solar irradiance smoothing using a 45-sensor network and the wavelet variability model,2014,Ana Dyreson and Eric Morgan and Sam Monger and Tom Acker,,,,,,With increasing penetrations of solar photovoltaic (PV) power in the electricity grid. the variability of the irradiance. and therefore power. is important to understand because variable resources can challenge grid operations. Predicting PV variability using one irradiance sensor. as is commonly done. does not account for the smoothing of irradiance over the extent of the power plant. This smoothing is examined using two methods: averaging measurements from many irradiance sensors. and using a model developed by Lave. Kleissl. and Stein [1] called the Wavelet Variability Model. The results show the similarities and differences between two irradiance smoothing models. These two models both show that the smoothing effect is significant for large PV power plants. which means the power plant output has less variability and is easier to integrate into the electricity grid than might have been expected using a single point sensor measurement to predict variability.,True,lXhdRJcAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,2,https://in.nau.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/156/2018/08/FINAL_Solar2014Paper_Dyreson052914-ek.pdf,11931546367300014095,/scholar?cites=11931546367300014095,,,https://in.nau.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/156/2018/08/FINAL_Solar2014Paper_Dyreson052914-ek.pdf,0,0,0

The methanol synthesis unit consists of: a high pressure side that includes a compressor. a reactor. and a throttling valve; and a low pressure side that includes a knockout drum. and a mixer where fresh gas enters the system. Methanol and water are produced at high pressure in the reactor and then exit the system under low pressure and temperature in the knockout drum.

An issue of particular importance is the rate at which the solar irradiance changes. and the consequent rate at which the power output changes. ie the ramp rates. Pertinent information describing the ramps is the frequency. duration. and magnitude of the ramps. This paper compares different methods of computing ramp rates in both irradiance and power. The “dead band” method. an historical data compression technique. is demonstrated for identifying fluctuations in the one second to several second timeframe.

The ability to produce synthetic fuel on site is potentially valuable both because it mitigates transportation costs and insulates the islanders from oil price fluctuations.

The burdened cost of delivering fuel to remote locations is often significantly more expensive than the purchase price. Here it is shown that newly developed solid aluminum metal fuel is suited for remote production of liquid diesel fuels. On a volumetric basis. aluminum has more than twice the energy of diesel fuel. making it a superb structural energy vector for remote applications. Once aluminum is treated with gallium. water of nearly any purity is used to rapidly oxidize the aluminum metal which spontaneously evolves hydrogen and heat in roughly equal energetic quantities. The benign byproduct of the reaction could. in theory. be taken to an off-site facility and recycled back into aluminum using standard smelting processes or it could be left on-site as a high-value waste.

More frequent and intense heat waves or high temperatures can degrade their operational lifetime and thereby increase the premature failure risk. Without adequate preparedness. a widespread situation would ultimately lead to prolonged grid disruption and incur excessive economic costs. In this study. we investigate the impact of climate warming and corresponding shifts in heat waves on a selected LPT located in the Northeast corridor of the United States. We apply an analogue method. which detects the occurrence of heat waves based on the salient. associated large-scale atmospheric conditions (“composites”). to assess the risk of future change in heat wave occurrence. Compared with the more conventional approach that relies on climate model-simulated daily maximum temperature. the analogue method produces model medians of late twentieth-century heat wave frequency that are more consistent with observation and have stronger inter-model consensus. Under the future climate warming scenarios. multi-model medians of both model daily maximum temperature and the analogue method indicate strong decadal increases in heat wave frequency by the end of the 21st century. but the analogue method improves model consensus considerably. We perform a preliminary assessment on the decrease of transformer lifetime with temperature increase. Future work will focus on using more advanced algorithms to quantify the impact of more frequent heat waves on the transformer’s expected lifetime and associated additional costs.

One such energy harvesting modality is to use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generators to directly produce electricity from flowing seawater. Fundamentally. MHD generators convert the kinetic energy of a conductive fluid directly into electricity by separating charged particles. thereby generating an electric field transverse to the direction of fluid flow and the magnetic field. The electric field is then accessed with an external circuit to provide power to a load. Since the power output from an MHD generator is linearly related to the conductivity of the flowing fluid and to the square of both the magnetic field strength and the fluid velocity. strong magnets and high fluid velocity are desirable.

DIFFUSION FLAMES,1992,Baki M Cetegen and Tarek Ahmed,,"FIRE RESEARCH October 13-15, 1992 Rockville, MD",,53,,Buoyant propane diffusion flames established on 0.05 and 0.10 m. diameter burners were found to exhibit splitting of puffing frequencies with changes in the fuel flow rate or total heat release of the flames. A series of experiments were performed with flames established on porous-bed pool f? re burners in quiescent surroundings to explore this phenomenon. Burner surface pressure fluctuations along with the static pressure at a height of 1/2D above the burner surface were measured to determine tihe signature of puffing as detailed in a recent article [13. At low fuel flow rates. the puffing frequency more or less scales with the well-known. diameter dependent frequency (fa D-ln). As the fuel flow rate is increased. a higher frequency emerges in both the surface and the stahc pressure frequency spectrum as shown in the figure. At intermediate flow rates (eg Qf= 6.0 kw). both frequencies have comparable strengths. The higher frequency that appears in the spectra is believed to be associated with the buoyant flame instabilities with a frequency of around 10 Hz. These types of flames have been extensively studied by a number of researchers [2. 3]. It is also interesting to point out that the frequency of this instability has been experimentally fo. pnd to be insensitive to burner size. fuel type. etc. At even higher flow rates of fuel (eg Qf= 8.4 kW). this higher frequency begins to dominate while the amplitudes of the lower frequency fluctuations diminish.

Heptane is diffused into viscous crude oil in a microscale Hele-Shaw cell. No external pressure gradients are applied; hence. the imposed Peclet number is zero. Surprisingly. the diffusive/dispersive process is dictated by a two-stage dispersive mechanism owing to the multicomponent character of the crude oil. Stage I is distinguished by the spontaneous fractal-like fingering of heptane into the crude oil phase due to diffusive preferential light components extraction from the crude oil. Stage II is characterized by diffusive miscible fluid-pair mixing between the heptane and the heavy components in the crude oil. Preferential diffusive extraction of light components exceeds the diffusion between heptane and heavy components in stage I. thereby allowing a distinct interface to form between heptane and the crude oil.

Seafloor methane venting is often linked to dissociating hydrates or gas migration from a deep source. and subsurface evidence of gas‐driven tensile fracturing is abundant. However. the physical links among hydrate dissociation. gas flow. and fracturing has not been rigorously investigated. We used mercury intrusion data to model the capillary drainage curves of shallow marine muds as a function of clay content and porosity. We combined these with estimates of in situ tensile strength to determine the critical gas saturation at which the pressure of the gas phase would exceed the pressure required to generate tensile fractures.

For a given water content and temperature. pumping pressures below that of the dew point pressure of the system would induce liquid phase water condensation. and its subsequent acidification leads to pipeline corrosion and ultimately failure. The safe and economic pipeline transport of industrially generated CO2 from point emission sources to its respective injection wells–either for CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) or for CO2 storage in reservoir formations–therefore hinges upon the knowledge of the water dew point conditions.For the binary system of pure CO2 and water. the conditions (pressure. temperature. and water concentration) at which water condenses to its liquid phase has been well studied. both experimentally and analytically. 17–30 However. with the addition of impurities typical of industrially generated flue streams. for example N2. O2. and H2. the overall thermodynamic properties of the system inevitably change. Liquid phase water may exist at conditions at which single phase existed for the pure CO2–water binary system.

However. despite the efficiency increase. turbochargers often lack fast transient response due to the nature of the energy exchange with the engine. which deteriorates the vehicle’s drivability. An electrically-assisted turbocharger can be used for improving the transient response without any parasitic losses to the engine while providing energy recovery for increasing overall system efficiency. The present study provides a detailed numerical investigation on the potential of e-turbocharging to control load and if possible replace the wastegate valve. A parametric study of the optimum compressor/turbine sizing and wastegate area was performed for maximum torque. fast response time and energy regeneration across the real driving conditions speed/load area of the engine. The results showed that the implementation of a motor-generator could contribute to reducing the response time of the engine by up to 90% while improving its thermal efficiency and generating up to 6.6 kWh of energy. Suppressing the wastegate can only be achieved when a larger turbine is implemented. which as a result deteriorates the engine’s response and leads to energy provision demands at low engine speeds.

Dual-fuel technology is a fascinating approach as it can combine the benefits of two fuels to achieve high thermal efficiency and lower harmful emissions. Natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels. and its recent low price makes it an attractive fuel as a near-term solution. The utilization of natural gas with diesel in a compression ignition engine can result in efficiency improvement and lower CO2 emissions. However. at low engine loads. natural gas-diesel operation suffers from low combustion efficiency and high unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The present paper collates the work of experimental and simulation studies on natural gas-diesel dual-fuel operation over three different engine setups. Two single-cylinder. with and without optical access. and a multi-cylinder engine were used to analyze the effects of different diesel injection and air-path strategies on the combustion performance. with a focus on the low-load operation zone. The results show that the injection timing. as well as intake charge dilution. can severely promote clean combustion at the low-load zone. An advanced diesel injection can enhance the dieselnatural gas homogeneity within the cylinder and improve the combustion efficiency of the engine.

By carefully tuning the stoichiometry of the SnSe. we found that the composition range of single phase SnSe is very narrow. a Se/Sn ratio of 0.95–0.99; outside of this range secondary phases (metallic Sn or SnSe2) formed. Electrical properties were found to be very sensitive to even small changes in the stoichiometry. Three orders of magnitude difference in the carrier concentration was observed within the stoichiometry range for single-phase SnSe. which can be explained by changes in the shallow level defect density.

In particular for decreasing hazard rates. timer policies outperform the static policy of caching the most popular contents. We provide explicit solutions for the optimal policy in the case of Pareto-distributed inter-request times and a Zipf distribution of file popularities. including a compact fluid characterization in the limit of a large number of files.

Service capacity for a certain content adjusts dynamically as a function of peer population. thus achieving scalability. This dynamic behavior has been the subject of recent analytical studies. In this paper. we propose a partial differential equation model for BitTorrent-like systems. in which a fluid variable represents content and its distribution in the system is taken into account. This model allows for a variety of file sharing disciplines; we identify equilibrium properties that must hold regardless of this choice. and others that depend on a notion of efficiency. The equilibrium properties of many specific disciplines are described. Through a discretized ordinary differential equation model. we also present results on the stability of the equilibrium for a particular sharing policy that is suitable to model …,True,W93dcfkAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,10,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6160928/,15323998685804168255,/scholar?cites=15323998685804168255,,,https://folk.ntnu.no/skoge/prost/proceedings/cdc-ecc-2011/data/papers/1331.pdf,0,0,0
1306054,Controlling aggregates of deferrable loads for power system regulation,2015,Federico Bliman and Andres Ferragut and Fernando Paganini,,,,2335-2340,IEEE,This paper considers the role of a demand aggregator that manages a large number of consumer loads. with the objective of participating in the frequency regulation market. The key feature to be exploited is load deferrability in time. which enables the aggregator to adapt the consumption profile and thus reduce its own consumption of regulation. and even be a provider of regulation services to others. Rather than a microscopic model that considers individual loads and their scheduling. we consider here a macroscopic viewpoint drawn from fluid models of queueing systems. Here the state variable is the quantity of currently dispatchable loads. and the control input dictates the fraction of those which are currently active. The dynamics is a simple nonlinear ODE that allows us to design a controller with a feedforward term to track an external regulation reference. and a feedback term to reduce the impact of random …,True,W93dcfkAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7171081/,16039025601978250911,/scholar?cites=16039025601978250911,,,https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/6712/8/acc2015.pdf,0,0,0

Traditionally. research has focused on designing systems that ensure predictable performance for service requests. Motivated by applications in cloud computing and electricity markets. this article focuses on a different form of predictability: predictable allocations of service capacity. The focus of the article is a new model where service capacity can be scaled dynamically and service deferrals (subject to deadline constraints) can be used to control the variability of the active service capacity. Four natural policies for the joint problem of scheduling and managing the active service capacity are considered. For each. the variability of service capacity and the likelihood of deadline misses are derived. Further. the paper illustrates how pricing can be used to provide incentives for jobs to reveal deadlines and thus enable the possibility of service deferral in systems …,True,W93dcfkAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,6,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3086506,783907178379975478,/scholar?cites=783907178379975478,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3086506,0,0,0

However. since multiple TCP connections in one or many paths can serve a common user. we advocate in this paper a user-centric notion of fairness. which we formulate in the Network Utility Maximization (NUM) framework. In particular. we develop control laws for the number of connections identified with a certain user. which can include single-path. multipath or more general aggregates of flows. and prove convergence to the optimal resource allocation.

These high modulation speeds apply to the data portion of the transmitted frames. while headers must remain at lower speeds; this has motivated the use of frame aggregation to increase data payloads in the newer standards. However. this simple method may still utterly fail to deliver the promised speeds. due to a series of cross-layer effects involving the transport and multiple access layers: the downward equalization of throughputs imposed by TCP under physical rate diversity. the excessive impact of the TCP ACK stream. or the unreasonable fraction of access opportunities taken by uplink flows when competing with the more numerous downlink connections.

We obtained a complete (non-simplified) analytic solution of the entropy generation along of the HEX that allows exact evaluation of the irreversible processes in smooth or augmented tubes. By using this analytic solution. we proposed an adapted augmentation entropy generation number and compared it with Bejan’s original formulation. We evaluated the difference between the two at more than 7%. For a heat exchanger with corrugated tubes we have found that the recommended augmented solution e4p4a45# 9 in Bejan’s adapted formulation is different from the e2p4a45# 3 recommended by Bejan’s original formulation; thus. we found a change of the hierarchy of the recommended solutions. We developed a thermoeconomic model of a HEX for periods of operation of 1 to 10 years. for which specific optimum points of cost have been obtained. Furthermore. representing the cost versus entropy generation opens the path for future advanced comparisons of complementary objectives that may conduct to balanced designs: thermal process optimum vs economical optimum. We outlined. through matrix formulation. a new methodology of analysis of the constructal tree networks based on the network laws and thermohydro-electric analogy. The proposed methodology is characterized by compactness. a higher degree of abstraction of the problem and allows further generalizations.

Next to the economic challenges. there are equally important factors that hinder renovating the existing residential building stock and adding newly constructed high performance buildings. Under these circumstances this paper summarizes the findings of a cross-comparative study of the societal and technical barriers of nZEBs implementation in 7 Southern European countries. The aim of the study was to enhance the understanding and provide and overview on future challenges of residential nZEBs in Southern Europe. The result presents an overview of challenges and provides recommendations based on available empirical evidence to further lower those barriers in the European construction sector. The paper finds that the most Southern European countries are poorly prepared for nZEBs implementation and especially for existing buildings. It is essential creating a common approach to further develop nZEBs concepts and definitions in adaptation with the climatic. societal and technical state of progress in Southern Europe.

Oliver Gao,106,Environment International,,119-126,,In order to design effective strategies to reduce the public health burden of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) imposed in an area. it is necessary to identify the emissions sources affecting that location and quantify their contributions. However. it is challenging because PM2.5 travels long distances and most constituents are the result of complex chemical processes. We developed a reduced-form source-receptor model for estimating locations and magnitudes of downwind health costs from a source or. conversely. the upwind sources that contribute to health costs at a receptor location. Built upon outputs from a state-of-the-art air quality model. our model produces comprehensive risk-based source apportionment results with trivial computational costs.

Employing a chemical transport model (CTM) is the most rigorous way to address these atmospheric processes.

Wintertime PM2.5 increases in nonattainment areas were fairly linear at a rate of 3.4 μg PM2.5/m3 per 1 Tg NH3. allowing these results to be applied to other CCS emissions scenarios.

The so-called “good neighbor provisions” of the Clean Air Act requires states not to interfere with the maintenance of air quality standards in downwind states. Pursuant to the provision. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented policies to reduce upwind-downwind interferences from power plant emissions on PM2. 5 and ozone by implementing the Ozone Transport Commission NOx Budget Program in 1999. the NOx SIP Call program in 2003. the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005. the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in 2011 [2]. and a revision of CSAPR in 2016 [3].A desirable approach for controlling such effects would be to maximize social net benefits while limiting the interstate interferences at an equitable level.

Finding the right materials that can retain their electrical and spin properties when combined is a technological and fundamental challenge. We carry out the study of three archetypal organic molecules in intimate contact with the BiAg 2 surface alloy. We show that the BiAg 2 alloy is an especially suited substrate due to its inertness as support for molecular films. exhibiting an almost complete absence of substrate–molecular interactions. This is inferred from the persistence of a completely unaltered giant spin-orbit split surface state of the BiAg 2 substrate. and from the absence of significant metallic screening of charged molecular levels in the organic layer. Spin-orbit split states in BiAg 2 turn out to be far more robust to organic overlayers than previously thought.,True,APVDqcgAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,13,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/4/045002/meta,15648090158248459224,/scholar?cites=15648090158248459224,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/16/4/045002/pdf,0,0,0

1306131,Analysis of the Dynamics of Adsorbed Organic Molecules,2014,Johannes Schaffert,,,,,,This thesis presents the analysis of the dynamics of an adsorbed organic molecular species on a metal surface. When individual copper phthalocyanine molecules (CuPc) on Cu (111) are imaged by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). fluctuations which can be identified as’ random telegraph noise’are observed. The noise manifests itself in jumps of the tunneling current and documents bi-stable dynamics on the nanometer scale. A new method of detection is presented. which allows to analyze random telegraph noise during ongoing STM experiments in real-time. The strength of the’scanning noise microscopy and spectroscopy’technique (SNM. SNS) relies on the fact that it provides a full characterization of the noise with the same lateral resolution as provided by the STM. The results for the studied system show in great detail where the switching events are localized and provide the corresponding rates. Furthermore. the amplitude of the current jumps. as well as the relative occupation of the two observed states. are being detected. From the new information. a model for the underlying molecular dynamics is deduced: The molecule performs a frustrated rotation. a so called libration. within its adsorption plane. excited by the injected tunneling electrons. Furthermore. the spectroscopy mode reveals a one-electron process for the rotational excitation and gives access to the contributing orbital structure: The LUMO. HOMO and HOMO-1 states are detected. The geometry and electronic properties of the organic-metallic system are also addressed by density functional theory (DFT). As a result. the molecular rotor can be described …,True,APVDqcgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13927403892867707253&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13927403892867707253,/scholar?cites=13927403892867707253,,,,0,0,0

The lateral transport of electrons may be studied by using two tips to drive a current parallel to the surface. A third tip enables to map the corresponding electrochemical potential μ ec. Measurements for a 2D conducting layer will be discussed. To analyze the transport perpendicular to the surface. a thin metallic layer is placed on a semiconducting surface. At the interface a Schottky barrier is formed. which can only be overcome by electrons of sufficient energy.

1306136,Impact of hydrogen admixture on combustion processes–Part I,2020,Jörg Leicher and Johannes Schaffert and Stéphane Carpentier and Rolf Albus and Klaus Görner,5,Feedback,,05,,Natural gas is today one of the most important primary energy sources in Europe. with combustion processes representing the dominant utilization path. Although natural gas also serves as a feedstock for a wide variety of products in the chemical industry (as well as in some metallurgical applications). the vast majority of the natural gas being distributed today is burned to provide heat. electricity or propulsion across many different sectors. from residential appliances to industrial furnaces. power plants or in natural gas vehicles. While combustion is used in different ways in these sectors. tailored to the specific application. the basic principles are the same.The combustion of any hydrocarbon fuel will release carbon dioxide (CO2). which has been identified as a greenhouse gas. While natural gas will form far less CO2 per energy unit than other fuels such as coal or oil. measures must be taken to reduce the overall impact of gas combustion on the climate. Hydrogen admixture into the natural gas grids is being discussed as one potential way to reduce CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion. across all sectors. Hydrogen admixture into the gas grids can also serve to store surplus renewable energy from wind turbines or PV panels in times of low power demand. Energy storage is one of the major challenges of the energy transition to renewable energies. While storing electricity is strongly limited in terms of storage time and scale. the long-term storage of energy in chemical form. ie as a fuel. is technically feasible on the large scale.

The metallic surface states which occur on various of its surfaces underlie a large spin orbit splitting. We use scanning tunneling microscopy to analyze the lateral variation in the local density of states in the vicinity of a point defect on a Bi(111)-surface. The observed pattern in the dI/dV-images visualizes the scattering of surface state electrons. At energies close to the Fermi level. the pattern is highly anisotropic and shows a threefold symmetry. Using the calculated Fermi surface of Bi(111) the scattering processes are ascribed to spin-conserving transitions between two spin orbit split surface states. The scattering pattern can be simulated by the superposition of three monochromatic waves where the phase with respect to the scattering center has a significant impact on the appearance and the symmetry of the pattern.,True,APVDqcgAAAAJ:LO7wyVUgiFcC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21515103,,,,,,0,0,0

Although in many previous studies fully dispersed ice slurry flow is assumed homogeneous. inhomogeneity appears as a variation in physical properties in the actual measurements. From experiments. it was found that the fluctuation in pressure drop is relatively small at the beginning. but becomes larger after long-term periods. Additionally. the ice particle size included in the ice slurry also affects this fluctuation. We supposed the fluctuation is caused by the variation in IPF. because it appears only in laminar flow.

COVID-19 pandemic is now continuing to develop and researchers across the world are working to combat with COVID-19 & to reduce and prevent its spread. Traditional pathological tests are used but they are time consuming & also number of test kits & centers are limited. Surprising thing is 60% patients may not have any symptoms but still they are SAR-CoV-2 positive & may work as silent carrier causing outbreak of this disease. And a reason to worry is that there is no vaccine & exact drug for this disease.Machine learning techniques can be used to analyze clinical data but again symptoms vary from person-to-person & accuracy of clinical outcomes is questionable. To tackle this problem. this paper proposes a technique to detect presence of SAR-CoV-2 in a person using genome sequencing. This will accurately help to detect presence of virus. to develop targeted therapies & vaccines and also to learn how patient will respond to drugs. This paper summarizes primary survey of existing work & proposes a technique using predictive analytics to detect presence of SAR-CoV-2 using genome sequencing to combat with COVID-19. This system will be able to differentiate SAR-CoV-2 from its other subtypes. such as MERS-CoV. HCoV-NL63. HCoV-OC43. HCoV-229E.

1306192,Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater: Inspection through Wastewater-based Epidemiology essential for India,,Madhulika Bhati and Madhur D Gajbhiye,,,,,,Many countries are tackling the spread of the contagious disease COVID-19 by screening. testing. and implementing social distancing norms and lockdowns to avoid community transmission. The reported mode of infection of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is respiratory droplet and contact routes from the infected person. Countries worldwide have also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 fragments in stool samples from China (Pan et al.; Zheng et al. 2020); Netherland (Wan et al.; Medema et al. 2020); USA (Holshue et al. 2020). Stools of asymptomatic patients also tested positive for the viral fragments. Investigation of the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater showed positive results in various studies conducted in Spain (Randazzo et al. 2020); Australia (Ahmed et al. 2020); France (Wurtzer et al. 2020); Italy (La Rosa et al. 2020); India (Kumar et al. 2020); United States (Peccia et al.; Wu et al. 2020); Pakistan (Sharif et al. 2020); etc.The presence of SARS-CoV-2 fragments in wastewater is a great matter of concern for India also. As only 37.18% of the total wastewater generated gets treated while remaining is released in various surface water bodies. Prior research reveals that the human coronavirus can remain infectious for several days in sewage. Viral contaminated water is a potential source of aerosolization of the virus and direct human exposure (Casanova et al. 2009). A study conducted at Amoy Gardens. Hong Kong suggested an outbreak of SARS 2003 from the leakage of sewage pipe which led to the formation of aerosols of water droplets comprising the coronavirus which is the possible …,True,huX6y7cAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,0,https://sciencereporter.niscair.res.in/home/article/262,,,,,https://sciencereporter.niscair.res.in/home/article/262,0,0,0

This infrastructure is already in place in many cities throughout the main markets of China. EU and USA. Public policies are both taken at regional and/or at a city level targeting both EV adoption. but also charging infrastructure management. A growing trend is the increasing idle time over the years (time an EV is connected without charging). which directly impacts on the sizing of the infrastructure. hence its cost or availability. Such a phenomenon can be regarded as an opportunity but may very well undermine the same initiatives being taken to promote adoption; in any case it must be measured. studied. and managed. The time an EV takes to charge depends on its initial/final state of charge (SOC) and the power being supplied to it. The problem however is to estimate the time the EV remains parked after charging (idle time). as it depends on many factors which simple statistical analysis cannot tackle. In this study we apply supervised machine learning to a dataset from the Netherlands and analyze three regression algorithms. Random Forest.

This paper describes the result of focus groups and a survey with 286 respondents. Results indicate the current EV driver is predominantly a well-educated middle aged male with a high paying job. We link this to the price of the vehicles and the structure of tax incentives. He is moderately environmentally friendly and likes innovation. He loves the driving experience and promotes EVs towards friends. Most EV drivers are unsatisfied with their all electric range and on average a range of 375 km is desired. Bigger batteries will lead to better use of charging infrastructure. Fast charging is considered important for longer trips but not as a replacement for chargers at parking locations.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have an important role in the electrifi cation of passenger transportation. Long-range PHEVs not only are a transitional technology. They also are an enabling technology that can encourage more consumers to adopt electric vehicles.2. The electric range of PHEVs has a signifi cant impact on electric vehicle miles traveled. PHEVs with electric range of at least 60km (37 miles (EPA Range)) have a similar ability to electrify travel as short-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs).3. Assuming the goal of policymakers is to increase electric vehicle miles traveled. policy support should correspond directly to electric driving range of both PHEVs and BEVs. Short-range PHEVs should receive less policy support; long-range PHEVs and BEVs should receive more policy support.4. Consumer research in several countries shows that mainstream consumers tend to be more attracted to PHEVs than to BEVs. however many consumers are unaware of how a PHEV diff ers from a BEV.

It compliments another guide that explores financial purchase incentives [1]. Reoccurring incentives are received by consumers during vehicle ownership opposed to financial purchase incentives which are received at point of sale. Reoccurring incentives can be received at any increment. during any timeframe. and not all consumers use these incentives when they are in place.

The electrification of passenger vehicles should be one part of a city’s transportation plan. Shifting from internal combustion engine vehicles to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can improve urban air quality. reduce greenhouse gas emissions. and reduce energy consumption.2. Recent studies show that electric vehicle awareness is low even in mature markets; cities should promote electric vehicles to residents by leveraging existing promotional campaigns.3. Various financial and non-financial incentives can effectively encourage electric vehicle uptake. including: free. discounted. or preferential-location parking; free or reduced road and bridge tolls; and allowing electric vehicles to drive in bus or carpool lanes.4. Several cities are restricting or planning to restrict the access that internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) have to certain areas. If these restrictions apply to most (or all) passenger ICEVs. they can promote PEV purchase and use in cities.5. Infrastructure development in cities should follow the same fundamental approach as that used outside of cities. The priority should be ensuring that PEV owners and prospective PEV buyers have access to charging at or near home. Workplace and public charging should be developed for those who cannot access charging at or near home.6. Cities should be strategic in their approach. first identifying the goals they want to achieve. and then exploring what steps they can take to meet these goals. The steps available will likely differ between cities due to the different ways in which roads. parking. and any other vehicle infrastructure is governed.,True,NxZkE04AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://escholarship.org/content/qt8q2917sh/qt8q2917sh.pdf,,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt8q2917sh/qt8q2917sh.pdf,0,0,0

1306215,Key Takeaways,2018,Alan Jenn and Sten Karlsson and José Pontes and Nazir Refa and Frances Sprei and Bert Witkamp,,,,,,PEVs are more efficient and less polluting than conventional vehicles. For PEVs to reduce urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in time to meet emissions reduction goals. they must be deployed quickly and in large numbers. Yet the available evidence indicates most consumers remain largely unaware of PEVs. ignorant of their capabilities. and lacking experience to compare PEVs to conventional vehicles.Currently. there is a small segment of pioneering PEV buyers: world markets have reached about 1% of annual sales. However. even in places where sales are higher. such as Norway. California. and Shanghai. many other vehicle buyers—especially used-car buyers—have little awareness and knowledge of PEVs and even less experience driving and charging them.,True,NxZkE04AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://phev.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/increasing-consumer-awareness-and-knowledge.pdf,,,,,https://phev.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/increasing-consumer-awareness-and-knowledge.pdf,0,0,0

For PEVs to have the most significant impact on urban air pollution. energy consumption. and climate change. their market share will need to increase quickly. A robust and reliable PEV charging infrastructure is needed to help grow the market. Moreover. PEV charging infrastructure must meet the needs of PEV drivers. so it requires careful consideration. All PEV stakeholders. including automakers. electric utilities. PEV drivers. employers. housing developers. charging station manufacturers and service providers. and any other stakeholders. need to communicate and coordinate on the development of charging infrastructure.

For facilitating charging possibilities for EVs typically two rollout strategies have been applied; demand-driven and strategic rollout. This study focuses on determining the differences in performance metrics of the two rollout strategies by first defining key performance metrics. Thereafter. the root causes of performance differences between the two rollout strategies are investigated. This study analyzes charging data of 1.007.137 transactions on 1742 different CPs by use of 53.850 unique charging cards. This research concludes that demand-driven CPs outperform strategic CPs on weekly energy transfer and connection duration. while strategic CPs outperform their demand-driven counterparts on charging time ratio. Regarding users facilitated. there is a significant change in performance after massive EV-uptake. The root cause analysis shows effects of EV uptake and user type composition on the differences in performance metrics.

1306218,Considerations for the development of plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure for consumers-A review,2017,Erik Figenbaum Daina and Niklas Jakobsson and Patrick Jochem and Neale Kinnear and Patrick Plötz and Jose Pontes and Nazir Refa and Tom France,,,,,,Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) need to be adopted by large numbers of consumers to have a significant impact on urban air pollution. climate change. and resource depletion. The adoption of PEVs is partially dependent on the availability of PEV charging infrastructure. The development of this infrastructure needs to be carefully considered so that it serves the needs of PEV buyers and encourages more consumers to purchase the vehicles. This article draws from data in the current literature to make recommendations on charging location. charging levels (level 1. 2. DC fast). access and payment for charging. pricing. dependability of infrastructure. charge management. and number of charging stations. To ensure PEV market entry is successful infrastructure will be needed at home locations. workplaces. and in public locations. Charging level should be based on location. with home and work being level 1 or 2. and public being level 2 or DC fast. Charge stations should be interoperable so that all consumers can access them. and there should be a cost to charge to prevent unnecessary charging and congestion of chargers. Charging should be managed with smart charging or pricing tariffs that prevent peak demand charging. Finally. the number of charging stations needed in a region will depend on several factors including PEV market share. travel patterns. and housing types.,True,NxZkE04AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://phev.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/PEV-Infrastructure-Literature-Review-.pdf,,,,,https://phev.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/PEV-Infrastructure-Literature-Review-.pdf,0,0,0

1306221,Pinpointing the Smart Charging Potential for Electric Vehicles at Public Charging Points,,Youssef El Bouhassani and Nazir Refa and Robert van den Hoed,,,,,,The peaks in electricity demand for charging electric vehicles (EVs) correspond with the peaks of household electricity demand. As the number of EVs will increase. the demand for electricity at these peak moments will increase even further. Research on public charging infrastructure. shows that the charging time of EV’s (the time EV’s are connected and charging) is on average 20% of the total connection time. This suggests a high potential for smart charging which can be unlocked by eg rescheduling the charging sessions optimizing for the grid while meeting the demand of EVs at the same time.The focus of this research is to develop a methodology to assess the potential for smart charging and suggest possible smart charging strategies. Based on the start time of a charging session and the total connection time three main user categories are defined for which the smart charting potential is determined. Based on this research. we can conclude that approximately 40% of all charging sessions start between 16: 00 and 20: 00. a category that has a smart charging Potential of 75% or higher.,True,NxZkE04AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazir_Refa/publication/333262644_Pinpointing_the_Smart_Charging_Potential_for_Electric_Vehicles_at_Public_Charging_Points/links/5ce501b092851c4eabb4ff29/Pinpointing-the-Smart-Charging-Potential-for-Electric-Vehicles-at-Public-Charging-Points.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazir_Refa/publication/333262644_Pinpointing_the_Smart_Charging_Potential_for_Electric_Vehicles_at_Public_Charging_Points/links/5ce501b092851c4eabb4ff29/Pinpointing-the-Smart-Charging-Potential-for-Electric-Vehicles-at-Public-Charging-Points.pdf,0,0,0

1306237,Correlation of Leakage Current Pathways and Potential Induced Degradation of CIGS Thin Film Solar Modules,2017,Sebastian Voswinckel and Viktor Wesselak and Sven Münter and Lukas Gerstenberg,,Proceedings of the ISES Solar World Conference 2017 and the IEA SHC Solar Heating and Cooling Conference for Buildings and Industry,,,,The life time of over 20 years is a unique feature of PV modules. Because of weather exposition and the system design of PV power plants system induced degradation can occur. In case of CIGS PV modules it is called Potential Induced Degradation (PID). The rate of degradation depends on the transferred charge. which can be determined by measuring the leakage currents because of the potential between module connectors and ground. Thereby only the sum of the leakage current can be measured. but there are different leakage current pathways. The main pathways are through the cover glass and the back glass/material. For a real lifetime prediction the correlation of climate chamber tests and outdoor conditions is necessary. A method for measuring the exclusive leakage current pathway through the cover or the back glass was developed. The encapsulation foil enables the possibility to deactivate the leakage current pathways which is more harmful in relation to PID of CIGS PV modules.,True,wCN0_YkAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,3,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/swc2017/swc2017-0132-Voswinckel.pdf,8001261873068126466,/scholar?cites=8001261873068126466,,,http://proceedings.ises.org/paper/swc2017/swc2017-0132-Voswinckel.pdf,0,0,0

This degradation is named potential induced degradation (PID). At the cell level. PID has been studied in laboratory experiments and can be traced back to sodium diffusion. which is accelerated by the mentioned voltage against ground potential. The applied potential will lead to a leakage current. which can serve as an indicator for PID.The question whether PID of CIGS thin film solar modules also occurs in real PV power plants inevitably arises. To solve this question the degradation behaviour will be analysed by accelerated aging tests. Furthermore. the influence of different leakage current pathways will be shown.

Both methane leakage rates and decisions about when CCS is deployed will affect the timing and magnitude of climate impacts from these power plants. This works compares the annual and cumulative radiative forcing of new coal and natural gas power plants under different CCS deployment scenarios and a range of methane leakage rates. The results show that coal with CCS results in higher radiative forcing than natural gas with CCS under most scenarios. and that delaying CCS on a coal power plant by 20 years results in higher climate impacts than a natural gas plant without any CCS. Reducing methane leakage can reduce mid-century peak radiative forcing from natural gas plants by a similar amount as …,True,eOVC73oAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMPA33A..11S/abstract,,,,,,0,0,0

However. there are some other available biomass feedstocks capable of being densified for energy production. Among the various options. the use of mixed biomass pellets is becoming remarkable due to the wide variety of species. although more research is needed in order to enhance the mechanical properties of these pellets. This study aims to identify the effect of particle size on the mechanical properties of sawdust and coal pellets when cocoa pod husks are used as an additive. Cocoa pod husks have a similar composition to sawdust and less sulfur and nitrogen than coal. Thus. the use of this additive might decrease the environmental impact during coal pellets combustion.

Este trabajo analiza el desempeño de un control mediante redes neuronales aplicado a un gasificador de lecho fijo corriente descendente cuando se emplean cascaras de coco o cuesco de palma. Los resultados indican que el uso del sistema de control en el equipo. alimentado con cascaras de coco. permite aumentar las temperaturas en el reactor de 600 C a 800 C en la zona de inyección. superando así el problema derivado de la baja transferencia de energía por conducción a través del sistema. Cuando se emplea el control en la gasificación de cuesco. la temperatura promedio se mantuvo constante en 790 C. el CO presente en el gas estuvo alrededor de 10% mientras que el CO 2 disminuyó a 4%. La aplicación de un sistema de control mediante redes neuronales es una gran alternativa puesto que se puede entrenar para cada tipo de biomasa mejorando la estabilidad del sistema y produciendo un gas de síntesis con menor contenido de CO 2.

The necessity of cleaner energy sources is mandatory; among the different possibilities. biomass and solid wastes have become remarkable materials because of the wide processes and fuels resulting of them. Annually. the leather industry in Colombia produces 3.324 tons and generates 700 tons of tanned solid wastes approximately. The lack of alternative disposal methods makes this industry hazardous. despite the different technologies evaluated worldwide. such as pyrolysis. gasification or biodigestion. This work aims to analyze the changes in the chemical composition of the remaining solid and to enhance the energetic value of tanned solid wastes after thermal treatment in the 180-280 C range. The improvement of the high heating value is about 16%. Such parameter ups from 17 to 20. 5 MJ kg-1. Hydrogen exhibits the highest variation after thermal treatment with a decomposition ratio of 0.102 mol C-1. while Sulfur. at 0. 0021 mol C-1. is the most stable.

Eng,4,382-390,,Gasification is a remarkable alternative to produce either thermal or electrical energy using renewable resources like biomass. Several developments have been performed in order to increase the energy value of syngas resulting from biomass gasification; nevertheless. the complexity of the reactions occurring inside the reactors and the differences of the raw materials employed have created the necessity of analyzing the internal performance of the equipment. This work aims to simulate the thermal performance of a lab-scale downdraft fixed bed gasifier by means of a Euler-Euler multiphase Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. and validate it in accordance with experimental data of charcoal gasification. The model. built on a 2D axissymmetric domain. comprises heat. mass transfer equations. and homogeneous and solid-gas heterogeneous reactions. Mesh quality was evaluated in accordance with squish. skewness and aspect ratio criteria. The composition of the syngas varied with the airflow rate; however. CO content was between 24 and 27%. whereas CO2 was in the range of 4.4 and 2.8%. The higher the CO content. the greater the energy value of the syngas. Small prediction errors. obtained after comparing predicted CO and CO2 content in syngas with experimental data indicated good accuracy of the CFD model; nonetheless. further research is needed in order to decrease differences on the temperature distribution along the reactor.

Oxidative stress is implicated as a final common pathway in development of diabetic neuropathy. Pharmacological interventions targeted at inhibiting free radical production have shown beneficial effects in diabetic neuropathy. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the possible analgesic effects of melatonin and vitamin E in diabetic rats.Materials and MethodsThis study was performed on 32 male Wistar rats divided into 4 groups: control. diabetic. melatonin-treated diabetic and vitamin E-treated diabetic. Experimental diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) injection. Melatonin (10 mg/kg. ip) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg. ip) were injected for 2 weeks after 21st day of diabetes induction. At the end of administration period. pain-related behavior was assessed using 0.5% formalin test according to two spontaneous flinching and licking responses. The levels of lipid peroxidation as well as glutathione-peroxidase and catalase activities were evaluated in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia.Results: Formalin-evoked flinching and total time of licking were increased in both acute and chronic phases of pain in diabetic rats as compared to control rats. whereas treatment with melatonin or vitamin E significantly reduced the pain indices. Furthermore. lipid peroxidation levels increased and glutathione-peroxidase and catalase activities decreased in diabetic rats. Both antioxidants reversed the biochemical parameters toward their control values.Conclusion: These results suggest that oxidative stress may …,True,MIn-aAgAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,26,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=168971,16569287125919774956,/scholar?cites=16569287125919774956,,,https://www.sid.ir/EN/VEWSSID/J_pdf/93720100201.pdf,0,0,0
