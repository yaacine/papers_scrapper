We demonstrate that in vivo central airway branch variants are present in 26.5% of the general population. are unchanged over 10 y. and exhibit strong familial aggregation. The most common airway branch variant is associated with COPD in two cohorts (n = 5.054). with greater central airway bifurcation density. and with emphysema throughout the lung. The second most common airway branch variant is associated with COPD among smokers. with narrower airway lumens in all lobes. and with genetic polymorphisms within the FGF10 gene.

A major barrier to mapping normal brain aging has been the difficulty in excluding the earliest preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Here. before addressing this issue we first imaged a mouse model and learn that the best MRI measure of dendritic spine loss. a known pathophysiological driver of normal aging. is one that relies on the combined use of functional and structural MRI. In the primary study. we then deployed the combined functional-structural MRI measure to investigate over 100 cognitively-normal people from 20–72 years of age. Next. to cover the tail end of aging. in secondary analyses we investigated structural MRI acquired from cognitively-normal people. 60–84 years of age. who were Alzheimer’s-free via biomarkers. Collectively. the results from the primary functional-structural study. and the secondary structural studies revealed that the dentate gyrus is a hippocampal region differentially affected by aging. and that the entorhinal cortex is a region most resistant to aging.

The time-tagged list-mode neutron detection data for each of the five experiments was recorded and analysed to calculate the normalized doubles counting rates. R2F. Each experiment was then modelled in COG and MORET to produce simulated list-mode neutron detection data. This data was then analysed by the same methods and compared to the experimental data to validate the neutron transport simulation software. Use of the Fission Reaction Event Yield Algorithm (FREYA) to generate correlated fission neutrons was found to significantly improve the accuracy of the simulations.

1284873,Carbon Nanotube Based Dosimetry of Neutron and Gamma Radiation,2016,Anthony Joseph Nelson,,,,,,As the world's nuclear reactors approach the end of their originally planned lifetimes and seek license extensions. which would allow them to operate for another 20 years. accurate information regarding neutron radiation exposure is more important than ever.  Structural components such as the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) become embrittled by neutron irradiation. reducing their capability to resist crack growth and increasing the risk of catastrophic failure.  The current dosimetry approaches used in these high flux environments do not provide real-time information.  Instead. radiation dose is calculated using computer simulations. which are checked against dose readings that are only available during refueling once every 1.5-2 years.  These dose readings are also very expensive. requiring highly trained technicians to handle radioactive material and operate specialized characterization equipment.  This dissertation describes the development of a novel neutron radiation dosimeter based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that not only provides accurate real-time dosimetry. but also does so at very low cost. without the need for complex instrumentation. highly trained operators. or handling of radioactive material.  Furthermore. since this device is based on radiation damage rather than radioactivation. its readings are time-independent. which is beneficial for nuclear forensics.  In addition to development of a novel dosimeter. this work also provides insight into the particularly under-investigated topic of the effects of neutron irradiation of carbon nanotubes.  This work details the fabrication and characterization of carbon nanotube based neutron and …,True,cEJ85HAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/79732,11314877599531907776,/scholar?cites=11314877599531907776,,,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/79732/Nelson_AJ_D_2016.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1,0,0,0

In this paper. we present MintHint. a novel technique for program repair that is a departure from most of today’s approaches. Instead of trying to fully automate program repair. which is often an unachievable goal. MintHint performs statistical correlation analysis to identify expressions that are likely to occur in the repaired code and generates. using pattern-matching based synthesis. repair hints from these expressions.

As is true with any promising technology. there are a number of tools for software model checking. However. their respective performance trade-offs are difficult to characterize accurately–making it difficult for practitioners to select a suitable tool for the task at hand. This paper proposes a technique called MUX that addresses the problem of selecting the most suitable software model checker for a given input instance.

Images of weeds growing within a variety of crops were gathered across variable environmental conditions with regards to soil types. resolution and light settings. Then. 9649 of these images were used for training the computer. which automatically divided the weeds into nine growth classes. The performance of this proposed convolutional neural network approach was evaluated on a further set of 2516 images. which also varied in term of crop. soil type. image resolution and light conditions. The overall performance of this approach achieved a maximum accuracy of 78% for identifying Polygonum spp. and a minimum accuracy of 46% for blackgrass. In addition. it achieved an average 70% accuracy rate in estimating the number of leaves and 96% accuracy when accepting a deviation of two leaves. These results show that this new method of using deep convolutional neural networks has a relatively high ability to estimate early growth stages across a wide variety of weed species.

Radar sensors are capable of imaging Earth’s surface independently of the weather conditions. local time of day. penetrating of waves through clouds. and containing spatial information on agricultural crop types. Based on these characteristics. the main goal sought in this research is to reveal the SAR imaging data capability in recognizing various agricultural crops in the main growth season in a more clarified and detailed way by using a deep-learning-based method. In the present research. the multi-temporal C-band Sentinel 1 images were used to classify 14 major classes of agricultural crops plus background in Denmark. By considering the capability of a deep learning method in analyzing satellite images. a novel. optimal. and lightweight network structure was developed and implemented based on a combination of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network. The average pixel-based accuracy and Intersection over Union obtained from the proposed network were 86% and 0.64. respectively. Winter rapeseed. winter barley. winter wheat. spring barley. and sugar beet had the highest pixel-based accuracies of 95%. 94%. 93%. 90%. and 90%; respectively.

Remote sensing using Sentinel-1 have the potential to provide daily updates on the current conditions in the individual fields and at the same time give an overview of the agricultural areas in the region. Research depends on the ability of independent validation of the presented results. In the case of the Sentinel-1 satellites. every researcher has access to the same base dataset. and therefore independent validation is possible.

PCV is thought to deliver a more uniform distribution of ventilation than VCV. but the delivered tidal volume could be unstable and affected by changes in the degree of constriction. To explore the magnitude of these effects. we ran numerical simulations with both modes of ventilation in a network model of the lung in which we incorporated not only the pressure and flow dynamics along the airways but also the effect of cycling pressures and tissue tethering forces during breathing on the dynamic equilibrium of the airway smooth muscle (ASM) (Venegas et al..

1284891,Elevation in lung volume and preventing catastrophic airway closure in asthmatics during bronchoconstriction,2018,Juan S Osorio-Valencia and Chanikarn Wongviriyawong and Tilo Winkler and Vanessa J Kelly and Robert S Harris and Jose G Venegas,13,PloS one,12,e0208337,Public Library of Science,Background Asthma exacerbations cause lung hyperinflation. elevation in load to inspiratory muscles. and decreased breathing capacity that. in severe cases. may lead to inspiratory muscle fatigue and respiratory failure. Hyperinflation has been attributed to a passive mechanical origin; a respiratory system time-constant too long for full exhalation. However. because the increase in volume is also concurrent with activation of inspiratory muscles during exhalation it is unclear whether hyperinflation in broncho-constriction is a passive phenomenon or is actively controlled to avoid airway closure.   Methods Using CT scanning. we measured the distensibility of individual segmental airways relative to that of their surrounding parenchyma in seven subjects with asthma and nine healthy controls. With this data we tested whether the elevation of lung volume measured after methacholine (MCh) provocation was associated with airway narrowing. or to the volume required to preventing airway closure. We also tested whether the reduction in FVC post-MCh could be attributed to gas trapped behind closed segmental airways.   Findings The changes in lung volume by MCh in subjects with and without asthma were inversely associated with their reduction in average airway lumen. This finding would be inconsistent with hyperinflation by passive elevation of airway resistance. In contrast. the change in volume of each subject was associated with the lung volume estimated to cause the closure of the least stable segmental airway of his/her lungs.

We study whether textual entailment predictions can be used to detect such errors and if they can be reduced by reranking alternative predicted summaries.

As abundant information on almost any topic is electronically available nowadays. supporting tools are needed to ensure that people can profit from the information's availability rather than suffer from the information overload. Structured summaries can help in this situation: They can be used to provide a concise overview of the contents of a document collection. they can reveal interesting relationships and they can be used as a navigation structure to further explore the documents. A concept map. which is a graph representing concepts and their relationships. is a specific form of a structured summary that offers these benefits. However. despite its appealing properties. only a limited amount of research has studied how concept maps can be automatically created to summarize documents. Automating that task is challenging and requires a variety of text processing techniques including information extraction. coreference resolution and summarization. The goal of this thesis is to better understand these challenges and to develop computational models that can address them. As a first contribution. this thesis lays the necessary ground for comparable research on computational models for concept map--based summarization. We propose a precise definition of the task together with suitable evaluation protocols and carry out experimental comparisons of previously proposed methods.

1284913,Random vector functional link neural network based ensemble deep learning,2019,Rakesh Katuwal and Ponnuthurai N Suganthan and M Tanveer,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.00350,,,,In this paper. we propose a deep learning framework based on randomized neural network. In particular. inspired by the principles of Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network. we present a deep RVFL network (dRVFL) with stacked layers. The parameters of the hidden layers of the dRVFL are randomly generated within a suitable range and kept fixed while the output weights are computed using the closed form solution as in a standard RVFL network. We also propose an ensemble deep network (edRVFL) that can be regarded as a marriage of ensemble learning with deep learning. Unlike traditional ensembling approaches that require training several models independently from scratch. edRVFL is obtained by training a single dRVFL network once.

Instead of relying on explicitly provided demographic data for each user. we define an audio-based demographic group profile that captures the age and gender for all members of the audience. A 7-class age and gender classifier employing a fusion of acoustic and prosodic features determines the probability of each speaker belonging to each class. The information for all speakers is then combined to form the group profile. which itself is the input to a recommender system. The recommender system finds the content items whose demographics best match the group profile. We tested the effectiveness of the system for several typical home audience configurations.

In particular. the presented approach uses a limited number of arbitrary discrete measurements of the magnitude of the sound field pressure in order to extrapolate this field to a higher-resolution grid of discrete points in space with a low computational complexity.

Despite their potential of improving multiple application domains. these devices have poor security. which can be explored by attackers to build large-scale botnets. In this work. we propose a host-based approach to detect botnets in IoT devices. named IoTDS (Internet of Things Detection System). It relies on one-class classifiers. which model only the legitimate device behaviour for further detection of deviations. avoiding the manual labelling process. The proposed solution is underpinned by a novel agent-manager architecture based on HTTPS. which prevents the IoT device from being overloaded by the training activities. To analyse the device’s behaviour. the approach extracts features from the device’s CPU utilisation and temperature. memory consumption. and number of running tasks. meaning that it does not make use of network traffic data. To test our approach. we used an experimental IoT setup containing a device compromised by bot malware. Multiple scenarios were made. including three different IoT device profiles and seven botnets. Four one-class algorithms (Elliptic Envelope. Isolation Forest. Local Outlier Factor. and One-class Support Vector Machine) were evaluated. The results show the proposed system has a good predictive performance for different botnets. achieving a mean F1-score of 94% for the best performing algorithm. the Local Outlier Factor.

Zarpelão,,,,917-922,IEEE,Botnets have been a serious threat to the Internet security. With the constant sophistication and the resilience of them. a new trend has emerged. shifting botnets from the traditional desktop to the mobile environment. As in the desktop domain. detecting mobile botnets is essential to minimize the threat that they impose. Along the diverse set of strategies applied to detect these botnets. the ones that show the best and most generalized results involve discovering patterns in their anomalous behavior. In the mobile botnet field. one way to detect these patterns is by analyzing the operation parameters of this kind of applications.

A type of malware that imposes a serious threat to the Internet security is known as botnets. This malware exploits some vulnerabilities of IoT devices to infect them and perform large-scale Distributed Denial of Service attacks. affecting many users who depend on their services. This work presents the construction of an experimental environment to generate a dataset that contains data from a real IoT device that was infected by botnet malware in a laboratory.

Therefore. it is expected that CC models provide solutions by examining a summary of past history. rather than using full historical data. This strategy has significant benefits in terms of response time and space complexity but poses new challenges in term of concept-drift detection. where both long term and short terms dynamics should be taken into account.

However. the quality of data labels is a concern because of the lack of high-quality labels in many real-world scenarios. As noisy labels severely degrade the generalization performance of deep neural networks. learning from noisy labels (robust training) is becoming an important task in modern deep learning applications. In this survey. we first describe the problem of learning with label noise from a supervised learning perspective. Next. we provide a comprehensive review of 57 state-of-the-art robust training methods. all of which are categorized into five groups according to their methodological difference. followed by a systematic comparison of six properties used to evaluate their superiority. Subsequently. we perform an in-depth analysis of noise rate estimation and summarize the typically used evaluation methodology. including public noisy datasets and evaluation metrics.

Each event is detected in real time to improve the user friendliness of the application. Cyclists may keep their smartphones at any random orientation and placement. Moreover. different smartphones sense the same incident dissimilarly and hence report discrepant sensor values. We further address the aforementioned difficulties that limit such crowd-sourcing …,True,gPY5tFEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8355173/,5365551714320276752,/scholar?cites=5365551714320276752,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05545,0,0,0
1284980,A deep learning approach for classification of cleanliness in restrooms,2018,Lahiru Jayasinghe and Nipun Wijerathne and Chau Yuen,,,,1-6,IEEE,Facilities hire cleaning companies to maintain and manage cleaning operations on their restrooms by deploying cleaners who are responsible for performing frequent checks to ensure the cleanliness of restrooms. Nevertheless. the perception of quality and word. clean is very subjective to the observer. Hence. it is not an easy task to quantify the cleanliness. This paper presents a deep learning approach using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) to detect and classify the level of cleanliness in restrooms into three different categories; namely dirty. average. and clean. Our method sheds new lights on data augmentation. feature extraction and knowledge transfer between models. The proposed architecture achieved a precision of 0.98. 0.95. 0.80 and recall of 0.99. 0.83. 0.95 for dirty. average. and clean categories respectively utilizing a dataset collected from an active restroom facility.,True,gPY5tFEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8540592/,3620277509067700078,/scholar?cites=3620277509067700078,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lahiru_Jayasinghe2/publication/329492041_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Classification_of_Cleanliness_in_Restrooms/links/5c5cf50745851582c3d5a30f/A-Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Classification-of-Cleanliness-in-Restrooms.pdf,0,0,0

While existing human activity tracking systems have demonstrated the capability to unveil the hidden aspects of citizens’ behavior. they often come with a high implementation cost and require a large communication bandwidth. In this article. we study the implementation of low-cost analog sound sensors to detect outdoor activities and estimate the raining period in an urban residential area. The analog sound sensors are transmitted to the cloud every 5 min in histogram format. which consists of sound data sampled every 100 ms (10 Hz).

Measures for characterizing and monitoring structural properties. however. have not been developed. In this work. we propose neural persistence. a complexity measure for neural network architectures based on topological data analysis on weighted stratified graphs.

1284986,Early Recognition of Sepsis with Gaussian Process Temporal Convolutional Networks and Dynamic Time Warping,2019,Michael Moor and Max Horn and Bastian Rieck and Damian Roqueiro and Karsten Borgwardt,,"Proceedings of the 4th Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference, 2019.",,,,Sepsis is a life-threatening host response to infection that is associated with high mortality. morbidity. and health costs. Its management is highly time-sensitive because each hour of delayed treatment increases mortality due to irreversible organ damage. Meanwhile. despite decades of clinical research. robust biomarkers for sepsis are missing. Therefore. detecting sepsis early by utilizing the affluence of high-resolution intensive care records has become a challenging machine learning problem. Recent advances in deep learning and data mining promise to deliver a powerful set of tools to efficiently address this task. This empirical study proposes two novel approaches for the early detection of sepsis: a deep learning model and a lazy learner that is based on time series distances. Our deep learning model employs a temporal convolutional network that is embedded in a multi-task Gaussian Process adapter framework. making it directly applicable to irregularly-spaced time series data. In contrast. our lazy learner is an ensemble approach that employs dynamic time warping. We frame the timely detection of sepsis as a supervised time series classification task. Consequently. we derive the most recent sepsis definition in an hourly resolution to provide the first fully accessible early sepsis detection environment. Seven hours before sepsis onset. our methods improve area under the precision–recall curve from 0.25 to 0.35 and 0.40. respectively. over the state of the art. This demonstrates that they are well-suited for detecting sepsis in the crucial earlier stages when management is most effective.,True,Q_Y5csgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,26,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v106/moor19a.html,6608657189109755388,/scholar?cites=6608657189109755388,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v106/moor19a/moor19a.pdf,0,0,0

These data can be used to extract signatures. commonly known as biomarkers. that help physicians understand the biological complexity of many syndromes. However. most biological biomarkers suffer from either poor predictive performance or weak explanatory power.

Shapelets have the advantage of combining a high predictive performance with an interpretable component—their shape.

Considering significant practical advantages of lung ultrasound (LUS) over other imaging techniques. but difficulties for doctors in pattern recognition. we aim to leverage machine learning toward guiding diagnosis from LUS. We release the largest publicly available LUS dataset for COVID-19 consisting of 202 videos from four classes (COVID-19. bacterial pneumonia. non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia and healthy controls). On this dataset. we perform an in-depth study of the value of deep learning methods for the differential diagnosis of lung pathologies.

1285000,Synchronization analysis of neuronal networks by means of recurrence plots,2007,André Bergner and Maria Carmen Romano and Jürgen Kurths and Marco Thiel,,,,177-191,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,We present a method for synchronization analysis. that is able to handle large networks of interacting dynamical units. We focus on large networks with different topologies (random. small-world and scale-free) and neuronal dynamics at each node. We consider neurons that exhibit dynamics on two time scales. namely spiking and bursting behavior. The proposed method is able to distinguish between synchronization of spikes and synchronization of bursts. so that we analyze the synchronization of each time scale separately. We find for all network topologies that the synchronization of the bursts sets in for smaller coupling strengths than the synchronization of the spikes. Furthermore. we obtain an interesting behavior for the synchronization of the spikes dependent on the coupling strength: for small values of the coupling. the synchronization of the spikes increases. but for intermediate values of the …,True,ET76bLcAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-73159-7_6,16801285819734185611,/scholar?cites=16801285819734185611,,,,0,0,0

1285004,Synchronization in complex systems with multiple time scales,2011,André Bergner,,,,,,In the present work synchronization phenomena in complex dynamical systems exhibiting multiple time scales have been analyzed. Multiple time scales can be active in different manners. Three different systems have been analyzed with different methods from data analysis.The first system studied is a large heterogenous network of bursting neurons. that is a system with two predominant time scales. the fast firing of action potentials (spikes) and the burst of repetitive spikes followed by a quiescent phase. This system has been integrated numerically and analyzed with methods based on recurrence in phase space. An interesting result are the different transitions to synchrony found in the two distinct time scales. Moreover. an anomalous synchronization effect can be observed in the fast time scale. ie there is range of the coupling strength where desynchronization occurs.,True,ET76bLcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/5153,,,,,https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/files/5153/bergner_diss.pdf,0,0,0
1285005,Linear Filters and Wavelet Analysis–lecture script–,2008,André Bergner,,,,,,Filter are a fundamental tool in data analysis. They are not used to give a specific result. such as. eg. the fractal dimension. but rather for preprocessing the data to clean it from certain undesired structures. which might distort the results of following algorithms. A typical example of a filter is noise reduction or limiting the signal to a certain frequency bandwidth. In this chapter we give an basic introduction to linear filter theory. A general approach of filtering is computing the Fourier transform. In Fourier space a signal is represented by fundamental frequencies (sinusoids). where each frequency has an amplitude and a phase. The filtering process is then simply a multiplication of the Fourier transform with some function. which characterizes the filter. and which thus alters the frequency spectrum as desired. Typically one chooses filters of one of the following categories: lowpass filters. which reduce all frequencies above …,True,ET76bLcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12750553608608419377&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

Current commercially-available RPSs. the most commonly used humanoid robots worldwide. are substantially limited in their usability and fidelity due to the fact that they lack one of the most important clinical interaction and diagnostic tools: an expressive face. Using autonomous facial synthesis techniques. we synthesized pain both on a humanoid robot and comparable virtual avatar. We conducted an experiment with 51 clinicians and 51 laypersons (n = 102). to explore differences in pain perception across the two groups. and also to explore the effects of embodiment (robot or avatar) on pain perception.

Workshop",,,,As technology advances. autonomous robots are becoming more prominent in our daily lives. and they will be expected to effectively work with groups of humans. In order to be effective teammates. robots need to be able to understand human team dynamics as humans do. This understanding will help robots to recognize. anticipate. and adapt to human motion. There exist many group interaction scenarios where the activities performed by the group members are not only synchronous. but also change their tempo over time. During these interactions. humans employ temporal adaptation and anticipation to coordinate with one another in a team. The goal of our work is to leverage these mechanisms to enable robots to better coordinate with human teams. with a particular eye toward understanding rhythm. We are developing methods for robots to better understand tempo changing behavior in teams. so that the robots can leverage this knowledge to coordinate with group members. This work will enable robots to recognize. anticipate. and adapt to human groups. and will help enable others in the robotics community to build more fluent and adaptable robots in the future.,True,TWwHq5kAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,12,http://people.csail.mit.edu/cdarpino/RSS2016WorkshopHRcolla/abstracts/RSS16WS_12_TempoAdaptationAnticipationMethods.pdf,9389818953521195652,/scholar?cites=9389818953521195652,,,http://people.csail.mit.edu/cdarpino/RSS2016WorkshopHRcolla/abstracts/RSS16WS_12_TempoAdaptationAnticipationMethods.pdf,0,0,0

Despite the large body of literature on synthesizing facial expressions for synthetic faces. there is no general solution that is platform-independent. Subsequently. one cannot readily apply custom software created for a specific robot to other platforms.

Existing prediction methods mainly exploit the historical exercising records of students. where each exercise is usually represented as the manually labeled knowledge concepts. and the richer information contained in the text description of exercises is still underexplored. In this paper. we propose a novel Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework for student performance prediction by taking full advantage of both student exercising records and the text of each exercise.

Generally. student performance prediction is achieved by tracing the evolution of each student’s knowledge states via a series of learning activities. Every learning activity record has two types of feature data: student behavior and exercise features.

Plug-in electrical vehicles (PEVs) are introduced to cut the continuing increase in energy use and carbon emission of the urban mobility. However. the increased demand for mobility. and therefore energy. can create constraints on the power network which can reduce the benefits of electrification as a certain and reliable source. Thus. the rise in the use of electric vehicles needs electric grids to be able to feed the increased energy demand while the current infrastructure supports it. In this paper. we introduce a methodological framework for scheduling smart PEVs charging by considering the uncertainties and battery degradation. This framework includes an economic model for charging and discharging of PEVs which has been implemented in a 21-node sample distribution network with a wind turbine as a distributed generation (DG) unit. Our proposed approach indicates that the optimal charging of the PEVs has a high impact on the distribution network operation. particularly under the high market penetration of PEVs. Thus. the smart grid to vehicle (G2V) charging mode is a potential solution to maximize the PEV’s owner profit. while considering the battery degradation cost of the PEVs.

Since multi-label image classification is very complicated. many studies seek to use the attention mechanism as a kind of guidance. Conventional attention-based methods always analyzed images directly and aggressively. which is difficult to well understand complicated scenes. We propose a global/local attention method that can recognize a multi-label image from coarse to fine by mimicking how human-beings observe images. Our global/local attention method first concentrates on the whole image. and then focuses on its local specific objects. We also propose a joint max-margin objective function. which enforces that the minimum score of positive labels should be larger than the maximum score of negative labels horizontally and vertically.

However. the old tasks of the most previous rehearsal-based methods suffer from the unpredictable domain shift when training the new task. This is because these methods always ignore two significant factors. First. the Data Imbalance between the new task and old tasks that makes the domain of old tasks prone to shift. Second. the Task Isolation among all tasks will make the domain shift toward unpredictable directions; To address the unpredictable domain shift. in this paper. we propose Multi-Domain Multi-Task (MDMT) rehearsal to train the old tasks and new task parallelly and equally to break the isolation among tasks. Specifically. a two-level angular margin loss is proposed to encourage the intra-class/task compactness and inter-class/task discrepancy. which keeps the model from domain chaos. In addition. to further address domain shift of the old tasks. we propose an optional episodic distillation loss on the memory to anchor the knowledge for each old task.

The evolving nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings. which are now functions of time. should represent both the static node features and the evolving topological structures. Moreover. node and topological features can be temporal as well. whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate temporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature interactions. For TGAT. we use the self-attention mechanism as building block and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers. the network recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task. and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset.

With advantages in model flexibility. computation complexity and interpretability. self-attention is gradually becoming a key component in event sequence models. However. like most other sequence models. self-attention does not account for the time span between events and thus captures sequential signals rather than temporal patterns. Without relying on recurrent network structures. self-attention recognizes event orderings via positional encoding. To bridge the gap between modelling time-independent and time-dependent event sequence. we introduce a functional feature map that embeds time span into high-dimensional spaces. By constructing the associated translation-invariant time kernel function. we reveal the functional forms of the feature map under classic functional function analysis results. namely Bochner's Theorem and Mercer's Theorem. We propose several models to learn the functional time representation and the interactions with event representation. These methods are evaluated on real-world datasets under various continuous-time event sequence prediction tasks.

In this paper. we provide a principled way to characterize continuous-time systems using deep learning tools. Notably. the proposed approach applies to all the major deep learning architectures and requires little modifications to the implementation. The critical insight is to represent the continuous-time system by composing neural networks with a temporal kernel. where we gain our intuition from the recent advancements in understanding deep learning with Gaussian process and neural tangent kernel. To represent the temporal kernel. we introduce the random feature approach and convert the kernel learning problem to spectral density estimation under reparameterization. We further prove the convergence and consistency results even when the temporal kernel is non-stationary. and the spectral density is misspecified.

In addition to deploying a pre-trained feature extractor. we explore how to make use of an existing acoustic model (AM) trained on the same task with different features as well. Another neural front-end which is only trained together with the supervised ASR loss as well as traditional Gammatone features are applied for comparison. Moreover. it is shown that the AM can be retrofitted with i-vectors for speaker adaptation. Finally. the described features are combined in order to further advance the performance. With the final best system. we obtain a relative improvement of 4% and 6% over our previous best model on the LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets.,True,EbDErF4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04298,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04298,0,0,0

1285070,Forecasting the presence and intensity of hostility on Instagram using linguistic and social features,2018,Ping Liu and Joshua Guberman and Libby Hemphill and Aron Culotta,12,Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media,1,,,Online antisocial behavior. such as cyberbullying. harassment. and trolling. is a widespread problem that threatens free discussion and has negative physical and mental health consequences for victims and communities. While prior work has proposed automated methods to identify hostile comments in online discussions. these methods work retrospectively on comments that have already been posted. making it difficult to intervene before an interaction escalates. In this paper we instead consider the problem of forecasting future hostilities in online discussions. which we decompose into two tasks:(1) given an initial sequence of non-hostile comments in a discussion. predict whether some future comment will contain hostility; and (2) given the first hostile comment in a discussion. predict whether this will lead to an escalation of hostility in subsequent comments. Thus. we aim to forecast both the presence and intensity of hostile comments based on linguistic and social features from earlier comments. To evaluate our approach. we introduce a corpus of over 30K annotated Instagram comments from over 1.100 posts. Our approach is able to predict the appearance of a hostile comment on an Instagram post ten or more hours in the future with an AUC of. 82 (task 1). and can furthermore distinguish between high and low levels of future hostility with an AUC of. 91 (task 2).,True,XBDYtqkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,39,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/15022,8714975197026671274,/scholar?cites=8714975197026671274,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/download/15022/14872,0,0,0

In this paper. we investigate this phenomenon in the context of political news recommendation algorithms. which have important implications for civil discourse.We first collect and curate a collection of over 900K news articles from 41 sources annotated by topic and partisan lean. We then conduct simulation studies to investigate how different algorithmic strategies affect filter bubble formation. Drawing on Pew studies of political typologies. we identify heterogeneous effects based on the user’s pre-existing preferences. For example. we find that i) users with more extreme preferences are shown less diverse content but have higher click-through rates than users with less extreme preferences. ii) content-based and collaborative-filtering recommenders result in markedly different filter bubbles. and iii) when users have divergent views on different topics. recommenders tend to have a homogenization effect.,True,XBDYtqkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,http://cs.tulane.edu/~aculotta/pubs/liu2021filter.pdf,,,,,http://cs.tulane.edu/~aculotta/pubs/liu2021filter.pdf,0,0,0

For example. under cytokine stimulation some cells activate immune signaling pathways while others completely ignore the signal. The underlying sources of cellular variability have been inaccessible due to the destructive nature of experiments. Here we apply deep learning. live-cell analysis. and mechanistic modeling to uncover hidden variables controlling NF-κB activation in single-cells. Our computer-vision algorithm accurately predicts cells that will respond to pro-inflammatory TNF stimulation and shows that single-cell activation is pre-determined by minute amounts of “leaky” nuclear NF-κB localization before stimulation. Theoretical analysis predicts and experiments confirm that the ratio of NF-κB to its inhibitor IκB determines the activation probability of a given cell. Our results demonstrate how computer vision can study living-cells without the use of destructive measurements and settles the question of whether heterogenous NF-κB activation is controlled by pre-existing deterministic variables or purely stochastic ones.,True,XBDYtqkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/687848v1.full,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/687848v1.full,0,0,0

Gully-affected areas detection is the basic work in this region for gully erosion assessment and monitoring. For the first time. an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was applied to extract gully features in this region. Two typical catchments in Changwu and Ansai were selected to represent loess tableland and loess hilly regions. respectively. A high-powered quadrocopter (md4-1000) equipped with a non-metric camera was used for image acquisition. InPho and MapMatrix were applied for semi-automatic workflow including aerial triangulation and model generation. Based on the stereo-imaging and the ground control points. the highly detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) and ortho-mosaics were generated. Subsequently. an object-based approach combined with the random forest classifier was designed to detect gully-affected areas. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the influences of segmentation strategy and feature selection. Results showed that vertical and horizontal root-mean-square errors were below 0.5 and 0.2 m. respectively. which were ideal for the Loess Plateau region. The overall extraction accuracy in Changwu and Ansai achieved was 84.62% and 86.46%. respectively. which indicated the potential of the proposed workflow for extracting gully features. This study demonstrated that UAV can bridge the gap between field measurement and satellite-based remote sensing. obtaining a balance in resolution and efficiency for catchment-scale gully erosion research.

Recording the spatial distribution of terraces is the basis of monitoring their extent and understanding their ecological effects. The current terrace extraction method mainly relies on high-resolution imagery. but its accuracy is limited due to vegetation coverage distorting the features of terraces in imagery. High-resolution topographic data reflecting the morphology of true terrace surfaces are needed. Terraces extraction on the Loess Plateau is challenging because of the complex terrain and diverse vegetation after the implementation of “vegetation recovery”.

1285087,UAV-based terrain modeling under vegetation in the chinese Loess plateau: A deep learning and terrain correction ensemble framework,2020,Jiaming Na and Kaikai Xue and Liyang Xiong and Guoan Tang and Hu Ding and Josef Strobl and Norbert Pfeifer,12,Remote Sensing,20,3318,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Accurate topographic mapping is a critical task for various environmental applications because elevation affects hydrodynamics and vegetation distributions. UAV photogrammetry is popular in terrain modelling because of its lower cost compared to laser scanning. However. this method is restricted in vegetation area with a complex terrain. due to reduced ground visibility and lack of robust and automatic filtering algorithms. To solve this problem. this work proposed an ensemble method of deep learning and terrain correction. First. image matching point cloud was generated by UAV photogrammetry. Second. vegetation points were identified based on U-net deep learning network. After that. ground elevation was corrected by estimating vegetation height to generate the digital terrain model (DTM). Two scenarios. namely. discrete and continuous vegetation areas were considered. The vegetation points in the discrete area were directly removed and then interpolated. and terrain correction was applied for the points in the continuous areas. Case studies were conducted in three different landforms in the loess plateau of China. and accuracy assessment indicated that the overall accuracy of vegetation detection was 95.0%. and the MSE (Mean Square Error) of final DTM (Digital Terrain Model) was 0.024 m.

However. classic rule-based vessel segmentation algorithms need to be hand-crafted and are insufficiently validated. A specialized deep learning method - the U-net - is a promising alternative. Using labeled data from 66 patients with cerebrovascular disease the U-net framework was optimized and evaluated with three metrics: Dice coefficient. 95% Hausdorff distance (95HD) and average Hausdorff distance (AVD). The model performance was compared with the traditional segmentation method of graph-cuts. Training and reconstruction was performed using 2D patches. A full and a reduced architecture with less parameters were trained. We performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The U-net models yielded high performance for both the full and the reduced architecture: A Dice value of ~0.88. a 95HD of ~47 voxels and an AVD of ~0.4 voxels. The visual analysis revealed excellent performance in large vessels and sufficient performance in small vessels. Pathologies like cortical laminar necrosis and a rete mirabile led to limited segmentation performance in few patients. The U-net outperfomed the traditional graph-cuts method (Dice ~0.76 95HD ~59 AVD ~1.97). Our work highly encourages the development of clinically applicable segmentation tools based on deep learning.

1285106,Drowned out by the noise: Evidence for Tracking-free Motion Prediction,2021,Ameni Trabelsi and Ross J Beveridge and Nathaniel Blanchard,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.08368,,,,Autonomous driving consists of a multitude of interacting modules. where each module must contend with errors from the others. Typically. the motion prediction module depends on a robust tracking system to capture each agent's past movement. In this work. we systematically explore the importance of the tracking module for the motion prediction task and ultimately conclude that the tracking module is detrimental to overall motion prediction performance when the module is imperfect (with as low as 1% error). We explicitly compare models that use tracking information to models that do not across multiple scenarios and conditions. We find that the tracking information only improves performance in noise-free conditions. A noise-free tracker is unlikely to remain noise-free in real-world scenarios. and the inevitable noise will subsequently negatively affect performance. We thus argue future work should be mindful of noise when developing and testing motion/tracking modules. or that they should do away with the tracking component entirely.,True,4MT7cUsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08368,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08368,0,0,0

1285108,Machine learning for omics data analysis.,2018,Ameni Trabelsi,,,,,,In proteomics and metabolomics. to quantify the changes of abundance levels of biomolecules in a biological system. multiple sample analysis steps are involved. The steps include mass spectrum deconvolution and peak list alignment. Each analysis step introduces a certain degree of technical variation in the abundance levels (ie peak areas) of those molecules. Some analysis steps introduce technical variations that affect the peak areas of all molecules equally while others affect the peak areas of a subset of molecules with varying degrees. To correct these technical variations. some existing normalization methods simply scale the peak areas of all molecules detected in one sample using a single normalization factor or fit a regression model based on different assumptions. As a result. the local technical variations are ignored and may even be amplified in some cases. To overcome the above limitations. we developed a molecule specific normalization algorithm. called MSN. which adopts a robust surface fitting strategy to minimize the molecular profile difference of a group of house-keeping molecules across samples. The house-keeping molecules are those molecules whose abundance levels were not affected by the biological treatment. We also developed an outlier detection algorithm based on Fisher Criterion to detect and remove noisy data points from the experimental data. The applications of the MSN method on two different datasets showed that MSN is a highly efficient normalization algorithm that yields the highest sensitivity and accuracy compared to five existing normalization algorithms.

However. accurate estimation of the pose in a wide range is a challenging computer vision problem. We present an accurate approach for head pose estimation on consumer depth cameras that works in a wide pose range without prior knowledge about the tracked person and without prior training of a detector. Our algorithm builds and registers a 3D head model with the iterative closest point algorithm. To track the head pose using this head model an initialization with a known pose is necessary. Instead of providing such an initialization manually we determine the initial pose using features of the head and improve this pose over time.

Current control systems implement a hard switch. disabling the automation all at once. However. studies show that the driver’s ability to take over depends on his last activity. We therefore propose a system that uses camera based observation of the driver to assess the situation and to predict transition times. We combine this with a control system that uses a cooperative shared control method to support the driver in takeover situations and allows him to adjust safely to the current situation. We present our first steps towards this goal and show both how the behavior of the driver in the interior can be assessed and how a cooperative control transfer can be implemented.

As different sensors suffer from their individual limitations. combining multiple sources has strong potential to improve the results. A number of deep architectures have been proposed to recognize gestures from eg both color and depth data. However. these models conventionally comprise separate networks for each modality. which are then combined in the final layer (eg via simple score averaging). In this work. we take a closer look at different fusion strategies for gesture recognition especially focusing on the information exchange in the intermediate layers. We compare three fusion strategies on the widely used C3D architecture: 1) late fusion. combining the streams in the final layer; 2) information exchange in an intermediate layer using an additional convolution layer; and 3) linking information at multiple layers simultaneously using the cross-stitch units. originally designed for multi-task learning.

Although speech recognition performance on literary Finnish is already quite good. those systems have very poor baseline performance in conversational speech. Text data for relevant vocabulary and language models can be collected from the Internet. but web data is very noisy and most of it is not helpful for learning good models. Finnish language is highly agglutinative. and written phonetically. Even phonetic reductions and sandhi are often written down in informal discussions.

1285154,Finnish Language Speech Recognition for Dental Health Care,2012,Seppo Enarvi,,,,,,A significant portion of the work time of dentists and nursing staff goes to writing reports and notes. This thesis studies how automatic speech recognition could ease the work load. The primary objective was to develop and evaluate an automatic speech recognition system for dental health care that records the status of patient's dentition. as dictated by a dentist. The system accepts a restricted set of spoken commands that identify a tooth or teeth and describe their condition. The status of the teeth is stored in a database. In addition to dentition status dictation. it was surveyed how well automatic speech recognition would be suited for dictating patient treatment reports. Instead of typing reports with a keyboard. a dentist could dictate them to speech recognition software that automatically transcribes them into text. The vocabulary and grammar in such a system is. in principle. unlimited. This makes it significantly harder to obtain an accurate transcription. The status commands and the report dictation language model are Finnish. Aalto University has developed an unlimited vocabulary speech recognizer that is particularly well suited for Finnish free speech recognition. but it has previously been used mainly for research purposes. In this project we experimented with adapting the recognizer to grammar-based dictation. and real end user environments. Nearly perfect recognition accuracy was obtained for dentition status dictation. Letter error rates for the report transcription task varied between 1.3 % and 17 % depending on the speaker. with no obvious explanation for so radical inter-speaker variability.

Aalto University has developed automatic recognition of Finnish speech and achieved very low error rates on clearly spoken standard Finnish. such as news broadcasts. Recognition of natural conversations is much more challenging. The language that is spoken in Finnish conversations also differs in many ways from standard Finnish. and its recognition requires data that has previously been unavailable.   This thesis develops automatic speech recognition for conversational Finnish. starting by collection of training and evaluation data. For language modeling. large amounts of text are collected from the Internet. and filtered to match the colloquial speaking style. An evaluation set is published and used to benchmark the progress in conversational Finnish speech recognition.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the leading method for image denoising. They are traditionally trained on pairs of images. which are often hard to obtain for practical applications. This motivates self-supervised training methods such as Noise2Void (N2V) that operate on single noisy images. Self-supervised methods are. unfortunately. not competitive with models trained on image pairs. Here. we present Probabilistic Noise2Void (PN2V). a method to train CNNs to predict per-pixel intensity distributions. Combining these with a suitable description of the noise. we obtain a complete probabilistic model for the noisy observations and true signal in every pixel.

We study the consensus problem in an asynchronous network with bounded and constant delays on the communication channel between the agents. In many applications. it is important for agents to distributively detect when consensus is reached in finite time which is essential where consensus value is employed for real time use and to conserve energy. This work presents a novel maximum-minimum consensus based distributed protocol where each node detects when it is within a pre-specified margin of the consensus value and stops its computations. Furthermore. the maximum-minimum consensus based distributed protocol is extended to the average consensus problem to achieve distributive finite time stopping criterion for each agent within a pre-specified margin of the average of initial conditions.

1285174,Query expansion for microblog retrieval focusing on an ensemble of features,2019,Abu Nowshed Chy and Md Zia Ullah and Masaki Aono,27,Journal of Information Processing,,61-76,Information Processing Society of Japan,In microblog search. vocabulary mismatch is a persisting problem due to the brevity of tweets and frequent use of unconventional abbreviations. One way of alleviating this problem is to reformulate the query via query expansion. However. finding good expansion terms for a given query is a challenging task. In this paper. we present a query expansion framework. where supervised learning is adopted for selecting expansion terms. Upon retrieving tweets by our proposed topic modeling based query expansion. we utilize the pseudo-relevance feedback and a new temporal relatedness approach to select the candidate tweets. Next. we devise several new features to select the temporally and semantically relevant expansion terms by leveraging the temporal. word embedding. and sentiment association of candidate term and query. Moreover. we also utilize the lexical and twitter specific features to quantify the term relatedness. After supervised feature selection using regularized regression. we estimate the feature importance by applying random forest. Then. we make use of a learning-to-rank (L2R) framework to rank the candidate expansion terms. Results of extensive experiments on TREC Microblog 2011 and 2012 test collections over the Tweets2011 corpus show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline and competitive query expansion methods.,True,jmF_XnQAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,7,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ipsjjip/27/0/27_61/_article/-char/ja/,9634236200829199854,/scholar?cites=9634236200829199854,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ipsjjip/27/0/27_61/_pdf,0,0,0

Large-scale screens involving tens of thousands of images. each containing hundreds of cells described by hundreds of measurements. result in overwhelming amounts of data. Reducing per-cell measurements to the averages across the image(s) for each treatment leads to loss of potentially valuable information on population variability. We present PopulationProfiler—a new software tool that reduces per-cell measurements to population statistics. The software imports measurements from a simple text file. visualizes population distributions in a compact and comprehensive way. and can create gates for subpopulation classes based on control samples. We validate the tool by showing how PopulationProfiler can be used to analyze the effect of drugs that disturb the cell cycle. and compare the results to those obtained with flow cytometry.,True,qLOArhUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151554,8545031907645849653,/scholar?cites=8545031907645849653,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151554,0,0,0

In this paper. we propose the Log-Polar Magnitude feature descriptor—a rotation. scale. and illumination invariant descriptor that achieves comparable performance to SIFT on a large variety of image registration problems but with much shorter feature vectors. The descriptor is based on the Log-Polar Transform followed by a Fourier Transform and selection of the magnitude spectrum components. Selecting different frequency components allows optimizing for image patterns specific for a particular application. In addition. by relying only on coordinates of the found features and (optionally) feature sizes our descriptor is completely detector independent. We propose 48- or 56-long feature vectors that potentially can be shortened even further depending on the application. Shorter feature vectors result in better memory usage and faster matching. This combined with the fact that the descriptor does not require a time-consuming feature orientation estimation (the rotation invariance is achieved solely by using the magnitude spectrum of the Log-Polar Transform) makes it particularly attractive to applications with limited hardware capacity. Evaluation is performed on the standard Oxford dataset and two different microscopy datasets; one with fluorescence and one with transmission electron microscopy images. Our method performs better than SURF and comparable to SIFT on the Oxford dataset. and better than SIFT on both microscopy datasets indicating that it is particularly useful in applications with microscopy …,True,qLOArhUAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,3,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188496,10599778627097629392,/scholar?cites=10599778627097629392,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188496,0,0,0

Thus. our goal is to use the Next Generation Sequencing provided high-throughput miRNA expression and clinical data in an integrated fashion to perform survival analysis in order to identify breast cancer subtype specific miRNAs. and analyze associated genes and transcription factors. We select top 100 miRNAs for each of the four subtypes. based on the value of hazard ratio and p-value. thereafter. identify 44 miRNAs that are related to all four subtypes. which we call as 4-star miRNAs. Moreover. 12. 14. 9 and 15 subtype specific. viz. 1-star miRNAs. are also identified. The resulting miRNAs are validated by using machine learning methods to differentiate tumor cases from controls (for 4-star miRNAs). and subtypes (for 1-star miRNAs). The 4-star miRNAs provide 95% average accuracy. while in case of 1-star miRNAs 81% accuracy is achieved for HER2-Enriched. Differences in expression of miRNAs between cancer stages is also analyzed. and a subset of 8 miRNAs is found. for which expression is increased in stage II relative to stage I. including hsa-miR-10b-5p. which contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Subsequently we prepare regulatory networks in order to identify the interactions among miRNAs. their targeted genes and transcription factors (TFs). that are targeting those miRNAs. In this way. key regulatory circuits are identified. where genes such as TP53. ESR1. BRCA1.

Moreover. the detection of highly divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge despite of its clinical importance. In this situati on. the outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its susceptibility in different epidemic condition around the world clearly suggest that the virus is mutating to create divergent variants and making the task of virus prediction more challenging. On the other hand. despite of novel coronavirus. two more coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS-CoV-1 are already present. Therefore. the use of machine learning technique is highly required at this moment to predict the coronaviruses by considering their divergent genetic functional characteristics. Thus. we are proposing machine learning based coronavirus prediction technique. called COVID-Predictor. where 1000 of RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-1. MERS. SARS-CoV-2 and other virus are used to train a Naıve Bayes classi er so that it can predict any unknown sequence of these viruses. In order to develop the COVID-Predictor. the feature vector is constructed by the motifs of the sequence generated by k-mer and n-gram techniques. The model has been validated using 10 fold cross validation in comparison with other classi cation techniques. The results show the superiority of our predictor by achieving average 97% accuracy on unseen validation set.

During the test. subjects are presented with slides that include both novel images and images that were seen before (repeated images). Slides are presented sequentially and the number of slides between the first and second presentations of repeated images is varied to mask the purpose of the test. The normalised average glance duration (N-AGD) on repeated images (the bias towards novelty) was used to measure novelty preference. Data from 10 young controls showed that the bias towards novelty is reduced as the number of slides between the first and second presentations of repeated images is increased. A group of 17 patients with AD showed no significant bias towards novelty while a group of 21 age matched controls do exhibit such bias (t (20)= 6.16. p< 0.001).

Misdiagnosing BD as MDD is relatively common and the introduction of markers to improve diagnostic accuracy early in the course of the illness has been identified as one of the top unmet needs in the field. In this paper. we present novel methods to differentiate between BD and MDD patients. The methods use deep learning techniques to quantify differences between visual scanning patterns of BD and MDD patients. In the methods. visual scanning patterns that are described by ordered sequences of fixations on emotional faces are encoded into a lower dimensional space and are fed into a long-short term memory recurrent neural network (RNN). Fixation sequences are encoded by three different methods: 1) using semantic regions of interests (RoIs) that are manually defined by experts. 2) using semi-automatically defined grids of RoIs. or 3) using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract visual features from saliency maps. Using data from 47 patients with MDD and 26 patients with BD we showed that using semantic RoIs. the RNN improved the performance of a baseline classifier from an AUC of 0.603 to an AUC of 0.878. Similarly using grid RoIs. the RNN improved the performance of a baseline classifier from an AUC of 0.450 to an AUC of 0.828.

Being one type of a critical infrastructure. embankment dams in the US require significant investment to upgrade the deteriorated parts. Due to limited budgets. understanding the behavior of structures over time through risk assessment is essential to prioritize dams. During the risk assessment for embankment dams. engineers utilize current and historical data from the design. construction. and operation phases of these structures. The challenge is that during risk assessment. various engineers from different disciplines (e.g.. geotechnical. hydraulics) come together. and how they would like to visualize the available datasets changes based on the discipline-specific analyses they need to perform. The objective of this research study is to understand the discipline-specific visualization needs of engineers from US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) who are involved in risk assessment of embankment dams when they deal with large set of data accumulated since the inception of dams. The requirements were identified through a three-phased research approach including interviews with engineers who are regularly involved in risk assessment processes. a card game and review of standards and published work on risk assessment of embankment dams.

While various methods have been proposed for solving these including adversarial discriminator based methods. most approaches have focused on the entire image based domain adaptation. In an image. there would be regions that can be adapted better. for instance. the foreground object may be similar in nature. To obtain such regions. we propose methods that consider the probabilistic certainty estimate of various regions and specific focus on these during classification for adaptation.

1285257,Learning Semantic Sentence Embeddings using Sequential Pair-wise Discriminator,2018,Badri Narayana Patro* and Vinod Kumar Kurmi* and Sandeep Kumar* and Vinay Namboodiri,,COLING 2018 Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics,,2715-2729,,In this paper. we propose a method for obtaining sentence-level embeddings. While the problem of securing word-level embeddings is very well studied. we propose a novel method for obtaining sentence-level embeddings. This is obtained by a simple method in the context of solving the paraphrase generation task. If we use a sequential encoder-decoder model for generating paraphrase. we would like the generated paraphrase to be semantically close to the original sentence. One way to ensure this is by adding constraints for true paraphrase embeddings to be close and unrelated paraphrase candidate sentence embeddings to be far. This is ensured by using a sequential pair-wise discriminator that shares weights with the encoder that is trained with a suitable loss function. Our loss function penalizes paraphrase sentence embedding distances from being too large. This loss is used in combination with a sequential encoder-decoder network. We also validated our method by evaluating the obtained embeddings for a sentiment analysis task. The proposed method results in semantic embeddings and outperforms the state-of-the-art on the paraphrase generation and sentiment analysis task on standard datasets. These results are also shown to be statistically significant.,True,Exo2VNAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,34,https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00807,5697312057826167986,/scholar?cites=5697312057826167986,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.00807,0,0,0

Adversarial learning based techniques have shown their utility towards solving this problem using a discriminator that ensures source and target distributions are close. However. here we suggest that rather than using a point estimate. it would be useful if a distribution based discriminator could be used to bridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using traditional ensemble methods. In contrast. we suggest that a Monte Carlo dropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution based discriminator. Specifically. we propose a curriculum based dropout discriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based distribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the source and target feature representations.

Images can have multiple visual and language cues such as places. captions. and tags. In this paper. we propose a principled deep Bayesian learning framework that combines these cues to produce natural questions. We observe that with the addition of more cues and by minimizing uncertainty in the among cues. the Bayesian network becomes more confident. We propose a Minimizing Uncertainty of Mixture of Cues (MUMC). that minimizes uncertainty present in a mixture of cues experts for generating probabilistic questions. This is a Bayesian framework and the results show a remarkable similarity to natural questions as validated by a human study. We observe that with the addition of more cues and by minimizing uncertainty among the cues. the Bayesian framework becomes more confident. Ablation studies of our model indicate that a subset of cues is inferior at this task and hence the principled fusion of cues is preferred.

However. the availability of actual source samples is not always possible in practical cases. It could be due to memory constraints. privacy concerns. and challenges in sharing data. This practical scenario creates a bottleneck in the domain adaptation problem. This paper addresses this challenging scenario by proposing a domain adaptation technique that does not need any source data. Instead of the source data. we are only provided with a classifier that is trained on the source data. Our proposed approach is based on a generative framework. where the trained classifier is used for generating samples from the source classes. We learn the joint distribution of data by using the energy-based modeling of the trained classifier. At the same time. a new classifier is also adapted for the target domain.

This auxiliary task is trained in addition to the main speech recognition task and its goal is to help improve the results of the main task. In this paper. we investigate this idea further by generating features extracted directly from the audio file containing only the noise. instead of the clean-speech. After demonstrating that an improvement can be obtained through this multi-task learning auxiliary task. we also show that using both noise and clean-speech estimation auxiliary tasks leads to a 4% relative word error rate improvement in comparison to the classic single-task learning on the CHiME4 dataset.,True,f7pqK8AAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-68456-7_15,6023931848204259115,/scholar?cites=6023931848204259115,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gueorgui_Pironkov2/publication/320038201_Noise_and_Speech_Estimation_as_Auxiliary_Tasks_for_Robust_Speech_Recognition/links/59ccb5190f7e9bbfdc400806/Noise-and-Speech-Estimation-as-Auxiliary-Tasks-for-Robust-Speech-Recognition.pdf,0,0,0

Unlike traditional hiring. where workers are hired either as a full time employee or as a contractor. hiring from online marketplaces are done for individual jobs of short duration. As these marketplaces are open for anyone. hiring becomes challenging due to the large number of freelancers applying for a posted job.

Yet. due to its black-box nature. it is inherently difficult to understand which aspects of the input data drive the decisions of the network. There are various real-world scenarios in which humans need to make actionable decisions based on the output DNNs. Such decision support systems can be found in critical domains. such as legislation. law enforcement. etc. It is important that the humans making high-level decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by combinations of data features that are appropriate in the context of the deployment of the decision support system and that the decisions made are legally or ethically defensible. Due to the incredible pace at which DNN technology is being developed. the development of new methods and studies on explaining the decision-making process of DNNs has blossomed into an active research field.

1285330,Visual Entailment: A Novel Task for Fine-Grained Image Understanding,2019,Ning Xie and Lai Farley and Derek Doran and Asim Kadav,,,,,,Existing visual reasoning datasets such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). often suffer from biases conditioned on the question. image or answer distributions. The recently proposed CLEVR dataset addresses these limitations and requires fine-grained reasoning but the dataset is synthetic and consists of similar objects and sentence structures across the dataset.In this paper. we introduce a new inference task. Visual Entailment (VE)-consisting of image-sentence pairs whereby a premise is defined by an image. rather than a natural language sentence as in traditional Textual Entailment tasks. The goal of a trained VE model is to predict whether the image semantically entails the text. To realize this task. we build a dataset SNLI-VE based on the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus and Flickr30k dataset. We evaluate various existing VQA baselines and build a model called Explainable Visual Entailment (EVE) system to address the VE task. EVE achieves up to 71% accuracy and outperforms several other state-of-the-art VQA based models. Finally. we demonstrate the explainability of EVE through cross-modal attention visualizations.

Reasoning. ie. the drawing of logical inferences from knowledge expressed in such standards. is traditionally based on logical deductive methods and algorithms which can be proven to be sound and complete and terminating. ie correct in a very strong sense. For various reasons. though. in particular. the scalability issues arising from the ever-increasing amounts of Semantic Web data available and the inability of deductive algorithms to deal with noise in the data. it has been argued that alternative means of reasoning should be investigated which bear high promise for high scalability and better robustness. From this perspective. deductive algorithms can be considered the gold standard regarding correctness against which alternative methods need to be tested. In this paper. we show that it is possible to train a Deep Learning system on RDF knowledge graphs. such that it is able to perform reasoning over new RDF knowledge graphs. with high precision and recall compared to the deductive gold standard.,True,Gtqv820AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,10,https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04132,13449304042004574805,/scholar?cites=13449304042004574805,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04132,0,0,0

The methods hypothesize that the recognition of these concepts are instrumental in the decision a CNN reaches. but the nature of this relationship has not been well explored. To address this gap. this paper examines the quality of a concept's recognition by a CNN and the degree to which the recognitions are associated with CNN decisions. The study considers a CNN trained for scene recognition over the ADE20k dataset. It uses a novel approach to find and score the strength of minimally distributed representations of input concepts (defined by objects in scene images) across late stage feature maps. Subsequent analysis finds evidence that concept recognition impacts decision making.

1285335,Contextual Grounding of Natural Language Entities in Images,2019,Farley Lai and Ning Xie and Derek Doran and Asim Kadav,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.02133,,,,In this paper. we introduce a contextual grounding approach that captures the context in corresponding text entities and image regions to improve the grounding accuracy. Specifically. the proposed architecture accepts pre-trained text token embeddings and image object features from an off-the-shelf object detector as input. Additional encoding to capture the positional and spatial information can be added to enhance the feature quality. There are separate text and image branches facilitating respective architectural refinements for different modalities. The text branch is pre-trained on a large-scale masked language modeling task while the image branch is trained from scratch. Next. the model learns the contextual representations of the text tokens and image objects through layers of high-order interaction respectively. The final grounding head ranks the correspondence between the textual and visual representations through cross-modal interaction. In the evaluation. we show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy of 71.36% over the Flickr30K Entities dataset.

1285341,Wearable sensors for estimation of parkinsonian tremor severity during free body movements,2019,Murtadha D Hssayeni and Joohi Jimenez-Shahed and Michelle A Burack and Behnaz Ghoraani,19,Sensors,19,4215,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Tremor is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) that reduces the quality of life. Tremor is measured as part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III. However. the assessment is based on onsite physical examinations and does not fully represent the patients’ tremor experience in their day-to-day life. Our objective in this paper was to develop algorithms that. combined with wearable sensors. can estimate total Parkinsonian tremor as the patients performed a variety of free body movements. We developed two methods: an ensemble model based on gradient tree boosting and a deep learning model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The developed methods were assessed on gyroscope sensor data from 24 PD subjects. Our analysis demonstrated that the method based on gradient tree boosting provided a high correlation (r= 0.96 using held-out testing and r= 0.93 using subject-based. leave-one-out cross-validation) between the estimated and clinically assessed tremor subscores in comparison to the LSTM-based method with a moderate correlation (r= 0.84 using held-out testing and r= 0.77 using subject-based. leave-one-out cross-validation). These results indicate that our approach holds great promise in providing a full spectrum of the patients’ tremor from continuous monitoring of the subjects’ movement in their natural environment.

ICH could lead to disability or death if it is not accurately diagnosed and treated in a time-sensitive procedure. The current clinical protocol to diagnose ICH is examining Computerized Tomography (CT) scans by radiologists to detect ICH and localize its regions. However. this process relies heavily on the availability of an experienced radiologist. In this paper. we designed a study protocol to collect a dataset of 82 CT scans of subjects with a traumatic brain injury. Next. the ICH regions were manually delineated in each slice by a consensus decision of two radiologists. The dataset is publicly available online at the PhysioNet repository for future analysis and comparisons. In addition to publishing the dataset. which is the main purpose of this manuscript. we implemented a deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). known as U-Net. to segment the ICH regions from the CT scans in a fully-automated manner.

However. because of the temporal and spatial variability in motor fluctuations. a single clinical examination often fails to capture the spectrum of motor impairment experienced in routine daily life. In this study. we developed an algorithm to estimate the degree of motor fluctuation severity from two wearable sensors’ data during subjects’ free body movements. Specifically. we developed a new hybrid feature extraction method to represent the longitudinal changes of motor function from the sensor data. Next. we developed a classification model based on random forest to learn the changes in the patterns of the sensor data as the severity of the motor function changes. We evaluated our algorithm using data from 24 subjects with idiopathic PD as they performed a variety of daily routine activities. A leave-one-subject-out assessment of the algorithm resulted in 83.33% accuracy. indicating that our approach holds a great promise to passively detect degree of motor fluctuation severity from continuous monitoring of an individual’s free body movements. Such a sensor-based assessment system and algorithm combination could provide the objective and comprehensive information about the fluctuation severity that can be used by the treating physician to effectively adjust therapy for PD patients with troublesome motor fluctuation.

ON state with maximum benefit from medication and OFF state with no benefit from medication). In order to address these motor fluctuations. the patients go through periodic clinical examination where the treating physician reviews the patients' self-report about duration in different medication states and optimize therapy accordingly. Unfortunately. the patients' self-report can be unreliable and suffer from recall bias. There is a need to a technology-based system that can provide objective measures about the duration in different medication states that can be used by the treating physician to successfully adjust the therapy. In this paper. we developed a medication state detection algorithm to detect medication states using two wearable motion sensors. A series of significant features are extracted from the motion data and used in a classifier that is based on a support vector machine with fuzzy labeling. The developed algorithm is evaluated using a dataset with 19 PD subjects and a total duration of 1.052.24 minutes (17.54 hours).

One of the major obstacles hindering the ubiquitous use of CNNs for inference is their relatively high memory bandwidth requirements. which can be a main energy consumer and throughput bottleneck in hardware accelerators. Accordingly. an efficient feature map compression method can result in substantial performance gains. Inspired by quantization-aware training approaches. we propose a compression-aware training (CAT) method that involves training the model in a way that allows better compression of feature maps during inference. Our method trains the model to achieve low-entropy feature maps. which enables efficient compression at inference time using classical transform coding methods.

The task of achieving high accuracy on resource-restricted devices. however. is still considered to be challenging. which is mainly due to the vast number of design parameters that need to be balanced. While the quantization of CNN parameters leads to a reduction of power and area. it can also generate unexpected changes in the balance between communication and computation. This change is hard to evaluate. and the lack of balance may lead to lower utilization of either memory bandwidth or computational resources. thereby reducing performance. This paper introduces a hardware performance analysis framework for identifying bottlenecks in the early stages of CNN hardware design. We demonstrate how the proposed method can help in evaluating different architecture alternatives of resource-restricted CNN accelerators (eg. part of real-time embedded systems) early in design stages and. thus. prevent making design mistakes.

However. CNNs are typically very demanding computationally at inference time. One of the ways to alleviate this burden on certain hardware platforms is quantization relying on the use of low-precision arithmetic representation for the weights and the activations. Another popular method is the pruning of the number of filters in each layer. While mainstream deep learning methods train the neural networks weights while keeping the network architecture fixed. the emerging neural architecture search (NAS) techniques make the latter also amenable to training. In this paper. we formulate optimal arithmetic bit length allocation and neural network pruning as a NAS problem. searching for the configurations satisfying a computational complexity budget while maximizing the accuracy. We use a differentiable search method based on the continuous relaxation of the search space proposed by Liu et al.(arXiv: 1806.09055). We show. by grid search. that heterogeneous quantized networks suffer from a high variance which renders the benefit of the search questionable. For pruning. improvement over homogeneous cases is possible. but it is still challenging to find those configurations with the proposed method.

In this paper. we show that GNNs are vulnerable to the extremely limited scenario of a single-node adversarial example. where the node cannot be picked by the attacker. That is. an attacker can force the GNN to classify any target node to a chosen label by only slightly perturbing another single arbitrary node in the graph. even when not being able to pick that specific attacker node. When the adversary is allowed to pick a specific attacker node. the attack is even more effective. We show that this attack is effective across various GNN types. such as GraphSAGE. GCN.

Current methods of defense from such attacks are based on either implicit or explicit regularization. eg. adversarial training. Randomized smoothing. the averaging of the classifier outputs over a random distribution centered in the sample. has been shown to guarantee the performance of a classifier subject to bounded perturbations of the input. In this work. we study the application of randomized smoothing as a way to improve performance on unperturbed data as well as to increase robustness to adversarial attacks. The proposed technique can be applied on top of any existing adversarial defense. but works particularly well with the randomized approaches. We examine its performance on common white-box (PGD) and black-box (transfer and NAttack) attacks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. substantially outperforming previous art for most scenarios and comparable on others. For example. we achieve 60.4% accuracy under a PGD attack on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-20. outperforming previous art by 11.7%.

Existing methods typically merge all reviews of a given user (item) into a long document. and then process user and item documents in the same manner. In practice. however. these two sets of reviews are notably different: users' reviews reflect a variety of items that they have bought and are hence very heterogeneous in their topics. while an item's reviews pertain only to that single item and are thus topically homogeneous. In this work. we develop a novel neural network model that properly accounts for this important difference by means of asymmetric attentive modules. The user module learns to attend to only those signals that are relevant with respect to the target item. whereas the item module learns to extract the most salient contents with regard to properties of the item.

Most existing architectures are painstakingly customized to learn task relationships for different problems. which is not flexible enough to model the dynamic task relationships and lacks generalization abilities to novel test-time scenarios.

MT-RMN consists of a shared encoder and multiple task-specific decoders. and recurrently operates over time. For better flexibility. it modularizes the encoder into multiple layers of sub-networks and dynamically controls the connection between these subnetworks and the decoders at different time steps. which provides the recurrent networks with varying degrees of parameter sharing for tasks with dynamic relatedness.

Although supervised learning algorithms have advanced considerably in recent years. in many settings it remains more practical to apply an unsupervised technique. The latter are oftentimes based on sentiment lexicons. However. existing sentiment lexicons reflect an abstract notion of polarity and do not do justice to the substantial differences of word polarities between different domains. In this work. we draw on a collection of domain-specific data to induce a set of 24 domain-specific sentiment lexicons. We rely on initial linear models to induce initial word intensity scores. and then train new deep models based on word vector representations to overcome the scarcity of the original seed data.

In this paper. we address the above question by developing an electroencephalography (EEG) driven VR cybersickness prediction model. The EEG data has been widely utilized to learn the cognitive representation of brain activity. In the first stage. to fully exploit the advantages of the EEG data. it is transformed into the multi-channel spectrogram which enables to account for the correlation of spectral and temporal coefficient. Then. a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to encode the cognitive representation of the EEG spectrogram. In the second stage. we train a cybersickness prediction model on the VR video sequence by designing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Here. the encoded cognitive representation is transferred to the model to train the visual and cognitive features for cybersickness prediction. Through the proposed framework. it is possible to predict the cybersickness level that reflects brain activity automatically. We use 8-channels EEG data to record brain activity while more than 200 subjects experience 44 different VR contents.

1285386,Graphx-convolution for point cloud deformation in 2d-to-3d conversion,2019,Anh-Duc Nguyen and Seonghwa Choi and Woojae Kim and Sanghoon Lee,,,,8628-8637,,In this paper. we present a novel deep method to reconstruct a point cloud of an object from a single still image. Prior arts in the field struggle to reconstruct an accurate and scalable 3D model due to either the inefficient and expensive 3D representations. the dependency between the output and number of model parameters or the lack of a suitable computing operation. We propose to overcome these by deforming a random point cloud to the object shape through two steps: feature blending and deformation. In the first step. the global and point-specific shape features extracted from a 2D object image are blended with the encoded feature of a randomly generated point cloud. and then this mixture is sent to the deformation step to produce the final representative point set of the object.

However. the perception of distortion depends nonlinearly on the distortion type. Here we propose a novel FR-IQA framework that dynamically generates receptive fields responsive to distortion type. Our proposed method-  dynamic receptive field generation based image quality assessor  (DRF-IQA)-separates the process of FR-IQA into two streams: 1) dynamic error representation and 2) visual sensitivity-based quality pooling. The first stream generates dynamic receptive fields on the input distorted image. implemented by a trained convolutional neural network (CNN). then the generated receptive field profiles are convolved with the distorted and reference images. and differenced to produce spatial error maps.

One of the major unsolved problems is to identify image content which can not be reliably recognized with a given inference engine. We therefore study approaches to recover a dense outlier map alongside the primary task with a single forward pass. by relying on shared convolutional features. We consider semantic segmentation as the primary task and perform extensive validation on WildDash val (inliers). LSUN val (outliers). and pasted objects from Pascal VOC 2007 (outliers). We achieve the best validation performance by training to discriminate inliers from pasted ImageNet-1k content. even though ImageNet-1k contains many road-driving pixels. and. at least nominally. fails to account for the full diversity of the visual world.

We present a method to anticipate semantic segmentation of future frames in driving scenarios based on feature-to-feature forecasting. Our method is based on a semantic segmentation model without lateral connections within the upsampling path. Such design ensures that the forecasting addresses only the most abstract features on a very coarse resolution. We further propose to express feature-to-feature forecasting with deformable convolutions. This increases the modelling power due to being able to represent different motion patterns within a single feature map. Experiments show that our models with deformable convolutions outperform their regular and dilated counterparts while minimally increasing the number of parameters.

However. high capacity implies high computational complexity and therefore hinders real-time operation. We therefore study compact architectures which aim at high accuracy in spite of modest capacity. We propose a novel semantic segmentation approach based on shared pyramidal representation and fusion of heterogeneous features along the upsampling path. The proposed pyramidal fusion approach is especially effective for dense inference in images with large scale variance due to strong regularization effects induced by feature sharing across the resolution pyramid.

Several previous works approach this problem by F2F (feature-to-feature) forecasting where future features are regressed from observed features. Different from previous work. we consider a novel F2M (feature-to-motion) formulation. which performs the forecast by warping observed features according to regressed feature flow. This formulation models a causal relationship between the past and the future. and regularizes inference by reducing dimensionality of the forecasting target. However. emergence of future scenery which was not visible in observed frames can not be explained by warping. We propose to address this issue by complementing F2M forecasting with the classic F2F approach. We realize this idea as a multi-head F2MF model built atop shared features. Experiments show that the F2M head prevails in static parts of the scene while the F2F head kicks-in to fill-in the novel regions.

Consequently. the problem of detecting outlier images has recently been receiving a lot of attention. Unlike most previous work. we address this problem in the dense prediction context in order to be able to locate outlier objects in front of in-distribution background. Our approach is based on two reasonable assumptions. First. we assume that the inlier dataset is related to some narrow application field (eg~ road driving). Second. we assume that there exists a general-purpose dataset which is much more diverse than the inlier dataset (eg~ ImageNet-1k). We consider pixels from the general-purpose dataset as noisy negative training samples since most (but not all) of them are outliers. We encourage the model to recognize borders between known and unknown by pasting jittered negative patches over inlier training images. Our experiments target two dense open-set recognition benchmarks (WildDash 1 and Fishyscapes) and one dense open-set recognition dataset (StreetHazard).

Hence. training on all available datasets appears as a feasible approach towards accurate semantic segmentation models with graceful degradation in unusual scenes. Unfortunately. different datasets often use incompatible labels. For instance. the Cityscapes road class subsumes all pixels on driving surfaces. while Vistas defines separate classes for road markings. zebra crossings etc. Such inconsistencies pose a major obstacle towards successful multi-domain learning. We address this challenge by proposing a principled technique for learning with incompatible labeling policies. Different than recent related work. our technique allows seamless training on datasets with overlapping classes. Consequently. it can learn visual concepts which are not represented as a separate class in any of the individual datasets.

The robustness of these models. however. has not yet been studied. In this paper. we propose a sparse feature-space adversarial attack method against deep saliency models for the first time. The proposed attack only requires a part of the model information. and is able to generate a sparser and more insidious adversarial perturbation. compared to traditional image-space attacks. These adversarial perturbations are so subtle that a human observer cannot notice their presences. but the model outputs will be revolutionized. This phenomenon raises security threats to deep saliency models in practical applications. We also explore some intriguing properties of the feature-space attack. eg 1) the hidden layers with bigger receptive fields generate sparser perturbations. 2) the deeper hidden layers achieve higher attack success rates. and 3) different loss functions and different attacked layers will result in diverse perturbations. Experiments indicate that the proposed method is able to successfully attack different model architectures across various image scenes.,True,6Dt6XHgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01231,11573810235989223997,/scholar?cites=11573810235989223997,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01231,0,0,0

While a large number of bokeh images can be found in our albums. the impacts of bokeh on visual saliency has not been studied yet. Our study shows that traditional saliency models do not perform well on bokeh images in that the foreground/background cannot be efficiently differentiated. Therefore. in this paper we propose a hierarchical saliency model for bokeh images through combining local sharpness measure and foreground saliency detection. More specifically. first we use local sharpness feature as a clue to locate the foreground objects in bokeh image so as to get the first level saliency map. Then we compute the second level saliency map from the blurry background using a robust saliency model.

However. these learned features are hard to identify and interpret from a human vision perspective. causing a lack of understanding of the CNNs internal working mechanism. To improve the CNN interpretability. the CNN visualization is well utilized as a qualitative analysis method. which translates the internal features into visually perceptible patterns.

However. compared to extensive research in new designs of various adversarial attacks and defenses. the neural networks' intrinsic robustness property is still lack of thorough investigation. This work aims to qualitatively interpret the adversarial attack and defense mechanism through loss visualization. and establish a quantitative metric to evaluate the neural network model's intrinsic robustness. The proposed robustness metric identifies the upper bound of a model's prediction divergence in the given domain and thus indicates whether the model can maintain a stable prediction. With extensive experiments. our metric demonstrates several advantages over conventional adversarial testing accuracy based robustness estimation:(1) it provides a uniformed evaluation to models with different structures and parameter scales;(2) it over-performs conventional accuracy based robustness estimation and provides a more reliable evaluation that is invariant to different test settings;(3) it can be fast generated without considerable testing cost.,True,FUzqFNAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,14,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04270,501021385494901244,/scholar?cites=501021385494901244,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04270,0,0,0

1285453,Automated Vision-Based Detection of Cracks on Concrete Surfaces Using a Deep Learning Technique,2018,Byunghyun Kim and Soojin Cho,18,Sensors,10,3452,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,At present. a number of computer vision-based crack detection techniques have been developed to efficiently inspect and manage a large number of structures. However. these techniques have not replaced visual inspection. as they have been developed under near-ideal conditions and not in an on-site environment. This article proposes an automated detection technique for crack morphology on concrete surface under an on-site environment based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A well-known CNN. AlexNet is trained for crack detection with images scraped from the Internet. The training set is divided into five classes involving cracks. intact surfaces. two types of similar patterns of cracks. and plants. A comparative study evaluates the successfulness of the detailed surface categorization. A probability map is developed using a softmax layer value to add robustness to sliding window detection and a parametric study was carried out to determine its threshold. The applicability of the proposed method is evaluated on images taken from the field and real-time video frames taken using an unmanned aerial vehicle. The evaluation results confirm the high adoptability of the proposed method for crack inspection in an on-site environment.

Efflorescence can cause concrete degradation in the long term; therefore. it must be accurately assessed by proper inspection. Currently. the assessment is performed on the basis of visual inspection or image-based inspection. which may result in the subjective assessment by the inspectors.

In this study. a novel method using a hyperspectral camera is proposed for objective and accurate assessment of concrete efflorescence. The hyperspectral camera acquires the light intensity for a number of continuous spectral bands of light for each pixel in an image. which makes the hyperspectral imaging technique provides more detailed information than a color camera that collects intensity for only three bands corresponding to RGB (red. green. and blue) colors. A stepwise assessment algorithm is proposed based on the spectral features to decompose efflorescence area from the inspected concrete area.

When inspecting a bridge. the image obtained from the UAV was degraded by various interference factors such as vibration. wind. and motion of UAV. Image quality degradation such as blur. noise. and low-resolution is a major obstacle in utilizing bridge inspection technology based on UAV. In particular. in the field of bridge inspection where damages must be accurately and quickly detected based on data obtained from UAV. these quality issues weaken the advantage of using UAVs by requiring re-take of images through re-flighting. Therefore. in this study. image quality assessment (IQA) based on local blur map (LBM) and image quality enhancement (IQE) using the variational Dirichlet (VD) kernel estimation were proposed as a solution to address the quality issues. First. image data was collected by setting different camera parameters for each bridge member. Second. a blur map was generated through discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and a new quality metric to measure the degree of blurriness was proposed. Third. for low-quality images with a large degree of blurriness. the blind kernel estimation and blind image deconvolution were performed to enhance the quality of images. In the validation tests. the proposed quality metric was applied to material image sets of bridge pier and deck taken from UAV. and its results were compared with those of other quality metrics based on singular value decomposition (SVD). sum of gray-intensity variance (SGV) and …,True,0XwDyrIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://koasas.kaist.ac.kr/handle/10203/281603,,,,,,0,0,0

This paper proposes a technique for the automated detection of multiple concrete damage based on a state-of-the-art deep learning framework. Mask R-CNN. developed for instance segmentation. The structure of Mask R-CNN. which consists of three stages (region proposal. classification. and segmentation) is optimized for multiple concrete damage detection. The optimized Mask R-CNN is trained with 765 concrete images including cracks. efflorescence. rebar exposure. and spalling. The performance of the trained Mask R-CNN is evaluated with 25 actual test images containing damage as well as environmental objects. Two types of metrics are proposed to measure localization and segmentation performance. On average. 90.41% precision and 90.81% recall are achieved for localization and 87.24% precision and 87.58% recall for segmentation. which indicates the excellent field applicability of the trained Mask R-CNN. This paper also qualitatively discusses the test results by explaining that the architecture of Mask R-CNN that is optimized for general object detection purposes. can be modified to detect long and slender shapes of cracks. rebar exposure. and efflorescence in further research.

However. because implementing these identical fields of view is difficult in practical applications. in this paper. we propose a HSR method that is applicable when an HSI and a target RGB image have different spatial information. The proposed HSR method first creates a low-resolution RGB image from a given HSI. Next. a histogram matching is performed on a high-resolution RGB image and a low-resolution RGB image obtained from an HSI. Finally. the proposed method optimizes endmember abundance of the high-resolution HSI towards the histogram-matched high-resolution RGB image. The entire procedure is evaluated using an open HSI dataset. the Harvard dataset. by adding spatial mismatch to the dataset. The spatial mismatch is implemented by shear transformation and cutting off the upper and left sides of the target RGB image. The proposed method achieved a lower error rate across the entire dataset. confirming its capability for super-resolution using images that have different fields of view.

The performance of BERT on SQuAD dataset shows that the accuracy of BERT can be better than human users. However. it does not mean that computers can surpass the human being in reading comprehension. CommonsenseQA is a large-scale dataset which is designed based on commonsense knowledge. BERT only achieved an accuracy of 55.9% on it. The result shows that computers cannot apply commonsense knowledge like human beings to answer questions. Comprehension Ability Test (CAT) divided the reading comprehension ability at four levels. We can achieve human like comprehension ability level by level. BERT has performed well at level 1 which does not require common knowledge. In this research. we propose a system which aims to allow computers to read articles and answer related questions with commonsense knowledge like a human being for CAT level 2. This system consists of three parts. Firstly. we built a commonsense knowledge graph; and then automatically constructed the commonsense knowledge question dataset according to it. Finally. BERT is combined with the commonsense knowledge to achieve the reading comprehension ability at CAT level 2.

As compared to using Shortest Path routing. on the GÉANT network. 2DP-NF can save around 20% energy by switching off links only with negligible effects on path delays and link utilization. even for MLU below 30%. Furthermore. 2DP-NF can obtain 39.7% power savings by switching off both …,True,4zVnuksAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6883901/,10147881817324795242,/scholar?cites=10147881817324795242,,,https://espace.curtin.edu.au/bitstream/handle/20.500.11937/11161/226587_226587.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0
1285472,On the effects of energy-aware traffic engineering on routing reliability,2013,Gongqi Lin and Sieteng Soh and Mihai Lazarescu and Kwan-Wu Chin,,,,69-74,IEEE,Current network infrastructures are over-provisioned to increase their resilience against resource failures. e.g.. bundled links and nodes. as well as congestion during peak hours. However such strategies waste resources as well as exhibit poor energy efficiency at off-peak periods. To this end. several energy-aware routing algorithms have been proposed to maximally switch off redundant network resource at low traffic load to minimize energy usage. These routing solutions. however. do not consider network reliability as critical back-off links/nodes maybe switched off. Henceforth. we aim to quantify the effects of five recently proposed green routing approaches. namely FGH. GreenTE. MSPF. SSPF. and TLDP. on the following two reliability measures: (i) 2-terminal reliability (ii) path reliability.

1285473,Connectivity in social networks,2015,Sieteng Soh and Gongqi Lin and Subhash Kak,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03377,,,,The value of a social network is generally determined by its size and the connectivity of its nodes. But since some of the nodes may be fake ones and others that are dormant. the question of validating the node counts by statistical tests becomes important. In this paper we propose the use of the Benford's distribution to check on the trustworthiness of the connectivity statistics. Our experiments using statistics of both symmetric and asymmetric networks show that when the accumulation processes are random. the convergence to Benford's law is significantly better. and therefore this fact can be used to distinguish between processes which are randomly generated and those with internal dependencies.,True,4zVnuksAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03377,11622271959803828689,/scholar?cites=11622271959803828689,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03377,0,0,0

While recent advanced methods on interactive segmentation focus on the region-based paradigm. more traditional boundary-based methods such as Intelligent Scissor are still popular in practice as they allow users to have active control of the object boundaries. Existing methods for boundary-based segmentation solely rely on low-level image features. such as edges for boundary extraction. which limits their ability to adapt to high-level image content and user intention. In this paper. we introduce an interaction-aware method for boundary-based image segmentation. Instead of relying on pre-defined low-level image features. our method adaptively predicts object boundaries according to image content and user interactions. Therein. we develop a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network that takes both the image and user interactions (eg clicks on boundary points) as input and predicts semantically meaningful boundaries that match user intentions.

Recently. deep neural network methods have shown to be favorable for this problem when compared to traditional methods. However. these new methods do not consider dynamic content in input images. They train neural networks with only image pairs that can be perfectly aligned using homographies. This paper investigates and discusses how to design and train a deep neural network that handles dynamic scenes. We first collect a large video dataset with dynamic content. We then develop a multi-scale neural network and show that when properly trained using our new dataset. this neural network can already handle dynamic scenes to some extent. To estimate a homography of a dynamic scene in a more principled way. we need to identify the dynamic content. Since dynamic content detection and homography estimation are two tightly coupled tasks. we follow the multi-task learning principles and augment our multi-scale network such that it jointly estimates the dynamics masks and homographies.

Our method uses a projector-camera system that scans an environment and evaluates the quality of the environment surface for visual projection in two steps. Our method first excludes non-planar or highly-textured surface through epipolar geometry analysis and texture analysis. For a surface that passes the first test. our method further evaluates its quality for visual projection by quickly projecting the sampled projection content onto the surface and measuring the quality of the projected visual content.

Heidelberg,The low-power techniques are essential part of VLSI design due to continuing increase in clock frequency and complexity of chip. The synchronous circuit operates at highest clock frequency. These circuits drive a large load because it has to reach many sequential elements throughout the chip. Thus. clock signals have been a great source of power dissipation because of high frequency and load. Since. clock signals are used for synchronization. they does not carry any information and certainly doesn’t perform any computation. Therefore. disabling the clock signal in inactive portions of the circuit is a useful approach for power dissipation reduction. So. by using clock gating we can save power by reducing unnecessary clock activities inside the gated module. In this chapter. we will review some of the techniques available for clock gating.

The problem of associating semantic labels to utterances can be treated as a sequence labeling problem. In this work. we build a hierarchical recurrent neural network using bidirectional LSTM as a base unit and the conditional random field (CRF) as the top layer to classify each utterance into its corresponding dialogue act. The hierarchical network learns representations at multiple levels. ie. word level. utterance level. and conversation level. The conversation level representations are input to the CRF layer. which takes into account not only all previous utterances but also their dialogue acts. thus modeling the dependency among both. labels and utterances. an important consideration of natural dialogue. We validate our approach on two different benchmark data sets. Switchboard and Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act. and show performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods by 2.2% and 4.1% absolute points. respectively.

Subjectivity Extraction. ie.. extracting the relevant subjective portions of the text that cover the overall sentiment expressed in the document. is an important step. Subjectivity Extraction. however. is a hard problem for systems. as it demands a great deal of world knowledge and reasoning. Humans. on the other hand. are good at extracting relevant subjective summaries from an opinionated document (say. a movie review). while inferring the sentiment expressed in it. This capability is manifested in their eye-movement behavior while reading: words pertaining to the subjective summary of the text attract a lot more attention in the form of gaze-fixations and/or saccadic patterns. We propose a multi-task deep neural framework for document level sentiment analysis that learns to predict the overall sentiment expressed in the given input document. by simultaneously learning to predict human gaze behavior and auxiliary linguistic tasks like part-of-speech and syntactic properties of words in the document. For this. a multi-task learning algorithm based on multi-layer shared LSTM augmented with task specific classifiers is proposed. With this composite multi-task network. we obtain performance competitive with or better than state-of-the-art approaches in SA. Moreover. the availability of gaze predictions as an auxiliary output helps interpret the system better; for instance. gaze predictions reveal that the system indeed performs subjectivity extraction better. which accounts for improvement in document level sentiment analysis performance.,True,4PG3B2EAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,14,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/12068,17451896795357644763,/scholar?cites=17451896795357644763,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/12068/11927,0,0,0

Unfortunately. microarray experiments can generate data sets with multiple missing values. which significantly affect the performance of subsequent statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. Numerous imputation algorithms have been proposed to estimate the missing values. However. most of these algorithms fail to take into account the fact that gene expressions are continuous time series. and deal with gene expression profiles in terms of discrete data. In this paper. we present a new approach. FDVSplineImpute. for time series gene expression analysis that permits the estimation of missing observations using B-splines of similar genes from fuzzy difference vectors. We have used smoothing splines to relax the fit of the splines so that they are less prone to over fitting the data.

1285532,Leveraging multiple tasks to regularize fine-grained classification,2016,Riddhiman Dasgupta and Anoop M Namboodiri,,,,3476-3481,IEEE,Fine-grained classification is an extremely challenging problem in computer vision. compounded by subtle differences in shape. pose. illumination and appearance. While convolutional neural networks have become the versatile jack-of-all-trades tool in modern computer vision. approaches for fine-grained recognition still rely on localization of keypoints and parts to learn discriminative features for recognition. In order to achieve this. most approaches use a localization module and subsequently learn classifiers for the inferred locations. thus necessitating large amounts of manual annotations for bounding boxes and keypoints. In order to tackle this problem. we aim to leverage the (taxonomic and/or semantic) relationships present among fine-grained classes.

The type of manipulation. a"" bear raid."" would have been prevented by a regulation that was repealed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2007. The regulation. the uptick rule. was designed to prevent manipulation and promote stability and was in force from 1938 as a key part of the government response to the 1929 market crash and its aftermath. On November 1. 2007. Citigroup experienced an unusual increase in trading volume and decrease in price. Our analysis of financial industry data shows that this decline coincided with an anomalous increase in borrowed shares. the selling of which would be a large fraction of the total trading volume. The selling of borrowed shares cannot be explained by news events as there is no corresponding increase in selling by share owners. A similar number of shares were returned on a single day six days later. The magnitude and coincidence of borrowing and returning of shares is evidence of a concerted effort to drive down Citigroup's stock price and achieve a profit. ie. a bear raid.

By virtue of the fact that the rationals are dense. the taxonomy can be used to approximate aperiodic orbits with periodic orbits. This may help reduce computational overhead for calculations in gravitational wave astronomy. Our dynamical systems approach enables us to study orbits for both charged and uncharged particles in spite of the fact that charged particle orbits around a charged black hole do not admit a simple one-dimensional effective potential description.

Heidelberg,Complex systems experience dramatic changes in behavior and can undergo transitions from functional to dysfunctional states. An unstable system is prone to dysfunctional collective cascades that result from self-reinforcing behaviors within the system. Because many human and technological civilian and military systems today are complex systems. understanding their susceptibility to collective failure is a critical problem. Understanding vulnerability in complex systems requires an approach that characterizes the coupled behaviors at multiple scales of cascading failures.

1285543,Black box attacks on transformer language models,2019,Vedant Misra,,ICLR 2019 Debugging Machine Learning Models Workshop,,,,Language models based on Transformers have proven remarkably effective at producing human-quality text. While such models enable users to quickly generate coherent long-form passages. they are also prone to leaking information about the individual data records used for training. In this work we first implement a Transformer-based architecture for dialog completion. We next investigate the susceptibility of this model to membership inference attack under varying conditions of data and information availability. We show how to train attack models to infer membership in a Transformer language model target even in a query-limited black box setting.,True,oINjrJEAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,3,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2094662719278136986&hl=en&oi=scholarr,2094662719278136986,/scholar?cites=2094662719278136986,,,,0,0,0
1285544,Regulation of Short Selling: The Uptick Rule and Market Stability,2010,Yaneer Bar-Yam and Dion Harmon and Vedant Misra and Joe Ornstein,,"Report presented at the Securities and Exchange Commission (February 22, 2010)",,,,Following the market crash in 1929-1930. Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1934 with a mandate to regulate short selling of securities to protect investors and the public interest.[1] In 1938. the SEC instated the uptick rule to allow relatively unrestricted short selling in advancing markets while preventing short selling from driving the market down or accelerating a declining market.[2] In 2005. the SEC conducted a pilot study. to investigate the effect of the uptick rule. removing it from 943 stocks of the Russell 3000. Data collected over six months starting in May 2006 were interpreted to mean that the uptick rule had no significant impact on market behavior. and the uptick rule was repealed on July 3. 2007.[3] In 2008-2009 US markets experienced a crisis of similar proportions to the market crash in 1929-1930. Here we show that the original pilot study provides evidence predicting a market crash as an outcome of the repeal of the uptick rule.The market crisis has prompted many calls for reinstating the uptick rule. Beginning in April 2009. the SEC has announced two comment periods on short-selling regulations.[4. 5] the last of which ended on September 21. 2009. The purpose of these comment periods is to consider whether to reinstate the uptick rule. and whether alternatives to the uptick rule should be implemented instead. These include the original uptick rule. an upbid rule. or these rules only implemented after large market drops. ie as “circuit breakers.” Here we provide a method for analysis of the impact of alternative rules. We show that the upbid rule weakens the uptick rule by a small but quantifiable …,True,oINjrJEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.514.2527&rep=rep1&type=pdf,4830025352877806611,/scholar?cites=4830025352877806611,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.514.2527&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Le type spécifique de manipulation. dénommé «le raid baissier» aurait été empêché par une règle que l'autorité du Marché. la Commission sur la Sécurité et les échanges [le «SEC»] a annulé au mois de juillet 2007. Cette règle. dite «clôture à la hausse»[«the uptick rule»] avait été formulée afin d’empêcher la manipulation des marchés et promouvoir la stabilité et a été appliquée comme une partie intégrante de la riposte du gouvernement au krach de 1928 et ses suites depuis 1938. Le 1er novembre 2007. il y a eu une hausse exceptionnelle du volume accompagnée de la chute du prix des titres de Citigroup. Notre analyse des données dont dispose l'industrie financière démontre que cette baisse correspondait à une augmentation hors norme de titres prêtées dont la vente aura fourni la plus grande portion du volume des transactions. La vente de titres empruntées ne peut s' expliquer dans le cadre de l’événementiel puisqu'il n'y a pas eu d'augmentation de ventes chez les porteurs. Une quantité similaire de titres ont été rendus lors d'une seule journée six jours plus tard. L'ordre de grandeur et la coordination entre l'emprunt et le retour des titres fournit la preuve d'un effort concerté de forcer la baisse du prix du titre de Citigroup et d'en tirer un profit. ie: un raid baissier Les interprétations et analyses des marchés financiers doivent prendre en considération la possibilité que les interventions d'acteurs individuels ou de groupes coordonnés peuvent faire fléchir les marchés.

The proposed technique is based on a simple startup test using a standard V/F inverter. The recorded startup currents are compared to that obtained by simulation of an induction motor model. A Modified PSO optimization is used to find out the best model parameter that minimizes the sum square error between the measured and the simulated currents. The performance of the modified PSO is compared with other optimization methods including line search. conventional PSO and genetic algorithms.

In the proposed clubs-based particle swarm optimization (C-PSO) algorithm. each particle initially joins a default number of what we call 'clubs'. Each particle is affected by its own experience and the experience of the best performing member of the clubs it is a member of. Clubs membership is dynamic. where the worst performing particles socialize more by joining more clubs to learn from other particles and the best performing particles are made to socialize less by leaving clubs to reduce their strong influence on other members. Particles return gradually to default membership level when they stop showing extreme performance. Inertia weights of swarm members are made random within a predefined range.

A recent addition to these techniques are the Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques which. in most cases. are nature or biologically inspired techniques. Different CI techniques found their way to many control engineering applications. including system identification. and the results obtained by many researchers were encouraging. However. most control engineers and researchers used the basic CI models as is or slightly modified them to match their needs. Henceforth. the merits of one model over the other was not clear. and full potential of these models was not exploited.In this research. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods. which are different CI techniques. are modified to best suit the multimodal problem of system identification. In the first case of GA. an extension to the basic algorithm. which is inspired from nature as well. was deployed by introducing redundant genetic material. This extension. which come in handy in living organisms. did not result in significant performance improvement to the basic algorithm. In the second case. the Clubs-based PSO (C-PSO) dynamic neighborhood structure was introduced to replace the basic static structure used in canonical PSO algorithms. This modification of the neighborhood structure resulted in significant performance of the algorithm regarding convergence speed. and equipped it with a tool to handle multimodal problems.,True,dMtX7ToAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7096,4739583465479363258,/scholar?cites=4739583465479363258,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.7096,0,0,0

Although the utility of self-supervised algorithms has improved recently. there are still bottlenecks hindering their widespread use. such as the compute needed. In this paper. we propose a module that serves as an additional objective in the self-supervised contrastive learning paradigm. We show how the inclusion of this module to regress the parameters of an affine transformation or homography. in addition to the original contrastive objective. improves both performance and learning speed. Importantly. we ensure that this module does not enforce invariance to the various components of the affine transform. as this is not always ideal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional objective on two recent. popular self-supervised algorithms. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of the proposed method and show an improvement in performance for all considered datasets. Further. we find that although both the general homography and affine transformation are sufficient to improve performance and convergence. the affine transformation performs better in all cases.,True,QZ_MjosAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04713,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04713,0,0,0
1285568,Confident in the Crowd: Bayesian Inference to Improve Data Labelling in Crowdsourcing,2020,Pierce Burke and Richard Klein,,,,1-6,IEEE,With the increased interest in machine learning and big data problems. the need for large amounts of labelled data has also grown. However. it is often infeasible to get experts to label all of this data. which leads many practitioners to crowdsourcing solutions. In this paper. we present new techniques to improve the quality of the labels while attempting to reduce the cost. The naive approach to assigning labels is to adopt a majority vote method. however. in the context of data labelling. this is not always ideal as data labellers are not equally reliable. One might. instead. give higher priority to certain labellers through some kind of weighted vote based on past performance. This paper investigates the use of more sophisticated methods. such as Bayesian inference. to measure the performance of the labellers as well as the confidence of each label. The methods we propose follow an iterative improvement algorithm …,True,QZ_MjosAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9041099/,,,,,,0,0,0

In this work. however. we aim to show that this is only true for a noiseless system and in general the trend of the model towards wide areas in the landscape reflect the propensity of the model to overfit the training data. Utilizing the objective Bayesian (Jeffreys) prior we instead propose a different determinant of the optimal width within the parameter landscape determined solely by the curvature of the landscape. In doing so we utilize the decomposition of the landscape into the dimensions of principal curvature and find the first principal curvature dimension of the …,True,QZ_MjosAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,0,https://openreview.net/forum?id=HygXkJHtvB,,,,,,0,0,0

While it is well understood that programmers spend lots of time looking for information. with few exceptions. there is a significant lack of data on what information they seek. and why. Modern platforms. like Android. comprise complex APIs that often perplex programmers. We ask: which elements are confusing. and why? Increasingly. when programmers need answers. they turn to StackOverflow. This provides a novel opportunity. There are a vast number of applications for Android devices. which can be readily analyzed. and many traces of interactions on StackOverflow.

Open Source Software (OSS) are the bellwether; they support dynamic teams. with tools for code sharing. communication. and issue tracking. The success of an OSS project is reliant on team communication. E.g.. in issue discussions. individuals rely on rhetoric to argue their position. but also maintain technical relevancy. Rhetoric and technical language are on opposite ends of a language complexity spectrum: the former is stylistically natural; the latter is terse and concise. Issue discussions embody this duality. as developers use rhetoric to describe technical issues. The style mix in any discussion can define group culture and affect performance. e.g.. issue resolution times may be longer if discussion is imprecise.

It is an invaluable resource for software developers; on average. questions posted there get answered in minutes to an hour. Questions about well established topics. e.g.. the coercion operator in C++. or the difference between canonical and class names in Java. get asked often in one form or another. and answered very quickly. On the other hand. questions on previously unseen or niche topics take a while to get a good answer. This is particularly the case with questions about current updates to or the introduction of new application programming interfaces (APIs). In a hyper-competitive online market. getting good answers to current programming questions sooner could increase the chances of an app getting released and used. So. can developers anyhow. e.g.. hasten the speed to good answers to questions about new APIs? Here. we empirically study Stack Overflow questions pertaining to new Android APIs and their associated answers. We contrast the interest in these questions. their answer quality. and timeliness of their answers to questions about old APIs. We find that Stack Overflow answerers in general prioritize with respect to currentness: questions about new APIs do get more answers. but good quality answers take longer. We also find that incentives in terms of question bounties. if used appropriately. can significantly shorten the time and increase answer quality.

The sheer volume of interactions and participants makes it challenging for participants to find relevant tasks. discussions and people. Tagging (e.g.. @AmySmith) is a socio-technical practice that enables more focused discussion. By tagging important and relevant people. discussions can be advanced more effectively. However. for all but a few insiders. it can be difficult to identify important and/or relevant people. In this paper we study tagging in OSS projects from a socio-linguistics perspective. First we argue that textual content per se reveals a great deal about the status and identity of who is speaking and who is being addressed. Next. we suggest that this phenomenon can be usefully modeled using modern deep-learning methods.

While previous works on query relaxation over RDF data have focused on defining new relaxation operators. we investigate in this paper techniques to find the parts of an RDF query that are responsible of its failure. Finding such subqueries. named Minimal Failing Subqueries (MFSs). is of great interest to efficiently perform the relaxation process. We propose two algorithmic approaches for computing MFSs.

The direct consequence of this phenomenon is the need of development of scalable solutions. The database technology was one of these solutions. Several commercial and academic DBMS have been extended with features designed to manage and query these mountains of ontology-based data such as Oracle [1]. IBM Sor [2] or OntoDB [3]. The obtained databases are called ontology-based databases (OBDB). They bring new characteristics that we cannot find in the traditional databases:(i) they store both ontologies and their instances in the same repository.(ii) Several storage layouts are candidates for storing ontologies and data (vertical. horizontal. binary). where each representation has its advantages and limitations.(iii) The DBMS managing this type of database may have three main architectures: systems like Oracle [1]. use the same architecture of traditional databases with two parts: data schema part and the system catalog part. In systems like IBM Sor [2]. the ontology model is separated from its data which gives an architecture with three parts: the ontology model. the data schema and the system catalog. Systems like Ontodb [3] consider an architecture with four parts. where a new part called meta-schema is added as a system catalog for the ontology part.(iv) The ontology referencing OBDB instances may be expressed in various formalisms (RDF.

1285590,A finite difference method for pricing European and American options under a geometric Lévy process,2015,Wen Chen and Song Wang,11,Journal of Industrial & Management Optimization,1,241-264,,In this paper we develop a numerical approach to a fractional-order differential Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) arising in pricing European and American options under a geometric Lévy process. The LCP is first approximated by a nonlinear penalty fractional Black-Scholes (fBS) equation. We then propose a finite difference scheme for the penalty fBS equation. We show that both the continuous and the discretized fBS equations are uniquely solvable and establish the convergence of the numerical solution to the viscosity solution of the penalty fBS equation by proving the consistency. stability and monotonicity of the numerical scheme. We also show that the discretization has the 2nd-order truncation error in both the spatial and time mesh sizes. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and usefulness of the numerical method for pricing both European and American options under the geometric Lévy process.1. Introduction. Pricing financial options has attracted much attention from both mathematicians and financial engineers in the last decade. A financial option is a contract that gives its owner the right. not obligation. to buy (call option) or to sell (put option) a fixed quantity of a stock at a fixed price (strike price) on (European type) or before (American type) a given expiry date. In a complete market. Black & Scholes [2] demonstrated that the price of a European option on a stock. whose price follows geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility. satisfies a second order partial differential equation. known as the Black-Scholes (BS) equation (or model). with proper boundary and terminal conditions.

Technical difficulties and costs associated with ore extraction together with a highly uncertain environment present significant risks for profitability of mineral projects. Optimising operating strategies in response to changing market conditions and information about the available reserves is crucial for project profitability in the face of uncertainty.A natural resource extraction problem can be viewed as a stochastic optimal control (real options) problem. with extraction rate representing a control variable.

1285596,Natural resource extraction with production target: the real option value of variable extraction rate,2016,Wen Chen and Nicolas Langrené and Tanya Tarnopolskaya,,"ROC2016, 20th Real Option Conference",,,,We consider the problem faced by mining companies to set their extraction rate over time in order to meet their production targets. from a real option perspective. As part of their strategic planning. mining companies usually set a production target for a given. short-term to medium-term. time horizon. The extraction rate is constrained by this target. but remains flexible around a certain base rate. Because of the uncertainty in commodity prices. this flexibility has a value. Basically. by slowing down production when prices are low and speeding up production when prices are high. the miner can still meet its production target exactly. while at the same time significantly increase the value of the mine. Mathematically. this resource extraction problem can be described as a multi-regime constrained stochastic control problem. The control is the extraction rate. to be set for every time step. and the constraint is the total extraction volume over the whole time period. We solve this problem numerically using an extension of the simulation-based Least-Squares Monte Carlo algorithm. To deal with the endogenous reserve variable. we use the so-called control randomization technique.The estimated mine value increase would be nothing without the roadmap to achieve this improvement in practice. Fortunately. our numerical solution provides the optimal extraction regime to apply over time. for any commodity price level and any reserve level. We summarize the information about the optimal regime switching surfaces into intuitive graphics that can assist industry for their sequential production decisions under uncertainty in practice.,True,2dZZbK0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,7,http://realoptions.org/openconf2016/data/papers/67.pdf,17245288129563292644,/scholar?cites=17245288129563292644,,,http://realoptions.org/openconf2016/data/papers/67.pdf,0,0,0

Existing urban transit systems suffer many well-known shortcomings. where public transits have limits on coverage areas. and fixed schedules. and private transits are expensive and fail to timely meet the demand needs. We thus envision a Cloud-Commuting system. that employs a giant pool of centralized taxis/shuttles to better cope with the dynamic urban trip demands. To better understand the feasibility of such a system. in this paper we develop generative models to capture fundamental demand arrival and service patterns. and introduce a novel model to estimate the total number of vehicles needed to serve all urban demands.

Recent image-based Deep Learning (DL) techniques are obtaining breakthrough results in these perceptive tasks. However. DL research has not yet advanced much towards processing 3D point clouds from lidar range-finders. These sensors are very common in autonomous vehicles since. despite not providing as semantically rich information as images. their performance is more robust under harsh weather conditions than vision sensors.

As dynamic objects represent higher collision risk than static ones. our own ego-trajectories have to be planned attending to the future states of the moving elements of the scene. Motion can be perceived using temporal information such as optical flow. Conventional optical flow computation is based on camera sensors only. which makes it prone to failure in conditions with low illumination. On the other hand. LiDAR sensors are independent of illumination. as they measure the time-of-flight of their own emitted lasers. In this work we propose a robust and real-time CNN architecture for Moving Object Detection (MOD) under low-light conditions by capturing motion information from both camera and LiDAR sensors.

Yet. most of these systems rely on the semantically rich information of RGB images. Deep Learning solutions applied to the data of other sensors typically mounted on autonomous cars (e.g. lidars or radars) are not explored much. In this paper we propose a novel solution to understand the dynamics of moving vehicles of the scene from only lidar information. The main challenge of this problem stems from the fact that we need to disambiguate the proprio-motion of the “observer” vehicle from that of the external “observed” vehicles. For this purpose. we devise a CNN architecture which at testing time is fed with pairs of consecutive lidar scans.

In this paper. we present a computationally low-cost and robust DATMO system which uses as input only 2D laser rangefinder (LRF) information. Due to its low requirements both in sensor needs and computation. our DATMO algorithm is meant to be used in current Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to improve their reliability for the cargo transportation tasks at port terminals. advancing towards the next generation of fully autonomous transportation vehicles. Our method follows a Detection plus Tracking paradigm. In the detection step we exploit the minimum information of 2D-LRFs by segmenting the elements of the scene in a model-free way and performing a fast object matching to pair segmented elements from two different scans. In this way. we easily recognize dynamic objects and thus reduce consistently by between two and five times the computational burden of the adjacent tracking method. We track the final dynamic objects with an improved Multiple-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT). to which special functions for filtering. confirming. holding. and deleting targets have been included. The full system is evaluated in simulated and real scenarios producing solid results.

Shazzad Hossain and Tarun Kanti Ghosh and Mohiuddin Ahmad,3,American Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering,3-1,27-33,Science Publishing Group,In this work the electrical activity in brain or known as electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is being analyzed to study the various effects of sound on the human brain activity. The effect is in the form of variation in either frequency or in the power of different EEG bands. A biological EEG signal stimulated by Music listening reflects the state of mind. impacts the analytical brain and the subjective-artistic brain. A two channel EEG acquisition unit is being used to extract brain signal with high transfer rate as well as good SNR. This paper focused on three types of brain waves which are theta (4-7 Hz). alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta wave (13-30 Hz). The analysis is carried out using Power Spectral density (PSD). Correlation co-efficient analysis. The outcome of this research depicted that high amplitude Alpha and low amplitude Beta wave and low amplitude Alpha and high amplitude Beta wave is associated with melody and rock music respectively meanwhile theta has no effect. High power of alpha waves and low power of beta waves that obtained during low levels of sound (Melody) indicate that subjects were in relaxed state. When subjects exposed to high level of sound (Rock). beta waves power increased indicating subjects in disturbed state. Meanwhile. the decrease of alpha wave magnitude showed that subjects in tense. Thus the subject’s executional attention level is determined by analyzing the different components of EEG signal.,True,36WXELIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,4,http://article.ajobb.org/pdf/10.11648.j.bio.s.2015030301.15.pdf,15496473561441090202,/scholar?cites=15496473561441090202,,,http://article.ajobb.org/pdf/10.11648.j.bio.s.2015030301.15.pdf,0,0,0

1285653,Learning point embeddings from shape repositories for few-shot segmentation,2019,Gopal Sharma and Evangelos Kalogerakis and Subhransu Maji,,,,67-75,IEEE,User generated 3D shapes in online repositories contain rich information about surfaces. primitives. and their geometric relations. often arranged in a hierarchy. We present a framework for learning representations of 3D shapes that reflect the information present in this meta data and show that it leads to improved generalization for semantic segmentation tasks. Our approach is a point embedding network that generates a vectorial representation of the 3D points such that it reflects the grouping hierarchy and tag data. The main challenge is that the data is noisy and highly variable. To this end. we present a tree-aware metric-learning approach and demonstrate that such learned embeddings offer excellent transfer to semantic segmentation tasks. especially when training data is limited.

We present CSGNET. a deep network architecture that takes as input a 2D or 3D shape and outputs a CSG program that models it. Parsing shapes into CSG programs is desirable as it yields a compact and interpretable generative model. However. the task is challenging since the space of primitives and their combinations can be prohibitively large. CSGNET uses a convolutional encoder and recurrent decoder based on deep networks to map shapes to modeling instructions in a feed-forward manner and is significantly faster than bottom-up approaches.

Heidelberg,A striking feature in most widely used biometric images such as fingerprint and palmprint are certain prominent line structures. These structures are in the form of arches. whorls and loops in fingerprints while line segments are in palmprint. This paper makes use of orthogonal moments. namely Legendre. Pseudo-Zernike and Chebyshev moments. to extract features from this type of biometric images. These moments are widely used as shape descriptors. Bayesian Belief Net (BBN) is used to classify the moment based features. Experimental results reveal that features extracted from these line structure based images with the help of orthogonal moments are found to be very accurate and can be used for individual identification. It also analyzes the performance of the multimodal biometric systems by making feature level fusion of moments from fingerprints and palmprints.,True,BZNqCTUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31576-3_83,,,,,,0,0,0

This algorithm enables autonomous agents to generate individual trajectories independently with only the relative position information of neighboring agents. Each agent applies a force-based control that contains two main terms: 1) collision avoidance and 2) navigational feedback. The first term keeps two agents separate with a certain distance. while the second term attracts each agent toward its goal location. Compared with existing collision-avoidance algorithms. the proposed force-based motion planning (FMP) algorithm can find collision-free motions with lower transition time. free from velocity state information of neighboring agents.

Multi-sensor multi-target tracking in surveillance applications is an example where the network’s success in tracking targets. efficiently and effectively. hinges significantly on the network’s ability to allocate the right set of sensors to the right set of targets so as to achieve optimal performance which minimizes the number of uncovered targets. This task can be even more complicated when both the sensors and the targets are mobile. To ensure timely tracking of mobile targets. the surveillance sensor network needs to perform the following tasks in real-time: (i) target-to-sensor allocation; (ii) sensor mobility control and coordination.

1285684,The impact of the conflict on solving distributed constraint satisfaction problems,2009,Samaneh Hosseini and Kamran Zamanifar,28,Computing and Informatics,5,673,,Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DCSPs) involve a vast number of AI and Multi-Agent problems. Many important efforts have been recently accomplished for solving these kinds of problems using both backtracking-based and mediation-based methods. One of the most successful mediation based algorithms in this field is Asynchronous Partial Overlay (APO) algorithm. By choosing some agents as mediators. APO tries to centralize portions of the distributed problem. and then each mediator tries to solve its centralized sub-problem. This work continues until the whole problem is solved. This paper presents a new strategy to select mediators. The main idea behind this strategy is that the number of mediators conflicts (violated constraints) impacts directly on its performance. Experimental results show that choosing the mediators with the most number of conflicts not only leads to considerable decrease in APO complexity. but also it can decrease the complexity of the other extensions of the APO such as IAPO algorithm. MaxCAPO and MaxCIAPO are two new expansions of APO which introduce this idea and are presented in this article.

Conventional approaches follow a fixed paradigm which first trains a large and redundant network. and then determines which units (eg. channels) are less important and thus can be removed. In this work. we find that pre-training an over-parameterized model is not necessary for obtaining the target pruned structure. In fact. a fully-trained over-parameterized model will reduce the search space for the pruned structure. We empirically show that more diverse pruned structures can be directly pruned from randomly initialized weights. including potential models with better performance. Therefore. we propose a novel network pruning pipeline which allows pruning from scratch with little training overhead. In the experiments for compressing classification models on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. our approach not only greatly reduces the pre-training burden of traditional pruning methods. but also achieves similar or even higher accuracy under the same computation budgets. Our results facilitate the community to rethink the effectiveness of existing techniques used for network pruning.,True,cAz9PToAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,29,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6910,7897413981199760420,/scholar?cites=7897413981199760420,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6910/6764,0,0,0

Theoretically. we prove that a differentially private learning algorithm used for training the GAN does not overfit to a certain degree. ie. the generalization gap can be bounded. Moreover. some recent works. such as the Bayesian GAN. can be re-interpreted based on our theoretical insight from privacy protection. Quantitatively. to evaluate the information leakage of well-trained GAN models. we perform various membership attacks on these models.

However. due to the limited number of labeled pathological images. there are still two challenges to be addressed:(1) overfitting: the performance of a CNN model is undermined by the overfitting due to its huge amounts of parameters and the insufficiency of labeled training data.(2) privacy leakage: the model trained using a conventional method may involuntarily reveal the private information of the patients in the training dataset. The smaller the dataset. the worse the privacy leakage. To tackle the above two challenges. we introduce a novel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) scheme. named patient privacy preserving SGD (P3SGD). which performs the model update of the SGD in the patient level via a large-step update built upon each patient's data. Specifically. to protect privacy and regularize the CNN model. we propose to inject the well-designed noise into the updates. Moreover. we equip our P3SGD with an elaborated strategy to adaptively control the scale of the injected noise. To validate the effectiveness of P3SGD. we perform extensive experiments on a real-world clinical dataset and quantitatively demonstrate the superior ability of P3SGD in reducing the risk of overfitting. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the privacy cost under differential privacy. Additionally. we find that the models trained with P3SGD are resistant to the model-inversion attack compared with those trained using non-private SGD.,True,cAz9PToAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,13,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Wu_P3SGD_Patient_Privacy_Preserving_SGD_for_Regularizing_Deep_CNNs_in_CVPR_2019_paper.html,16441677129864197949,/scholar?cites=16441677129864197949,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wu_P3SGD_Patient_Privacy_Preserving_SGD_for_Regularizing_Deep_CNNs_in_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0

How the brain encodes these units is not well understood. Many neuroimaging studies have found distinct representations of consonant–vowel syllables that shared one phoneme and differed in the other phoneme (e.g. /ba/ and /da/). but it is unclear whether this discrimination ability is due to the neural coding of phonemes or syllables. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with multivariate pattern analysis to explore this question. Subjects listened to nine Mandarin syllables in a consonant–vowel form.

Here. we measure how much extremely activating images help humans to predict CNN activations. Using a well-controlled psychophysical paradigm. we compare the informativeness of synthetic images (Olah et al.. 2017) with a simple baseline visualization. namely exemplary natural images that also strongly activate a specific feature map. Given either synthetic or natural reference images. human participants choose which of two query images leads to strong positive activation. The experiment is designed to maximize participants' performance. and is the first to probe intermediate instead of final layer representations. We find that synthetic images indeed provide helpful information about feature map activations (82% accuracy; chance would be 50%). However. natural images-originally intended to be a baseline-outperform synthetic images by a wide margin (92% accuracy). Additionally. participants are faster and more confident for natural images. whereas subjective impressions about the interpretability of feature visualization are mixed. The higher informativeness of natural images holds across most layers. for both expert and lay participants as well as for hand-and randomly-picked feature visualizations.

We propose to investigate these two problems in a joint CNN-based framework which has been seldom reported in the recent literature. The proposed method is efficient in terms of training time. testing time and storage. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several gait recognition and soft biometrics benchmarks.

1285720,Cross-view gait recognition by discriminative feature learning,2019,Yuqi Zhang and Yongzhen Huang and Shiqi Yu and Liang Wang,29,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,,1001-1015,IEEE,Recently. deep learning-based cross-view gait recognition has become popular owing to the strong capacity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Current deep learning methods often rely on loss functions used widely in the task of face recognition. e.g.. contrastive loss and triplet loss. These loss functions have the problem of hard negative mining. In this paper. a robust. effective. and gait-related loss function. called angle center loss (ACL). is proposed to learn discriminative gait features. The proposed loss function is robust to different local parts and temporal window sizes. Different from center loss which learns a center for each identity. the proposed loss function learns multiple sub-centers for each angle of the same identity. Only the largest distance between the anchor feature and the corresponding cross-view sub-centers is penalized. which achieves better intra-subject compactness.

Note that such 3D optical flow shows robustness and accuracy to dynamic objects and textureless environments. In DeepVIO training. 2D optical flow network is constrained by the projection of its corresponding 3D optical flow. and LSTM-style IMU preintegration network and the fusion network are learned by minimizing the loss functions from ego-motion constraints.

Recently. some local solutions based on matching cost filtering with an edge-preserving filter have been proved to be capable of achieving more accuracy than global approaches. Unfortunately. the computational complexity of these algorithms is quadratically related to the window size used to aggregate the matching costs. The recent trend has been to pursue higher accuracy with greater efficiency in execution. Therefore. this paper proposes a new cost-aggregation module to compute the matching responses for all the image pixels at a set of sampling points generated by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The complexity of this implementation is linear both in the number of image pixels and the number of clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art local methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.

1285741,Pivot Correlational Neural Network for Multimodal Video Categorization,2018,Sunghun Kang and Junyeong Kim and Hyunsoo Choi and Sungjin Kim and Chang D Yoo,,,,386-401,,This paper considers an architecture for multimodal video categorization referred to as Pivot Correlational Neural Network (Pivot CorrNN). The architecture is trained to maximizes the correlation between the hidden states as well as the predictions of the modal-agnostic pivot stream and modal-specific stream in the network. Here. the modal-agnostic pivot hidden state considers all modal inputs without distinction while the modal-specific hidden state is dedicated exclusively to one specific modal input. The Pivot CorrNN consists of three modules:(1) maximizing pivot-correlation module that attempts to maximally correlate the modal-agnostic and a modal-specific hidden-state as well as their predictions.(2) contextual Gated Recurrent Unit (cGRU) module which extends the capability of a generic GRU to take multimodal inputs in updating the pivot hidden-state. and (3) adaptive aggregation module that aggregates all modal-specific predictions as well as the modal-agnostic pivot predictions into one final prediction. We evaluate the Pivot CorrNN on two publicly available large-scale multimodal video categorization datasets. FCVID and YouTube-8M. From the experimental results.

For VMR. several methods that require full supervision for training have been proposed. Unfortunately. acquiring a large number of training videos with labeled temporal boundaries for each query is a labor-intensive process. This paper explores a method for performing VMR in a weakly-supervised manner (wVMR): training is performed without temporal moment labels but only with the text query that describes a segment of the video. Existing methods on wVMR generate multi-scale proposals and apply query-guided attention mechanism to highlight the most relevant proposal. To leverage the weak supervision. contrastive learning is used which predicts higher scores for the correct video-query pairs than for the incorrect pairs.

This paper considers a resizable mini-batch gradient descent (RMGD) algorithm based on a multi-armed bandit for achieving best performance in grid search by selecting an appropriate batch size at each epoch with a probability defined as a function of its previous success/failure. This probability encourages exploration of different batch size and then later exploitation of batch size with history of success. At each epoch. the RMGD samples a batch size from its probability distribution. then uses the selected batch size for mini-batch gradient descent. After obtaining the validation loss at each epoch. the probability distribution is updated to incorporate the effectiveness of the sampled batch size. The RMGD essentially assists the learning process to explore the possible domain of the batch size and exploit successful batch size. Experimental results show that the RMGD achieves performance better than the best performing single batch size. Furthermore. it. obviously. attains this performance in a shorter amount of time than grid search. It is surprising that the RMGD achieves better performance than grid search.,True,gJfozOAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06424,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06424,0,0,0

Overview. and Solutions,2020,Rahul Mishra and Hari Prabhat Gupta and Tanima Dutta,,,,,,Deep Neural Network (DNN) has gained unprecedented performance due to its automated feature extraction capability. This high order performance leads to significant incorporation of DNN models in different Internet of Things (IoT) applications in the past decade. However. the colossal requirement of computation. energy. and storage of DNN models make their deployment prohibitive on resource constraint IoT devices. Therefore. several compression techniques were proposed in recent years for reducing the storage and computation requirements of the DNN model. These techniques on DNN compression have utilized a different perspective for compressing DNN with minimal accuracy compromise. It encourages us to make a comprehensive overview of the DNN compression techniques. In this paper. we present a comprehensive review of existing literature on compressing DNN model that reduces both storage and computation requirements. We divide the existing approaches into five broad categories. ie. network pruning. sparse representation. bits precision. knowledge distillation. and miscellaneous. based upon the mechanism incorporated for compressing the DNN model.

Specifically. we focus on the challenging task of multi-view sclera recognition. where the visible part of the sclera vasculature changes from image to image due to varying gaze (or view) directions. We propose a complete solution for this task built around Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and make several contributions that result in state-of-the-art recognition performance. ie:(i) we develop a cascaded CNN assembly that is able to robustly segment the sclera vasculature from the input images regardless of gaze direction. and (ii) we present ScleraNET. a CNN model trained in a multi-task manner (combining losses pertaining to identity and view-direction recognition) that allows for the extraction of discriminative vasculature descriptors that can be used for identity inference. To evaluate the proposed contributions. we also introduce a new dataset of ocular images. called the Sclera Blood Vessels.

This area has long been dominated by iris recognition research. while other ocular modalities such as the periocular region or the vasculature of the sclera have received significantly less attention in the literature. Consequently. ocular modalities beyond the iris are not well studied and their characteristics are today still not as well understood. While recent needs for more secure authentication schemes have considerably increased the interest in competing ocular modalities. progress in these areas is still held back by the lack of publicly available datasets that would allow for more targeted research into specific ocular characteristics next to the iris.

To minimize recognition error robust segmentation algorithms are required. Among all ocular traits. iris got the most attention due to high recognition accuracy. New modalities such as sclera blood vessels and periocular region were also proposed as autonomous (or iris-complementary) modalities.  In this work we tackle ocular segmentation and recognition problems using deep learning methods. which represent state-of-the-art in many computer vision related tasks. We individually evaluate three recognition pipelines based on different ocular modalities (sclera blood vessels. periocular region. iris). The pipelines are then fused into a single biometric system and its performance is evaluated. The main focus is sclera recognition in the scope of which we i) create a new dataset named SBVPI. ii) propose and evaluate segmentation approaches. which won the first place on SS(ER)BC competitions. and iii) develop and evaluate the rest of the sclera-based recognition pipeline. The next contribution of this work is multi-class eye segmentation technique. which gives promising results. We also propose and evaluate deep learning pipeline for periocular recognition.

A fundamental yet unanswered question is: how CNNs can infer depth from a single image. Toward answering this question. we consider visualization of inference of a CNN by identifying relevant pixels of an input image to depth estimation. We formulate it as an optimization problem of identifying the smallest number of image pixels from which the CNN can estimate a depth map with the minimum difference from the estimate from the entire image. To cope with a difficulty with optimization through a deep CNN. we propose to use another network to predict those relevant image pixels in a forward computation.

1285820,Analysis of deep networks for monocular depth estimation through adversarial attacks with proposal of a defense method,2019,Junjie Hu and Takayuki Okatani,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.08790,,,,In this paper. we consider adversarial attacks against a system of monocular depth estimation (MDE) based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The motivation is two-fold. One is to study the security of MDE systems. which has not been actively considered in the community. The other is to improve our understanding of the computational mechanism of CNNs performing MDE. Toward this end. we apply the method recently proposed for visualization of MDE to defending attacks. It trains another CNN to predict a saliency map from an input image. such that the CNN for MDE continues to accurately estimate the depth map from the image with its non-salient part masked out. We report the following findings. First. unsurprisingly. attacks by IFGSM (or equivalently PGD) succeed in making the CNNs yield inaccurate depth estimates. Second. the attacks can be defended by masking out non-salient pixels. indicating that the attacks function by perturbing mostly non-salient pixels. However. the prediction of saliency maps is itself vulnerable to the attacks. even though it is not the direct target of the attacks. We show that the attacks can be defended by using a saliency map predicted by a CNN trained to be robust to the attacks.

To mitigate these problems. the present study develops a novel end-to-end benchmark model. termed the pyramid pooling module semi-Siamese network (PPM-SSNet). based on a large-scale xBD satellite imagery dataset. The high precision of the proposed model is achieved by adding residual blocks with dilated convolution and squeeze-and-excitation blocks into the network.

Research has shown that bearing faults are the most frequently occurring faults in IMs. The vibration signals carry rich information about bearing health conditions and are commonly utilized for fault diagnosis in bearings. However. collecting these signals is expensive and sometimes impractical because it requires the use of external sensors. The external sensors demand enough space and are difficult to install in inaccessible sites. To overcome these disadvantages. motor current signal-based bearing fault diagnosis methods offer an attractive solution. As such. this paper proposes a hybrid motor-current data-driven approach that utilizes statistical features. genetic algorithm (GA) and machine learning models for bearing fault diagnosis. First. the statistical features are extracted from the motor current signals. Second. the GA is utilized to reduce the number of features and select the most important ones from the feature database. Finally. three different classification algorithms namely KNN. decision tree. and random forest. are trained and tested using these features in order to evaluate the bearing faults. This combination of techniques increases the accuracy and reduces the computational complexity. The experimental results show that the three classifiers achieve an accuracy of more than 97%.

In addition. a fuzzy algorithm is applied to the ARX-Laguerre technique to increase the system’s modeling accuracy. Next. the conventional sliding mode observer is applied to resolve the problems of fault estimation in a complex system with a high degree of uncertainty. such as rotating machinery. To address the problem of chattering that is inherent in the conventional sliding mode observer. the higher-order super-twisting (advanced) technique is introduced in this study. In addition. the fuzzy method is applied to the advanced sliding mode observer to improve the accuracy of fault estimation in uncertain conditions. As a result. the advanced fuzzy sliding mode observer adaptively improves the reliability. robustness. and estimation accuracy of rolling-element bearing fault estimation. Then. the residual signal delivered by the proposed methodology is split in the windows and each window is characterized by a numerical parameter. Finally. a machine learning technique. called a decision tree. adaptively derives the …,True,u63hOVUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,15,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/24/5404,16995649683085716761,/scholar?cites=16995649683085716761,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/24/5404/pdf,0,0,0
1285830,Towards bearing health prognosis using generative adversarial networks: Modeling bearing degradation,2018,Sheraz Ali Khan and Alexander E Prosvirin and Jong-Myon Kim,,,,1-6,IEEE,Condition based maintenance of rotary machines is centered on bearings. as they are the leading source of breakdowns in induction motors used in the industry. The health prognosis of bearings primarily involves the estimation of its remaining useful life (RUL). The accurate modeling of a bearing's degradation is key to correctly estimating its RUL. This paper investigates using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for modeling the degradation behavior of a bearing. GANs are used to estimate generative models. which can be sampled directly to generate the future trajectory of a bearing's health indicator. In the GAN framework. two artificial neural networks. a generator network G and a discriminator network D. engage in a game. where the network G tries to fool the network D by generating samples of data that resemble real data. The training process of GANs finds the Nash equilibrium to this game.

1285831,Rub-impact fault diagnosis using an effective IMF selection technique in ensemble empirical mode decomposition and hybrid feature models,2018,Alexander E Prosvirin and Manjurul Islam and Jaeyoung Kim and Jong-Myon Kim,18,Sensors,7,2040,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The complex nature of rubbing faults makes it difficult to use traditional signal analysis methods for feature extraction. Various time-frequency analysis approaches based on signal decomposition. such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD). have been widely utilized recently to analyze rub-impact faults. However. traditional EMD suffers from “mode-mixing”. and in both EMD and EEMD the relevance of the extracted components to rubbing processes must be determined. In this paper. we introduce a new informative intrinsic mode function (IMF) selection method for EEMD and a hybrid feature model for diagnosing rub-impact faults of various intensities. Our method uses a novel selection procedure that combines the degree-of-presence ratio of rub impact and a Kullback–Leibler divergence-based similarity measure into an IMF quality metric with adaptive threshold-based selection to pick the meaningful signal-dominant modes. Signals reconstructed using the selected IMFs contained explicit information about the rubbing faults and are used for hybrid feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach effectively defines meaningful IMFs for rubbing processes. and the presented hybrid feature model allows for the classification of rub-impact faults of various intensities with good accuracy.

Singapore, Early detection of rolling-element bearings faults is essential. and acoustic emission (AE) signals are actively utilized for monitoring bearing health condition. Most existing methods for fault diagnosis comprise two steps: feature extraction and fault classification. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a powerful deep learning technique that can perform both feature extraction and classification procedures without the need to separate these tasks into different algorithms. However. most of the known CNN architectures are used for image recognition and require a 2-D image as an input parameter. To employ CNN to resolve the problem of rolling-element bearings fault diagnosis. in the present work. the raw 1-D AE signal is transformed into a 2-D kurtogram representation.

One of the most frequently applied signal processing techniques for the analysis of rub-impact faults in rotating machines is ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD).

Uncertain conditions in which a robot manipulator operates. as well as its nonlinearities. represent challenges for fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control (FDC) that are addressed through the proposed FDC technique. A machine-learning-based neural adaptive. high-order. variable structure observer for fault diagnosis (FD) and adaptive. modern. fuzzy. backstepping. variable structure control for use in a fault-tolerant control (FC) algorithm. are proposed in this paper.

The chattering phenomenon associated with the variable structure observer (VSO) is solved using a high-order variable structure observer. Then. the dynamic behavior estimation performance in the high-order variable structure observer is improved by incorporating a neural network algorithm in the FD pipeline. This adaptive technique is also effective in improving the robustness of the fault signal estimation. Moreover. support vector machines (SVMs) that can derive adaptive threshold values are used to categorize faults.

1285836,A Reliable Fault Diagnosis Method for a Gearbox System with Varying Rotational Speeds,2020,Cong Dai Nguyen and Alexander Prosvirin and Jong-Myon Kim,20,Sensors,11,3105,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The vibration signals of gearbox gear fault signatures are informative components that can be used for gearbox fault diagnosis and early fault detection. However. the vibration signals are normally non-linear and non-stationary. and they contain background noise caused by data acquisition systems and the interference of other machine elements. Especially in conditions with varying rotational speeds. the informative components are blended with complex. unwanted components inside the vibration signal. Thus. to use the informative components from a vibration signal for gearbox fault diagnosis. the noise needs to be properly distilled from the informational signal as much as possible before analysis. This paper proposes a novel gearbox fault diagnosis method based on an adaptive noise reducer–based Gaussian reference signal (ANR-GRS) technique that can significantly reduce noise and improve classification from a one-against-one. multiclass support vector machine (OAOMCSVM) for the fault types of a gearbox. The ANR-GRS processes the shaft rotation speed to access and remove noise components in the narrowbands between two consecutive sideband frequencies along the frequency spectrum of a vibration signal. enabling the removal of enormous noise components with minimal distortion to the informative signal. The optimal output signal from the ANR-GRS is then extracted into many signal feature vectors to generate a qualified classification dataset. Finally. the OAOMCSVM classifies the health states of an experimental gearbox using the dataset of extracted features.

Such characteristics are used for early fault detection to guarantee the enhanced safety of complex systems and their cost-effective operation. There exist many fault diagnosis models that have been developed for classifying various fault types in gearboxes. However. the classification results of the conventional fault classification models degrade when they are applied to gearbox systems with multi-level tooth cut gear (MTCG) faults operating under variable shaft speeds. These conditions cause difficulty in discriminating the gear fault types. Due to the improved computational capabilities of modern systems. the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) is getting popular in a variety of research fields. such as image and natural language processing. DNNs are capable of improving the classification results even when addressing complex problems such as diagnosing gearbox MTCG faults. In this research. an adaptive noise control (ANC) and a stacked sparse autoencoder–based deep neural network (SSA-DNN) are used to construct a sensitive fault diagnosis model that can diagnose a gearbox system with MTCG fault types under varying shaft rotation speeds. despite its complicatedness. An ANC is applied to gear vibration characteristics to remove a significant level of noise along the frequency spectrum of vibration signals to fix the most fault-informative components of each fault case.

Yet the effectiveness of dense retrieval (DR) often requires combination with sparse retrieval. In this paper. we identify that the main bottleneck is in the training mechanisms. where the negative instances used in training are not representative of the irrelevant documents in testing. This paper presents Approximate nearest neighbor Negative Contrastive Estimation (ANCE). a training mechanism that constructs negatives from an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index of the corpus. which is parallelly updated with the learning process to select more realistic negative training instances. This fundamentally resolves the discrepancy between the data distribution used in the training and testing of DR. In our experiments. ANCE boosts the BERT-Siamese DR model to outperform all competitive dense and sparse retrieval baselines. It nearly matches the accuracy of sparse-retrieval-and-BERT-reranking using dot-product in the ANCE-learned representation space and provides almost 100x speed-up.,True,NaItBoUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,41,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00808,8917790448070447494,/scholar?cites=8917790448070447494,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00808,0,0,0

In this paper we review some of these research areas and thus propose machine learning techniques to automatically generate an accurate predictive model to predict equipment faults during the wafer fabrication process of the semiconductor industries. This research paper aims at constructing a decision model to help detecting as quickly as possible any equipment faults in order to maintain high process yields in manufacturing.

However. plasma etching is a complex procedure and it is hard to capture all relevant equipment properties and behaviors in a single physical model. Machine learning offers an alternative for predicting upcoming machine failures based on relevant data points. In this paper. we describe three different machine learning tasks that can be used for that purpose: (i) predicting Time-To-Failure (TTF). (ii) predicting health state. and (iii) predicting TTF intervals of an equipment. Our results show that trained machine learning models can outperform benchmarks resembling human judgments in all three tasks.

Its optimization criterion is well fitted for an architecture-selection. ie. it minimizes the regret incurred by a sub-optimal selection of operations. Unlike previous search relaxations. that require hard pruning of architectures. our method is designed to dynamically wipe out inferior architectures and enhance superior ones. It achieves an optimal worst-case regret bound and suggests the use of multiple learning-rates. based on the amount of information carried by the backward gradients.

As some primal methods optimized over a discrete search space. thousands of days of GPU were required for convergence. A recent approach is based on constructing a differentiable search space that enables gradient-based optimization. thus reducing the search time to a few days. While successful. such methods still include some incontinuous steps. eg. the pruning of many weak connections at once. In this paper. we propose a differentiable search space that allows the annealing of architecture weights. while gradually pruning inferior operations. thus the search converges to a single output network in a continuous manner.

In this paper. we introduce a novel asymmetric loss ("" ASL""). that operates differently on positive and negative samples. The loss dynamically down-weights the importance of easy negative samples. causing the optimization process to focus more on the positive samples. and also enables to discard mislabeled negative samples.

Use of end-to-end systems that pipe together text detection and recognition is often awkward because the user cannot influence the detection stage. On the other hand. glossing over the word's regions to help system with text localization requires a manual job and can be unacceptable. This paper proposes a solution that gives visual cues to the user during a detection stage. These hints differ from traditional bounding boxes in two ways. Firstly. the found text is surrounded with polygonal bounding reflecting a possible complex nature of text blocks. Secondly.

Symbolically. a similar level of acceptance is to name a newborn child after the person we like. Tracing the fashion of names. one can learn about emotional reactions to popular personalities in a social scale. Contrary to previous research [2–5]. which dealt with statistical averages. here we are going to concentrate on case studies. Namely. we intend to trace the popularity of names of US presidents in the 20th century and to compare the results with those on the names of selected celebrities. We will show that this specific dataset provides results complementary to standard poll data on approval of politicians [6]. Our main goal is to show that this level of social acceptance of US presidents vanished in the 1960’s. Yet this thesis cannot be maintained if applied to celebrities.The data is taken from the website of the US Social Security Administration [7]. Its discussion comprises the next section. Section 3 presents a quantitative data analysis: an index is proposed. designed to measure the jump in popularity of a given name due to an appearance of a person with this name.

Cham,In this paper. a method of elongated structure detection is presented. In general. this is not a trivial task since standard image segmentation techniques require usually quite complex procedures to incorporate the information about the expected shape of the segments. The presented approach may be an interesting alternative for them. In its first phase. it changes the representation of the image. Instead of a set of pixels. the image is described by a set of ellipses representing fragments of the regions of similar color. This representation is obtained using cross-entropy clustering (CEC) method. The second phase analyses geometrical and spatial relationships between ellipses to select those of them that form an elongated structure within an acceptable range of its width.

1285918,Gas classification using deep convolutional neural networks,2018,Pai Peng and Xiaojin Zhao and Xiaofang Pan and Wenbin Ye,18,Sensors,1,157,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this work. we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) tailored for gas classification. Inspired by the great success of DCNN in the field of computer vision. we designed a DCNN with up to 38 layers. In general. the proposed gas neural network. named GasNet. consists of: six convolutional blocks. each block consist of six layers; a pooling layer; and a fully-connected layer. Together. these various layers make up a powerful deep model for gas classification.

Large receptive fields facilitate the long-term relations among video clips while small receptive fields help capture the local details. Existing methods construct models with hand-designed receptive fields in layers. Can we effectively search for receptive field combinations to replace hand-designed patterns? To answer this question. we propose to find better receptive field combinations through a global-to-local search scheme. Our search scheme exploits both global search to find the coarse combinations and local search to get the refined receptive field combination patterns further. The global search finds possible coarse combinations other than human-designed patterns.

The previous graph neural network (GNN) approaches in few-shot learning have been based on the node-labeling framework. which implicitly models the intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. In contrast. the proposed EGNN learns to predict the edge-labels rather than the node-labels on the graph that enables the evolution of an explicit clustering by iteratively updating the edge-labels with direct exploitation of both intra-cluster similarity and the inter-cluster dissimilarity. It is also well suited for performing on various numbers of classes without retraining. and can be easily extended to perform a transductive inference. The parameters of the EGNN are learned by episodic training with an edge-labeling loss to obtain a well-generalizable model for unseen low-data problem.

Conventional data-driven approaches suffer from the problem of overfitting and result in high rates of false positives. and model-driven approaches suffer from a lack of specific information about complex systems. We overcome these problems by modifying the denoising autoencoder (DA). a data-driven method. to form a new approach. called the structured denoising autoencoder (SDA). which can utilize incomplete prior information. The SDA does not require specific information and can perform well without overfitting. In particular. an empirical analysis with synthetic data revealed that the SDA performs better than the DA even when there is partially incorrect or abstract information. An evaluation using real data from moving cars also showed that the SDA with incomplete knowledge outperformed conventional methods. Surprisingly. the SDA results were better even though the parameters of the conventional methods were tuned using faulty data. which are normally unknown. In addition. the SDA fault analysis was able to extract the true causes of the changes within the faulty data; the other methods were unable to do this. Thus. only our proposed method can explain why the faults occurred.,True,BOCEQSYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,47,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v39/tagawa14.html,15350549033832143991,/scholar?cites=15350549033832143991,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v39/tagawa14.pdf,0,0,0

Despite the prevalence. researchers have rarely tackled this problem. Our framework focuses on the representation and explanation of changes occurring between two datasets. specifically the normal data and data with the observed changes. We employ two-dimensional scatter plots which can provide comprehensive representation without requiring statistical knowledge. This helps a human operator to intuitively understand the change and the cause. An analysis to find two-attribute pairs whose scatter plots well explain the change does not require high computational complexity owing to the novel characteristic function-based approach. Although a hyper-parameter needs to be determined. our analysis introduces a novel appropriate prior distribution to determine the proper hyper-parameter automatically. The experimental results show that our method presents the change and the cause with the same accuracy as that of the state-of-the-art kernel hypothesis testing approaches. while reducing the computational costs by almost 99% at the maximum for all popular benchmark datasets.

Given that data logged by a system include unknown anomalies. anomaly identification models aim to simultaneously identify the time of occurrence and the features that contributed to these anomalies.

For this purpose. they leverage the few extra bytes available for encoding custom metadata in Bitcoin transactions. A sequence of records of the same application can thus be abstracted as a stand-alone subchain inside the Bitcoin blockchain.

The anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. which for a long time have represented some of the most efficient solutions to detect intrusion attempts on a network. have to face this new and more complicated scenario. Well-known problems. such as the difficulty of distinguishing legitimate activities from illegitimate ones due to their similar characteristics and their high degree of heterogeneity. today have become even more complex. considering the increase in the network activity. After providing an extensive overview of the scenario under consideration. this work proposes a Local Feature Engineering (LFE) strategy aimed to face such problems through the adoption of a data preprocessing strategy that reduces the number of possible network event patterns. increasing at the same time their characterization. Unlike the canonical feature engineering approaches. which take into account the entire dataset. it operates locally in the feature space of each single event. The experiments conducted on real-world data showed that this strategy. which is based on the introduction of new features and the discretization of their values. improves the performance of the canonical state-of-the-art solutions.,True,4k_xAbEAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,3,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/12/10/177,17991555661552550412,/scholar?cites=17991555661552550412,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/12/10/177/pdf,0,0,0

In a distributed setting. the various components of an application may be developed and run by untrustworthy parties. which could opportunistically diverge from the expected behaviour when they find it convenient. The use of contracts in this setting is essential: by binding the behaviour of each component to a contract. and by sanctioning contract violations. components are incentivized to behave in a correct and cooperative manner.This chapter is a step-by-step tutorial on programming contract-oriented distributed applications. The glue between components is a middleware which establishes sessions between services with compliant contracts. and monitors sessions to detect and punish violations. Contracts are formalised as timed session types. which describe timed communication protocols between two components at the endpoints of a session.

Second. a relabeling function repairs noisy labels for the retained examples. Each of these components is a model trained on synthetically-noised examples generated from a small manually-labeled set. We investigate this approach on the ultra-fine entity typing task of Choi et al.(2018). Our baseline model is an extension of their model with pre-trained ELMo representations. which already achieves state-of-the-art performance. Adding distant data that has been denoised with our learned models gives further performance gains over this base model. outperforming models trained on raw distant data or heuristically-denoised distant data.,True,Qd-puacAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,17,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01566,6592792730680239240,/scholar?cites=6592792730680239240,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01566,0,0,0
1285984,Fine-Grained Entity Typing for Domain Independent Entity Linking,2020,Yasumasa Onoe and Greg Durrett,,,,,,Neural entity linking models are very powerful. but run the risk of overfitting to the domain they are trained in. For this problem. a “domain” is characterized not just by genre of text but even by factors as specific as the particular distribution of entities. as neural models tend to overfit by memorizing properties of frequent entities in a dataset. We tackle the problem of building robust entity linking models that generalize effectively and do not rely on labeled entity linking data with a specific entity distribution. Rather than predicting entities directly. our approach models fine-grained entity properties. which can help disambiguate between even closely related entities. We derive a large inventory of types (tens of thousands) from Wikipedia categories. and use hyperlinked mentions in Wikipedia to distantly label data and train an entity typing model. At test time. we classify a mention with this typing model and use soft type predictions to link the mention to the most similar candidate entity. We evaluate our entity linking system on the CoNLL-YAGO dataset (Hoffart et al. 2011) and show that our approach outperforms prior domain-independent entity linking systems. We also test our approach in a harder setting derived from the WikilinksNED dataset (Eshel et al. 2017) where all the mention-entity pairs are unseen during test time. Results indicate that our approach generalizes better than a state-of-the-art neural model on the dataset.,True,Qd-puacAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,15,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6380,15759644360213113116,/scholar?cites=15759644360213113116,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/6380/6236,0,0,0
1285985,Interpretable Entity Representations through Large-Scale Typing,2020,Yasumasa Onoe and Greg Durrett,,Findings of EMNLP 2020,,,,In standard methodology for natural language processing. entities in text are typically embedded in dense vector spaces with pre-trained models. Such approaches are strong building blocks for entity-related tasks. but the embeddings they produce require extensive additional processing in neural models. and these entity embeddings are fundamentally difficult to interpret. In this paper. we present an approach to creating interpretable entity representations that are human readable and achieve high performance on entity-related tasks out of the box. Our representations are vectors whose values correspond to posterior probabilities over fine-grained entity types. indicating the confidence of a typing model's decision that the entity belongs to the corresponding type. We obtain these representations using a fine-grained entity typing model. trained either on supervised ultra-fine entity typing data (Choi et al. 2018) or distantly-supervised examples from Wikipedia. On entity probing tasks involving recognizing entity identity. our embeddings achieve competitive performance with ELMo and BERT without using any extra parameters. We also show that it is possible to reduce the size of our type set in a learning-based way for particular domains. Finally. we show that these embeddings can be post-hoc modified through simple rules to incorporate domain knowledge and improve performance.,True,Qd-puacAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00147,15531234217402771157,/scholar?cites=15531234217402771157,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00147,0,0,0
1285986,Modeling Fine-Grained Entity Types with Box Embeddings,2021,Yasumasa Onoe and Michael Boratko and Greg Durrett,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00345,,,,Neural entity typing models typically represent entity types as vectors in a high-dimensional space. but such spaces are not well-suited to modeling these types' complex interdependencies. We study the ability of box embeddings. which represent entity types as d-dimensional hyperrectangles. to represent hierarchies of fine-grained entity type labels even when these relationships are not defined explicitly in the ontology. Our model represents both types and entity mentions as boxes. Each mention and its context are fed into a BERT-based model to embed that mention in our box space; essentially. this model leverages typological clues present in the surface text to hypothesize a type representation for the mention. Soft box containment can then be used to derive probabilities. both the posterior probability of a mention exhibiting a given type and the conditional probability relations between types themselves. We compare our approach with a strong vector-based typing model. and observe state-of-the-art performance on several entity typing benchmarks. In addition to competitive typing performance. our box-based model shows better performance in prediction consistency (predicting a supertype and a subtype together) and confidence (ie. calibration). implying that the box-based model captures the latent type hierarchies better than the vector-based model does.,True,Qd-puacAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00345,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00345,0,0,0

While in the literature. the majority of works deal with shape or texture modality individually. only a few concern their combination.

Since. accurate measurement of eye movements is important in many studies. it is crucial to identify different factors that influence the dynamics of the eye movements measured by an eye tracker.

The oculomotor system is vulnerable to interference at various levels of the system. from high level cognitive control to peripheral neural pathways. Therefore. in this work we examined two forms of oculomotor inhibition and two forms of oculomotor interference at high and low levels of the control system. This study employed a prosaccade. antisaccade. and a recent distractor eye movement task (akin to a spatial negative priming) in order to explore high level cognitive control and the inhibition of a competing distractor. To explore low-level control we examined the frequency of microsaccades and post-saccade oscillations. The findings demonstrated that dyslexics have an impairment of volitional inhibitory control. reflected in the antisaccade task. In contrast. inhibitory control at the location of a competing distractor was equivalent in the dyslexic and non-dyslexic groups. There was no difference in the frequency of microsaccades between the two groups. However. the dyslexic group generated larger microsaccades prior to the target onset in the prosaccade and the antisaccade tasks. The groups did not differ in the frequency or in the morphology of the post-saccade oscillations. These findings reveal that the word reading and attentional difficulties of dyslexic readers cannot be attributed to an impairment in the inhibition of a visual distractor or interference from low-level oculomotor instability.

One of the major drawbacks of such methods is out-of-vocabulary terms. especially when having small training datasets and using a wider vocabulary. This is the case in Intent Classification for chatbots. where typically small datasets are extracted from internet communication. Two problems arise with the use of internet communication. First. such datasets miss a lot of terms in the vocabulary to use word embeddings efficiently …,True,qGFPeY8AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4230122640751696422&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

There is no definite marker for the diagnosis of ALS. Currently. the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on clinical observations of upper and lower motor neuron damage in the absence of other causes. which is timeconsuming. of high cost. and often delayed. Timely diagnosis and assessment for ALS are crucial. Automatic detection of ALS from speech samples would advance the diagnosis of ALS. In this paper. we investigated the automatic detection of ALS from short. pre-symptom speech acoustic and articulatory samples using machine learning approaches (support vector machine and deep neural network). A data set of more than 2.500 speech samples collected from eleven patients with ALS and eleven healthy speakers was used. Leave-subjects-out cross validation experimental results indicate the feasibility of the automatic detection of ALS from speech samples.

In this study. we propose an end-to-end framework. named CogMol (Controlled Generation of Molecules). for designing new drug-like small molecules targeting novel viral proteins with high affinity and off-target selectivity. CogMol combines adaptive pre-training of a molecular SMILES Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and an efficient multi-attribute controlled sampling scheme that uses guidance from attribute predictors trained on latent features. To generate novel and optimal drug-like molecules for unseen viral targets. CogMol leverages a protein-molecule binding affinity predictor that is trained using SMILES VAE embeddings and protein sequence embeddings learned unsupervised from a large corpus.

Hebbian learning mechanism may account for the development of localized hand-centred representations in a hierarchical neural network model of the primate visual system. VisNet. The hand-centered neurons developed in the model use an invariance learning mechanism known as continuous transformation (CT) learning. In contrast to previous theoretical proposals for the development of hand-centered visual representations. CT learning does not need a memory trace of recent neuronal activity to be incorporated in the synaptic learning rule. Instead. CT learning relies solely on a Hebbian learning rule. which is able to exploit the spatial overlap that naturally occurs between successive images of a hand-object configuration as it is shifted across different retinal locations due to saccades. Our simulations show how individual neurons in the network model can learn to respond selectively to target objects in particular locations with respect to the hand. irrespective of where the hand-object configuration occurs on the retina. The response properties of these hand-centred neurons further generalise to localised receptive fields in the hand-centred space when tested on novel hand-object configurations that have not been explored during training. Indeed. even when the network is trained with target …,True,FHL-zfsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178304,17097680664484456520,/scholar?cites=17097680664484456520,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178304,0,0,0

Periodic response to a questionnaire is also obtained. The goal is to determine combinations of modalities that best serve as predictors of task performance.A group of participants performed a computer-based visual search task mimicking postal code sorting. A five-digit number had to be assigned to one of six different non-overlapping numeric ranges. Trials were presented in blocks of progressively increasing task difficulty.

Software developers often need to understand a large amount of existing code before they can develop new features or fix bugs in existing programs. Being able to process programming language code automatically and provide summaries of code functionality accurately can significantly help developers to reduce time spent in code navigation and understanding. and thus increase productivity. Different from natural language articles. source code in programming languages often follows rigid syntactical structures and there can exist dependencies among code elements that are located far away from each other through complex control flows and data flows. Existing studies on tree-based convolutional neural networks (TBCNN) and gated graph neural networks (GGNN) are not able to capture essential semantic dependencies among code elements accurately. In this paper. we propose novel tree-based capsule networks (TreeCaps) and relevant techniques for processing program code in an automated way that encodes code syntactical structures and captures code dependencies more accurately.

In this work. we introduce a neural network based approach to classify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients into four clinical profiles. Starting from their structural connectivity information. obtained by diffusion tensor imaging and represented as a graph. we evaluate the classification performances using unweighted and weighted connectivity matrices. Furthermore. we investigate the role of graph- based features for a better characterization and classification of the pathology. 90 MS patients (12 clinically isolated syndrome. 30 relapsing-remitting. 28 secondary-progressive. and 20 primary- progressive) along with 24 healthy controls. were considered in this study. This work shows the great performances achieved by neural networks methods in the classification of the clinical profiles. Furthermore. it shows local graph metrics do not improve the classification results suggesting that the latent features created by the neural network in its layers have a much important informative content.

Answer Set Programming (ASP) gained some momentum. and has been lately fruitfully employed in many real-world scenarios. Nonetheless. in spite of a large number of success stories in relevant application areas. and even in industrial contexts. deductive reasoning cannot be considered the ultimate. comprehensive solution to AI; indeed. in several contexts. other approaches result to be more useful. Typical Bioinformatics tasks. for instance classification. are currently carried out mostly by Machine Learning (ML) based solutions. In this paper. we focus on the relatively new problem of analyzing the evolution of neurological disorders. In this context. ML approaches already demonstrated to be a viable solution for classification tasks; here. we show how ASP can play a relevant role in the brain evolution simulation task.

Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized data analysis in many areas. including medical imaging. However. there is a bottleneck in the advancement of DL in the surgery field. which can be seen in a shortage of large-scale data. which in turn may be attributed to the lack of a structured and standardized methodology for storing and analyzing surgical images in clinical centres.

In this paper. we show that neither of these components is indispensable. We propose a new framework that utilizes the gradients to revise the sentence in a continuous space during inference to achieve text style transfer. Our method consists of three key components: a variational auto-encoder (VAE). some attribute predictors (one for each attribute). and a content predictor. The VAE and the two types of predictors enable us to perform gradient-based optimization in the continuous space. which is mapped from sentences in a discrete space. to find the representation of a target sentence with the desired attributes and preserved content. Moreover. the proposed method naturally has the ability to simultaneously manipulate multiple fine-grained attributes. such as sentence length and the presence of specific words. when performing text style transfer tasks.

1286064,Multi-Loss Rebalancing Algorithm for Monocular Depth Estimation,2020,Jae-Han Lee and Chang-Su Kim,,,,,,An algorithm to combine multiple loss terms adaptively for training a monocular depth estimator is proposed in this work. We construct a loss function space containing tens of losses. Using more losses can improve inference capability without any additional complexity in the test phase. However. when many losses are used. some of them may be neglected during training. Also. since each loss decreases at a different speed. adaptive weighting is required to balance the contributions of the losses. To address these issues. we propose the loss rebalancing algorithm that initializes and rebalances the weight for each loss function adaptively in the course of training.

As SNPs are highly conserved throughout evolution and within a population. the map of SNPs serves as an excellent genotypic marker. Conventional SNPs analysis mechanisms suffer from large run times. inefficient memory usage. and frequent overestimation. In this paper. we propose efficient. scalable. and reliable algorithms to select a small subset of SNPs from a large set of SNPs which can together be employed to perform phenotypic classification. Our algorithms exploit the techniques of gene selection and random projections to identify a meaningful subset of SNPs. To the best of our knowledge. these techniques have not been employed before in the context of genotype‐phenotype correlations. Random projections are used to project the input data into a lower dimensional space (closely preserving distances). Gene selection is then applied on the projected data to identify a subset of the most relevant SNPs. We have compared the performance of our algorithms with one of the currently known best algorithms called Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR). and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms are superior in terms of accuracy as well as run time. In our proposed techniques. random projection is used to map data from a high dimensional space to a lower dimensional space. and thus overcomes the curse of dimensionality problem.
