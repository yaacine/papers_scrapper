1029893,Global signatures of protein and mRNA expression levels,2009,Raquel de Sousa Abreu and Luiz O Penalva and Edward M Marcotte and Christine Vogel,5,Molecular BioSystems,12,1512-1526,Royal Society of Chemistry,Cellular states are determined by differential expression of the cell’s proteins. The relationship between protein and mRNA expression levels informs about the combined outcomes of translation and protein degradation which are. in addition to transcription and mRNA stability. essential contributors to gene expression regulation. This review summarizes the state of knowledge about large-scale measurements of absolute protein and mRNA expression levels. and the degree of correlation between the two parameters. We summarize the information that can be derived from comparison of protein and mRNA expression levels and discuss how corresponding sequence characteristics suggest modes of regulation.,True,HWw7bF0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1006,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2009/mb/b908315d,3044025718163318061,/scholar?cites=3044025718163318061,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4089977/,0,0,0

Using measurements of absolute protein and mRNA abundances in cellular lysate from the human Daoy medulloblastoma cell line. we quantitatively evaluate the impact of mRNA concentration and sequence features implicated in translation and protein degradation on protein expression.

Msi1 has been shown to affect their translation by binding to short elements located in the 3′-untranslated region. To better understand Msi1 functions. we initially performed an RIP-Chip analysis in HEK293T cells; this method consists of isolation of specific RNA-protein complexes followed by identification of the RNA component via microarrays.

In some populations. FAP onset seems to occur on average 2–11 years earlier in men than in women. and SSA appears to be a disease of elderly men. Most (95–100%) SSA patients described in the literature are men. suggesting that amyloid deposition in these patients may be sex hormone related. On the basis of gender-related differences in FAP onset. and on the almost exclusivity of SSA in elder men. we hypothesize that. sex hormones may increase TTR synthesis by the liver. and therefore. may contribute to amyloid deposition.

However. its mechanism of action has not yet been established comprehensively. To identify its target genes comprehensively and determine the main routes by which it influences glioblastoma phenotypes. we conducted individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. We confirmed that MSI1 has a preference for UAG sequences contained in a particular structural context. especially in 3′ untranslated regions.

Importantly. alterations in the cholinergic system are a key underlying factor in cognitive defects associated with aging. One essential component of cholinergic synaptic transmission is the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT). which regulates the packaging of ACh into synaptic vesicles for extracellular release. Mutations that cause a reduction in either protein level or activity lead to diminished locomotion ability whereas complete loss of function of VAChT is lethal. While much is known about the function of VAChT. the direct role of altered ACh release and its association with either an impairment or an enhancement of cognitive function are still not fully understood.

It also binds retinol binding protein preventing its filtration trough the kidneys and therefore is involved in delivering retinol to target cells. Moreover. TTR sequesters amyloid-beta impairing its deposition in nervous tissues and possibly contributing to its removal. Despite its importance in mammalian physiology. there are few studies regarding the regulation of TTR synthesis. In silico analysis of the 5′ flanking region of the TTR gene allowed the identification of androgen responsive elements suggesting that androgens may regulate TTR expression in tissues where TTR and androgen receptor (AR) are co-expressed.

Recently. we discovered that short peptide nucleic acids (PNA) bind strongly and sequence selectively to a homopurine tract of double-helical RNA via formation of a triple helix. Herein. we tested if the molecular recognition of RNA could be enhanced by α-guanidine modification of PNA. Our study was motivated by the discovery of Ly and co-workers that the guanidine modification greatly enhances the cellular delivery of PNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the guanidine-modified PNA (GPNA) had reduced affinity and sequence selectivity for triple-helical recognition of RNA. The data suggested that in contrast to unmodified PNA. which formed a 1:1 PNA–RNA triple helix.

However. the function of cortactin remains obscure. Here we show that cortactin co-localizes with the Arp2/3 complex. a de novo actin nucleator. at dynamic particulate structures enriched with actin filaments. Cortactin binds directly to the Arp2/3 complex and activates it to promote nucleation of actin filaments. The interaction of cortactin with the Arp2/3 complex occurs at an amino-terminal domain that is rich in acidic amino acids.

The magnitude of the particle formation events was observed to be greatest at the lowest tides with the highest concentrations of ultrafine particles growing to the largest sizes. probably by the condensation of anthropogenically-formed condensable material. At such sizes the particles should be able to act as cloud condensation nuclei at reasonable atmospheric supersaturations.,True,46OlYtQAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,97,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/2975/2010/,1871219794123362695,/scholar?cites=1871219794123362695,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/10/2975/2010/,0,0,0

However. knowledge on the assembly of rhizospheric communities in aged-contaminated industrial soils is still limited. especially with regard to transcriptionally active microbiomes and their link to the quality or quantity of carbon sources. We compared the short-term (2-10 days) dynamics of bacterial communities and potential PAH-degrading bacteria in bare or ryegrass-planted aged-contaminated soil spiked with phenanthrene. put in relation with dissolved organic carbon sources and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution. Both resident and active bacterial communities (analyzed from DNA and RNA. respectively) showed higher species richness and smaller dispersion between replicates in planted soils. Root development strongly favored the activity of Pseudomonadales within the first two days. and of members of Actinobacteria. Caulobacterales. Rhizobiales and Xanthomonadales within 6-10 days. Plants slowed down the dissipation of phenanthrene. while root exudation provided a cocktail of labile substrates that might preferentially fuel microbial growth. Although the abundance of PAH-degrading genes increased in planted soil. their transcription level stayed similar to bare soil.

Microbes play an essential role in the functioning of this ecosystem and are the main drivers of the biogeochemical cycling of elements. Yet. the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in this system remains poorly studied. in particular with regards to changes along environmental gradients. Here. we used amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene tags using primers covering both Bacteria and Archaea to assess the composition and diversity of the microbial communities from four sampling depths (surface. the maximum and minimum of the oxygen concentration. and near the seafloor) at ten oceanographic stations located in Bransfield Strait (northwest of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP)) and near the sea ice edge (north of the AP). Samples collected near the seafloor and at the oxygen minimum exhibited a higher diversity than those from the surface and oxygen maximum for both bacterial and archaeal communities. The main taxonomic groups identified below 100 m were Thaumarchaeota. Euryarchaeota and Proteobacteria (Gamma-. Delta-.

Various approaches used to evaluate O3 effects generally concur that current yield losses range from 5% to 15% among sensitive plants. There is. however. considerable genetic variability in plant responses to O3. To illustrate this. we show that ambient O3 concentrations in the eastern United States cause substantially different levels of damage to otherwise similar snap bean cultivars.

We hypothesized that cattle avoid leafy spurge because it contains 1 or more chemicals that elicit a conditioned flavor aversion when consumed. First. we tested cattle to determine if they reduced their intake of a novel feed on subsequent days if we modestly increased rumen fill by introducing additional feed or additional feed plus an aversive agent (lithium chloride. LiCl) after they had consumed the novel feed. We observed that cattle became averted (P = .0001) to the novel feed only when LiCl was administered with additional feed. Simply increasing rumen fill by a small amount did not cause cattle to reduce their intake of the novel feed the following day. Secondly. we tested cattle to determine if they reduced their intake of a novel feed on subsequent days if we introduced leafy spurge into their rumina following consumption of the novel feed. We also tested cattle to determine if a spurge-induced aversion to a novel feed was preventable by inoculation with rumen microbes from sheep with spurge in their diets. We found that introducing spurge into cattle after their intake of novel feed reduced (P < .01) their intake of the novel feed on subsequent days. Cattle inoculated with rumen microbes from spurge-adapted sheep had similar (P > .40) aversions to a novel feed paired with spurge introductions.

Here we organized discrete glucose oxidase (GOx)/horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme pairs on specific DNA origami tiles with controlled interenzyme spacing and position. The distance between enzymes was systematically varied from 10 to 65 nm. and the corresponding activities were evaluated. The study revealed two different distance-dependent kinetic processes associated with the assembled enzyme pairs. Strongly enhanced activity was observed for those assemblies in which the enzymes were closely spaced. while the activity dropped dramatically for enzymes as little as 20 nm apart. Increasing the spacing further resulted in a much weaker distance dependence.

Here we report a tweezer-like DNA nanodevice to actuate the activity of an enzyme/cofactor pair. A dehydrogenase and NAD+ cofactor are attached to different arms of the DNA tweezer structure and actuation of enzymatic function is achieved by switching the tweezers between open and closed states. The enzyme/cofactor pair is spatially separated in the open state with inhibited enzyme function. whereas in the closed state. enzyme is activated by the close proximity of the two molecules.

Existing protein immobilization approaches. including noncovalent or covalent attachments to solid supports. have difficulties in controlling protein orientation. reducing nonspecific absorption and preventing protein denaturation. New strategies for enzyme immobilization are needed that allow the precise control over orientation and position and thereby provide optimized activity.   Methodology/Principal Findings A method is presented for utilizing peptide ligands to immobilize enzymes on surfaces with improved enzyme activity and stability. The appropriate peptide ligands have been rapidly selected from high-density arrays and when desirable. the peptide sequences were further optimized by single-point variant screening to enhance both the affinity and activity of the bound enzyme. For proof of concept. the peptides that bound to β-galactosidase and optimized its activity were covalently attached to surfaces for the purpose of capturing target enzymes. Compared to conventional methods. enzymes immobilized on peptide-modified surfaces exhibited higher specific activity and stability. as well as controlled protein orientation.

Efficient coupling of substrate transport between enzymes is important for overall pathway activity and also controls the depletion of intermediate molecules that drive the reaction forward. Here. we assembled a three-enzyme pathway on a series of DNA nanoscaffolds to investigate the dependence of their activities on spatial arrangement. Unlike previous studies. the overall activity of the three-enzyme pathway relied less on inter-enzyme distance and more on the geometric patterns that arranged them within a relatively small range of 10–30 nm. Pathway intermediate detection demonstrated that the assembled enzyme systems quickly depleted the intermediate molecules through efficient reaction coupling.Biological systems have evolved complex. multistep. cascade pathways to make molecules and derive energy vital to the metabolism and reproduction of living systems.[1] Efficient coupling of substrates between enzymes increases the mass transport of molecules within the cascade reaction and modulates the ratio of reactants to products by depleting intermediates. making the reactions more thermally favoured. Such examples can be found in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. in which several individual reactions cannot happen spontaneously due to the positive standard ΔG (thermally disfavoured).[2] For instance. malate dehydrogenase (MDH). an essential component of the citric acid cycle pathway. catalyses the oxidation of malic acid to oxaloacetate (OAA) with the simultaneous reduction of NAD+ to NADH.[3] However.

It was also possible to recognize a structural rationale for the absence of other permutations. which either destabilize the invariant GTPase fold or disrupt regions that provide critical residues for GTP binding and hydrolysis. such as Switch-I and Switch-II.

Zoonotic transmission from livestock animals or animal-derived food is the likely cause for most of these infections. However. little is known about their general and host-specific mechanisms of colonization. or virulence and pathogenicity factors. In certain hosts. Campylobacter species colonize persistently and do not cause disease. while they cause acute intestinal disease in humans. Here. we investigate putative host-specificity using phenotypic characterization and genome-wide analysis of genetically closely related C. jejuni strains from different sources. A collection of 473 fresh Campylobacter isolates from Germany was assembled between 2006 and 2010 and characterized using MLST. A subset of closely related C. jejuni strains of the highly prevalent sequence type ST-21 was selected from different hosts and isolation sources. PCR typing of strain-variable genes provided evidence that some genes differed between these strains. Furthermore. phenotypic variation of these strains was tested using the following criteria: metabolic variation. protein expression patterns. and eukaryotic cell interaction. The results demonstrated remarkable phenotypic diversity within the ST-21 group. which however did not correlate with isolation source. Whole genome sequencing was performed for five ST-21 strains from chicken. human. bovine. and food sources. in order to gain insight into ST-21 genome diversity.

So far. functional and phenotypic differences between these two DC subsets remain unclear due to lack of markers to identify DDCs.  Methodology/Principal Findings In the present report. we demonstrated that macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (MGL) 2 was exclusively expressed in the DDC subset in the skin-to-LN immune system. In the skin. MGL2 was expressed on the majority (about 88%) of MHCII+CD11c+ cells in the dermis. In the cutaneous LN. MGL2 expression was restricted to B220−CD8αloCD11b+CD11c+MHCIIhi tissue-derived DC. MGL2+DDC migrated from the dermis into the draining LNs within 24 h after skin sensitization with FITC. Distinct from LCs. MGL2+DDCs localized near the high endothelial venules in the outer T cell cortex. In FITC-induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS). adoptive transfer of FITC+MGL2+DDCs. but not FITC+MGL2−DCs into naive mice resulted in the induction of FITC-specific ear swelling. indicating that DDCs played a key role in initiation of immune responses in the skin.

1030023,Unique features of antiviral immune system of the vaginal mucosa,2012,Yosuke Kumamoto and Akiko Iwasaki,24,,4,411-416,Elsevier Current Trends,A vast majority of human vaccines rely on neutralizing antibodies for protection. With the exception of vaccines against human papillomavirus. despite a great amount of dedicated effort by the scientific community. development of vaccines against sexually transmitted viruses has generally been unsuccessful. Understanding the immunobiology of the genital tract is key to designing vaccines that prevent spreading of these viruses. Recent studies demonstrate that adaptive immunity in the vaginal mucosa is uniquely regulated compared to other mucosal organs. In particular. development of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is critically important for antiviral defense in vagina. In this review. we provide an overview of our current understanding of a wide spectrum of immune responses in vagina – from innate viral sensing to memory development.,True,W4BeUy0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,51,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791512000775,11759330536044197477,/scholar?cites=11759330536044197477,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3423557/,0,0,0

We conclude that innexins are the primordial gapjunction molecules. while connexins evolved more recently in the deuterostomes. The major question is whether the connexin–innexin dichotomy is an extreme case of sequence divergence from a common ancestor or a convergent solution to the problem of intercellular communication. A critical experiment was to identify gapjunction proteins in diploblastic organisms. eg cnidaria. These organisms have functional gap junctions [4] and represent an evolutionary grade before the deuterostome–protostome divergence.

JmjC domain containing proteins catalyze the oxidative removal of methyl groups on histone lysine residues. Here. we report studies to test the involvement of Jumonji domain-containing protein 6 (Jmjd6) in histone lysine demethylation. Jmjd6 has recently been shown to hydroxylate RNA splicing factors and is known to be essential for the differentiation of multiple tissues and cells during embryogenesis. However. there have been conflicting reports as to whether Jmjd6 is a histone-modifying enzyme.  Methodology/Principal Findings Immunolocalization studies reveal that Jmjd6 is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm outside of regions containing heterochromatic DNA. with occasional localization in nucleoli. During mitosis. Jmjd6 is excluded from the nucleus and reappears in the telophase of the cell cycle. Western blot analyses confirmed that Jmjd6 forms homo-multimers of different molecular weights in the nucleus and cytoplasm. A comparison of mono-. di-. and tri-methylation states of H3K4. H3K9. H3K27. H3K36. and H4K20 histone residues in wildtype and Jmjd6-knockout cells indicate that Jmjd6 is not involved in the demethylation of these histone lysine residues. This is further supported by overexpression of enzymatically active and inactive forms of Jmjd6 and subsequent analysis of histone methylation patterns by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. Finally. treatment of cells with RNase A and DNase I indicate that Jmjd6 may preferentially associate with RNA/RNA complexes and less likely with chromatin …,True,2dUprBcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,69,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013769,454695591567579406,/scholar?cites=454695591567579406,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013769,0,0,0

By itself. NusA induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination. but NusA also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. We show that NusA is required for λ-related phage 82 antiterminator Q82 to construct a stable complex in which RNA-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both Q82 and NusA near the β flap domain of RNA polymerase.

In order to evaluate the susceptibility level of plants to air pollutants. four parameters namely ascorbic acid. chlorophyll. relative water content and leaf extract pH were determined and computed together in a formulation signifying the air pollution tolerance index (APTI) of plants. APTI values of seven economically important plant species growing in the urban-industrial region of Allahabad were estimated. The order of tolerance is as follows: Artocarpus sp.< Eucalyptus sp.< Citrus lemon< Azadirachta indica< Rosa indica< Aegle marmelos< Mangifera indica. Among the plant studies. Mangifera indica (APTI value 18.51) is considered as a relatively tolerant species and Artocarpus sp.(APTI value 8.75) as most sensitive to air pollutants.

Initiation of repair involves the mismatch-.

A disulfide bridge is introduced into Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase to make two separate mutant enzymes with a single bridge. Even though the A103C/S121C mutant showed remarkable thermal stability. its specific activity decreased. whereas the A296C/A326C mutant showed tremendous thermal stability. relative pH insensitivity and 7.3-fold increase of specific activity. Moreover. the bioluminescence emission spectrum of A296C/A326C was resistant against higher temperatures (37 °C). Far-UV CD analysis showed slight secondary structure changes for both mutants.

CTCF‐binding sites are often flanked by thyroid hormone response elements (TREs). as at the chicken lysozyme upstream silencer.

Structural studies of Mimivirus have been difficult because of its size and long surface fibers.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and atomic force microscopy were able to show that the 20 icosahedral faces of Mimivirus capsids have hexagonal arrays of depressions. Each depression is surrounded by six trimeric capsomers that are similar in structure to those in many other large. icosahedral double-stranded DNA viruses.

The extensive structural similarity revealed by such portals in diverse viruses. as well as their invariable positioning at a unique icosahedral vertex. led to the consensus that a particular. highly conserved vertex-portal architecture is essential for viral DNA translocations. Here we present an exception to this paradigm by demonstrating that genome delivery and packaging in the virus Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus occur through two distinct portals. By using high-resolution techniques. including electron tomography and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. we show that Mimivirus genome delivery entails a large-scale conformational change of the capsid. whereby five icosahedral faces open up. This opening. which occurs at a unique vertex of the capsid that we coined the “stargate”. allows for the formation of a massive membrane conduit through which the viral DNA is released. A transient aperture centered at an icosahedral face distal to the DNA delivery site acts as a non-vertex DNA packaging portal.

Here we present the crystal structure of a disk-shaped octameric form of VP40 formed by four antiparallel homodimers of the N-terminal domain. The octamer binds an RNA triribonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-U-G-A-3′ through its inner pore surface. and its oligomerization and RNA binding properties are facilitated by two conformational changes when compared to monomeric VP40. The selective RNA interaction stabilizes the ring structure and confers in vitro SDS resistance to octameric VP40. SDS-resistant octameric VP40 is also found in Ebola virus-infected cells. which suggests that VP40 has an additional function in the life cycle of the virus besides promoting virus assembly and budding off the plasma membrane.,True,mtLay3EAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,168,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603000509,11071080652588359946,/scholar?cites=11071080652588359946,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212603000509,0,0,0

Ltd,Gephyrin is a bi‐functional modular protein involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and in postsynaptic clustering of inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs). Here. we show that full‐length gephyrin is a trimer and that its proteolysis in vitro causes the spontaneous dimerization of its C‐terminal region (gephyrin‐E). which binds a GlyR β‐subunit‐derived peptide with high and low affinity. The crystal structure of the tetra‐domain gephyrin‐E in complex with the β‐peptide bound to domain IV indicates how membrane‐embedded GlyRs may interact with subsynaptic gephyrin. In vitro. trimeric full‐length gephyrin forms a network upon lowering the pH. and this process can be reversed to produce stable full‐length dimeric gephyrin. Our data suggest a mechanism by which induced conformational transitions of trimeric gephyrin may generate a reversible postsynaptic scaffold for GlyR recruitment. which allows for …,True,mtLay3EAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,156,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600256,6453823674940155945,/scholar?cites=6453823674940155945,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600256,0,0,0

Here we show that full-length wild-type VP40 octamers bind RNA upon HEK 293 cell expression. While the Phe125-to-Ala mutation resulted in reduced RNA binding. the Arg134-to-Ala mutation completely abolished RNA binding and thus octamer formation. The absence of octamer formation. however. does not affect virus-like particle (VLP) formation. as the VLPs generated from the expression of wild-type VP40 and mutated VP40 in HEK 293 cells showed similar morphology and abundance and no significant difference in size.

Evidence is mounting successively regarding the adverse health effects of lead at low levels. This study was undertaken to assess the antioxidant status of lead-exposed residential and commercial painters of Lucknow city in Uttar Pradesh. India.Thirty-five painters aged 20 to 50 years who had blood lead levels ≤400 μg L-1 were selected for the study from a population of 56 male painters initially screened for blood lead. The control group included an equal number of subjects of the same age group without any occupational exposure to lead.We studied the association between low lead level exposure and antioxidant status and found that blood lead levels in painters were approximately seven times as high as in controls [(219.2 ± 61.9) μg L-1 vs. (30.6±10.1) μg L-1. respectively]. Among the biomarkers of lead toxicity a significant decrease in the level of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase [(9.13±4.62) UL-1 vs. (39.38±5.05) UL-1] and an increase in the level of zinc protoporphyrin [(187.9±49.8) μg L-1 vs. (26.4±5.5) μg L-1] were observed in painters compared to controls.

We show that lateral microtubule movement and looping is a result of microtubules sliding against one another in interphase Drosophila S2 cells. RNAi of the kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC). but not dynein or the kinesin-1 light chain. eliminates these movements. KHC-dependent microtubule sliding powers the formation of cellular processes filled with parallel microtubule bundles. The growth of these cellular processes is independent of the actin cytoskeleton. We further observe cytoplasmic microtubule sliding in Xenopus and Ptk2 cells. and show that antibody inhibition of KHC in mammalian cells prevents sliding. We therefore propose that. in addition to its well established role in organelle transport. an important universal function of kinesin-1 is to mediate cytoplasmic microtubule–microtubule …,True,xA3zTykAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,98,https://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12151.short,4201049485814330724,/scholar?cites=4201049485814330724,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/107/27/12151.full.pdf,0,0,0

Although durable responses can be achieved in some patients. many patients fail to respond to these therapies. underscoring the need for improvement with combination therapies. From a screen of 850 bioactive compounds. we identify HSP90 inhibitors as candidates for combination with immunotherapy. We show that inhibition of HSP90 with ganetespib enhances T-cell-mediated killing of patient-derived human melanoma cells by their autologous T cells in vitro and potentiates responses to anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that HSP90 inhibition results in upregulation of interferon response genes. which are essential for the enhanced killing of ganetespib treated melanoma cells by T cells.

Mercury (12 μmol/kg b.w.. single intraperitoneal injection) resulted in oxidative injury and metallothionein mRNA expression together with alterations in tissue histology and accumulation of mercury in the body organs. The ameliorating potential of vitamin E (24 μmol/kg b.w.. single intraperitoneal injection) was observed in mercury administered rats. Our findings indicate that vitamin E provides complete protection from mercury toxicity in the liver with both pre- and post-treatments. As mercury is nephrotoxic and neurotoxic. it is interesting to note that post-treatment of vitamin E showed more protection in the kidney compared to pre-treatment. In brain tissue. partial protection was observed on oxidative stress parameters. Our results thus suggest that post-treatment with vitamin E could be more beneficial …,True,h93IDOkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668909001689,2089537521900955081,/scholar?cites=2089537521900955081,,,0,0,0

During the last years. research on diseases linked to Q-deficiency has highlighted the essential role of this lipid in cell physiology. Q levels are also affected during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore. therapies based on dietary supplementation with Q must be considered in cases of Q deficiency such as in aging. However. the low bioavailability of dietary Q for muscle and brain obligates to design new mechanisms to increase the uptake of this compound in these tissues. In the present review we show a complete picture of the different functions of Q in cell physiology and their relationship to age and age-related diseases. Furthermore. we describe the problems associated with dietary Q uptake and the mechanisms currently used to increase its uptake or even its biosynthesis in cells.

Present study has been designed to investigate expression and activation of STAT3 in cervical precancer and cancer in relation to HPV infection during cervical carcinogenesis. Established cervical cancer cell lines and prospectively-collected cervical precancer and cancer tissues were analyzed for the HPV positivity and evaluated for STAT3 expression and its phosphorylation by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry whereas STAT3-specific DNA binding activity was examined by gel-shift assays. Analysis of 120 tissues from cervical precancer and cancer lesions or from normal cervix revealed differentially high levels of constitutively active STAT3 in cervical precancer and cancer lesions. whereas it was absent in normal controls.

Pharmacologic targeting of STAT3 expression in cervical cancer cell lines either by STAT3-specific siRNA or blocking its tyrosine phosphorylation by AG490 or curcumin led to dose-dependent accumulation of p53 and pRb in cervical cancer cells.

To examine additional virulence determinants. we performed a genetic screen in V.ácholerae-infected Drosophila and identified the two-component system CrbRS. CrbRS controls transcriptional activation of acetyl-CoA synthase-1 (ACS-1) and thus regulates the acetate switch. in which bacteria transition from excretion to assimilation of environmental acetate. The resultant loss of intestinal acetate leads to deactivation of host insulin signaling and lipid accumulation in enterocytes. resulting in host lethality. These metabolic effects are not observed upon infection with ΔcrbS or Δacs1 V. cholerae mutants.

Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism represent opposite clinical conditions. albeit not mirror images. Recent experimental and clinical studies have suggested the involvement of ROS tissue damage under altered thyroid status. Altered-thyroid state-linked changes in heart modify their susceptibility to oxidants and the extent of the oxidative damage they suffer following oxidative challenge. Chronic increase in the cellular levels of ROS can lead to a catastrophic cycle of DNA damage. mitochondrial dysfunction. further ROS generation and cellular injury.

A biphasic pattern was evident for lipid peroxidation and for the activity ratio of superoxide dismutase to catalase and glutathione peroxidase with increasing age. In the first phase of life (birth‐7 days). a linear fall in lipid peroxidation was accompanied by a gradual increase in the enzyme ratio which was reversed in the second phase (15–600 days). Glutathione and ascorbic acid levels increased from birth to the 45th day and remained unchanged up till 365 days and then reduced at 600 days of age. The maximum level of H2O2 observed at birth gradually decreased till 90 days and remained unchanged up till 365 days of age; thereafter its level was elevated on day 600.

Due to the rapid development in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) over the years. the major focus of proteomic studies has been around the ejaculated spermatozoa. Although seminal plasma is not a requirement for ART. the question arose whether the role of seminal plasma is merely to transport spermatozoa. Seminal plasma (SP) contains a large diversity of proteins that are essential not only for sperm transport. but also for sperm protection and maturation. Most of the proteins bind to sperm surface through exosomes (epididymosomes and prostasomes). modulating sperm function. interaction with the female reproductive tract and finally fertilization.

It is an independent biomarker of sperm function. Seminal plasma is a natural reservoir of antioxidants responsible for the nourishment. protection. capacitation. and motility of sperm within the female reproductive tract resulting in successful fertilization and implantation of the embryo. A comparative proteomic analysis of seminal plasma proteins from fertile men and infertile men with varying levels of ROS was carried out to identify signature proteins involved in ROS-mediated reproductive dysfunction. A total of 42 infertile men presenting with infertility and 17 proven fertile donors were enrolled in the study. ROS levels were measured in the seminal ejaculates by chemiluminescence assay. Infertile men were subdivided into Low ROS (0–<93 RLU/s/106 sperm; n = 11). Medium ROS (>93–500 RLU/s/106 sperm; n = 17) and High ROS (>500 RLU/s/106 sperm; n = 14) groups and compared with fertile men (4–50 RLU/s/106 sperm). 4 subjects from fertile group and 4 each from the Low.

The composition of milk of different mammals has been adapted during evolution of the species to fulfill the needs of the offspring. Milk not only provides nutrients. but it also serves as a medium for transfer of host defense components to the offspring. The host defense proteins in the milk of different mammalian species are expected to reveal signatures of evolution. The aim of this study is therefore to study the difference in the host defense proteome of human and bovine milk. We analyzed human and bovine milk using a shot-gun proteomics approach focusing on host defense-related proteins. In total. 268 proteins in human milk and 269 proteins in bovine milk were identified. Of these. 44 from human milk and 51 from bovine milk are related to the host defense system. Of these proteins. 33 were found in both species but with significantly different quantities. High concentrations of proteins involved in the mucosal immune system. immunoglobulin A. CD14. lactoferrin. and lysozyme. were present in human milk. The human newborn is known to be deficient for at least two of these proteins (immunoglobulin A and CD14). On the other hand. antimicrobial proteins (5 cathelicidins and lactoperoxidase) were abundant in bovine milk. The high concentration of lactoperoxidase is probably linked to the high amount of thiocyanate in the plant-based diet of cows. This first detailed analysis of host defense proteins in human and bovine milk is an important step in understanding the function of milk in the development of the immune system of these two mammals.,True,pS36wK0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,191,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019433,303429291434416523,/scholar?cites=303429291434416523,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019433,0,0,0

Therefore. there seems to be an opportunity for improvement by means of using more observations. The objective of this study was to verify whether the use of more data would add to the accuracy of predicting milk fat composition. In addition. the effect of season on modeling was quantified because large differences in milk fat composition between winter and summer samples exist. We concluded that the use of 3.622 observations does increase predictability of milk fat composition based on infrared spectroscopy.

Both the similarity in changes from day 0 to day 9 in the quantitative milk proteome. and the differences in specific protein abundance. were observed among four cows. One third of the quantified proteins showed a significant decrease in concentration over the first 9 days after calving. especially in the immune proteins (as much as 40 fold). Three relative high abundant enzymes (XDH. LPL. and RNASE1) and cell division and proliferation protein (CREG1) may be involved in the maturation of the gastro-intestinal tract. In addition. high correlations between proteins involved in complement and blood coagulation cascades illustrates the complex nature of biological interrelationships between milk proteins. The linear decrease of protease inhibitors and proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune system implies a protective role for protease inhibitor against degradation.

However. rules of protein folding remain elusive till date. In this work. rigorous analyses of several thousand crystal structures of folded proteins reveal a surprisingly simple unifying principle of backbone organization in protein folding. We find that protein folding is a direct consequence of a narrow band of stoichiometric occurrences of amino-acids in primary sequences. regardless of the size and the fold of a protein.

Although little is known about the host factors that induce and maintain Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) within latent lesions. O2 depletion. nutrient limitation and acidification are some of the stresses implicated in bacterial dormancy development/growth arrest. Adaptation to hypoxia and exposure to NO/CO is implemented through the DevRS/DosT two-component system which induces the dormancy regulon.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that vitamin C (ascorbic acid/AA) can serve as an additional signal to induce the DevR regulon. Physiological levels of AA scavenge O2 and rapidly induce the DevR regulon at an estimated O2 saturation of <30%. The kinetics and magnitude of the response suggests an initial involvement of DosT and a sustained DevS-mediated response during bacterial adaptation to increasing hypoxia. In addition to inducing DevR regulon mechanisms. vitamin C induces the expression of selected genes previously shown to be responsive to low pH and oxidative stress. triggers bacterial growth arrest and promotes dormancy phenotype development in M. tb grown in axenic culture and intracellularly in THP-1 cells.  Conclusions/Significance Vitamin C mimics multiple intracellular stresses and has wide-ranging regulatory effects on gene expression and physiology of M. tb which leads to growth arrest and a ‘dormant’ drug-tolerant phenotype. but in a manner independent of the DevRS/DosT sytem.

This paper exploits this relationship to derive hydrophobicity indices for amino acid residues. Retention times of 20 Z-amino acids and their methyl. ethyl and benzyl esters were determined under standard conditions on reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography at pH 3.0 and pH 7.5. Retention times of derivatives of six of the amino acids were used to calculate amino acid residue hydrophobicity values relative to glycine and leucine by a computer-based iterative procedure that used splines to optimize the smoothness of fit. Using these derived curves. values for each derivative of the remaining 14 Z-amino acids were determined and averages calculated. The curves. generated independently for pH 3.0 and pH 7.5 were effectively identical and the determined hydrophobicity values (other than for charged residues) were also similar at the two pHs. The values obtained vary significantly from other published values. Comparisons with some of the more commonly used hydrophobicity/hydropathy tables are presented.

We have recently reported that proteases released by major allergenic pollens can injure airway epithelial cells in vitro. Disruption of epithelial integrity by proteases released following deposition of pollens on mucosal surfaces could promote sensitization and induce inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To compare protease activities released by allergenic pollens of various genera. METHODS: We used a rapid microassay which quantifies cleavage of dipeptide ester substrates to characterize the substrate preference profiles of serine proteases in diffusates of the pollens of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Kentucky blue grass (Poa pratensis). Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon). Western ragweed (Ambrosia spp.). white birch (Betula spp.) and Sydney golden wattle (Acacia longifolia). RESULTS: Comparison of the profiles revealed notable differences as well as similarities between serine protease activities released by these pollens. Diffusates of Kentucky blue grass pollen exhibited very high substrate preference for arginine and lysine. For other pollens. cleavage of the cysteine substrate was usually the most rapid and was associated with marked preference for leucine and methionine. There was considerable variation between these pollens in the rates of cleavage of the histidine substrate. In addition. we observed high rates of cleavage of arginine and lysine substrates by Acacia pollen diffusate. CONCLUSION: At least two dominant patterns of substrate preference are identifiable in the mixtures of proteases released by hydrated pollens.

These deficiencies are addressed by conjugate vaccines composed of bacterial polysaccharide covalently attached to protein carriers such as tetanus or diphtheria toxoids. These vaccines activate T-cells and have been hugely effective in reducing the incidence of dangerous infectious diseases such as bacterial meningitis in infants and adults.

1030394,Redox regulation of protein function via cysteine S-nitrosylation and its relevance to neurodegenerative diseases,2012,Mohd Waseem Akhtar and Carmen R Sunico and Tomohiro Nakamura and Stuart A Lipton,2012,,,,Hindawi,Debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). can be attributed to neuronal cell damage in specific brain regions. An important hallmark of these diseases is increased oxidative and nitrosative stress that occurs via overproduction of highly reactive free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). These molecules are normally removed by cellular antioxidant systems. Under physiological conditions. ROS/RNS are present at low levels. mediating several neurotrophic and neuroprotective signaling pathways. In contrast. under pathological conditions. there is a pronounced increase in ROS/RNS generation. impairing normal neurological function. Nitric oxide (NO) is one such molecule that functions as a signaling agent under physiological conditions but causes nitrosative stress under pathological conditions due to its enhanced production. As first reported by our group and colleagues. the toxic effects of NO can be in part attributed to thiol S-nitrosylation. a posttranslational modification of cysteine residues on specific proteins. Here. we review several reports appearing over the past decade showing that S-nitrosylation of an increasing number of proteins compromises important cellular functions. including mitochondrial dynamics. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding. and signal transduction. thereby promoting synaptic damage. cell death. and neurodegeneration.,True,nRJ_JscAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,55,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2012/463756/abs/,3026456697782062407,/scholar?cites=3026456697782062407,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcb/2012/463756/abs/,0,0,0

A notable exception to this paradigm is provided by two GTPases in the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor (SR) that control the co-translational targeting of proteins to cellular membranes. Instead of the classical “GTPase switch.” both the SRP and SR undergo a series of discrete conformational rearrangements during their interaction with one another. culminating in their reciprocal GTPase activation.

However. the precise mechanism by which high fidelity is achieved is not well understood for any protein-targeting pathway. To address this fundamental question. we investigated the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway in Escherichia coli. which delivers proteins to the bacterial inner membrane through recognition of signal sequences on cargo proteins. Fidelity was thought to arise from the inability of SRP to bind strongly to incorrect cargos. Using biophysical assays. we found that incorrect cargos were also rejected through a series of checkpoints during subsequent steps of targeting. Thus. high fidelity of substrate selection is achieved through the cumulative effect of multiple checkpoints; this principle may be generally applicable to other pathways involving selective signal recognition.,True,4fi20e4AAAAJ:OjREftYh6kAC,101,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/757.abstract,1911092384981604230,/scholar?cites=1911092384981604230,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760334/,0,0,0

During the protein targeting reaction. the 4.5S SRP RNA accelerates the association between the two GTPases by 400-fold.

We also found that the 4.5S SRP RNA significantly stabilizes the early GTP-independent intermediate.

We observed a red edge excitation shift (REES) of 4 nm for the tryptophans in the case of spectrin in its native state. This indicates that tryptophans in spectrin are localized in a microenvironment of restricted mobility. and that the regions surrounding the spectrin tryptophans offer considerable restriction to the reorientational motion of the water dipoles around the excited state tryptophans. Interestingly. spectrin exhibits a REES of 3 nm even when denatured in 8 M urea. This represents the first report of a denatured protein displaying REES.

However. the achieved titers are significantly lower as compared to the citric acid production by A. niger. Heterologous expression of cis-aconitate decarboxylase in A. niger leads to the accumulation of small amounts of itaconic acid. Additional expression of aconitase. the second enzyme metabolically linking citric acid and itaconic acid improves productivity. However. proper organelle targeting of the enzymes appears to be an important point to consider. Here we compare the mitochondrial expression with the cytosolic expression of cis-aconitate decarboxylase or aconitase in A. niger.

While the transcription of the xyr1 gene itself is achieved by release of carbon catabolite repression. the transcript formation of xyn1 (xylanase 1) is regulated by an additional induction mechanism mediated by lactose. Xyr1 has an important impact on lactose metabolism by directly activating xyl1 (xylose reductase 1) transcription and indirectly influencing transcription of bga1 (β-galactosidase 1).

In this study. we examined the microbial communities of a Gulf of Mexico coastal salt marsh during and after the influx of petroleum hydrocarbons following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Total hydrocarbon concentrations in salt marsh sediments were highest in June and July 2010 and decreased in September 2010. Coupled PhyloChip and GeoChip microarray analyses demonstrated that the microbial community structure and function of the extant salt marsh hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations changed significantly during the study. The relative richness and abundance of phyla containing previously described hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Proteobacteria. Bacteroidetes. and Actinobacteria) increased in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments and then decreased once hydrocarbons were below detection. Firmicutes. however. continued to increase in relative richness and abundance after hydrocarbon concentrations were below detection.

Integrin-mediated adhesion is known to activate Rac1 and to regulate the interaction of Rac1 with downstream effectors. Currently. it is not clear how integrins signal Rac1 activation following cell adhesion. Integrin β cytoplasmic domains (β-tails) are known to be required for integrin-mediated cell spreading. and isolated β tails expressed as tac-β tail chimeras can inhibit cell spreading indicating that protein interactions with β tails can regulate this process.

Conformational distortion of the native monomer leads to aggregation-coupled misfolding. Whereas β-cells are protected from proteotoxicity by hexamer assembly. fibrillation limits the storage and use of insulin at elevated temperatures. Here. we have investigated conformational distortions of an engineered insulin monomer in relation to the structure of an insulin fibril. Anomalous 13C NMR chemical shifts and rapid 15N-detected 1H-2H amide-proton exchange were observed in one of the three classical α-helices (residues A1–A8) of the hormone. suggesting a conformational equilibrium between locally folded and unfolded A-chain segments.

To investigate the functional relevance of lncRNAs in various physiological conditions. we have developed a collection of 18 lncRNA knockout strains in which the locus is maintained transcriptionally active. Initial characterization revealed peri- and postnatal lethal phenotypes in three mutant strains (Fendrr. Peril. and Mdgt). the latter two exhibiting incomplete penetrance and growth defects in survivors. We also report growth defects for two additional mutant strains (linc–Brn1b and linc–Pint). Further analysis revealed defects in lung. gastrointestinal tract. and heart in Fendrr−/− neonates. whereas linc–Brn1b−/− mutants displayed distinct abnormalities in the generation of upper layer II–IV neurons in the neocortex.

To investigate and harness these capabilities. we developed clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Display (CRISP-Disp). a targeted localization method that uses Cas9 to deploy large RNA cargos to DNA loci. We demonstrate that functional RNA domains up to at least 4.8 kb long can be inserted in CRISPR guide RNA at multiple points. allowing the construction of Cas9 complexes with protein-binding cassettes. artificial aptamers. pools of random sequences and natural long noncoding RNAs.

TTP post-transcriptionally represses gene expression by interacting with AU-rich elements (AREs) in 3′ untranslated regions of target mRNAs and subsequently engenders their deadenylation and decay.

Under most circumstances. translational control occurs at the initiation step at which the ribosome is recruited to the mRNA. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). as part of the eIF4F complex. interacts first with the mRNA and facilitates the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The activity of eIF4E is regulated at many levels. most profoundly by two major signalling pathways: PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt (also known and Protein Kinase B.

Because of the multifaceted nature of mTORC1 signaling. identification of reliable biomarkers for the sensitivity of tumors to asTORi is imperative for their clinical implementation. Here. we show that cancer cells acquire resistance to asTORi by downregulating eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs—EIF4EBP1. EIF4EBP2). Loss of 4E-BPs or overexpression of eIF4E renders neoplastic growth and translation of tumor-promoting mRNAs refractory to mTOR inhibition. Conversely. moderate depletion of eIF4E augments the anti-neoplastic effects of asTORi.

Using an RNP isolation/mass spectrometry approach. we identified candidate cofactors of eIF4E mRNA export including LRPPRC.

Upon association with the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). miRNAs repress target mRNA translation and accelerate mRNA decay. Degradation of the mRNA is initiated by shortening of the poly(A) tail by the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex followed by the removal of the 5′ cap structure and exonucleolytic decay of the mRNA. Here. we report a direct interaction between the large scaffolding subunit of CCR4–NOT. CNOT1. with the translational repressor and decapping activator protein. DDX6. DDX6 binds to a conserved CNOT1 subdomain in a manner resembling the interaction of the translation initiation factor eIF4A with eIF4G.

For instance. groups of mRNAs acting in the same biochemical processes can be retained or exported in a coordinated manner thereby impacting on specific biochemistries and ultimately on cell physiology. mRNAs can be transported by either bulk export pathways involving NXF1/TAP or more specialized pathways involving chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1).

Few studies have investigated how the level. and thus activity. of eIF4E is regulated in healthy (noncancerous) cells and how they become elevated in malignant cells. Here. our studies reveal a novel mechanism by which eIF4E levels are regulated at the level of mRNA stability. Two factors known to modulate transcript stability. HuR and the p42 isoform of AUF1. compete for binding to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of eIF4E mRNAs.

Ltd,The activity of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E is modulated through conformational response to its ligands. For example. eIF4G and eIF4E‐binding proteins (4E‐BPs) modulate cap affinity. and thus physiological activity of eIF4E. by binding a site distal to the 7‐methylguanosine cap‐binding site. Further. cap binding substantially modulates eIF4E's affinity for eIF4G and the 4E‐BPs. To date. only cap‐bound eIF4E structures were reported. In the absence of structural information on the apo form. the molecular underpinnings of this conformational response mechanism cannot be established.

No vaccine is available. and praziquantel. the only drug extensively utilized. is currently administered more than 100 million people yearly. Because praziquantel resistance may develop it is essential to identify novel drug targets. Our goal was to investigate the potential of a unique. selenium-containing parasite enzyme thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) as a drug target.   Methods and Findings Using RNA interference we found that TGR is essential for parasite survival; after silencing of TGR expression. in vitro parasites died within 4 d. We also found that auranofin is an efficient inhibitor of pure TGR (Ki = 10 nM). able to kill parasites rapidly in culture at physiological concentrations (5 μM). and able to partially cure infected mice (worm burden reductions of ~60%). Furthermore. two previously used antischistosomal compounds inhibited TGR activity. suggesting that TGR is a key target during therapy with those compounds.   Conclusions Collectively. our results indicate that parasite TGR meets all the major criteria to be a key target for antischistosomal chemotherapy.

Auranofin (AF). a gold-containing compound already in clinical use as an anti-arthritic drug. has been shown to inhibit TGR and to substantially reduce worm burden in mice. Using x-ray crystallography we solved (at 2.5 Å resolution) the structure of wild type TGR incubated with AF. The electron density maps show that the actual inhibitor is gold. released from AF.

Genes encoding two novel 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin proteins were identified in the expressed sequence tag data base of the helminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni. a causative agent of schistosomiasis. The recombinant proteins showed peroxidase activity in vitro with a variety of hydroperoxides and used both the thioredoxin and the glutathione systems as electron donors. Steady-state kinetic analysis indicated that the new peroxiredoxins had saturable kinetics. whereas a previously identified schistosome peroxiredoxin was found to function with more typical unsaturable (ping-pong) kinetics.

Schistosomes lack catalase. the main H2O2-neutralizing enzyme of many organisms. and their glutathione peroxidases are in the phospholipid class with poor reactivity toward H2O2.

Praziquantel is the only drug used to treat the disease. and with its increased use the probability of developing drug resistance has grown significantly. The Schistosoma parasites can survive for up to decades in the human host due in part to a unique set of antioxidant enzymes that continuously degrade the reactive oxygen species produced by the host's innate immune response. Two principal components of this defense system have been recently identified in S. mansoni as thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (TGR) and peroxiredoxin (Prx) and as such these enzymes present attractive new targets for anti-schistosomiasis drug development. Inhibition of TGR/Prx activity was screened in a dual-enzyme format with reducing equivalents being transferred from NADPH to glutathione via a TGR-catalyzed reaction and then to hydrogen peroxide via a Prx-catalyzed step. A fully automated quantitative high-throughput (qHTS) experiment was performed against a collection of 71.028 compounds tested as 7- to 15-point concentration series at 5 µL reaction volume in 1536-well plate format.

We explore how substrate multimerization modulates recognition by the ClpX unfoldase using a natural substrate. MuA transposase. MuA is initially monomeric but forms a stable tetramer when bound to transposon DNA. Destabilizing this tetramer by ClpX promotes an essential transition in the phage Mu recombination pathway. We show that ClpX interacts more tightly with tetrameric than with monomeric MuA. Residues exposed only in the MuA tetramer are important for enhanced recognition—which requires the N domain of ClpX—as well as for a high maximal disassembly rate. We conclude that an extended set of potential enzyme contacts are exposed upon assembly of the tetramer and function as internal guides to recruit …,True,fjr41vgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,48,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276508001329,14174565077683304790,/scholar?cites=14174565077683304790,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276508001329,0,0,0

We have used live-cell fluorescence imaging to follow rotavirus entry and penetration into the cytosol of its ∼700 Å inner capsid particle (“double-layered particle”. DLP). We label with distinct fluorescent tags the DLP and each of the two outer-layer proteins and track the fates of each species as the particles bind and enter BSC-1 cells. Virions attach to their glycolipid receptors in the host cell membrane and rapidly become inaccessible to externally added agents; most particles that release their DLP into the cytosol have done so by ∼10 minutes. as detected by rapid diffusional motion of the DLP away from residual outer-layer proteins. Electron microscopy shows images of particles at various stages of engulfment into tightly fitting membrane invaginations. consistent with the interpretation that rotavirus particles drive their own uptake. Electron cryotomography of membrane-bound virions also shows closely wrapped membrane.

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 34-year-old man awaiting a lung transplant for interstitial lung disease was connected to an ECMO circuit as a bridge to lung transplant. with a drainage catheter attached to his right internal jugular vein. Shortly after he was cannulated. he developed blurred vision in his right eye and was found to have a progressively worsening bullous exudative retinal detachment. After receiving a lung transplant and getting decannulated from ECMO. his bullous detachment rapidly improved. The patient's clinical course as well as his ophthalmic testing showed findings inconsistent with alternative diagnoses such as central serous chorioretinopathy.

Red blood cell mean half-life in old mice was 8 ± 0.8 days compared to 12 ± 1 days in young mice. This reduced survival of red blood cell is not due to a different rate of cell phagocytosis in the reticulohistiocytic system of young and old animals since erythrocytes from young mice have the same mean half-life when injected both in young and old animals and vice versa.

1030664,Effects of macromolecular crowding on protein conformational changes,2010,Hao Dong and Sanbo Qin and Huan-Xiang Zhou,6,PLoS Comput Biol,7,e1000833,Public Library of Science,Many protein functions can be directly linked to conformational changes. Inside cells. the equilibria and transition rates between different conformations may be affected by macromolecular crowding. We have recently developed a new approach for modeling crowding effects. which enables an atomistic representation of “test” proteins. Here this approach is applied to study how crowding affects the equilibria and transition rates between open and closed conformations of seven proteins: yeast protein disulfide isomerase (yPDI). adenylate kinase (AdK). orotidine phosphate decarboxylase (ODCase). Trp repressor (TrpR). hemoglobin. DNA β-glucosyltransferase. and Ap4A hydrolase. For each protein. molecular dynamics simulations of the open and closed states are separately run. Representative open and closed conformations are then used to calculate the crowding-induced changes in chemical potential for the two states. The difference in chemical-potential change between the two states finally predicts the effects of crowding on the population ratio of the two states. Crowding is found to reduce the open population to various extents. In the presence of crowders with a 15 Å radius and occupying 35% of volume. the open-to-closed population ratios of yPDI. AdK. ODCase and TrpR are reduced by 79%. 78%. 62% and 55%. respectively. The reductions for the remaining three proteins are 20–44%. As expected. the four proteins experiencing the stronger crowding effects are those with larger conformational changes between open and closed states (e.g.. as measured by the change in radius of gyration).

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The negatively charged phosphates of nucleic acids are often paired with positively charged residues upon binding proteins. It was thus counter-intuitive when previous Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) calculations gave positive energies from electrostatic interactions. meaning that they destabilize protein–nucleic acid binding. Our own PB calculations on protein–protein binding have shown that the sign and the magnitude of the electrostatic component are sensitive to the specification of the dielectric boundary in PB calculations. A popular choice for the boundary between the solute low dielectric and the solvent high dielectric is the molecular surface; an alternative is the van der Waals (vdW) surface.

It is becoming well accepted that they form via liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of protein mixtures (often including RNA). where the organelles correspond to a protein-rich droplet phase coexisting with a protein-poor bulk phase. The major protein components contain disordered regions and often also RNA-binding domains. and the disordered fragments on their own easily undergo LLPS. By contrast. LLPS for structured proteins has been observed infrequently. The contrasting phase behaviors can be explained by modeling disordered and structured proteins. respectively. as polymers and colloids.

Two approaches have been used. one involving the introduction of a conventional alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) against a pepMHC cancer antigen. and the second involving introduction of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) consisting of a single-chain antibody as an Fv fragment (scFv) linked to transmembrane and signaling domains. In this review. we focus on one aspect of TCR-mediated adoptive T cell therapies. the impact of the affinity of the alpha-beta TCR for the pepMHC cancer antigen on both efficacy and specificity. We discuss the advantages of higher affinity TCRs in mediating potent activity of CD4 T cells. This is balanced with the potential disadvantage of higher affinity TCRs in mediating greater self-reactivity against a wider range of structurally similar antigenic peptides. especially in synergy with the CD8 co-receptor. Both TCR affinity and target selection will influence potential safety issues. We suggest pre-clinical strategies that might be used to examine each TCR for possible on-target and off-target side effects due to self-reactivities. and to adjust TCR affinities accordingly.,True,nBVrbgIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,78,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2013.00244/full,7878703167238518654,/scholar?cites=7878703167238518654,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2013.00244/full,0,0,0

We have here compared oligomeric and monomeric Ld and Kb peptide–MHC complexes and free peptide as stimulators of CD8+ T cells expressing the 2C TCR. We found that the monomers are indeed effective in activating naïve and effector CD8+ T cells. but through an unexpected mechanism that involves transfer of peptide from soluble monomers to T cell endogenous MHC (Kb) molecules.

Various approaches have been devised to circumvent this problem. In one approach. the gene encoding an antibody against a cancer-associated antigen is linked. in the form of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv). to genes that encode transmembrane and signaling domains. This chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is then introduced into T cells for adoptive T-cell therapy. In another approach. the anti-cancer scFv is fused to a scFv that binds to the CD3ε subunit of the TCR/CD3 complex.

These interactions are mediated through two MA3 domains on the Pdcd4 molecule and result in inhibition of protein synthesis. We have solved the high-resolution crystal structure of the C-terminal MA3 (cMA3) domain of Pdcd4 in several crystal forms and demonstrated its similarity to the MA3 domain of eIF4G. As predicted by the structure. the cMA3 domain competes with eIF4Gc for binding to eIF4A and surprisingly is sufficient to inhibit translation initiation.

A fraction containing high amounts of powerful antioxidant glycoside molecules has been isolated. In a dose‐dependent manner. this fraction reduces the lucigenin‐amplified chemiluminescence produced by the superoxide anion generated from the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. thus indicating a superoxide‐scavenging activity. A protective effect of this wheat sprouts fraction on the oxidative damage of pBR322 plasmid DNA induced by Fenton reaction (Fe2+/H2O2) was subsequently demonstrated.

Most of these medicinal plants may have scientific evidence to be considered in general practice.  Objective The aim of this work was to investigate the antioxidant capacities and anti-inflammatory activities of ethanol extracts of leaves of Cassia alata. Eleusine indica. Carica papaya. Eremomastax speciosa and the stem bark of Polyscias fulva. collected in Cameroon.  Methods Chemiluminescence was used to analyze the antioxidant activities of plant extracts against hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anion. Comet assays were used to analyze the protection against antioxidant-induced DNA damage induced in white blood cells after treating with hydrogen peroxide. Flow cytometry was used to measure γδ T cells proliferation and anti-inflammatory activity of γδ T cells and of immature dendritic cells (imDC) in the presence of different concentrations of plant extracts.  Results Ethanol extracts showed strong antioxidant properties against both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. Cassia alata showed the highest antioxidant activity. The effect of plant extracts on γδ T cells and imDC was evidenced by the dose dependent reduction in TNF-α production in the presence of Cassia alata. Carica papaya.
