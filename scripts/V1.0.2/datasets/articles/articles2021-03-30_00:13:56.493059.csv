The degradation of single‐walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) upon incubation with human EPO and H2O2 is reported. Biodegradation of SWCNTs is higher in the presence of NaBr. but neither EPO alone nor H2O2 alone caused the degradation of nanotubes. Molecular modeling reveals two binding sites for SWCNTs on EPO. one located at the proximal side (same side as the catalytic site) and the other on the distal side of EPO. The oxidized groups on SWCNTs in both cases are stabilized by electrostatic interactions with positively charged residues. Biodegradation of SWCNTs can also be executed in an ex vivo culture system using primary murine eosinophils stimulated to undergo degranulation.

To evaluate the effect of surface coating on MRI contrast efficiency. we examined the proton relaxivities of Fe3O4@mSiO2 NPs with different coating thicknesses. It was found that the mSiO2 coating has a significant impact on the efficiency of Fe3O4 NPs for MRI contrast enhancement. The efficiency increases with the thickness of mSiO2 coating and is much higher than that of the commercial contrast agents. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry of Fe3O4@mSiO2 further revealed that mSiO2 coating is partially permeable to water molecules and therefore induces the decrease of longitudinal relaxivity. r1.

The influences of particle size. inter-particle distance. particle-substrate spacer size etc on the resonance are studied thoroughly with a 3D finite-element method. We identified that the high-absorption resonance is mainly due to gap plasmon (coupled through particle bodies) when the separation between neighboring nano-spheres is small enough. such as close to 1 nm; at larger particle separations. the resonance is dominated by particle dipoles (coupled through the host dielectric). Experimentally. an absorber was fabricated based on chemically-synthesized gold nanoparticles coated with silica shell.

However. the shells of the crustaceans and other non-edible parts constituting about half of the body mass are usually discarded as waste. These discarded crustacean shells are a prominent source of polysaccharide (chitin) and protein. Chitosan is a de-acetylated form of chitin obtained from the crustacean waste that has attracted attention for applications in food. biomedical. and paint industries due to its characteristic properties. like solubility in weak acids. film-forming ability. pH-sensitivity. biodegradability. and biocompatibility. We present an overview of the application of chitosan in composite coatings for applications in food. paint. and water treatment.

The presence of Au NPs also induces long-term degradation of the photostability (photobleaching) of Rhodamine 6G used as gain medium in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity. We found that the degradation gets profound when the Au NPs concentration is significantly increased. Calculation of the radiative rate and direct time-resolved measurement of the fluorescence decay indicates that both the decrease of radiative decay rate and increase of non-radiative decay rate are responsible for the fluorescence quenching and photostability degradation. An energy transfer from the dye molecules to gold nanoparticles is dominating within the small distance between them and suppresses the quantum efficiency of Rhodamine 6G drastically. In long time scale. the photobleaching rate was slowing down. and laser output intensity reached a stabilized level which depends on the gold nanoparticles concentration.,True,t3Z4qNUAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,22,http://www.jeos.org/index.php/jeos_rp/article/view/470,6448454189625745578,/scholar?cites=6448454189625745578,,,http://www.jeos.org/index.php/jeos_rp/article/viewFile/11019/716,0,0,0

This study demonstrates the degradation of fragmented microplastics particularly low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film in water. through visible light-induced plasmonic photocatalysts comprising of platinum nanoparticles deposited on zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods (ZnO-Pt). The ZnO-Pt nanocomposite photocatalysts were observed to have better degradation kinetics for a model organic dye (methylene blue) compared to bare ZnO nanorods. attributed to the plasmonic effects leading to better interfacial exciton separation and improved hydroxyl radical activity along with a 78% increase in visible light absorption. These demonstrations of the plasmonically enhanced photocatalyst enabled it to effectively degrade microplastic fragments as confirmed following the changes in carbonyl and vinyl indices in infrared absorption. In addition. visual proof of physical surface damage of the LDPE film establishes the efficacy of using plasmonically enhanced nanocomposite photocatalytic materials to tackle the microplastic menace using just sunlight for a clean and green approach towards mitigation of microplastics in the ecosystem.

Several SeCs have been reported to have albumin-binding ability. which is an important factor in determining the treatment efficacy of drugs. In the present investigation. we hypothesized that extracellular albumin might orchestrate SeCs efficacy. Four SeCs representing distinct categories were selected to investigate their cytotoxicity. cellular uptake. and species transformation. Concomitant treatment of albumin greatly decreased cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of SeCs. Using both X-ray absorption spectroscopy and hyphenated mass spectrometry. we confirmed the formation of macromolecular conjugates between SeCs and albumin. Although the conjugate was still internalized. possibly via albumin scavenger receptors expressed on the cell surface. the uptake was strongly inhibited by excess albumin. In summary. the present investigation established the importance of extracellular albumin binding in determining SeCs cytotoxicity. Due to the fact that albumin content is higher in humans and animals than in cell cultures. and varies among many patient categories. our results are believed to have high translational impact and clinical implications.

1267434,Energy efficieny policy and carbon pricing,2011,Lisa Ryan and Sara Moarif and Ellina Levina and Richard Baron,,,,,,The main message of this paper is that while carbon pricing is a prerequisite for least-cost carbon mitigation strategies. carbon pricing is not enough to overcome all the barriers to cost-effective energy efficiency actions. Energy efficiency policy should be designed carefully for each sector to ensure optimal outcomes for a combination of economic. social and climate change goals. This paper aims to examine the justification for specific energy efficiency policies in economies with carbon pricing in place. The paper begins with an inventory of existing market failures that attempt to explain the limited uptake of energy efficiency. These market failures are investigated to see which can be overcome by carbon pricing in two subsectors -- electricity use in residential appliances and heating energy use in buildings. This analysis finds that carbon pricing addresses energy efficiency market failures such as externalities and imperfect energy markets. However. several market and behavioural failures in the two subsectors are identified that appear not to be addressed by carbon pricing. These include: imperfect information; principal-agent problems; and behavioural failures. In this analysis. the policies that address these market failures are identified as complementary to carbon pricing and their level of interaction with carbon pricing policies is relatively positive. These policies should be implemented when they can improve energy efficiency effectively and efficiently (and achieve other national goals such as improving socio-economic efficiency).,True,omrBUAUAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,31,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21467292,8919413955826208127,/scholar?cites=8919413955826208127,,,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/21467292,0,0,0

The objective of this paper is to assess the value of utility-scale solar PV using a multidisciplinary approach. In many cases renewable energy strategies are developed by investors and policymakers on the basis of a relatively narrow analysis of costs.

1267450,Evaluating ozone depletion from very short‐lived halocarbons,2000,Seth C Olsen and Bryan J Hannegan and Xin Zhu and Michael J Prather,27,Geophysical research letters,10,1475-1478,,A new approach is needed for calculating the ozone depletion potential (ODP) of short‐lived gases with mean lifetimes less than 100 days. Clearly. the ozone loss from such gases depends strongly on the location and season of emissions. It is proposed that delivery to the tropical tropopause is a surrogate for the amount of halogen entering the stratosphere. Thus 3‐D global models. with accurate simulation of tropospheric chemistry and transport. can calculate the ODP specific to tropical sources (high) and high‐latitude sources (low). The ODP of CH2BrCH2CH3 from this analysis ranges from 0.0002 to 0.06 depending on the location and season of emissions.,True,6WGiFb4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,26,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1999GL011040,12268074903272849574,/scholar?cites=12268074903272849574,,,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/1999GL011040,0,0,0

This research investigated changes in the performance parameters of crystalline silicon solar cells caused by a thin film of magnesium fluoride (MgF{sub 2}) deposited on top of a silicon nitride (SiN{sub x}) film already deposited on the emitter layer of a solar cell. The MgF{sub 2} film depositions on crystalline cells of large area (125 mm x 125 mm) were carried out by using thermal evaporation under high vacuum ({approx}10{sup -6} Torr) with a special mask to protect the front metal contact on the busbars after cell fabrication. Significant improvements in the conversion efficiency (Eff) and the short-circuit current (I{sub sc}) of the cells were obtained after deposition of the MgF{sub 2} layer. Comparison of the unscaled quantum efficiencies (QE) before and after MgF{sub 2} deposition showed a significant improvement in spectral response. especially in the wavelength range above 700 nm.

1267495,Neural network versus econometric models in forecasting inflation,2000,Saeed Moshiri and Norman Cameron,19,Journal of forecasting,3,201-217,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Artificial neural network modelling has recently attracted much attention as a new technique for estimation and forecasting in economics and finance. The chief advantages of this new approach are that such models can usually find a solution for very complex problems. and that they are free from the assumption of linearity that is often adopted to make the traditional methods tractable. In this paper we compare the performance of Back‐Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPN) models with the traditional econometric approaches to forecasting the inflation rate. Of the traditional econometric models we use a structural reduced‐form model. an ARIMA model. a vector autoregressive model. and a Bayesian vector autoregression model. We compare each econometric model with a hybrid BPN model which uses the same set of variables.

Since the test results indicate that crude oil futures prices follow a complex nonlinear dynamic process. we expect that the ANN model will improve forecasting accuracy.

Ltd.,Asymmetry has been well documented in the business cycle literature. The asymmetric business cycle suggests that major macroeconomic series. such as a country's unemployment rate. are non‐linear and. therefore. the use of linear models to explain their behaviour and forecast their future values may not be appropriate. Many researchers have focused on providing evidence for the non‐linearity in the unemployment series. Only recently have there been some developments in applying non‐linear models to estimate and forecast unemployment rates. A major concern of non‐linear modelling is the model specification problem; it is very hard to test all possible non‐linear specifications. and to select the most appropriate specification for a particular model.

Iran’s rapidly growing own energy consumption (about 6 percent per year for the past 30 years) has raised concerns about the country’s ability to continue to export oil in the next decade. The main driving forces behind the rising trend of energy consumption are economic growth (5 percent for the past 40 years) and population growth (about 2 percent). and heavily subsidized energy markets (12 percent of the GDP)(Iran Energy Balance. 2010; Central Bank of Iran Economic Indicators. 2011).

Mexico may soon become a net total energy importer due to a decline in oil reserves and increasing domestic consumption. To increase efficiency in the energy market. Mexican authorities approved a constitutional amendment aiming to open the state-run energy markets to competition in 2013. The reform is expected to raise efficiency and to lower energy prices in the long run. However. it will take some time for the new institutional arrangements to settle and the reform objectives to materialize.

1267514,Natural resources. institutions quality. and economic growth; A cross-country analysis,2017,Saeed Moshiri and Sara Hayati,21,Iranian Economic Review,3,661-693,University of Tehran. Faculty of Economics,Natural resources as a source of wealth can increase prosperity or impede economic growth.  Empirical studies with different specifications and data are also mixed on whether natural resources are curse or blessing. In fact. the variety of model specifications. measurements. and samples in the empirical literature makes it difficult to generalize the results. In this study. a growth model including natural resources is developed to estimate the effect of natural resource dependency on economic growth. using different measures of natural resources and controlling for the quality of institutions in 149 countries during 1996-2010. The results show that natural resource abundance. proxied by per capita natural wealth. has a positive and significant effect on GDP growth.  However. the impact of natural resource dependency on GDP growth depends on the type of natural resources and the quality of institutions. Fuel dependency. for example. can be considered a strong curse. as it has no effect on GDP growth. and agriculture and food dependency a weak curse. as it can increase GDP growth in the presence of good institutional qualities. Results also show that among different indexes used for institutional qualities. government effectiveness. regulatory quality. and rule of law are more effective in avoiding the negative effect of resource dependency. The thresholds above which different types of institutional qualities can turn a curse to a blessing are also estimated for different types of natural resource dependency.     [1].

The main idea is that although a complex system. such as world. seems to be generated by a random. and therefore. unpredictable process. it may run by a nonlinear deterministic process. Chaos theory has been applied to some Economic time series to see if they have an order. and. therefore. predictable. Some Economic time series. such as stock prices. look random. but. according to the chaos theory. they may come from a nonlinear deterministic process. If the data generating process is nonlinear. using traditional linear methods in estimation and forecasting can be misleading. Chaos theory is also applied to macroeconomic models. Some macroeconomic concepts. such as endogenous business cycles. can now be explained by the theory. In this paper. I try to review the chaos theory and its mathematical root for economists. Then.

However. energy intensity has been declining. on average. by about 1.4 percent since 1980. In this paper. we use the Fisher Ideal Index to determine the contribution of changes in the composition of economic activities and efficiency to a decline in energy intensity in Canada at national. provincial. and industry levels. We also apply panel data estimation methods to further investigate the factors driving energy intensity. efficiency and activity indexes for the period 1981-2008. We test for endogeneity as well as cross-section dependency in the provincial data and control for factors such as climate. policy. and energy endowment. The national and provincial decomposition results suggest that most of the reduction in energy intensity has occurred mainly due to improvements in energy efficiency rather than shifts in economic activities. Within the industry. while energy intensity has declined significantly in manufacturing. it has remained stable in transportation. utilities. and construction. and increased significantly in oil extraction and mining industries. The provincial panel regression results indicate that energy intensity is higher in provinces with higher average incomes. faster population growth. colder climate. and a higher capital-labour ratio. and lower in provinces with higher energy prices and higher investment.

This was with a view to recommending policy measures that could enhance the participation and performance of women in technological businesses. Primary data were collected from 210 micro and small scale enterprises owned by women using structured questionnaire and the Raosoft sample size calculator based on the normal distribution statistical method. Secondary data were also used. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed for data analysis. The study revealed that learning mechanisms such as television. trade fairs and community outreach programmes significantly influenced the choice of technological ventures. Factors such as educational background. prior training in venture. role model. socio-cultural factor. and age also influenced the choice of ventures. Furthermore. the performance of the businesses and respondents were significantly influenced by variables such as business premise status. retraining opportunities. systematic planning and monitoring among others.

The paper adopts Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) and Error Correction Model (ECM) to test the causality between real GDP and electricity consumption. The order of integration of the two variables was determined using Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test which was followed by co-integration and causality test. The result shows that there is unidirectional causality from real GDP to electricity consumption without a feedback effect. This could be attributed to the low level of electricity consumption. engendered by low level of electricity generation. which is too small to cause economic growth. There is need for government to diversify the energy mix to include all the untapped potentials of renewable power options such as small hydro. wind. solar and biomass among others in all the states and local constituencies. Energy wastages should be curtailed through proper efficiency measures and different pricing system. It is also suggested that government should make policies which will create an enabling environment for the private sector to generate electricity from renewable sources in terms of fiscal incentives such as tax rebate. subsidies and low import duties for the imported equipment among others.

The paper investigates the impact of R&D and innovation. labour and capital on economic growth in Nigeria using Least Square Method. The result of the thirty one (31) years (1977-2007) reviewed shows that Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) has significant impact on economic growth. The coefficient of R&D which is negatively related to economic growth implies that it is not enough to increase spending on R&D and innovation when there are weak institutions. high corruption practices. low interaction between the academia and the industry. uncoordinated industrial clusters. among others.

The attainment of development goals requires a painstaking process of policy-making based on scientific evidence derivable from relevant evidence. However. in many developing countries. there is a gap between policy and development priorities as most policies are not based on scientific facts either because they are unavailable or. where they exist. unreliable. Using a system analysis framework. the article brings into perspective the fundamental role played by STI indicators in providing scientific evidence for designing. formulating and implementing national innovation policy.

Although innovation is important for superior firm performance. our result found that the type of innovation that SMEs pursue is not a critical consideration in their performance. While there was no difference found in the focus of SMEs on either of product or process innovations. evidence showed that SMEs would focus more on incremental product and process innovations. Incremental innovation was found to be very important for Nigerian SMEs and a significant predictor of product quality and not of revenue. The authors conclude that SMEs chooses to pursue such innovations that most fit their strategies and available resources. Such level of innovation affords Nigerian SMEs to more extensively exploit the domestic market but cannot support extensive new product development required to enter export markets.,True,1Qlt1BgAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,24,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/id/eprint/25338,9094266515739819352,/scholar?cites=9094266515739819352,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/25338/3/MPRA_paper_25338.pdf,0,0,0

1267545,Innovation systems and capabilities in developing regions: Concepts. issues and cases,2016,WilliE Siyanbola and Olumuyiwa Olamade,,,,,Routledge,In today's knowledge-driven world. innovation and innovation systems have become key policy issues. However. the extent of knowledge that is available on these concepts in less developed countries is still relatively low. Much of what we know about innovation theory and systems has come from the developed countries and reflects their world view. This apparent knowledge deficit has major implications for less developed countries. Innovation Systems and Capabilities in Developing Regions adds to the growing body of knowledge on developing countries. The theoretical and empirical case studies presented here advance the notion that. while developing countries may not engage in frontier research. a critical knowledge base upon which these countries compete for global markets is emerging. There is evidence that state and non-state actors are increasingly emphasising policies that sit within the framework of national innovation systems. This book illuminates this shift in policy competence at national levels. The contributions in this volume highlight the need for thorough understanding of the role of diffusion-based innovation linked to technology transfer and acquisition. They also provide empirical evidence on the drivers. dynamics and impact of such innovation in developing economies and the constraints that apply.

We apply bounds testing techniques to different energy types separately. Robustness tests are performed by including additional variables and restricting the analysis to the period after 1970. The results show that there exist robust long-run relationships going from real GDP toward heating oil and electricity consumption. The relationship between heating oil and GDP is in fact bidirectional. although weaker from heating oil toward GDP than in the reverse direction. When investigating the period 1970–2010 only. the estimate of the long-run income elasticity of electricity consumption loses statistical significance and that for heating oil becomes negative. Those results imply a possible decoupling between GDP growth and energy consumption. so that energy conservation policies …,True,BO9E1QEAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,116,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988312002290,735085811955312231,/scholar?cites=735085811955312231,,,https://doc.rero.ch/record/30489/files/gdp-energy-revision_ee-sep12_final.pdf,0,0,0

We investigate the hypothesis that industries with high adaptive capacity (measured by their relative level of labour compensation) are able to mitigate the adverse effects of energy tax rises better than others.

We find that the negative marginal effect of higher energy taxes on TFP and net trade is significantly reduced for industries with stronger human capital and even turns to an overall positive effect in at least two cases.

Following a review of the alternative architectures for the next Climate Change Agreement. the paper outlines four areas in which trade will play a role: as a purveyor of technological transfer; as a mechanism to separate where abatement takes place from who bears the cots of abatement; as a participation mechanism; and as a way to address the pressures for border adjustments. Political-economy considerations are invoked to predict that a target system with a carbon credit system will be preferable to a carbon tax or to a portfolio system of treaties. A review of evidence on the extent of pollution haven effects suggests that these should be small under climate mitigation policies. especially if efforts are undertaken to raise the price of energy. A discussion of border measures to complement mitigation policies suggests that they are unlikely to be found compatible with the environmental exceptions allowed under article XX of the GATT. The review concludes that an umbrella agreement with leeway where much initial mitigation would first take place unilaterally as under the early days of the GATT might be the most promising way ahead while preserving an open World Trading System and environmental integrity.,True,BO9E1QEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,30,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1711045,14606868148056297157,/scholar?cites=14606868148056297157,,,https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:55403/ATTACHMENT01,0,0,0

Decomposing world-wide SO2 emissions 1990-2000,2007,Jean-Marie Grether and Nicole A Mathys and Jaime De Melo,,,,,University of Geneva,This paper proposes three simple exercises to estimate the impact of trade on worldwide SO2 emissions over the 1990-2000 period. Combining three emission data sources (IPPS. EDGAR and Stern.(2006)) with sectoral output and employment data. we construct a database with time. country and sector-specific emission coefficients. A first growthdecomposition exercise shows that the scale and technique effects are the main driving force behind global changes in SO2 emissions. Contrarily to the concerns raised by environmentalists. the influence of trade. captured by the composition effects. is more limited and leads to a small reduction in emissions. A second exercise compares the actual trade situation with an autarky benchmark. It shows that trade. by allowing clean countries to become net importers of emissions. leads to a rough 10% increase in world emissions with respect to autarky in 1990. but that this figure shrinks to 3.5% in 2000. This decrease in the effect is consistent with the negative composition effects found in the first exercise. A third exercise uses linear programming to simulate extreme situations where world emissions are either maximal or minimal. It turns out that effective emissions correspond to a 90% reduction with respect to the worst case. but that another 80% reduction could be reached if emissions were minimal.,True,BO9E1QEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,26,http://pseweb.eu/ydepot/semin/texte0607/MEL2007TRA.pdf,15959556740723827528,/scholar?cites=15959556740723827528,,,http://pseweb.eu/ydepot/semin/texte0607/MEL2007TRA.pdf,0,0,0

The Swiss government collects travel data since 1974. The last data collection took place in 2015 using computer assisted phone interviews (CATI). A large literature has identified disadvantages of these surveys (respondent fatigue. missing trips. high costs and non-panel nature) and suggests using data from an App on the smartphone of the respondent. An App gives access to sensor data. including GPS. The prevalence of smartphones in the population is large (78% of the population between 15 and 74 years old in Switzerland in 2016) but challenges still exist before using smartphone data in an official representative large scale survey.

1267598,Reconciling trade and climate policies,2012,Jaime De Melo and Nicole A Mathys,,,,,CEPR Discussion Paper No. DP8760,The outcome of the 15th conference of the Parties to the UNFCC showed a shift from a top-down approach with a collective target favoring environmental objectives to a bottom-up accord favoring political feasibility. There is no meaningful binding agreement in sight. also because the global climate regime and the global trade policy regime. represented by the WTO. appear to be on a collision course. Following a review of the challenges ahead. the paper argues that trade will have a second-order contribution to world-wide CO2 emissions. Evidence shows increasing carbon transfers through trade. but the magnitude of carbon leakage effects. likely to be induced by differences in climate mitigation policies. may be less than feared in some circles. Trade policy. however. will play a role in implementing climate mitigation policies in two areas: maintaining an open trading system and hence boosting growth and facilitating technological diffusion. and trade policy as a strategic instrument in negotiations. The paper concludes that an agreement with a few guiding principles and leeway where much initial mitigation would first take place unilaterally or in small groups. as under the early days of the GATT. is the most promising way ahead while preserving an open trading system and environmental integrity.,True,BO9E1QEAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,5,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1988691,12672985704354743414,/scholar?cites=12672985704354743414,,,https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:55409/ATTACHMENT01,0,0,0

The disturbance is detected by comparing the transformed signal with an empirically given threshold. However. as the signal under analysis contains noises. especially the white noise with flat spectrum. the threshold is difficult to give. Due to the nature of the flat spectrum. a filter cannot just get rid of the noise without removing the significant disturbance signals together. To enhance the WT technique in processing the noise-riding signals. this paper proposes a noise-suppression algorithm. The abilities of the WT in detecting and localizing the disturbances can hence be restored.

To effectively reduce the number of features representing load turn-on/off transient signals. an energy spectrum of the WTCs in different scales calculated by the Parseval's Theorem are proposed and presented in this paper. The back-propagation (BP) classification system is then used for artificial neural network (ANN) constructions and load identifications. The high successful rates of load events recognition from both experiments and simulations have proved that the proposed algorithm is applicable in multiple load operations of non-intrusive demand monitoring applications.,True,Jdz4y6kAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,12,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6682478/,4345939436961154444,/scholar?cites=4345939436961154444,,,,0,0,0
1267620,Non-intrusive fault identification of power distribution systems in intelligent buildings based on power-spectrum-based wavelet transform,2016,Hsueh-Hsien Chang,127,Energy and Buildings,,930-941,Elsevier,A new approach for protection of power distribution systems in intelligent buildings has been presented in this paper. Directly adopting the wavelet transform coefficients (WTCs) requires longer computation time and larger memory requirements for the non-intrusive fault monitoring (NIFM) identification process. However. the WTCs contain plenty of information needed for the symmetric and asymmetric transient signals of fault events. To effectively reduce the number of WTCs representing fault transient signals without degrading performance. a power spectrum of the WTCs in different scales calculated by Parseval’s Theorem is proposed in this paper. In this paper. artificial neural networks (ANNs). in combination with power-spectrum-based wavelet transform. are used to identify fault types and locations in power distribution systems of industrial buildings by using NIFM.

1267621,A novel nonintrusive fault identification for power transmission networks using power-spectrum-based hyperbolic S-transform—Part I: Fault classification,2018,Hsueh-Hsien Chang and Nguyen Viet Linh and Wei-Jen Lee,,,,1-21,IEEE,This paper presents a novel nonintrusive protection scheme for fault classification of power transmission networks in a wide-area measurement system (WAMS) using fault information for decision making. The protection scheme is a non-communication without GPS as it depends completely on locally measured currents for the non-intrusive fault monitoring (NIFM) using the power-spectrum-based hyperbolic S-transform (PS-HST). In this work. the HST is used to extract the high frequency components of the current signals generated by an electric fault. To effectively select the HST coefficients (HSTCs) representing fault transient signals with increasing performance. a power spectrum of the HSTCs in different scales calculated by Parseval's Theorem is proposed in this paper. Finally. back-propagation artificial neural networks (BP-ANNs) and PS-HST are used to identify fault types in power transmission networks.

1267622,Statistical feature extraction for fault locations in nonintrusive fault detection of low voltage distribution systems,2017,Hsueh-Hsien Chang and Nguyen Viet Linh,10,Energies,5,611,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper proposes statistical feature extraction methods combined with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for fault locations in non-intrusive single-line-to-ground fault (SLGF) detection of low voltage distribution systems. The input features of the AI algorithms are extracted using statistical moment transformation for reducing the dimensions of the power signature inputs measured by using non-intrusive fault monitoring (NIFM) techniques. The data required to develop the network are generated by simulating SLGF using the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) in a test system. To enhance the identification accuracy. these features after normalization are given to AI algorithms for presenting and evaluating in this paper. Different AI techniques are then utilized to compare which identification algorithms are suitable to diagnose the SLGF for various power signatures in a NIFM system. The simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and can identify the fault locations by using non-intrusive monitoring techniques for low voltage distribution systems.

However. the RWHS's limitations. i.e. the influences due to the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall. have not been properly addressed in developing a scientific system for RWHS design. This study establishes a GIS- based decision supporting system (DSS) incorporating hydraulic simulation and economic analysis (Benefit - Cost-Ratio. B/C). and uses the rooftop RWHSs in Taipei City as a case study. Two RWHS designs were tested in DSS to visualize the spatial distribution of the reliability and B/C ratio. and to seek the optimum design. Sensitivity analysis also verifies that the DSS renders higher information value than the traditional generalized method.

However. at the nanoscale. a well‐organized repetition of bilayers is found and thus V2O5·nH2O can be considered a nanostructured material. Synthesis route affects the morphological and structural characteristics of V2O5·nH2O and. depending on the drying method used. xerogel and aerogel are obtained. The reduced structural order. the large interlayer space and the short diffusion length that this class of material offer are the key factors that allow V2O5·nH2O to reversibly host cations that are different in charge and dimensions. These properties make bilayered V2O5·nH2O materials almost unique for the wide range of applicability in metal batteries.

1267728,Evaluation of carbon-coated graphite as a negative electrode material for Li-ion batteries,2017,Varvara Sharova and Arianna Moretti and Guinevere A Giffin and Diogo Vieira Carvalho and Stefano Passerini,3,C—Journal of Carbon Research,3,22,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Low-cost and environmentally-friendly materials are investigated as carbon-coating precursors to modify the surface of commercial graphite for Li-ion battery anodes. The coating procedure and final carbon content are tuned to study the influence of the precursors on the electrochemical performance of graphite. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis are used to characterize the carbon coating content and the surface area. respectively. whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy allow tracking of the graphite’s structural changes and surface amorphization. In general. the coating reduces the first cycle coulombic efficiency by 3%–10% compared to pristine graphite due to the increase of the surface area available for the continuous electrolyte decomposition. However. the use of citric acid as a carbon source (5 wt%) improves the rate capability of graphite. resulting in the specific delithiation capacity at 3C of 228 mAh g− 1 vs. 211 mAh g− 1 for the uncoated graphite. The attempt to reduce the coating amount from 5 wt% to 2 wt% results in a lower rate capability. but the first cycle coulombic efficiency is similar to that of pristine graphite.

The cost of living has gone up. and for many the standard of living is going down with a corresponding increase in fuel poverty. Even for larger companies the cost of energy is beginning to feature in boardroom discussions. How can comfortable working and living conditions be maintained for the majority in such a world. especially with the added uncertainty of climate change?The answer must be by thinking differently. Unless thermal comfort research addresses such issues it risks becoming marginalized.

Equally important are the kinds of new housing produced by the speculative volume building model. and the communities and neighbourhoods that result.

It sets out the first stage for exploring the possibility that repeated short term experiences can modify people's long term thermal history and thermal memory towards a better thermal adaptation. Data from 50 lobby spaces in Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the UK was collected in order to identify lobby typologies. Fieldwork was carried out during the summer of 2013 in three different buildings in Sheffield. UK.

In order to compare the effect of the side chains on the opto-electronic and photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers. the benzodithiophene monomers were substituted with either octylthienyl (PTzBDT-1) or dihexylthienyl (PTzBDT-2) as side groups. while the benzotriazole unit was maintained unaltered. The optical characterization. both in solution and thin-film. indicated that PTzBDT-1 has a red-shifted optical absorption compared to PTzBDT-2. likely due to a more planar conformation of the polymer backbone promoted by the lower content of alkyl side chains. The different aggregation in the solid state also affects the energetic properties of the polymers. resulting in a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for PTzBDT-1 with respect to PTzBDT-2. However. an unexpected behaviour is observed when the two polymers are used as a donor material. in combination with PC 61 BM as acceptor. in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Even though PTzBDT-1 showed favourable optical and electrochemical properties. the devices based on this polymer present a power conversion efficiency of 3.3%. considerably lower than the efficiency of 4.7% obtained for the analogous solar cells based on PTzBDT-2. The lower performance is presumably attributed to the limited solubility of the PTzBDT-1 in organic solvents resulting in enhanced aggregation and poor intermixing with the acceptor material in the active layer.,True,5kXH8cIAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C,19,https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/articles/1860-5397-12-160,1857468970312836210,/scholar?cites=1857468970312836210,,,https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc/articles/1860-5397-12-160,0,0,0

1267806,Design. Synthesis and Modelling of Conjugated Polymers for Organic Photovoltaics,2013,Wenliu Zhuang,,,,,,Secure. clean and renewable energy sources are believed to be the eventual solution for sustainable energy. especially by the direct utilization of solar energy. Organic photovoltaics offer such an option to convert solar energy into electricity based on solution-processed. lightweight. large-area. and potentially flexible devices. The current challenges for organic photovoltaics remain to further improve efficiency as well as durability and cost-effectiveness. to compete with traditional silicon-based solar cells.  Material design through band gap and energy level tuning has been playing a key role in developing new donor materials for efficient polymer solar cells. Computationally driven material design can accelerate the search for optimal conjugated polymers. and the exploration of chemical methodologies is highly desirable in pushing the efficiency further toward the theoretical limit. This thesis deals with the design. synthesis. characterization. and computational modelling of π-conjugated polymers for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells. It focuses on material design of conjugated donor polymers through band gap and energy level engineering via structural modifications such as backbone manipulations. side-chain engineering. as well as incorporation of newly developed building blocks. This also establishes structure–property relationships of the polymer systems here studied. and explores potential chemical methodologies for future judicious material design.,True,5kXH8cIAAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC,0,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/188968/188968.pdf,,,,,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/188968/188968.pdf,0,0,0

Though many solutions for environmental measuring based on wireless sensor networks exist. they are not easily accessible to households and building owners who may lack time or technical expertise needed to set up a system and get quick and detailed overview of environmental conditions. Building-in-Briefcase (BiB) is a portable sensor network platform that is trivially easy to deploy in any building environment. Once the sensors are distributed. the environmental data is collected and communicated to the BiB router via the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and WiFi technology. which then forwards the data to the central database securely over the internet through a 3G radio. The user. with minimal effort. can access the aggregated data and visualize the trends in real time on the BiB web portal. Paramount to the adoption and continued operation of an indoor sensing platform is battery lifetime. This design has achieved a multi-year lifespan by careful selection of components. an efficient binary communications protocol and data compression. Our BiB sensor is capable of collecting a rich set of environmental parameters. and is expandable to measure others. such as CO 2. This paper describes the power characteristics of BiB sensors and their occupancy estimation and activity recognition functionality. We have demonstrated large-scale deployment of BiB throughout Singapore.

We show that by regulating the partial gradients of policies. strong guarantees of robust stability can be obtained based on a proposed semidefinite programming feasibility problem. The method is able to certify a large set of stabilizing controllers by exploiting problem-specific structures; furthermore. we analyze and establish its (non)conservatism.

In addition. large thermal preference variance amongst people requires the development of personal thermal comfort models. rather than group-based methodologies such as predicted mean vote (PMV). This study focuses on assessing wearable solutions with the aim to predict personal thermal preference. We collected physiological signals (e.g.. skin temperature. heart rate) of 14 subjects (6 female and 8 male adults) and environmental parameters (e.g.. air temperature. wind speed. solar radiation. precipitation) for two weeks (at least 20 hr/d) to infer personal real-time thermal preference. The subjects reported their real-time thermal sensation and preference using cell-phones approximately every hour. We trained a Random Forest algorithm using data collected from individuals to develop a personal comfort model with the objective to predict thermal preference. The results show that subjects expressed needs for ""warmer"" or ""cooler"" conditions at about 30% (from 21% to 88%) of their daily time on average. implying the strong demand for a personalized indoor thermal comfort.

Top-down and Bottom-up approaches are discussed with a focus on the latter for better integration with occupant information. Compared to the Time-Of-Use (TOU) data used in previous Bottom-up models. this work utilizes high frequency sampled appliance power consumption data from wireless sensor network. and hence builds an appliance-data-driven probability based end-use energy profile model. ON/OFF probabilities of appliances are used in this model. to build a non-homogeneous Markov Chain. compared to the duration statistics based model that is widely used in other works. The simulation results show the capability of the model to capture the diversity and variability of different categories of end-use appliance energy profile. which can further help on the design of a modern robust building power system.,True,YdxdTtkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,20,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7049322/,5123653261324041738,/scholar?cites=5123653261324041738,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6133,0,0,0

The applications for fine-grained. responsive building operations require the location sensing systems to provide location estimates in real time. also known as indoor tracking. Existing indoor tracking systems require occupants to carry specialized devices or install programs on their smartphone to collect inertial sensing data. In this paper. we propose MapSentinel. which performs non-intrusive location sensing based on WiFi access points and ultrasonic sensors. MapSentinel combines the noisy sensor readings with the floormap information to estimate locations. One key observation supporting our work is that occupants exhibit distinctive motion characteristics at different locations on the floormap. eg. constrained motion along the corridor or in the cubicle zones. and free movement in the open space. While extensive research has been performed on using a floormap as a tool to obtain correct walking trajectories without wall-crossings. there have been few attempts to incorporate the knowledge of space use available from the floormap into the location estimation. This paper argues that the knowledge of space use as an additional information source presents new opportunities for indoor tracking. The fusion of heterogeneous information is theoretically formulated within the Factor Graph framework. and the Context-Augmented Particle Filtering algorithm is developed to efficiently solve real-time walking trajectories. Our evaluation in a large office space shows that the MapSentinel can achieve accuracy improvement of 31.3% compared with the …,True,YdxdTtkAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,18,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/4/472,4425416177158360661,/scholar?cites=4425416177158360661,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/4/472/pdf,0,0,0

The aim of the papers of this review is to study how this framework can guide the use and improvement of detailed methods and tools. in particular to support Sustainable Product Innovation (SPI). First. a new strategic life-cycle management approach is presented. in which the selection of aspects to be considered are not based on typical downstream impact categories. but on identified major violations of sustainability principles.

1267847,Electric road systems: Strategic stepping stone on the way towards sustainable freight transport?,2018,Jesko Schulte and Henrik Ny,10,Sustainability,4,1148,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Electrification of the transport sector has been pointed out as a key factor for tackling some of today’s main challenges. such as global warming. air pollution. and eco-system degradation. While numerous studies have investigated the potential of electrifying passenger transport. less focus has been on how road freight transport could be powered in a sustainable future. This study looks at Electric Road Systems (ERS) in comparison to the current diesel system. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development was used to assess whether ERS could be a stepping stone on the way towards sustainability. Strategic life-cycle assessment was applied. scanning each life-cycle phase for violations against basic sustainability principles. Resulting sustainability “hot spots” were quantified with traditional life-cycle assessment. The results show that. if powered by renewable energy. ERS have a potential to decrease the environmental impact of freight transport considerably. Environmental payback times of less than five years are achievable if freight traffic volumes are sufficiently high. However. some severe violations against sustainability principles were identified. Still. ERS could prove to be a valuable part of the solution. as they drastically decrease the need for large batteries with high cost and sustainability impact. thereby catalyzing electrification and the transition towards sustainable freight transport.

1267848,Context-adapted urban planning for rapid transitioning of personal mobility towards sustainability: A systematic literature review,2019,Varvara Nikulina and David Simon and Henrik Ny and Henrikke Baumann,11,,4,1007,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Sustainability related challenges in mobility planning have been recognised at the international level. and the urgency for change has been widely discussed among scholars. However. there seems to be no general agreement on the best ways to pursue such change. To seek answers to the question of how to pursue change. this study analysed the development of the broad research fields of mobility. urban planning and transitions. and the overlap of these bodies of literature. Both academic and non-academic literatures were covered. By means of a systematic literature review. as well as bibliometric studies. several prominent research themes that address change from planning and transition perspectives were identified. Moreover. these themes describe different viewpoints and challenges in mobility planning. These include planning and policy for sustainable mobility and accessibility. backcasting and scenario planning. indicators in planning. modes of transport. decision-making. studies of global North and global South. as well as overarching themes of equity. equality and justice. roles of institutions. and co-production of knowledge. Strategies for staying up to date with these fields were also identified. In the literature covered. the temporal dimension in mobility planning was described in four different ways. but little was found about how accelerated transitions towards sustainable mobility can be achieved. Further knowledge gaps were identified in relation to behavioural change. policy development. institutionalisation of planning capacity. and social sustainability in mobility planning. This created an outline for possible future studies.

1267849,Benefits of a product service system approach for long-life products: the case of light tubes,2010,Anthony Thompson and Henrik Ny and Pia Lindahl and Göran Broman and Mikael Severinsson,,,,,Linköping University,Products designed for long-life often have significant potential for better sustainability performance than standard products due to less material and energy usage for a given service provided. which usually also results in a lower total cost. These benefits are not always obvious or appealing to customers. who often focus on price. Long-life products are therefore at an inherent disadvantage: due to lower volume of sales that results from the products’ longer-life. the margins (price) often need to be higher. In this paper. we demonstrate that when the revenue base is shifted to be the service of light (instead of the sales of light tubes). there is an opportunity for a “win-win-win” for the light user. the long-life light provider and society. Through a product-service system approach. resulting in a well-communicated total offer. the full array of benefits becomes clearer to the customer. including that they avoid the high initial cost.,True,-6D53YUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,15,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:835170,2558760437494963420,/scholar?cites=2558760437494963420,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:835170/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

On the basis of a previous study. conducted by relying upon a modal analysis. the interactions between the thermal inertia of a building and the variation of the air exchange rate have been explained. It can then be shown that the notion of useful thermal mass has herein been altered in order to take the thermal inertia of the building into account; it would then be suitable to substitute this notion for an approximated calculation of the building's main time constant.

A computational methodology based on a finite element method is developed. It is then employed to determine the optimal cathode design. i.e.. the design that minimizes the energy losses and maximizes the lifetime of the cell. The effect of various design parameters on the current distribution is highlighted. Their economic impacts on the operation of the cell are also assessed.,True,CH3z59gAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,13,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65136-1_107,8524878967447715585,/scholar?cites=8524878967447715585,,,,0,0,0

These deposits have a high electrical and thermal resistivity. Hence. they disturb the electrical current path at the aluminum and cathode block interface. The phase diagrams of deposits with a typical composition were calculated by thermodynamic equilibrium. and the results were confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The ledge toe is mainly composed by Na3AlF6(ss). Al2O3(s). and liquid bath in industrial cells. The liquid fraction in the deposits at temperature lower than 933 °C is due to the presence of Na5Al3F14. Na2Ca3Al2F14. and NaCaAlF6 and depends on [Al2O3]. [CaF2] and the cryolite ratio (CR).

This study analyzes the impact of high temperatures. heatwaves. and the urban heat island on the cardiovascular and respiratory mortality of people over 65 years of age for the years 2002 to 2012. The area of application is Athens. Greece. an urban agglomeration experiencing an urban heat island of high intensity. The correlation of the daily cardiovascular and respiratory mortality count of people over 65 years of age with various temperature measures confirmed a U-shaped exposure response curve. with fewer deaths in the range of moderate temperatures. At high and very high temperatures. this mortality increased by 20 to 35% correspondingly. at a 99.9% significance level. Mortality was further investigated with ordinary least squares. Poisson. and negative binomial times series models. which. although suffering from poor fit. showed a one-day lag for the maximum temperature effect on mortality. Finally. cluster analysis for observations confined to May to September. confirmed by multiple discriminant analysis. showed the existence of six clusters. with the highest excess mortality count of 23% for the cluster that included the hottest days and 20.6% for the heatwave cluster. To this end. it is recommended that policies target high ambient temperatures and heatwaves as a priority.

Within 2004. personnel wages and fuel cost increased by 4.5% and 19.3% respectively. effecting an 8.4% increase on the average operating cost of a ship. Shipping companies may not afford the operation of fast vessels as long as fuel prices are maintained at high levels and island traffic demand remains low. This paper models the operation of passenger vessels as a linear programming problem on a network of 37 nodes in the Aegean. We consider (a) conventional vessels with an operating speed of 17 knots. consuming transportation diesel on a typical 17000 hp engine and having an average capacity of 900 passengers and (b) fast vessels with an operating speed of 28 knots. using IFO on a 30000 hp engine and with an average capacity of 500 passengers.

Comparing the 2010-11 winter to the harsher winter of 2011-12 showed that inhabitants consumed less energy during the winter of 2011-12 because of the rapid economic degradation. Important conclusions were drawn regarding the energy consumption of the households which during the harsh winter 2011-12 was 37% less than expected. Cluster analysis rendered two distinct clusters: three fourths of the households belonged to the lower income group that lived in a smaller space. had half the income and consumed more specific energy compared to the high income group. although much less than expected based on the degree hours of the second winter. One out of three higher-income and one out of four lower-income households adopted some conservation measures after the first winter while 2% of the higher income households and 14% of the lower-income households were below the fuel poverty threshold.

Computations are carried out using a three-dimensional modeling for sprays. spray-wall interactions. flow field. emission. and combustion process. Results indicate an increase in engine speed leads to increased spray impinging (wall film formation). turbulence intensity and average wall temperature in cylinder. The enhanced air/fuel mixing and intensified evaporation of wall film decreases soot emission by reducing the extent of the fuel rich regions specially in impinging zones. Also at higher engine speeds. combustion is delayed and fuel is consumed in a shorter time period by the enhanced air and fuel mixing.

NOx formation is a highly temperature-dependent phenomenon and takes place when the temperature in the combustion chamber exceeds 2000 K. Therefore. in order to reduce NOx emissions in the exhaust. it is necessary to keep peak combustion temperatures under control.One simple way of reducing the NOx emission of a diesel engine is by late injection of fuel into the combustion chamber. This technique is effective but increases fuel consumption by 10–15%. which necessitates the use of more effective NOx reduction techniques like exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Re-circulating part of the exhaust gas helps in reducing NOx. but appreciable paniculate emissions are observed at high loads. hence there is a trade-off between NOx and smoke emission.

Comparisons include both mean velocity and turbulent intensity cross-wake profiles at a range of tip speed ratios. The application of PIV to the study of wind turbine wakes is described in detail. including the steps required to ensure appropriate and accurate simulation of the flow field conditions. The results suggest that the PIV method is a potentially useful tool in the investigation of detailed wake flow. though significant differences are observed between wake velocity deficits at full- and model scale.

Dust collected from two different locations. Babuin. Indonesia and Perth. Australia. was coated artificially onto the surface of glass of the PV modules. The analysis revealed that dust from Babuin was dominated by larger size and porous particles so that it passed more light than ones from Perth. Dust from Perth with angular and diagonal shapes had better optical property than that from Babuin featuring elliptical and spheroid particles. As a result. transmittance values of the two types of dust tend to balance out. For an equivalent amount. the effect of dust from Babuin and Perth on the performance degradation of each PV technology was similar.

IEC61400-2 is valid for a rooftop wind installation,2015,Amir Bashirzadeh Tabrizi and Jonathan Whale and Thomas Lyons and Tania Urmee,139,Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics,,50-61,Elsevier,The use of small grid-connected wind turbines is increasing within the built environment. yet atmospheric turbulence in this environment is more complex than the open terrain sites on which the turbine design standards are based. The current IEC61400-2 design standard uses stochastic turbulence models adapted from the von Karman and Kaimal power spectra in order to simulate flow fields that are used by designers to predict structural loading on small wind turbines. Both spectra are based on observations in the atmospheric surface layer developed over flat. smooth and uniform terrain yet IEC61400-2 does not offer any modifications of the spectra for more complex terrain such as that which exists in the built environment.

Two different flow situations were created in a wind tunnel using an active grid. Both flows exhibit nearly equal mean velocity values and turbulence intensities but strongly differ in their two point statistics. namely their distribution of velocity increments on a variety of timescales. one being Gaussian distributed. and the other one being strongly intermittent. A horizontal axis model wind turbine is exposed to both flows. isolating the effect on the turbine of the differences not captured by mean values and turbulence intensities. Thrust. torque and power data were recorded and analyzed. showing that the model turbine does not smooth out intermittency. Intermittent inflow is converted to similarly intermittent turbine data on all scales considered. reaching down to sub-rotor scales in space. This indicates that it is not correct to assume a smoothing of intermittent wind speed increments below the size of the rotor.,True,AB51ZKcAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC,17,https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/2/1/2017/,16910390583720451072,/scholar?cites=16910390583720451072,,,https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/2/1/2017/wes-2-1-2017.pdf,0,0,0

Between 2008 and 2010. military. airspace. or meteorological radar concerns in the US contributed to the delay or abandonment of an estimated 20.000 MW of wind energy capacity. These delays are a likely major factor influencing the current US Administration's failure to double non-hydro renewable generation from 2008 to 2011; a target stated by the US President in a joint session address to Congress in February 2009. The delays are also a threat to the US Department of Energy's target to produce 20% of electricity from wind energy by 2030 – unless radar-related barriers are mitigated.

1268014,Design and construction of a simple blade pitch measurement system for small wind turbines,2009,Jonathan Whale,34,Renewable energy,2,425-429,Pergamon,For small wind turbines to be reliable they must have in place good mechanisms to protect themselves against very high winds or sudden removal of load. One common protection method in small wind turbines is that of blade feathering. It is important that the blade feathering mechanism of a small wind turbine is tested before the turbine is installed in the field. This paper presents a simple system for monitoring the blade feathering of a turbine with an overall component cost that small wind turbine manufacturers can afford. The Blade Pitch Measurement System (BPMS) has been designed and constructed by the Research Institute of Sustainable Energy (RISE) and aids small wind turbine manufacturers in testing and optimising the settings of the blade feathering mechanisms on their machines.

In addition. TiO2 is a good semiconductor photocatalyst for the degradation of organic compounds. mainly because the redox potential of the H2O/· OH couple (OHÀ= OH+ eÀ; Eo= À2. 8V) lies within its band gap.[4] These properties depend on their size. shape. and crystal phase.[5–7] Among all TiO2 crystal phases. anatase TiO2 provides excellent applications.[8] Theoretical calculations have indicated that the {001} and {100} facets of anatase TiO2 are active facets with high surface energies. whereas the thermodynamically most stable surface facets are {101}.[9] According to the Wulff construction. the equilibrium shape of an anatase crystal is enclosed by the most stable {101} facets that account for 94% of the total surface. leading to limited activity for anatase crystals.[10] To enhance the activity of TiO2. strategies for the synthesis of welldefined anatase crystals with a large percentage of exposed high-energy {001} or {100} facets have been proposed.[11] For example. TiO2 nanocuboids [12] and nanorods [13] with large percentages of {100} facets exhibited higher photocatalytic activity (three times) than the commercial P25 for the reaction with hydroxyl radicals (· OH).[14] Dye-sensitized solar cells featuring TiO2 photoanodes with about 10%. 38%. and 80% exposed {001} facets provided overall conversion efficiencies of 7.47%. 8.14 …,True,zwKZMzAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,22,https://www.academia.edu/download/47633015/Synthesis_of_Anatase_SeTeTiO2_Nanorods_w20160729-26070-13e1f5g.pdf,5944094659596706236,/scholar?cites=5944094659596706236,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47633015/Synthesis_of_Anatase_SeTeTiO2_Nanorods_w20160729-26070-13e1f5g.pdf,0,0,0

Ag2Te NPs prepared from tellurium dioxide and silver nitrate and hydrazine in aqueous solution containing sodium dodecyl sulfate at 90ºC with an average size of 26.8 ± 4.1 nm (100 counts) have strong SERS activity. The Ag2Te substrate provides strong SERS signals of R6G with an enhancement factor of 3.6 × 105 at 1360 cm-1. which is comparable to Ag NPs. After interaction of Ag2Te NPs with Hg2+. some HgTe NPs are formed. leading to decreases in the SERS signal of R6G. mainly because HgTe NPs relative to Ag2Te NPs have weaker SERS activity. Under optimum conditions. this SERS approach using Ag2Te as substrates is selective for the detection of Hg2+. with a limit of detection of 3 nM and linearity over 10-150 nM.

The process is based on the reversible and quick carbonation/calcination reaction of CaO/CaCO​3 at high temperatures and allows using low cost. widely available and non toxic CaO precursors such as natural limestone. In this work. the efficiency penalty caused by the integration of the Ca-looping technology into a coal fired power plant is analyzed. The results of the simulations based on the proposed integration model show that efficiency penalty varies between 4% and 7% points. which yields lower energy costs than other more mature post-combustion CO2 capture technologies such as the currently commercial amine scrubbing technology. A principal feature of the CaL process at CO2 capture conditions is that it produces a large amount of energy and therefore …,True,U5VZ_AMAAAAJ:m92CDrhVnKEC,51,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916301738,3858017455020470663,/scholar?cites=3858017455020470663,,,,0,0,0

However. the overpressure predicted for the ignited release is two orders of magnitude greater. reaching over 55 kPA in less than 1 s and thus potentially causing destruction of the structure.It has been shown that whilst the overpressures resulting from the unignited release are unlikely to cause harm. the garage is engulfed by a flammable …,True,cIAJLToAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319918323541,14307903072018096457,/scholar?cites=14307903072018096457,,,https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/ws/files/12523342/HE_D_18_01093R1.pdf,0,0,0

Just recently. new sensors with higher sensitivities have been demonstrated by leveraging advanced on-chip designs and microfabrication processes. Yet. WSNs using such sensors require energy to transmit the sensed information. Consequently. they either contain batteries that need to be periodically replaced or energy harvesting circuits whose low efficiencies prevent a frequent and continuous sensing and impact the maximum range of communication. Here. we report a new chip-less and battery-less tag-based WSN that fundamentally breaks any previous paradigm. This WSN. formed by off-the-shelf lumped components on a printed substrate. can sense and transmit information without any need of supplied or harvested DC power. while enabling full-duplex transceiver designs for interrogating nodes rendering them immune to their own self-interference. Also. even though the reported WSN does not require any advanced and expensive manufacturing. its unique parametric dynamical behavior enables extraordinary sensitivities and dynamic ranges that can even surpass those achieved by on-chip sensors. The operation and performance of the first implementation of this new WSN are reported. This device operates in the Ultra-High-Frequency range and is capable to passively and continuously detect temperature changes remotely from an interrogating node.In the last decades. the continuously expanding …,True,cIAJLToAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,1,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-81763/latest.pdf,6835086410614800314,/scholar?cites=6835086410614800314,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-81763/latest.pdf,0,0,0

This waveform is then unfolded by a low frequency switching structure to produce a fully sinusoidal waveform. The Cuk SMPS could offer advantages over the buck in such applications. Unfortunately the Cuk converter is considered to be difficult to control using classical methods. Correct closed loop design is essential for stable operation of Cuk converters. Due to these stability issues. Cuk converter based designs often require stiff low bandwidth control loops. In order to achieve this stable closed loop performance. traditional designs invariably need large. unreliable electrolytic capacitors.

The deployment of energy storage in the distribution network provides an alternative to conventional reinforcement.

The control methodology pre-processes the forecast data prior to a planning phase to build in resilience to the inevitable errors between the forecasted and actual demand.

This paper presents a study on the control of such storage devices. owned by distribution network operators. A deterministic model predictive control (MPC) controller and a stochastic receding horizon controller (SRHC) are presented. where the objective is to achieve the greatest peak reduction in demand. for a given storage device specification. taking into account the high level of uncertainty in the prediction of LV demand. The algorithms presented in this paper are compared to a standard set-point controller and bench marked against a control algorithm with a perfect forecast. A specific case study. using storage on the LV network. is presented. and the results of each algorithm are compared. A comprehensive analysis is then carried out simulating a large number of LV networks of varying numbers of households. The results show that the performance of each algorithm is dependent on the number of aggregated households. However. on a typical aggregation. the novel SRHC algorithm presented in this paper is shown to outperform each of the comparable storage control techniques.

BESS are now being deployed on LV networks by Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) as an alternative to conventional reinforcement (e.g. upgrading cables and transformers) in response to increased electricity demand from new technologies such as electric vehicles.

1268107,Optimal power management strategy for energy storage with stochastic loads,2016,Stefano Pietrosanti and William Holderbaum and Victor M Becerra,9,Energies,3,175,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this paper. a power management strategy (PMS) has been developed for the control of energy storage in a system subjected to loads of random duration. The PMS minimises the costs associated with the energy consumption of specific systems powered by a primary energy source and equipped with energy storage. under the assumption that the statistical distribution of load durations is known. By including the variability of the load in the cost function. it was possible to define the optimality criteria for the power flow of the storage. Numerical calculations have been performed obtaining the control strategies associated with the global minimum in energy costs. for a wide range of initial conditions of the system. The results of the calculations have been tested on a MATLAB/Simulink model of a rubber tyre gantry (RTG) crane equipped with a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) and subjected to a test cycle. which corresponds to the real operation of a crane in the Port of Felixstowe. The results of the model show increased energy savings and reduced peak power demand with respect to existing control strategies. indicating considerable potential savings for port operators in terms of energy and maintenance costs.

This concept has since become known as a highly-non-Keplerian orbit (NKO) and has been extensively studied to establish the fundamental dynamics of the problem [2]. In the late 1970s and early 1980s. Driver [3] outlined one of the first applications of a highly-non-Keplerian orbit.

The accuracy of the estimated parameters has a direct impact on various functions of network operation. such as state estimation. fault location. and dynamic thermal line rating. Impedance parameters can be estimated from voltage and current measurements taken at the ends of the transmission line. Previous research has produced a range of methods with the purpose of maximizing the accuracy of the estimated values. However. the input measurements from the line ends can contain systematic errors that are introduced by the instrumentation channel and significantly reduce impedance parameter accuracy. which is not taken into account by most of the existing methods. In this paper. a novel method is presented that estimates correction factors for the systematic errors and. thus …,True,XUvtksEAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C,20,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7865895/,17181784699546107353,/scholar?cites=17181784699546107353,,,http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/69898/1/Manuscript.pdf,0,0,0
1268112,Optimal energy management and MPC strategies for electrified RTG cranes with energy storage systems,2017,Feras Alasali and Stephen Haben and Victor Becerra and William Holderbaum,10,Energies,10,1598,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This article presents a study of optimal control strategies for an energy storage system connected to a network of electrified Rubber Tyre Gantry (RTG) cranes. The study aims to design optimal control strategies for the power flows associated with the energy storage device. considering the highly volatile nature of RTG crane demand and difficulties in prediction. Deterministic optimal energy management controller and a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) are proposed as potentially suitable approaches to minimise the electric energy costs associated with the real-time electricity price and maximise the peak demand reduction. under given energy storage system parameters and network specifications. A specific case study is presented in to test the proposed optimal strategies and compares them to a set-point controller. The proposed models used in the study are validated using data collected from an instrumented RTG crane at the Port of Felixstowe. UK and are compared to a standard set-point controller. The results of the proposed control strategies show a significant reduction in the potential electricity costs and peak power demand from the RTG cranes.

Angular kinematics are widely used for gait analysis. for rehabilitation. and more generally for activity recognition. Residential monitoring requires particular sensor constraints to enable long-term user compliance.

V-baffles with an angle of attack of 45° pointing upstream are mounted in both lower and upper walls with an in-line arrangement. Effect of various baffle blockage ratios (BR = 0.2. 0.4 and 0.6) and baffles pitch ratios (PR = 0.5.1 and 1.5) on flow behavior and heat transfer are investigated.

The operational principle is based on the concept of combining the lattice resonance. localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR). and cavity plasmon resonance modes within the nanostructure. The underlying mechanisms are investigated numerically by using the three-dimensional finite element method and the numerical results of coupled solid Ag nanorods are included for comparison.

This radiation heats up the atmospheric air. The intensity of this heating will be more at the equator (0o latitude) as the sun is directly overhead. Air around the poles gets less warm. as the angle at which the radiation reaches the surface is more acute. The density of air decreases with increase in temperature. Thus. lighter air from the equator rises up into the atmosphere to a certain altitude and then spreads around. This causes a pressure drop around this region. which attracts the cooler air from the poles to the equator. This movement of air causes the wind.Thus. the wind is generated due to the pressure gradient resulting from the uneven heating of earth’s surface by the sun.

From an overall efficiency perspective. development taxes and urban growth boundaries are equivalent instruments and the most effective anti-sprawl policies.

1268199,The fall of coal: Joint impacts of fuel prices and renewables on generation and emissions,2018,Harrison Fell and Daniel T Kaffine,10,American Economic Journal: Economic Policy,2,90-116,,Since 2007. US coal-fired electricity generation has declined by a stunning 25 percent. Detailed daily unit-level data is used to examine the joint impact of natural gas prices and wind generation on coal-fired generation and emissions. with a focus on the interaction between gas prices and wind. This interaction is found to be significant. Marginal responses of coal-fired generation to natural gas prices (wind) in 2013 were larger. sometimes much larger. than the counterfactual with 2008 wind generation (gas prices). Additionally. these factors jointly account for the vast majority of the observed decline in generation and emissions. (JEL L94. L95. Q35. Q38. Q42.

As onshore and offshore wind energy grows. preferred locations become saturated with numerous wind farms. An upwind wind farm generates ‘wake effects’(decreases in downwind wind speeds) that undermine a downwind wind farm’s power generation and revenues. Here we use a diverse set of analysis tools from the atmospheric science. economic and legal communities to assess costs and consequences of these wake effects. focusing on a West Texas case study. We show that although wake effects vary with atmospheric conditions. they are discernible in monthly power production. In stably stratified atmospheric conditions. wakes can extend 50+ km downwind. resulting in economic losses of several million dollars over six years for our case study.

Using a simple theoretical model. we show that traffic flows in mainline lanes unambiguously decrease when fuel prices increase. and this effect is stronger when the presence of a carpool lane provides a substitute to driving alone. In contrast. in carpool (HOV) lanes flow can either increase or decrease. These predictions are tested using 8 years of traffic flow data for 1700 locations in Los Angeles. In our preferred specification. the mean elasticity of flow with respect to fuel price is 0.136 for HOV lanes. For a 10% increase in fuel price this implies 10 additional carpools per hour. $8.8 million per year in additional congestion costs for carpoolers and $11.3 million lower costs for mainline drivers. For mainline lanes. flow elasticities are −0.083 and −0.050 for highways with and without an HOV lane.

MPAs limit harvest to certain areas. but may enhance profits outside via spillover. TURFs incentivize local stewardship but may be plagued by spatial externalities when the TURF size is insufficient to capture all dispersal. Within a numerical model parameterized to a California marine species. we explore the economic and ecological effects of imposing MPAs on a TURF‐regulated fishery. Whether MPAs can enhance or diminish profits (or fish abundance) hinges critically on the level of coordination already occurring between TURF owners.

A survey of the recent EPR economic literature,2013,Daniel Kaffine and Patrick O’Reilly,,Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),,,,The last decade has seen a substantial increase in implementation and interest in Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs. While on-the-ground implementation of EPR programs has grown. an academic literature on the economics of EPR has also developed. This document provides an overview of lessons learned from this literature. It identifies key results from the literature and possible areas for further analysis. with an eye towards informing policymakers regarding the design of EPR programs. Key insights from the literature that policymakers may want to take into consideration are as follows. First. in selecting policies within the EPR framework. multi-instrument policies. such as deposit/refund. are likely to be more efficient than single instrument policies such as an advance disposal fee. Second. while collective PROs may be attractive in terms of taking advantage of economies of scale and reducing the need to monitor individual firms. care should be taken that market power is not exploited. Third. while most EPR policies provide DfE incentives. policies that directly target product characteristics (weight. recyclability. etc.) will provide the most direct incentives.

We argue that the strategic component is inconsistent with commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We extend the theory of border adjustments to neutralize the strategic incentive. and consider the remaining environmental incentive in a simplified structure.

1268220,Implications of agricultural policy for species invasion in shifting cultivation systems,2006,Heidi J Albers and Michael J Goldbach and Daniel T Kaffine,,Environment and Development Economics,,429-452,Cambridage University Press,Policies to influence land use decisions in agriculture or grazing can increase the ability of invasive species to out-compete native species and thereby disrupt seemingly stable ecological-economic systems. Building off of models of interdependent resources. invasive species and soil fertility. this paper develops a model of shifting cultivation decisions for two types of farmers. one who sees the threat of invasive grasses and one who does not. The paper uses numerical solutions to this dynamic decision problem to examine the impact of various policies on farmer welfare and on the stability of the economic-ecological system. Some policies undermine the resilience of the system. while other policies augment the system's ability to withstand species invasions.,True,FlunvA4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,13,https://www.jstor.org/stable/44379114,1542930936733296604,/scholar?cites=1542930936733296604,,,,0,0,0

New York,In recent years. membrane distillation (MD) has become a potentially promising membrane technology for desalination. water reuse. and wastewater treatment applications. especially in the fields of high-salinity waters. brackish water. and brine treatment. where separation and purification become economically and technically complex through the existing separation technologies (eg. reverse osmosis (RO). electrodialysis (ED). as well as thermal processes including multistage flash (MSF) and multieffect distillation (MED))(Al-Obaidani et al.. 2008; Hanemaaijer et al.. 2006). Through such attractive features and benefits. for a long period MD has become a targeted topic and examined by membrane researchers and scientists globally in different aspects. that is. development of membrane materials (Eykens et al.. 2016a; Wang and Chung. 2015). membrane transport mechanisms (Phattaranawik and Jiraratananon. 2001; Yun et al.. 2006). wetting phenomena (Rezaei et al.. 2018). operation and process design (Francis et al.. 2013; Lawson and Lloyd. 1996; Singh and Sirkar. 2012). and cost and energy evaluation (Al-Obaidani et al.. 2008; Hogan et al.. 1991). Recently. there have been positive progresses through increased interests from both academic and industry sectors on MD development and commercialization; commencing from the early 2000s. several commercially orientated R&D activities such as MD pilots and demonstration plants have been undertaken by research institutions. private and government-granted firms/startups (Drioli et al.. 2015; Thomas et al.. 2017).

1268265,FUNDAMENTALS OF PVDF HOLLOW FIBER MEMBRANE FORMATION AND PERV APORATION FOR ETHANOL-WATER SEPARATION,2011,PANU SUKITPANEENIT,,,,,,Poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF) has gained considerable attention as one of promising polymeric membrane materials due to its outstanding chemical and physical properties. The key advantages of PVDF include its highly hydrophobic nature and excellent chemical resistance against corrosive chemicals such as acids and halogens [1]. Typically. PVDF comprises of crystalline phases along with amorphous and/or rubbery regions which respectively provides the thermal stability and flexibility of the membranes [2]. Compared to other hydrophobic materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polypropylene (PP). PVDF possesses better processability since it is soluble in common organic solvents. PTFE and PP membranes are usually fabricated by thermal and stretching methods and the resultant membranes are relatively symmetric [3-4]. In contrast. PVDF hollow fibers with favorable asymmetric structure can be fabricated via the dry-wet phase-inversion process. With these superior properties. PVDF has been considered for utilization in various membrane-based separations eg micro/nano/ultra-filtration [5-6]. membrane distillation [7-9]. pervaporation [10] and membrane gas absorption [11-12].,True,N_EdKLkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/48649436.pdf,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/48649436.pdf,0,0,0
1268266,PVDF hollow fiber membrane formation: Fundamental study on the roles of phase inversion. crystallization and rheology on morphology and mechanical properties,2009,Panu Sukitpaneenit and T-S Chung,,,,,,This study explores the fundamental science and engineering of fabricating poly(vinyl fluoride) (PVDF) hollow fiber membranes as well as elucidates the relationship among membrane morphology. crystallinity and mechanical properties as functions of non-solvent additives and dope rheology in the phase-inversion process. The phase inversion of semi-crystalline PVDF membranes is dominated by liquid-liquid demixing or solid-liquid demixing accompanying crystallization. These precipitation mechanisms drastically influence the resultant morphology and mechanical integrity of the membranes. Interestingly. the membrane morphology transforms from an interconnected-cellular type to an interconnected-globule type when adding water. methanol. ethanol. or isopropanol into the spinning dopes or into the external coagulation bath. In other words. the use of a weak non-solvent (i.e. methanol. ethanol or isopropanol) as an additive or a component in the external coagulant induces delayed demixing and crystallization and the resultant membranes are macrovoid-free with globule structure comprising of spherulitic crystallites. The size of spherulitic globules and crystallinity in the morphology are controlled by the amounts of non-solvents presented in the systems. Another interesting finding is the conventional perspective of macrovoid-free membranes having better mechanical properties may not be applicable for semi-crystalline polymers like PVDF. Despite the macrovoid-free structure. the membrane with spherulitic globule packing exhibits a lower mechanical strength than those with interconnected-cellular type morphology.

1268333,Classification of Hyperspectral Images with Robust Regularized Block Low-Rank Discriminant Analysis,2018,Baokai Zu and Kewen Xia and Wei Du and Yafang Li and Ahmad Ali and Sagnik Chakraborty,10,Remote Sensing,6,817,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Classification of Hyperspectral Images (HSIs) has gained attention for the past few decades. In remote sensing image classification. the labeled samples are insufficient or hard to obtain; however. the unlabeled ones are frequently rich and of a vast number. When there are no sufficient labeled samples. overfitting may occur. To resolve the overfitting issue. in this present work. we proposed a novel approach for HSI feature extraction. called robust regularized Block Low-Rank Discriminant Analysis (BLRDA). which is a robust and efficient feature extraction method to improve the HSIs’ classification accuracy with few labeled samples. To reduce the exponentially growing computational complexity of the low-rank method. we divide the entire image into blocks and implement the low-rank representation for each block respectively. Due to the symmetric matrix requirements for the regularized graph of discriminant analysis. the k-nearest neighbor is applied to handle the whole low-rank graph integrally. The low-rank representation and the k NN can maximally capture and preserve the global and local geometry of the data. respectively. and the performance of regularized discriminant analysis feature extraction can be apparently improved. Extensive experiments on multi-class hyperspectral images show that the proposed BLRDA is a very robust and efficient feature extraction method. Even with simple supervised and semi-supervised classifiers (nearest neighbor and SVM) and randomly given parameters. the feature extraction method achieves significant results with few labeled samples. which shows better performance than similar feature extraction …,True,mh9xi9sAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,6,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/6/817,1017153905840412556,/scholar?cites=1017153905840412556,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/6/817/pdf,0,0,0

At the high pressures and low temperatures common in deep-sea sediments. CO2 resides in its liquid phase and can be denser than the overlying pore fluid. causing the injected CO2 to be gravitationally stable. Additionally.

1268339,The energy penalty of post-combustion CO 2 capture & storage and its implications for retrofitting the US installed base,2009,Kurt Zenz House and Charles F Harvey and Michael J Aziz and Daniel P Schrag,2,Energy & Environmental Science,2,193-205,Royal Society of Chemistry,A review of the literature has found a factor of 4 spread in the estimated values of the energy penalty for post-combustion capture and storage of CO2 from pulverized-coal (PC) fired power plants. We elucidate the cause of that spread by deriving an analytic relationship for the energy penalty from thermodynamic principles and by identifying which variables are most difficult to constrain. We define the energy penalty for CCS to be the fraction of fuel that must be dedicated to CCS for a fixed quantity of work output.

HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3− without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer. some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3. resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon. and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere.

When measured by pore-volume. there appears to be sufficient CO2 capacity in terrestrial US basins to store thousands of years worth of current US emissions.[3–6] However. it may be difficult to guarantee the longterm confinement of buoyant CO2 in terrestrial reservoirs that often contain fractures. faults. and abandoned wells and may be subject to pressure-induced fracturing.[7–9] Furthermore. securing the surface rights for injection can be expensive. Storing CO2 in deep-sea sediments has been proposed as an alternative to storing CO2 in terrestrial formations.[10. 11] Previous work has demonstrated that beneath ca. 2800 m of ocean. the pressure and temperature conditions compress CO2 to a liquid phase that is denser than seawater.[11] Storing denser-than-seawater CO2 in deep-sea sediments is inherently more secure then storing buoyant supercritical CO2 in terrestrial formations because in the latter case. the CO2 can escape through any conduit such as a fault or fracture.[9] The key benefit of deepsea sediment storage is that confidence in the storage integrity derives from the known physical properties of CO2 and seawater. In terrestrial reservoirs. on the other hand. CO2 must be trapped by a confining layer of shale or clay.[12] As a result. ensuring the …,True,bC9Wh4AAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,17,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Harvey2/publication/45506453_The_Immobility_of_CO2_in_Marine_Sediments_Beneath_1500_Meters_of_Water/links/5c28f999299bf12be3a34675/The-Immobility-of-CO2-in-Marine-Sediments-Beneath-1500-Meters-of-Water.pdf,14887804881961459284,/scholar?cites=14887804881961459284,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Harvey2/publication/45506453_The_Immobility_of_CO2_in_Marine_Sediments_Beneath_1500_Meters_of_Water/links/5c28f999299bf12be3a34675/The-Immobility-of-CO2-in-Marine-Sediments-Beneath-1500-Meters-of-Water.pdf,0,0,0

By definition. all air capture processes start with ambient air and produce a concentrated stream of CO2. as well as a CO2-depleted airstream. As shown in our paper (2). one can precisely calculate the difference in exergy between these two end points. This exergy difference is the minimum work required by any air capture process. The fact that proposed air capture processes may have exothermic steps has absolutely no impact on the minimum work requirement; if there is an exothermic step in the process and that energy is not recovered. as is generally true for CO2 absorption processes. that lost energy becomes a source of process inefficiency.

The high pressures and low temperatures below~ 3000 m of seawater and several hundred meters of marine sediment compress CO2 (l) to greater density than the surrounding pore fluid. The lower density pore fluid is an effective cap on the system as the CO2 can only escape by diffusion. Furthermore. these pressure-temperature conditions allow hydrate formation. which reduces permeability near the seafloor enhancing the storage stability. Hydrate formation may also interfere with the injection process by reducing permeability near the well-head.

Despite the potentially large total storage capacity of the lower Paleozoic sediments in the basin. sites capable of injecting and storing CO 2 at the rates typical of large coal-fired power plants require site-specific reservoir characteristics. We present a methodology to identify and rank potential sites in the Illinois Basin on the basis of their geologic and engineering characteristics. with particular focus on the importance of both vertical and lateral confinement of the plume of injected CO 2. The results show that only a small percentage of the basin is viable for early-stage commercial projects. The Loudon Anticline. located in Fayette and Effingham Counties in south-central Illinois. represents the best site for a regional CO 2 storage hub.

The Mt Simon is overlain by the Eau Clair Shale and carbonates of the Knox Group. which have sufficiently low permeability to confine injected CO 2 within the Mt Simon.

Overheating may cause the malfunction or damage of electronics. The time needed for heat removal is particularly important in a wide range of electronic systems. such as switching circuits. Thus. it is important to characterize the transient behavior of the system and determine the response. Most studies in the literature have focused on steady-state circumstances and the transient effects have not been considered in the detail needed. In this article. an experimental system and a numerical model were developed to test the effects of different parameters and their influence on the transient electronic chip cooling by liquid flow in microchannel heat sinks.

Silica surfaces were chemically modified. yielding dissimilar surfaces with −Br. −NH2. and −CH3 functional group terminations. The relative hydrophobicity of the surfaces was characterized by contact angle measurements. The surface charge of the functionalized surfaces was first probed with commonly used static AFM measurements and serves as a reference to the dynamic response data.

Biomimetic microfluidic models comprised of vessel analogues that are lined with endothelial cells (ECs) have been developed to help answer several fundamental questions in endothelial mechanobiology. However. previously described microfluidic models have been primarily restricted to single straight or two parallel vessel analogues. which do not model the bifurcating vessel networks typically present in physiology. Therefore. the effects of hemodynamic stresses that arise due to bifurcating vessel geometries on ECs are not well understood.

All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of an aqueous solution of chloride placed on a silica slab were conducted. The response of the system is investigated as it is subjected to different axial electric fields and as the surface electrostatics is modified by implementing different positive charge densities on the patches. Chloride and water density profiles reveal that the charged patches cause an enrichment of hydrated chloride ions near the surface. Therefore. the system with patches proved to be successful in trapping ions. Moreover. the number of chloride ions trapped on the surface increases as higher charge densities are imposed on the patches.

However. for instance. in mountain regions and in developing countries there exist significant gaps in ground based climate records in space and time. Specifically. in the Peruvian Andes spatially and temporally coherent precipitation information is a prerequisite for ongoing climate change adaptation projects in the fields of water resources. disasters and food security. The present work aims at evaluating the ability of Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) to estimate precipitation rates at daily 0.25°× 0.25° scale in the Central Andes and the dependency of the estimate performance on changing spatial and temporal resolution. Comparison of the TMPA product with gauge measurements in the regions of Cuzco. Peru and La Paz. Bolivia were carried out and analysed statistically. Large biases are identified in both investigation areas in the estimation of daily precipitation amounts. The occurrence of strong precipitation events was well assessed. but their intensities were underestimated. TMPA estimates for La Paz show high false alarm ratio.

Rapid glacier retreat caused by climatic changes is thus a major concern. and decision makers demand urgently for regional/local glacier evolution trends. ice mass estimates and runoff assessments. However. in remote mountain areas. spatial and temporal data coverage is typically very scarce and this is further complicated by a high spatial and temporal variability in regions with complex topography. Here. we present an approach on how to deal with these constraints. For the Cordillera Vilcanota (southern Peruvian Andes). which is the second largest glacierized cordillera in Peru (after the Cordillera Blanca) and also comprises the Quelccaya Ice Cap. we assimilate a comprehensive multi-decadal collection of available glacier and climate data from multiple sources (satellite images. meteorological station data and climate reanalysis). and analyze them for respective changes in glacier area and volume and related trends in air temperature. precipitation and in a more general manner for specific humidity. While we found only marginal glacier changes between 1962 and 1985. there has been a massive ice loss since 1985 (about 30% of area and about 45% of volume). These high numbers corroborate studies from other glacierized cordilleras in Peru. The climate data show overall a moderate increase in air temperature. mostly weak and not significant trends for precipitation sums and probably cannot in full explain the observed substantial ice loss.

A unique data set from a large number of stations in the region of the Cordillera Blanca shows that after a strong air temperature rise of about 0.31 °C per decade between 1969 and 1998. a slowdown in the warming to about 0.13 °C per decade occurred for the 30 years from 1983 to 2012.

However. metadata are often missing. but may partly be reconstructed by suitable actions such as station inspections. This study identifies and attributes the most important common data quality issues in Bolivian and Peruvian temperature and precipitation datasets. The same or similar errors are found in many other predominantly manned station networks worldwide. A large fraction of these issues can be traced back to measurement errors by the observers.

Analysis,1994,MB Rohrer and LN Braun and H Lang,25,Hydrology Research,1-2,53-64,IWA Publishing,The snow-water equivalent (SWE) of the seasonal snow cover is an important component of the water cycle in the Swiss Alps. It is used for predicting seasonal discharge. for short-range discharge forecasts and also for assessing water quality aspects. The SWE has been measured every two weeks at about 50 stations located between 860 and 2.540 m a.s.l. for more than 30 years. In addition there are special investigation areas with stations located between 600 m and 2.900 m a.s.l. where SWE is measured once per winter. The main characteristics of temporal and spatial SWE distributions are analyzed. The variations of SWE values depend in ranking order on elevation. on the year-to-year variations. on the region and on the exposition. The standardized SWE-values depend mostly on the year-to-year variations and on the region.,True,OMmowOAAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,36,https://iwaponline.com/hr/article-abstract/25/1-2/53/636,5532736358540982619,/scholar?cites=5532736358540982619,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario_Rohrer/publication/263397979_Long-Term_Records_of_Snow_Cover_Water_Equivalent_in_the_Swiss_Alps_1_Analysis/links/0a85e53abfa18a5607000000/Long-Term-Records-of-Snow-Cover-Water-Equivalent-in-the-Swiss-Alps-1-Analysis.pdf,0,0,0

In the current discussion of possible climate changes. the natural variability of the water balance components may help to put today's research results in perspective. In a first step. the individual components of basin precipitation. snow accumulation. glacier mass balance and discharge are assessed. Special emphasis is placed on a comprehensive interpretation of the results. In a second step. a conceptual precipitation-runoff model running on a daily time step is applied. The required data input are daily values of precipitation and air temperature as measured at standard meteorological stations. which facilitates the transfer of this modelling approach to other mountainous regions where data are scarce. The results obtained using the various methods compare favourably with one another. It can be concluded that the high alpine Linth-Limmern region is well suited for the assessment of the water balance components thanks to the long-term series of available data. It is recommended to continue the various measurement programmes being conducted by federal agencies. hydro-power companies and private individuals. and to engage in further detailed investigations concerning runoff processes and pathways.,True,OMmowOAAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC,36,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario_Rohrer/publication/263367991_Measurement_and_simulation_of_high_alpine_water_balance_components_in_the_Linth-Limmern_head_watershed_north-eastern_Switzerland/links/02e7e53aacd2a4694e000000/Measurement-and-simulation-of-high-alpine-water-balance-components-in-the-Linth-Limmern-head-watershed-north-eastern-Switzerland.pdf,5311153878047602644,/scholar?cites=5311153878047602644,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mario_Rohrer/publication/263367991_Measurement_and_simulation_of_high_alpine_water_balance_components_in_the_Linth-Limmern_head_watershed_north-eastern_Switzerland/links/02e7e53aacd2a4694e000000/Measurement-and-simulation-of-high-alpine-water-balance-components-in-the-Linth-Limmern-head-watershed-north-eastern-Switzerland.pdf,0,0,0

The mass balance of tropical glaciers in Peru is highly sensitive to a rise in the FLH. mainly due to a decrease in accumulation and increase of energy for ablation caused by reduced albedo. Knowledge of future changes in the FLH is thus crucial to estimating changes in glacier extents. Since in situ data are scarce at altitudes where glaciers exist (above ~4800 m above sea level (asl)). reliable FLH estimates must be derived from multiple data types. Here we assessed the FLHs and their spatiotemporal variability. as well as the related snow/rain transition in the two largest glacier‐covered regions in Peru by combining data from two climate reanalysis products.

Disaster databases are a primary tool for the analysis of disaster characteristics and trends at global or national scales. and they support disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. However. the quality. consistency and completeness of different disaster databases are highly variable. Even though such variation critically influences the outcome of any study. comparative analyses of different databases are still rare to date. Furthermore. there is an unequal geographic distribution of current disaster trend studies. with developing countries being underrepresented.

Two types of hybrid configurations are taken up. Type A installs the Savonius rotor inside the Darrieus rotor and Type B installs the Savonius rotor outside the Darrieus rotor. The computed results of the output characteristics and the dynamic behavior of the system operated at the maximum power coefficient points show that Type A. which has fine operating behavior to wind speed changes and can be compactly designed because of a shorter rotational axis. is an effective way for stand‐alone small‐scale systems. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals.

In this paper. a robust optimal design method of energy supply systems under uncertain energy demands is proposed using a mixed-integer linear model so that it can consider discrete characteristics for selection and on/off status of operation and piecewise linear approximations for nonlinear performance characteristics of constituent equipment. First. a robust optimal design problem is formulated as a three-level min-max-min optimization one by expressing uncertain energy demands by intervals based on the interval programming. evaluating the robustness in a performance criterion based on the minimax regret criterion. and considering hierarchical relationships among design variables. uncertain energy demands. and operation variables.

In the present study. a detailed characterization of the crystal structure. optical properties. and electronic band structure of these photocatalysts was performed. It was found that increasing the Mg content decreased the N content in the solid solution as a result of co-substitution of Mg2+ for Ta5+ and O2− for N3−. and enabled fine tuning of the bandgap energy and position. The bandgap increased due to a shift in the valence band maximum towards the positive electrode potential. rather than a change in the conduction band minimum.

The scheme is based on the degenerate Raman interaction of a Λ-type three-level atom with a single-mode field. First let n atoms cross a coherent cavity field in succession to prepare a quantum channel. Then the sender lets the other n atoms which carry the unknown state cross the cavity in succession and makes a joint measurement by detecting the cavity field and the atoms separately. When| α| 1. the cavity field can be detected with the measurement method of detecting orthogonal states. Finally the receiver reconstructs the initial state according to the outcome of the joint measurement transmitted through a classical channel. The advantage of the scheme is that it uses an entangled state of a coherent state with n atoms as a quantum channel. which makes the scheme simple and easy.

However. with the increasing demand of industrial production. the licorice resources in our country have been reduced rapidly and we have to import licorice resources from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan consequently. In order to find out the trade flow of licorice resources and evaluate the status of Chinese licorice in the world trade. the trade situation of licorice and its products from 2011 to 2015 May in Chinese customs was investigated and analyzed in this paper. The import and export volumes of licorice were declining; the import and export volumes of licorice were relatively concentrated in international trade. with greater risks of trade; and export quota management was not well executed. As one of the strategic resources of medicine. licorice resources must be based on domestic development. and we should adjust the export quota management from passive quota to active quota management and improve the intrinsic value of licorice resources to establish the international market position of our licorice and control the pricing power in international market.,True,IExeEhQAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,1,https://europepmc.org/article/med/28822168,14981953011662866286,/scholar?cites=14981953011662866286,,,,0,0,0

1268488,Handwritten character recognition using multiclass svm classification with hybrid feature extraction,2016,Muhammad Naeem Ayyaz and Imran Javed and Waqar Mahmood,,Pakistan Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences,,,,In this paper. we describe hybrid feature extraction for offline handwritten character recognition. The proposed technique is a hybrid of structural. statistical and correlation features. In the first step. the proposed technique identifies the type and location of some elementary strokes in the character. The strokes to be looked for comprise horizontal. vertical. positive slant and negative slant lines–as we observe that the structure of any character can be approximated with the help of a combination of simple straight line strokes. The strokes are identified by correlating different segments of the character with the chosen elementary shapes. These normalized correlation values at different segments of the character give correlation features. For making feature extraction more robust. we add in the second step certain structural/statistical features to the correlation features. The added structural/statistical features are based on projections. profiles. invariant moments. endpoints and junction points. This enhanced. powerful combination of features results in a 157-variable feature vector for each character. which we find adequate enough to uniquely represent and identify each character. Prior. handwritten character recognition problem has not been addressed the way our proposed hybrid feature extraction technique deals with it. The extracted feature vector is used during the training phase for building a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The trained SVM classifier is subsequently used during the testing phase for classifying unknown characters.

1268489,Cluster-based intrusion detection (cbid) architecture for mobile ad hoc networks,2006,Ejaz Ahmed and Kashan Samad and Waqar Mahmood,,Asia Pacific Information Technology Security Conference (AUSCERT2006),,,,The ad hoc networks are vulnerable to attacks due to distributed nature and lack of infrastructure. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) provide audit and monitoring capabilities that offer the local security to a node and help to perceive the specific trust level of other nodes. The clustering protocols can be taken as an additional advantage in these processing constrained networks to collaboratively detect intrusions with less power usage and minimal overhead. Existing clustering protocols are not suitable for intrusion detection purposes. because they are linked with the routes. The route establishment and route renewal affects the clusters and as a consequence. the processing and traffic overhead increases due to instability of clusters. The ad hoc networks are battery and power constraint. and therefore a trusted monitoring node should be available to detect and respond against intrusions in time. This can be achieved only if the clusters are stable for a long period of time. If the clusters are regularly changed due to routes. the intrusion detection will not prove to be effective. Therefore. a generalized clustering algorithm has been proposed that can run on top of any routing protocol and can monitor the intrusions constantly irrespective of the routes. The proposed simplified clustering scheme has been used to detect intrusions. resulting in high detection rates and low processing and memory overhead irrespective of the routes. connections. traffic types and mobility of nodes in the network. Clustering is also useful to detect intrusions collaboratively since an individual node can neither detect the malicious node alone nor it can take action against that …,True,U5iOFhQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,47,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/33277/,17785002937550645157,/scholar?cites=17785002937550645157,,,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/33277/3/33277.pdf,0,0,0

So. in order to resolve this problem. an improved fast handoff mechanism is required that can minimize the overall handoff latency enough to run voice and video applications seamlessly. Handoff consists of three phases including scanning. reauthentication. and reassociation. Scanning is the most time consuming phase among all three.

This is the basic advantage of optical wireless communication over conventional wireless communication technologies. The other important thing is the day by day decreasing size of wireless sensors with the advent of advancement in device processing technologies like micro-and nano-electromechanical systems. This decrease in dimensions of sensors causes serious problem for battery storage capacity. We address this issue and propose a model of communication and recharging of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes simultaneously using passive optical communication. We propose both Line-of-Sight and Quasi-diffuse communication for this purpose. There are some situations where direct LOS is better option while at non-line-of-sight. the energy of a multi-spot Quasi-diffuse beam can be utilized.

Platform games are being revived with both their 2D and 3D versions being developed. A major challenge faced by the industry is a lack of automated system-level approaches for game testing. Currently in most game development organizations. games are tested manually or using semi-automated techniques. Such testing techniques do not scale to the industry requirements where more systematic and repeatable approaches are required. In this paper we propose a model-based testing approach for automated black box functional testing of platform games. The paper provides a detailed modeling methodology to support automated system-level game testing. As part of the methodology. we provide guidelines for modeling the platform games for testing using our proposed game test modeling profile.

Therefore. a very desirable feature of WSN would be its rechargability to remain operational over longer period of times. However. the nodes needing recharge may not be accessible. In this paper. we present a battery recharge model in WSNs for inaccessible or hard to access environments. at distances up to several hundred meters. using variable power Infrared (IR) laser. While bulk of the sensor network comprises of sensing nodes. the juncture nodes are the ones that relay data towards sink -resulting into faster battery depletion.

Multi-period economic dispatch and demand-side management for power systems with multiple wind farms is considered in this paper.

These schemes alleviate urban traffic congestion. reduce carbon emissions. and change people’s preferred travel modes. but they also suffer from a series of problems related to unsustainability. The sustainability performance of a DBSP is closely related to its influencing factors. which can be used to understand the main challenges of the program and consider what useful measures should be taken to overcome these issues. Therefore. it is essential to investigate the related factors that are critical to the sustainability of DBSPs from a systems-level perspective. In this paper. we explored publicly available data sources (ie. literature. institutional reports. and announcements) to determine the intrinsic influencing factors and understand their interactions and feedback relationships. A taxonomy of the key challenges with respect to the fundamental pillars of DBSP sustainability (ie. environment. society. and economy) was provided. System dynamics methodology was employed to map the critical factors and links in order to analyze the key challenges in facilitating the sustainability of DBSPs. Based on this approach. we put forward proposals to mitigate the severe challenges for governments and DBSP operators.

Despite growing activity in the field. very few photocatalysts exist that can efficiently and stably hydrogenate gaseous CO2 to methanol at ambient pressure with high selectivity. Here. we report that a defect-laden indium oxide. In2O3−x(OH)y. with a rod-like nanocrystal superstructure. can photocatalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol with 50% selectivity under simulated solar irradiation. Notably. the solar methanol production of the In2O3−x(OH)y nanocrystal superstructures can be stabilized at a rate of 0.06 mmol gcat−1 h−1 at atmospheric pressure. This is 120 times higher than that of the best-known photocatalysts.

Parameters such as initial concentration of IBP. catalyst dosage. solution pH value. cations and anions that affect the adsorption and photocatalytic efficiency of IBP were studied. We observed that approximately 80% of the IBP removal rate contributed from BiOBr adsorption in photocatalysis process. This suggests that the removal rate of IBP by BiOBr is highly adsorptivity dependent. with higher removal rate at higher adsorption capacity. We believe that the anion exchange between Br and dissociated IBP followed by formation of Bi–O bond on the surface of BiOBr microspheres is the main acting force during the IBP adsorption. which was further proved by XPS and FT-IR analysis.

Both top-down and bottom-up approaches provide access to silicene. the former via vapor deposition on a substrate and the latter via exfoliation of the layered CaSi2 precursor. Most top-down research has been concerned with understanding the various electronic. optical. magnetic. mechanical. electrical. thermal transport and gas-adsorption properties of silicene. By contrast. the focus on bottom-up silicene has primarily been on its synthesis. structure and chemical properties as they relate to its function and utility. Herein. emphasis is placed on the bottom-up strategy because of its scalability and the ease of subsequent silicene modification. with both qualities being important prerequisites for heterogeneous catalysis applications.

In addition. the metabolism of dietary amino acids by the gastrointestinal tract is nutritionally important for normal function. In the case of sulfur amino acids (SAAs). in vivo. stable isotope studies in adults suggest that the splanchnic tissues utilize as much as 30–44% of the dietary methionine and cysteine. Similarly. the dietary methionine requirement is 30% lower in total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-fed piglets. a condition in which dietary nutrients largely bypass intestinal metabolism. These data suggest that intestinal metabolism of methionine is substantial. yet the intestinal metabolic fate of dietary methionine is largely unknown.

This issue may impede utilization of pulse ingredients in dog food or consideration of alternative proteins. Pulse ingredients have been used in the pet food industry for over 2 decades and represent a valuable source of protein to compliment animal-based ingredients. Moreover. individual ingredients used in commercial foods do not represent the final nutrient concentration of the complete diet. Thus. nutritionists formulating dog food must balance complementary ingredients to fulfill the animal’s nutrient needs in the final diet. There are multiple factors that should be considered. including differences in nutrient digestibility and overall bioavailability. the fermentability and quantity of fiber. and …,True,1UMdZQUAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,20,https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-abstract/97/3/983/5279069,14553722802363507303,/scholar?cites=14553722802363507303,,,https://academic.oup.com/jas/article/97/3/983/5279069?fbclid=IwAR0LVwaOQ1ZRSV63emd5JtsXK55lyVOC8W0fTdGb41dBM1x2AhHKBfEwC6M,0,0,0

1268614,Calibration of agricultural risk programming models,2015,Athanasios Petsakos and Stelios Rozakis,242,European Journal of Operational Research,2,536-545,North-Holland,Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) is one of the most commonly used methods for calibrating activity programming models. In this article we consider PMP as a calibration method for risk programming models with a mean-variance (E-V) specification. We argue that the restrictive theoretical assumptions employed by typical linear E-V models limit their applicability in analyzing the effects of decoupled payments on agricultural production decisions. Furthermore. the requirement for eliciting a risk aversion coefficient renders such models incompatible with the PMP method. For this reason we propose a nonlinear E-V specification and develop a PMP-based procedure for its calibration which does not aim at introducing (further) nonlinearities in the objective function. but at recovering the “true” distribution of wealth that will allow the final model to reproduce base year observations. We also examine how our …,True,Rj5upnAAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,36,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037722171400839X,8019946029162212510,/scholar?cites=8019946029162212510,,,,0,0,0

Models related to each stage of bio-electricity production are pulled together within an integrated model of evaluation of the activity in the context of the European research program ALTENER. grouping multidisciplinary teams from Spain. Greece and Austria. A database containing spatial information and expert knowledge as well as environmental models interact with the economic model. Bioenergy production is modelled. in this case. through micro-economic programming assuming that farmers supply biomass to a competitive market. As bio-energy chains are currently not viable in economic terms. government acts as a leader by determining the amount of transfer payments to be allocated so that the activity breaks even. These subsidies are justified to the taxpayers as fossil fuel substitution results in positive externalities to the environment.

In order to enhance the predictive ability of such a model and to provide an analytical tool useful to policy makers. interval linear programming is used to formalize bounded rationality conditions. In the presence of uncertainty related to yields and prices. it is assumed that the farmer may adopt a min-max regret (MMR) criterion as an alternative to the classic profit maximization criterion. Recent advances in operational research are exploited. permitting an efficient implementation of the min-max criterion within an LP model. Model validation based on observed activity levels suggests that about 40% of the farms adopt the MMR criterion.

The present research uses Ajzen’s (1991) theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate entrepreneurial intent of agricultural students. The TPB offers a parsimonious explanation of purposeful behavior and has been used with success in previous research studies to explain the entrepreneurial intent of business and engineering students. However. research studies that examine the application of the theory to students from agricultural universities are scarce. In the present research. we empirically examine the TPB using data from 65 students from the Agricultural University of Athens. Greece. Results. using path analysis. support previous studies that used TPB to predict entrepreneurial intentions. which suggest that students’ attitudes towards entrepreneurship are related to their intention (INT) to start a business. In addition perceived behavioral control (PBC) is a strong predictor of INT. As far the role of subjective norm (SN) is concerned. results of the present study suggest that it has a small negative. and statistically significant effect. Furthermore. in line with recent theoretical and empirical studies about the potential role of emotions in entrepreneurship. we investigated the role of anticipated emotional ambivalence in students’ entrepreneurial intent. Results suggest that anticipated emotional ambivalence from nascent entrepreneurship (that is. students’ future oriented emotions relating to the expectancy of feeling both positive and negative affect) relates negatively to perceived behavioral control.,True,Rj5upnAAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,29,http://aoatools.aua.gr/RePEc/aua/wpaper/files/2013-4_entrep.pdf,16930265176612054741,/scholar?cites=16930265176612054741,,,http://aoatools.aua.gr/RePEc/aua/wpaper/files/2013-4_entrep.pdf,0,0,0

However. due to the very nature of agricultural production. as well as a need for carbon sequestration in soils and other aspects of food production. only part of the straw potential may be treated as waste and spent on energy production. Based on statistical data from the Polish Central Statistical Office (CSU) the actual production of straw was modelled on a scale of local districts (NUTS-5) as well as the needs of its local use and the possibility of redistribution of excessive quantities to regions with a deficit of straw. As a result. the straw surplus that could be used in the energy sector was obtained along with its geographical distribution.

We find an increasing trend of 3.9% per decade (r= 0.78. R 2= 0.61) during the analysis period. A multivariate linear regression of NPP with temperature. precipitation. atmospheric CO 2 concentration. soil water and surface solar radiation (r= 0.80. R 2= 0.65) indicates that the increasing trend is partly driven by increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration and the consequent CO 2 fertilization of the ecosystems. However. human interventions may have also played a key role in the NPP increase: non-forest NPP growth is largely driven by increases in irrigated area and fertilizer use. while forest NPP is influenced by plantation and forest conservation programs. A similar multivariate regression of interannual NPP anomalies with temperature. precipitation. soil water. solar radiation and CO 2 anomalies suggests that the interannual variability in NPP is primarily driven by precipitation and temperature variability. Mean seasonal NPP is largest during post-monsoon and lowest during the pre-monsoon period. thereby indicating the importance of soil moisture for vegetation productivity.

CO2 fertilization. N deposition and re-growth of mid-latitude forests are believed to be key drivers for land carbon uptake. In this study. we assess the importance of N deposition by performing idealized near-equilibrium simulations using the Community Land Model 4.0 (CLM4). In our equilibrium simulations. only 12–17% of the deposited nitrogen is assimilated into the ecosystem and the corresponding carbon uptake can be inferred from a C : N ratio of 20 : 1. We calculate the sensitivity of the terrestrial biosphere for CO2 fertilization. climate warming and N deposition as changes in total ecosystem carbon for unit changes in global mean atmospheric CO2 concentration. global mean temperature and Tera grams of nitrogen deposition per year. respectively. Based on these sensitivities. it is estimated that about 242 PgC could have been taken up by land due to the CO2 fertilization effect and an additional 175 PgC taken up as a result of the increased N deposition since the pre-industrial period. Because of climate warming. the terrestrial ecosystem could have lost about 152 PgC during the same period. Therefore. since pre-industrial times terrestrial carbon losses due to warming may have been more or less compensated by effects of increased N deposition. whereas the effect of CO2 fertilization is approximately indicative of the current increase in terrestrial carbon stock. Our simulations also suggest that the sensitivity of carbon storage to increased N deposition decreases beyond current levels …,True,Z_irx8YAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,41,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/7147/2013/,14645410409946071316,/scholar?cites=14645410409946071316,,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/7147/2013/bg-10-7147-2013.pdf,0,0,0

Early economic model studies considered forests as one out of many possible impacts of climate change. while ecological model studies tended to limit the economic impacts to fixed price-assumptions. More recent studies include broader representations of both systems. but there are still few studies which can be regarded fully integrated. Full integration of ecological and economic models is needed to address forest management under climate change appropriately. The conclusion so far is that there are vast uncertainties about how climate change affects forests.

Rajalakshmi,Climate change affects the balance of natural and socio-economic systems. In the recent years. literature has accumulated on the potentially large-scale impacts of climate change on India. India has emerged as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world. with a high-dependence on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture. water resources. natural ecosystems and forestry. health. sanitation. infrastructure and energy. This necessitates a rapid response by the government. especially in light of recent global negotiations. In this context. an attempt is made to present findings thus far on the potential vulnerability to the effects of climate change in India’s key sectors. This paves the way for an argument to ensure current and future policy development in India incorporate climate change adaptation.

Previous studies have shown that the formation of a subsurface air cavity by a falling sphere is conditional upon impact speed and surface treatment. This study focuses on the forces experienced by the sphere in both cavity-forming and non-cavity-forming cases. Unsteady force estimates require accurate determination of the deceleration for both high and low mass ratios. especially as inertial and hydrodynamic effects approach equality. Using high-speed imaging. high-speed particle image velocimetry. and numerical simulation. we examine the nature of the forces in each case. The effect of mass ratio is shown. where a lighter sphere undergoes larger decelerations and more dramatic trajectory changes. In the non-cavity-forming cases. the forces are modulated by the growth and shedding of a strong. ring-like vortex structure. In the cavity-forming cases. little vorticity is shed by the sphere. and the forces are modulated by the unsteady pressure required for the opening and closing of the air cavity.

1268668,An impulse framework for hydrodynamic force analysis: fish propulsion. water entry of spheres. and marine propellers,2010,Brenden P Epps,,,,,,This thesis presents an impulse framework for analyzing the hydrodynamic forces on bodies in flow. This general theoretical framework is widely applicable. and it is used to address the hydrodynamics of fish propulsion. water entry of spheres. and the offdesign performance of marine propellers. These seemingly-unrelated physics problems share a key common thread: The forces on these fish. spheres. and propellers can be modeled as the sum of the reaction to the rate of change of (1) the pressure impulse required to set up the potential flow about the body. and (2) the vortex impulse required to create the vortical structures in the wake of the body. Fish generate propulsive forces by creating and manipulating large-scale vortical structures using their body and tail. High-speed particle image velocimetry experiments show that a fish generates two vortex rings during a C-turn maneuver and that the change in momentum of the fish balances the change in pressure impulse plus the vortex impulse of these rings. When a sphere plunges into a basin of water and creates a sub-surface air cavity in place of a vortical wake. the vortex impulse is zero. and the force on the sphere is given by the pressure impulse component. Using data from high-speed imaging experiments. a semi-empirical numerical simulation is developed herein; this numerical model shows how the presence of the cavity alters the unsteady pressure force on the sphere and modulates the dynamics of the impact event. During steady propeller operation. the pressure impulse is constant. and the loads on the propeller are given by the vortex impulse component.

1268673,Evaluating derivatives of experimental data using smoothing splines,2010,Brenden P Epps and Tadd T Truscott and Alexandra H Techet,,"Proceedings of Mathematical Methods in Engineering International Symposium. MMEI, Lisbon Portugal",,29-38,,Instantaneous derivatives of high-precision experimental data can be evaluated by fitting the data with a smoothing spline. This paper presents a novel and robust method for choosing the best spline fit and. hence. the best prediction of the derivatives. Typically. a smoothing spline is fit by choosing the value of a smoothing parameter that controls the tradeoff between error to the data and roughness of the spline. However. this method can yield an unsatisfactory fit. because the roughness of the fitted spline is extremely sensitive to the choice of smoothing parameter. An alternate fitting method is to choose an error tolerance and to find the spline with the least roughness possible. given that the error must be less than or equal to this tolerance. In this paper. we systematically explore the relationship between error tolerance and the minimum possible roughness of smoothing splines. We find that there exists a critical error tolerance. corresponding to the spline that has the minimum error to the data possible. without also having roughness due to the noise in the data.

1268674,On the Rotor Lifting Line Wake Model.,2017,Brenden Epps,33,Journal of Ship Production & Design,1,,,This article comments on the wake model used in moderately loaded rotor lifting line theory for the preliminary design of propellers and horizontal-axis turbines. Mathematical analysis of the classic wake model reveals an inconsistency between the induced velocities numerically computed by the model versus those theoretically predicted by the model. An improved wake model is presented. which better agrees with theory than previous models and thus improves the numerical consistency and robustness of rotor lifting line design algorithms. The present wake model analytically relates the pitch of the trailing vortices to the pitch of the total inflow computed at the lifting line control points. For conciseness. the article focuses on the propeller case. although both propeller and horizontal-axis turbine examples are presented.,True,PtEBHiYAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,19,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=21582866&AN=120743519&h=VZGZRE6hhGnapQtdCHyrcTyajYfImLgb9MrleYL0VY1gjkWWDF2X9fMUr%2FeMMOZebvjCfa3sFx8Q8npHIa950Q%3D%3D&crl=c,5909485837307774079,/scholar?cites=5909485837307774079,,,,0,0,0

The derivation is grounded in Boltzmann kinetic theory. which presumes an equilibrium probability distribution $ f_\alpha^{eq}(t.{\bf x}.{\bf u}) $ of particle speeds. While historically $ f_\alpha^{eq} $ has been assumed to be the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. we show that any member of the family of Lévy $\alpha $-stable distributions is a suitable alternative. If $\alpha= 2$. then $ f^{eq} _\alpha $ is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. with large particle speeds very unlikely. and the Navier-Stokes equations are recovered (with $\mu_\alpha=\mu $ and $ C_\alpha= 0$). If $0<\alpha< 2$. then $ f^{eq} _\alpha $ is a Lévy $\alpha $-stable distribution. with"" heavy tails"" that permit large velocity fluctuations. as in turbulence. For shear turbulent flows. the choice of $\alpha= 1$(Cauchy distribution for $ f_\alpha^{eq} $) leads to the logarithmic velocity profile known as the Law of the Wall.

Contrary to intuition. increasing the release depth sometimes results in a lower pop-up height. We present the pop-up height of rising buoyant spheres over a range of release depths (1–12.5 diameters) and Reynolds numbers (4× 10 4 to 6× 10 5). While the dynamics of rising buoyant spheres and bubbles has been thoroughly investigated for Reynolds numbers below 10 4. pop-up in these larger-Reynolds-number regimes has not been studied. Yet the underwater motions of the sphere for the Reynolds numbers we study are the key to understanding the pop-up height. Two major regimes are apparent: vertical and oscillatory.

This paper presents the design of a notional propulsor for an inland waterway vessel. Calculations for the trochoidal propulsor are performed using a lumped. two-dimensional model. which includes the influence of the free vortex wake. as well as approximations to account for three-dimensional effects. The numerical model is used to optimize the foil pitch function in order to achieve the highest efficiency for given geometric and operational parameters. Foilto-foil interactions are studied for multiple-foil propulsors to determine effects of blade number on hydrodynamic efficiency.

A central premise of this approach is that partial solubilization of biomass changes the slurry’s physical properties such that milling becomes more impactful and more feasible. A key uncertainty is the energy required to mill partially fermented biomass. To inform both of these issues. we report rheological characterization of small-particle. corn stover slurries undergoing fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum. Fermented and unfermented corn stover slurries were found to be shear-thinning and well described by a power law model with an exponent of 0.10. Plastic viscosity of a slurry. initially at 16 wt.% insoluble solids. decreased as a result of fermentation by a factor of 2000. with the first eightfold reduction occurring in the first 10% of carbohydrate conversion. Large amplitude oscillatory shear experiments revealed only minor changes to the slurry’s rheological fingerprint as a result of fermentation. with the notable change being a reduction in the critical strain amplitude needed for the onset of nonlinearity. All slurries were found to be elastoviscoplastic. with the elastic/viscous crossover at roughly 100% strain amplitude. Whereas prior biomass rheology studies have involved pretreated feedstocks and solubilization mediated by fungal cellulase. we report results for feedstocks with no pretreatment other than autoclaving and for solubilization mediated by C. thermocellum.

Current studies suggest that agricultural intensification through optimally managed crops on today’s cropland alone is insufficient to satisfy future demand.

Resulting changes in regional water endowments and soil moisture will affect the productivity of cropland. leading to changes in food production and international trade patterns. High population growth elsewhere in Africa and Asia will put further pressure on natural resources and food security in South Africa. Based on four climate change scenarios from two general circulation models (CSIRO and MIROC) and two IPCC SRES emission scenarios (A1B.

1268692,The GTAP-W model: Accounting for water use in agriculture,2011,Alvaro Calzadilla and Katrin Rehdanz and Richard SJ Tol,,,1745,,Kiel Working Paper,Water and agriculture are intrinsically linked. Water is essential for crop production and agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater resources. However. this link is commonly ignored by economic models mainly because water use is not reported in the national economic accounts. Few regions have markets for water. This paper describes the new version of GTAP-W. a multi-region. multi-sector computable general equilibrium model of the world economy. The new version of GTAP-W distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture and introduces water as an explicit factor of production for irrigated agriculture. Moreover. the new production structure accounts for substitution possibilities between irrigation and other primary factors. The new model has been used to study a variety of topics including: irrigation efficiency. sustainable water use. climate change and trade liberalization.

The analysis uses the new version of the GTAP-W model. which distinguishes between rainfed and irrigated agriculture and implements water as an explicit factor of production for irrigated agriculture. Significant reductions in agricultural tariffs lead to modest changes in regional water use. Patterns are non-linear. On the regional level. water use may go up for partial liberalization. and down for more complete liberalization. This is because different crops respond differently to tariff reductions. and because trade and competition matter too. Moreover. trade liberalization tends to reduce water use in water scarce regions. and increase water use in water abundant regions. even though water markets do not exist in most countries. Considering impacts of climate change. the results show that global food production. welfare and GDP fall over time while food prices increase. Larger changes are observed under the SRES A2 scenario for the medium term (2020) and under the SRES A1B scenario for the long term (2050).

We find that global poverty and inequality measures are sensitive to the downscaling methodology used. Our results show that future economic growth is crucial for poverty reduction. Higher per capita incomes tend to favour poverty reduction. while higher population growth rates delay this progress. Scenarios that combine high economic growth and convergence assumptions with low population growth rates produce better outcomes.

This is a synthetic nanostructured material that contains high-aspect-ratio nano-protrusions. such as spikes or needles. on the Si surface produced via plasma etching. We now show that coating a bSi surface composed of 15 μm-high needles conformably with BDD produces a robust electrochemical electrode with high sensitivity and high electroactive area.

At present. the most effective fuel cell catalysts. both in cathode and anode. are highly dispersed platinum-based nanoparticles. These Pt nanoparticles are normally supported on carbon materials in order to increase the active surface area of Pt and improve the catalyst utilization. Among other factors. the performance of metal nanoparticles supported on carbon materials depends strongly on the properties of the support. For fuel cell applications. carbon supports should have several characteristics such as high surface area for dispersing catalytic metal particles. high electrical conductivity for providing electrical pathways. and mesoporous structure for the facile diffusion of reactants and by-products. Moreover. the interaction between the carbon support and the Pt plays an important role in the properties of the Pt/C catalyst. This interaction can be improved through the surface modification of the support in order to form proper functional groups and chemical links at the Pt/C interface.

In this system. a beam splitter is used to separate the concentrated solar radiation into two parts: one for the PV power generation and the other for thermal utility. The solar concentrator is a flat Fresnel-type concentrator with glass mirror reflectors. It can concentrate solar radiation onto solar cells with high uniformity. which is beneficial to improving the efficiency of solar cells. The thermal receiver is separated to the solar cells. and therefore. the thermal fluid can be heated to a relatively high temperature and does not affect the performance of solar cells.

Currently. however. we lack research that studies knowledge spillovers in such technologies at the firm level. To address this shortcoming. in this article we investigate the drivers of technological innovation in the solar photovoltaic industry. We find clear evidence for the existence of interfirm knowledge spillovers and show that besides investments in R&D. investments in manufacturing equipment have served as a channel of knowledge absorption. Our findings shed new light on the narrative linking environmental innovation and competitive advantage.

1268796,Hybrid ambidexterity: How the environment shapes incumbents' use of structural and contextual approaches,2019,Jan Ossenbrink and Joern Hoppmann and Volker H. Hoffmann,,Organization Science,,,,According to the literature on ambidexterity. organizations can use structural or contextual approaches to simultaneously explore novel opportunities and exploit existing ones. So far. however. we know very little about what induces organizations to focus on structural versus contextual ambidexterity. or how they combine the two approaches to maximize organizational learning. To shed more light on these questions. we investigate how the environment shapes a firm’s use of structural and contextual ambidexterity. Drawing on a comparative. longitudinal case study of the four largest electric utility companies in Germany. we show that firms focused on structural ambidexterity whenever they perceived emerging opportunities in the environment as requiring organizational culture and capabilities fundamentally different from their own.

Using data on more than 5.300 energy efficiency investment decisions by 462 firms. we find that firms that draw more strongly on external change agents seize significantly more sustainable investment opportunities. We show that external change agents are more effective in stimulating investments if they broadly search for investment opportunities and are more strongly involved in the implementation of change initiatives. Moreover. surprisingly. we do not find that using internal change agents in parallel with external agents enhances the effectiveness of external change agents.

Policy instruments such as feed-in tariffs have played a critical role in driving the growth of solar photovoltaics. and could accelerate the uptake of other technologies that are key to the decarbonization of energy systems. Historical experiences. however. show that failing to adjust economic incentives to falling technology prices can fundamentally undermine these policies' effectiveness and cost-efficiency. This paper addresses this challenge by assessing three novel policy designs. Based on control-theory principles. the proposed mechanisms modify incentives in response to changes in deployment. policy costs. or profitability for adopters.

We argue that firms use collaborations to directly work on or to work around bottlenecks. Moreover. we suggest that the relationship between bottlenecks and collaborations differs depending on the location of the bottleneck and firms’ investments in adjacent ecosystems. Employing a novel measure of bottlenecks. we show that firms shift collaborations to the complement side of the ecosystem in response to complement bottlenecks and also provide evidence for a moderating effect of investments in adjacent ecosystems. We find no uniform evidence for a similar effect on the component side of the ecosystem. which may be explained by differences between component and complements in terms of knowledge distance and uncertainty.

Currently. however. we still lack a sufficient understanding of how to balance these two types of policy instruments to maximize the mix efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper. we use agent-based modelling to simulate how the relative focus on technology-push vs. demand-pull instruments affects the outcome of policy interventions in sociotechnical systems. Based on simulations for the solar photovoltaic industry in Germany. we show that whether a focus on technology-push or demand-pull intruments is more effective depends on two important factors:(1) the goals of policy-making and (2) the relative weight policy makers put on present vs. future performance. A focus on technology-push is useful if policy makers pursue industry policy goals and put a stronger weight on future performance. A focus on demand-pull is more effective if policy makers pursue environmental goals and strongly value present performance. Our study contributes to the literature on policy mixes by stressing the importance of weighing and combining alternative policy goals. rather than only instruments.

The previous literature stresses that such identity change processes include changing organizational members’ perception of the ideal and current organizational identity. However. thus far. the literature provides no systematic evidence of the factors that shape how individuals within incumbent organizations perceive their organizations’ ideal and current identity.

1268811,The Impact of Technology Characteristics on the Formation of Exploration and Exploitation Alliances-Insights from the Solar Photovoltaic Industry,,Joern Hoppmann and Hyundo Choi and Meagan Stumpe Mauter,,,,,,The literature has identified exploration and exploitation alliances as two ideal-type modes firms use to collaboratively develop and commercialize technologies. Previous studies have investigated the antecedents and performance effects of a firm? s balance between exploration and exploitation in alliance formation. Yet. currently. we lack a sufficient understanding of how a firm? s choice to explore or exploit via alliances might depend on the characteristics of the firm? s technology. Drawing on data from 1079 partnerships in the solar photovoltaic industry. in this paper we test how the complexity. maturity and tacitness of technological knowledge affect a firm? s propensity to form exploration and exploitation alliances. We find that a higher tacitness of technological knowledge raises. whereas a higher technological maturity reduces the likelihood of entering exploration alliances. Moreover. we show that different sub-types of exploitation alliances. such as production and marketing alliances. differ in the degree to which they are related to specific technology characteristics. We conclude that understanding a firm? s choice to explore or exploit through alliances requires an in-depth understanding of the specific technology pursued. In addition. our work provides empirical support for recent studies that have called for a more fine-grained differentiation of alliances according to their position on the exploration-exploitation continuum.

1268819,Boundary-layer control by electric fields: A feasibility study,1997,R Vilela Mendes and JA Dente,,arXiv preprint physics/9705020,,,,A problem of great concern in aviation and submarine propulsion is the control of the boundary layer and. in particular. the methods to extend the laminar region as a means to decrease noise and fuel consumption. In this paper we study the flow of air along an airfoil when a layer of ionized gas and a longitudinal electric field are created in the boundary layer region. By deriving scaling solutions and more accurate numerical solutions we discuss the possibility of achieving significant boundary layer control for realistic physical parameters. Practical design formulas and criteria are obtained.

This study is motivated by the application of SRG to direct-drive wind turbines and other low speed renewable energy systems. In direct drive energy converters considerable simplifications result from the elimination of the gear box which has generally been used to interface a slowly rotating shaft with the generator shaft.

MOFs are a class of organic-inorganic hybrid crystalline materials consisting of metallic moieties that are linked by strong coordination bonds to organic ligands. They exhibit a great structural diversity and possess low weight. exceptionally high surface areas. large free volumes. and tunable pore sizes and functionalities. making them extremely attractive for a variety of applications such as hydrogen storage. For these reasons MOFs have been extensively studied. In this paper. a review of recent developments on hydrogen storage in MOFs is presented. with a focus on the effects of various factors including open metal sites. ‘guest’ metal ions. ligand functionalization. surface area. pore volume. pore size. and Pt or Pd metal nanoparticles. on hydrogen storage.

The conventional nanocasting process that involves impregnation with furfural alcohol and subsequent chemical vapour deposition was followed. Several techniques such as X‐ray diffraction (XRD). scanning electron microscopy (SEM). thermo‐gravimetric analysis (TGA) and surface area analysis were used to characterize the parent templating materials including the resulting nanocasted carbons. The study demonstrated that there is greater potential for the use of value‐added clays rather than their pristine form and hence presents a cost‐effective alternative for producing carbonaceous materials with more attractive properties for hydrogen storage applications.

Although vendors offer a “retrofit package.” to the best of our knowledge there has not been a study undertaken that looks at the technical and economic viability of oxy-fuel technology for CO2 capture for South African coal-fired power stations. This study presents a techno-economic analysis for six coal fired power stations in South Africa. Each of these power stations has a total capacity of about 3600 MW. The analysis was done using the oxy-fuel model developed by Carnegie Mellon University in the USA. The model was used to define the performance and costs of retrofitting the boilers.

The theoretical debate on politics of scale opens the way to investigate the reconfiguration of scalar organization in capitalism. which has complex and contradictory effects on power relations. It demonstrates that oppositional politics can ‘jump scale’ by rearticulating issues at larger scales to mobilize leverage.

1268893,4 Transparency and Development: Ethical Consumption through Web 2.0 and the Internet of Things,2011,Mark Graham and Håvard Haarstad,79,Open Development: Networked Innovations in International Development,,,,A central problem in contemporary processes of economic globalization is that information about commodities has not been globalized at the same rate as the commodities themselves. Contemporary capitalism conceals the histories and geographies of most commodities from consumers. These consumers rarely have opportunities to gaze backward through the chains of production in order to gain knowledge about the sites of production. transformation. and distribution of products. The complexity of commodity chains leaves us with highly opaque production processes. Transnational companies often strive to maintain this opacity through a separation between the “airbrushed world” communicated through advertising on one hand. 1 and the actual world of production on the other. With this problem in mind. this chapter discusses the potential for emergent practices of collaboration and communication through the Internet to facilitate flows of information about commodity chains. The hope is that. by transcending barriers of time and space. new practices tied to communication and information sharing through the Internet will open up the politics of consumer activism and influence the way goods are produced. particularly those that that originate in the Global South.Increasingly complex structures of production have been created by transnational corporations (TNCs) in their quest for efficiency. new markets. and new competitive advantages. 2 TNCs generally break production processes into networks and chains that are constituted by complex sets of geographically separated nodes. 3 The lack of association between commodities and information …,True,PQ3kg7sAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,79,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Sp6NAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA79&dq=info:l0NHamJRiBgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=cmKKtikisL&sig=qrI_ynbiFkvK2LrK5g8YElc4X-c,1767752336874619799,/scholar?cites=1767752336874619799,,,https://itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/download/693/693-1851-2-PB.pdf,0,0,0

Because achieving a “smart city” is a wide agenda rather than a specific set of interventions. smartness itself cannot easily be measured or quantifiably assessed.

On the basis of our study of the emergent labor movement in the Chilean aquaculture industry. we suggest that this field suffers from what we term “glocalocentrism”. which overshadows the fundamental importance of structures and processes that are primarily scaled nationally.

At the present juncture there seems to be widespread optimism due to the belief that natural resource extraction can engender social development and improve livelihoods in the region. Many of the governments have been influenced in a variety of ways by popular demands for more equitable models of development and more participatory politics.

This article argues for geography's relational concept of scale – seeing scales as interconnected arenas produced and constructed by social action. rather than naturally existing. discrete units – and shows some implications this has for how we frame and act on environmental issues. In particular. a relational perspective on scale changes the way we frame the scalar “existence” of environmental problems and how we assign responsibility.

1268903,Collective political subjectivity and the problem of scale,2007,Håvard Haarstad,13,Contemporary politics,1,57-74,Routledge,The contemporary political climate presents significant challenges for attempts to conceptualize and practise collective action. New forms of socio-spatial organization have challenged the centrality of the category of class. and opened for the proliferation of new political categories. Emancipation politics seem fragmented to the point where it is hard to discern a broad. common project. This has led both to efforts to rethink class in Marxist theory and to imagine collective political subjectivities at a relative distance from Marxism. Collective political subjectivity can be understood as the theory and practice of constructing a project around the interests of a broad range of actors who can negotiate the fundamental power relations in contemporary capitalism. Here theory and practice are mutually constitutive. since theory is derived from observation of practice. which in turn receives much of its imagination from theory.

1268904,The politics of rapid urban transformation,2018,Jakob Grandin and Håvard Haarstad and Kristin Kjærås and Stefan Bouzarovski,31,,,16-22,Elsevier,This paper addresses the potential for urban change in relation to rapid transitions and the 1.5 °C target. Interventions to achieve rapid urban transformation are typically framed in technical and economic terms. This means that the social and political conditions for rapid urban transformations may be overlooked. We address this gap by highlighting recent insights from sociology. human geography and urban studies that consider how the transformative potential of technical interventions is conditioned by social and political dynamics. The paper highlights three dimensions of such dynamics — the politics of governance. infrastructure and everyday practice — and proposes six areas where the understanding of the politics of rapid urban transformation can be improved.,True,PQ3kg7sAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343517300702,2100815763167000138,/scholar?cites=2100815763167000138,,,,0,0,0

Recent literature focusing on the relationship between globalization and these spaces foregrounds the new opportunity structures for political practices. Yet amid talk of ‘grassroots globalization’and ‘globalization from below’. it is important to remain sensitive to how certain forms of practice and organization. particularly those of labor unions. are marginalized within the political spaces of globalization.

London,The notion of the ‘resource curse’ now provides the predominating framework for understanding the persistence of poverty in many resource-rich developing countries. Over the past decades. it has been juxtaposed onto the development discourse of good governance. whereby the so-called curse is typically attributed to ‘governance’ of the natural resource exploitation process and the management of the resource rents (Leite & Weidmann. 1999; Mehlum et al.. 2006; Robinson et al.. 2006; Ross. 2012). thus leading to the axiom that certain types of institutional reforms are necessary to escape the curse.

Our methods identify conditions under which it is more energetically favorable to store energy than it is to simply curtail electricity production. Electrochemically based storage technologies result in much smaller EROI ratios than large-scale geologically based storage technologies like compressed air energy storage (CAES) and pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS). All storage technologies paired with solar photovoltaic (PV) generation yield EROI ratios that are greater than curtailment. Due to their low energy stored on electrical energy invested (ESOIe) ratios. conventional battery technologies reduce the EROI ratios of wind generation below curtailment EROI ratios.

A dynamic net energy analysis of renewable electricity generation supported by energy storage,2014,Michael Carbajales-Dale and Charles J Barnhart and Sally M Benson,7,Energy & Environmental Science,5,1538-1544,Royal Society of Chemistry,Global wind power and photovoltaic (PV) installed capacities are growing at very high rates (20% per year and 60% per year. respectively). These technologies require large. ‘up-front’ energetic investments. Conceptually. as these industries grow. some proportion of their electrical output is ‘re-invested’ to support manufacture and deployment of new generation capacity. As variable and intermittent. renewable generation capacity increases grid penetration. electrical energy storage will become an ever more important load-balancing technology. These storage technologies are currently expensive and energy intensive to deploy. We explore the impact on net energy production when wind and PV must ‘pay’ the energetic cost of storage deployment.

A useful example of astute framing of evidence can be viewed by analyzing the campaign of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) against the trade in wild birds. The RSPB was able to ‘re-frame’their evidence against wild bird trading when they sensed an opportunity to package it in a politically salient way. They had campaigned for a long period of time to achieve a European Union ban. presenting clear evidence that the trade was ongoing.

Geothermally heated aquifers in basaltic rock provide conditions conducive to forming Fe/Mg phyllosilicates at depth. Throughout the Noachian period. a high flux of km‐scale bolides excavated buried materials and distributed them over the surface. We use the Maxwell Z‐model to quantify the volume and final location of excavated clay‐bearing material. We focus on two potentially detectable properties: the volume of clay‐bearing material ejected as a fraction of total ejected volume and the volume percentage of clay‐bearing material in the ejecta as a function of distance from the crater's rim. Generally. the volume percentage of clays in the ejecta is greatest for craters less than 25 km in diameter.

Phonons and their possible coupling with the macroscopic electric fields resulting from the long-range interactions of instantaneous local dipoles (due to nuclear vibrations) in polar solids are taken into account through supercell calculations and longitudinal optical-transversal optical splitting corrections. Full structural relaxations using conventional density functional theory and hybrid functionals with localized Gaussian-type orbitals or plane-wave basis sets reveal a similar deviation of the local Ti environment compared to the TiO2(B) structural refinements reported so far.

1268972,Porous metal organic framework nanoparticles to address the challenges related to busulfan encapsulation,2011,Tamim Chalati and Patricia Horcajada and Patrick Couvreur and Christian Serre and M Ben Yahia and Guillaume Maurin and Ruxandra Gref,6,Nanomedicine,10,1683-1695,Future Medicine Ltd,Busulfan is an alkylating agent widely used in chemotherapy. but with severe side effects. Many attempts have been made to entrap busulfan in nanocarriers to avoid liver accumulation and to protect it against rapid degradation in aqueous media. However. poor loadings (≤5 wt%) and fast release were generally obtained due to the low affinity of busulfan towards the nanocarriers. Moreover. drug crystallization often occurred during nanoparticle preparation. To circumvent these drawbacks. metal organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles. based on crystalline porous iron (III) carboxylates. have shown an unprecedented loading (up to 25 wt%) of busulfan. This was attributed to the high porosity of nanoMOFs as well as to their hydrophilic–hydrophobic internal microenvironment well adapted to the amphiphilic character of busulfan.

To that aim. very simple concepts of chemical bonding can be used to find out the origin of the electrode limitations and to guide experimentalists for the design of new promising materials.

For this. operando XAS was carried out during the first one and a half cycles. and the whole set of measured data was analysed using a statistical-chemometric approach. while low temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements were carried out ex situ on selected samples stopped at different points of the electrochemical reaction. Complementary ab initio calculations were performed to support the experimental findings. Both techniques show that. upon the first sodiation. most Sb reacts with Na to form disordered Na 3 Sb. This step is accompanied by the formation of amorphous Sb as an intermediate. Upon inversion of the current Na 3 Sb is desodiated and an amorphous Sb phase. distinct from the pristine bulk Sb state. is gradually formed. However. both XAS and Mössbauer spectroscopy were unable to spot the formation of intermediate Na x Sb phases. which were evinced in previous works by operando Pair Distribution Function analyses.

Such a count satisfies the stability electron requirement for B62− (20 electrons) octahedra and B22− (8 electrons) units and allows the filling of two supplementary low-lying bands deriving from the valence metallic d atomic orbitals. This favored electron count is not reached for CaB4 which is then formally deficient by one electron per metal atom. This indicates that CaB4 is unlikely to exist without n-doping.,True,-_xQL08AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,14,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic701967n,3680816555290154686,/scholar?cites=3680816555290154686,,,,0,0,0

The attempt was made to gain a physical insight into the nature of the extraordinarily high hypersusceptibility of TeO2 glass. A finite field perturbation method implemented in the CRYSTAL code with the “sawtooth” approach was employed. The χ(3) values calculated for α-TeO2 were found to be of the same order as that measured for TeO2 glass and much higher than the values computed for α-SiO2 which. in turn. were close to that of glassy silica.,True,-_xQL08AAAAJ:sgsej9ZJWHMC,11,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp805050s,4251740234995819327,/scholar?cites=4251740234995819327,,,,0,0,0

The building uses renewable energy technologies and is usable in emergency situations or as simply temporary housing.Results show that the building module causes the emission of 1.5 t of CO2eq/m2 and consumes 29.2 GJ/m2 of primary energy during its life cycle. The building achieves the Net Zero Energy Building target even if it has relevant environmental impacts in the materials production stage (72% on average of the total impacts while the use stage reaches the 23% on average). The construction and the end-of-life stages give a marginal contribution to the total impacts. since they account for the 1% and the 3%. respectively.,True,CBSDWQIAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,47,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032118302429,5676323705975460544,/scholar?cites=5676323705975460544,,,,0,0,0

Refrigerating. and Air-Conditioning Engineers. Inc.(ASHRAE),In the framework of international actions to reduce the energy requirements and greenhouse gases emissions due to buildings. a new International Energy Agency task has been recently established in order to study Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs). The commonly shared concept of NZEB. is a building whose annual balance of energy consumptions tends to zero. This concept is still too imprecise and the authors of this paper participate to the activities of SubTask B of IEA Task40 with the aim of establishing an internationally agreed understanding on NZEBs. The task is based on a common methodology for identifying and refining design approaches and tools to support industry adoption of innovative demand/supply technologies for NZEBS. This goal is pursued through detailed modeling and analysis of specific NZEB case studies. Among the specific objectives of the Sub Task B it is possible to include the analysis of redesigned studies. Redesigned studies should identify better alternative solutions for plants. building envelope or impact on the environment that significantly modify the building. To provide high quality information about the design process of a NZEB. it was decided to examine in detail the specific case study of the Leaf House (LH) located in Ancona. Italy. The studied building is fully monitored in terms of thermal environment. energy production and consumption. water use and occupancy. The purpose of this paper is to present some optionsto improve the performance of the selected building. identified by using the collected data and analyzing a detailed TRNSYS model of plant-building complex.

In a country where a large share of existing buildings have heritage value. it is important to design effective retrofit solutions also in historical buildings. In this context. the paper describes the experience of re-design of an existing rural building located in Sicily. inside the ancient Greeks'“Valley of the Temples”.

1269070,Operation of solid oxide fuel cell anodes with practical hydrocarbon fuels,2004,Scott A Barnett and Jiang Liu and Yuanbo Lin,,,,,Northwestern University (US),This work was carried out to achieve a better understanding of how SOFC anodes work with real fuels. The motivation was to improve the fuel flexibility of SOFC anodes. thereby allowing simplification and cost reduction of SOFC power plants. The work was based on prior results indicating that Ni-YSZ anode-supported SOFCs can be operated directly on methane and natural gas. while SOFCs with novel anode compositions can work with higher hydrocarbons. While these results were promising. more work was clearly needed to establish the feasibility of these direct-hydrocarbon SOFCs. Basic information on hydrocarbon-anode reactions should be broadly useful because reformate fuel gas can contain residual hydrocarbons. especially methane. In the Phase I project. we have studied the reaction mechanisms of various hydrocarbons--including methane. natural gas. and higher hydrocarbons--on two kinds of Ni-containing anodes: conventional Ni-YSZ anodes and a novel ceramic-based anode composition that avoid problems with coking. The effect of sulfur impurities was also studied. The program was aimed both at achieving an understanding of the interactions between real fuels and SOFC anodes. and providing enough information to establish the feasibility of operating SOFC stacks directly on hydrocarbon fuels.

Mwabora,9,The African Review of Physics,,33-38,The African Review of Physics,Chalcogenide glasses are composed of chalcogen elements (selenium. sulphur and tellurium) of group VI of the periodic table. There is an increased interest in the properties of amorphous selenium (a-Se) rich semiconducting alloys due to their current use as photoconductors in high definition television (TV) pick-up tubes and in digital X-ray imaging [1]. Chalcogenide glasses of a-Se are largely used in memory devices and fiber optics as they exhibit threshold and memory switching behavior as well as infrared transmission [2].Pure a-Se is less sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. In addition. the glass transition temperature of a-Se is just above room temperature (~ 42℃). which makes a-Se rather unstable and in danger of unintended crystallization. To stabilize a-Se matrix. certain additives are added. in the order of about 1 at.%. These include lead (Pb). arsenide (As). bismuth (Bi). among others [3]. The glass transition temperature of stabilized a-Se is about 70oC [4]. The study focuses on the role of Bi in affecting the optical properties of a-Se films. Limited work is reported on the Raman studies of the as deposited Se-Bi thin films. Addition of bismuth to selenium films is said to increase the stability. sensitivity of the films and changes the conductivity from p-type to n-type [5]. It also serves to increase the chemical and thermal stability of the amorphous selenium glass.

1269094,Device simulation of Sb2S3 solar cells by SCAPS-1D software,2019,Victor Odari and Robinson Musembi and Julius Mwabora,3,Africa Journal of Physical Sciences ISSN: 2313-3317,,,,Antimony sulphide (Sb2S3) has drawn research interest due to its promising properties for photovoltaic applications. The progress in developing highly efficient Sb2S3 solar cells has stimulated this study to a great extent. In this paper. we present the results of a simulation of solar cell processing parameters on the performance of the solar cell through theoretical analysis and device simulation using SCAPS software. The results of this simulation show that the solar cell performance can be enhanced to a great extent by adjusting the thickness. doping concentration and defect density of both the TiO2 buffer layer and Sb2S3 absorber layer and also the electron affinity of the TiO2 buffer layer. Optimized parameters were found to be: doping concentration of (1.0 X 1017CM3 for TiO2 and 3.0 X 1016 CM3 for Sb2S3). defect density of the Sb2S3 absorber at (1.0 X 1015..... 3) and the electron affinity of the buffer layer at (4.26 eV). The results obtained were as follows: Voc of 750 mV. Jsc of 15.23 mA/cm2. FF of 73.55% and efficiency of 8.41%.

Nitrogen gas ratio (Φ ) in the doping procedure was varied from 0 to 0.024. HigherΦ resulted in decrease in film porosity. and XRD analysis of the TiO2 films showed that nitrogen doping induced a rutile-to-anatase phase transitions. SEM shows that the particle sizes of nitrogen doped films reduced with increase of Φ from an average of 36nm to 18nm. Optical measurements revealed that film transmittance improved and reflectance reduced in the visible light spectrum with nitrogen doping. Nitrogen doped TiO2 photoelectrodes have been found to be more sensitive to visible light spectrum and has a narrower band gap. Photoelectrochemical measurements showed a large anodic shift of the onset potential for the cathodic scans of the order of 0.24V. The overall energy conversion efficiency. short circuit current and open circuit voltages of the solar cell fabricated with nitrogen doped TiO2  photoelectrode were found to depend onΦ .

It is a system that can be easily modified. offering a range of design solutions. It can be easily mounted on the exterior and/or the interior of a vertical opening. it can come in various shapes from static flat forms to curved reflective surfaces. or it can even be actively controlled. A light shelf can offer shading and at the same time can redirect a significant part of the incoming light flux towards the ceiling improving daylight uniformity.

Moreover. lighting controls can ensure that the near zero energy requirements by EU can be achieved for near zero energy buildings (nZEBs). For this reason. more sophisticated lighting controls must be proposed in order to take full advantage of LEDs and their flexibility concerning dimming. This paper proposes the architecture of an embedded computer camera controller for monitoring and management of image data. which is applied in various control cases. and particularly in digitally controlled lighting devices. The proposed system deals with real-time monitoring and management of a GigE camera input. An in-house developed algorithm using MATLAB enables the identification of areas in luminance values. The embedded microcontroller is part of a complete lighting control system with an imaging sensor in order to measure and control the illumination of several working areas of a room. The power consumption of the proposed lighting system was measured and was compared with the power consumption of a typical photosensor.

1269114,Identifying. examining. and planning areas protected from light pollution. the case study of planning the first national dark sky park in Greece,2019,Andreas Papalambrou and Lambros T Doulos,11,Sustainability,21,5963,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Light pollution is a type of pollution that climaxes in cities and occurs increasingly away from them. due to the increase of artificial lighting and inappropriate lighting design (selection of luminaires. aiming. illuminance/luminance levels. and spectral characteristics). Increasingly. light pollution also affects the countryside due to local lighting but also distant lighting propagating from urban areas. This has a significant impact on ecosystems and astronomical observing sites. This work analyzes the main facts about light pollution (causes. impact. and solutions) and studies the methods. parameters. and special requirements for planning of light pollution protected areas. This dark sky park planning methodology is implemented as a case study in mount Parnon which has been selected due to its significance as a Natura 2000 protected area and because it is Greece’s most popular astronomical observing site. Mount Parnon is located close to two major cities as well as significant highways. however the site itself remains dark due to its sparse population. Planning a dark sky park involves a complete study of facts regarding the specific site. Existing lighting installations are surveyed in detail by recording types of luminaires and lamps and recording their positions in a map. Lighting illuminance levels are measured by photometers and spectra are analyzed using a spectrometer. Sky brightness levels measurements are performed using specialized photometers and light pollution origins are traced using wide-field photography. Finally. a proposal is made for a dark sky park scheme suited to the specific case of the site.

There are norms that define the required luminance in this entrance zone. which depends on the variability of the daylight on the surfaces that surround the entrance. In most existing tunnels. at the time of their design. there were no proper simulation tools resulting in an over-dimensioned lighting system. thus leading to over illumination and increased energy consumption. The reduction of this consumption can be realized through proper optimization of the pavement or by retrofitting the lighting system with cost effective LED luminaires. However. energy savings can be achieved with proper control of the tunnel's lighting system. since it is quite common to be organized in a number of active stages.

This paper investigates the influence that different roof types.(ie. sawtooth roof. skylight and monitor). have on daylight levels. along with the construction cost in an industrial environment in Athens. Greece. Construction costs and daylight adequacy/uniformity are antagonistic phenomena. since as the distance between the roof openings increases. the construction cost is minimised. while the daylight levels and the uniformity are reduced. Therefore. an optimisation method is proposed in order to find the optimum distance between the roof openings. The selected building is a representative unit of Greek industrial facilities. while the optimisation method is based upon a multiparametric approach. This consists of three (3) different roof opening arrangement types with different geometric characteristics. The daylight metrics used are the Daylight Area. the Daylight Factor. the Mean Daylight Autonomy. the Uniform Daylight Index and the Annual Sunlight Exposure. Overall. sawtooth roofs represent the best choice for daylight provision in industrial buildings at the examined geographic location. Using the aforementioned optimisation method. the optimum solution of distances between the roof openings ranges from 10 m to 13 m.

With theoretical aspects of human rights serving as a starting point. the article then moves to a consideration of the legal dynamics of migration. the history of U.S. (im)migration law in relation to lesbian and gay asylum claims. and the Uniting American Families Act (2005). Drawing from the concept of sexual migration. the article proposes that religious or spiritual communities may provide important networks and ideological resources for lesbian and gay migrants who subscribe to religious values. particularly in a context of politically incendiary claims surrounding homosexuality and immigration.

When he served as Mexico’s secretary of energy in 2003–4. Calderón helped to accelerate his country’s commitment to wind energy. As he ended his presidential term. wind power counted for almost twenty-three hundred kilotons of carbon dioxide reduction in Mexico annually. Calderón’s speech on that day was neither triumphant nor a swan song; instead. it pivoted between hope and precarity (fig. 1). He began with droughts. some of the most severe ever seen in Mexico and. to the north. in Texas.“This is climate change.” he said to his audience of several hundred seated in front of him.“Carbon dioxide is like a sweater surrounding the earth.” heating the ocean’s waters and making for differently distributed weather.“However …,True,vAK7k9UAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,40,https://read.dukeupress.edu/public-culture/article-abstract/28/2%20(79)/215/85787,8118724719859544936,/scholar?cites=8118724719859544936,,,https://read.dukeupress.edu/public-culture/article/28/2%20(79)/215/85787,0,0,0

Focusing on a locally produced and very popular television show in Nicaragua. I consider how social justice knowledge is produced through television characters' scripting and performance. The ideological underpinnings aspire to a dialogic engagement with the audience. as producers aim to both generate public discourse and benefit from audiences' suggestions and active engagement. Several levels of media advocacy interventions are considered including the production. scripting. and translation of transnational material into local registers.

1269137,Religion at the corner of bliss and nirvana: politics. identity. and faith in new migrant communities,2009,Cymene Howe,,,,,Duke University Press,Based on ethnographic research by an interdisciplinary team of scholars and activists. Religion at the Corner of Bliss and Nirvana illuminates the role that religion plays in the civic and political experiences of new migrants in the United States. By bringing innovative questions and theoretical frameworks to bear on the experiences of Chinese. Filipino. Mexican. Salvadoran. and Vietnamese migrants. the contributors demonstrate how groups and individuals negotiate multiple religious. cultural. and national identities. and how religious faiths are transformed through migration. Taken together. their essays show that migrants’ religious lives are much more than replications of home in a new land. They reflect a process of adaptation to new physical and cultural environments. and an ongoing synthesis of cultural elements from the migrants’ countries of origin and the United States. As they conducted research. the contributors not only visited churches and temples but also single-room-occupancy hotels. brothels. tattoo-removal clinics. and the streets of San Francisco. El Salvador. Mexico. and Vietnam. Their essays include an exploration of how faith-based organizations can help LGBT migrants surmount legal and social complexities. an examination of transgendered sex workers’ relationship with the unofficial saint Santisima Muerte. a comparison of how a Presbyterian mission and a Buddhist temple in San Francisco help Chinese immigrants to acculturate. and an analysis of the transformation of baptismal rites performed by Mayan migrants.

1269138,Latin America in the Anthropocene: energy transitions and climate change mitigations,2015,Cymene Howe,20,The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology,2,231-241,Wiley,Energy creates both possibilities and liabilities. Plentiful. inexpensive energy has long been a cornerstone of modernist dreams of never-ending expansion. While this may be a fantasy. the truth—at least according to overwhelming scientific evidence—is that our use of fossil fuels has led to distressing global consequences. In May 2013. the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the average daily level of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels had exceeded 400 parts per million. a density of heat-trapping gases that has not existed for at least three million years. long before humans evolved (Gillis 2013). The Holocenic conditions in which we developed as a species have expired. and the Anthropocene. an epoch defined by the advent of urban-industrial society as a geological force. seems to have taken its place. Human landscape transformation now massively exceeds natural sediment production and ocean acidification and the destruction of biota are the new norm. meaning that evolution itself has been “forced into a new trajectory” (Davis 2010:31). The reality of increased global energy consumption and its concomitant climatological effect has meant that local practices are now universal concerns. In this special issue of the Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology each author works within this spirit of currency. recognizing that we—as social subjects. as a species. or as inhabitants of a planet shared with other biotic life—are living in a time of decisions that will echo for centuries to come.

The thermal conditions of the combustion chamber are governed by chemical kinetics strongly coupled with heat transfer from the hot gas to the walls. The heat losses have a critical effect on HCCI ignition timing and burning rate. so it is essential to understand heat transfer process in the combustion chamber in the modeling of HCCI engines. In the present paper. a comparative analysis is performed to investigate the performance of well-known heat transfer correlations in an HCCI engine. The results from the existing correlations are compared with the experimental results obtained in a single-cylinder engine.

The over-prediction arises because it is not possible for the standard Wiebe function to fully match both the slower combustion (i.e. the large spread of autoignition times) that occurs in the cooler boundary regions adjacent to the walls and the faster combustion (small spread of autoignition times) in the hot core. The slower combustion by the wall is commonly modeled with a multi-zone approach. The aim of this work was to improve the ability of a single-zone model to predict cylinder pressure without introducing a separate wall zone. This was accomplished by using. within a single zone. a double-Wiebe function combustion model in which most of the fuel burns as usual but a minor fraction (typically 10–20%) burns at a reduced rate.

The method is based on the simultaneous use of sensitivity. reaction-flow. and extended lifetime analyses. The sensitivity analysis detects species to which the overall combustion process is sensitive. Small inaccuracies in calculating these species result in large errors in the characteristic behavior of the chemical scheme. Redundant species are detected by applying a simultaneous reaction-flow and sensitivity analyses. The sensitivities are transported through the reacting flow and each species is assigned an importance according to the importance of the species itself and the flow of atoms to and from the important species. The redundant species are removed from the detailed mechanism (74 species and 510 reactions) resulting in a skeleton mechanism (63 species and 386 reactions).

1269154,Performance and emissions of a diesel tractor engine fueled with marine diesel and soybean methyl ester,2011,B Gokalp and E Buyukkaya and HS Soyhan,35,Biomass and bioenergy,8,3575-3583,Pergamon,Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that is cleaner than petrodiesel. Biodiesel can be used directly as fuel for a diesel engine without having to modify the engine system. It has the major advantages of having high biodegradability. excellent lubricity and no sulfur content. This paper presents the results of investigations carried out in studying the fuel properties of soybean methyl ester (SME) and its blend with marine diesel fuel from 5%. 20% and 50% blends by volume and in running a diesel engine with these fuels. The results indicate that the use of biodiesel produces lower smoke opacity (up to 74%). but higher brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) (up to 12%) compared to marine fuel (MF). The measured carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of B5 and B100 fuels were found to be 3% and 52% lower than that of the MF. respectively.,True,fC0Nc4cAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,87,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953411002881,9242416993241886008,/scholar?cites=9242416993241886008,,,,0,0,0

Theoretically. we develop a correlation for τ in rectangular channels. which depends on the aspect ratio and the ratio (ψ) between the bubble velocity and the total superficial velocity. This correlation suggests that τ is – for a given value of ψ – larger in upward than in downward Taylor flow because of buoyancy. The evaluation of τ from direct numerical simulations of Taylor flow confirms this result. The lower value of τ suggests that the sequential mass transfer between the gas bubble. the liquid slug and the channel wall is more efficient in downward than in upward flow. Numerical investigations of the overall wall-to-bulk mass transfer. which also contains the contribution through the liquid film between the bubble and the channel wall. show. however. that upward Taylor flow is slightly more …,True,fC0Nc4cAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920586109003654,4879439801086116226,/scholar?cites=4879439801086116226,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49408876/j.cattod.2009.07.05420161006-16001-y81kwq.pdf,0,0,0

In an HCCI engine. the premixed fuel/air mixture ignites when sufficiently high temperature and pressure is reached. The entire bulk will auto-ignite at almost the same time because the physical conditions are similar throughout the combustion chamber. Therefore it is a justified assumption to consider the chemical reactions to be the rate-determining step for the ignition process. This gives us the opportunity to formulate a simple zero-dimensional model with detailed chemical kinetics for the calculations of the ignition process.

In contrast to other systems for automatic generation. the REACTION system uses pathways to organize the application of reaction classes. A pathway is a sequence of reaction classes where only those species produced by the previous step of the pathway are used in the current step of the pathway. This “controlled” generation process not only mimics what is done by hand. but also helps to limit the size of the generated mechanisms. Both systematic reaction by reaction comparisons and numerical simulation (zero-dimensional constant volume) comparisons were done and the mechanisms were found to have minor differences.

In this thesis we explore these phenomena in the context of battery degradation. monitoring/diagnostics. and their application to novel energy systems. We begin by establishing the importance of bulk stress in lithium-ion batteries through the presentation of a two-year exploratory aging study which shows that bulk mechanical stress can significantly accelerate capacity fade. We then investigate the origins of this coupling between stress and performance by investigating the effects of stress in idealized systems. Mechanical stress is found to increase internal battery resistance through separator deformation. which we model by considering how deformation affects certain transport properties. When this deformation occurs in a spatially heterogeneous manner. local hot spots form. which accelerate aging and in some cases lead to local lithium plating. Because of the importance of separator deformation with respect to mechanically-coupled aging. we characterize the mechanical properties of battery separators in detail. We also demonstrate that the stress state of a lithium-ion battery cell can be used to measure the cell’s state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC)–important operating parameters that are traditionally difficult to measure outside of a laboratory setting.

Here we present results from long term cycling studies of lithium-ion cells in which stack stress is monitored during cycling. These results show that stack stress in lithium-ion cells is a dynamic quantity that fluctuates during charge/discharge due to charging strains and irreversibly increases with cycling due to permanent electrode expansion. Furthermore. we show that higher levels of compressive mechanical stress lead to accelerated rates of capacity fade through lithium consumption by side reactions. We explain the observed coupling between compressive stress and chemical degradation through local transport inhomogeneity that arises from localized …,True,tumJKlwAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2014-02/49/2256/meta,,,,,,0,0,0
1269199,Mechanical Method of Lithium-Ion Soh and SOC Measurement,2014,John Cannarella and Craig B Arnold,,ECS Meeting Abstracts,3,316,IOP Publishing,Despite the fundamental importance of state of health and state of charge determination in battery management systems. measurement of SOH and SOC is difficult and remains an area of active research. In this presentation we propose a novel approach to lithium-ion battery cell management which makes use of observed relationships between cell expansion and SOH/SOC to determine the SOH and SOC of a cell during operation using simple stack stress measurements.We first present results from an aging study of constrained commercial lithium-ion pouch cells in which we observed an irreversible increase in stack stress during cycling [1]. The increase in stack stress is due to irreversible expansion of the solid battery electrodes against the rigid constraint of the cell housing. This increase in stack stress is not a result of gas evolution. as the same stress increase is observed in pouch cells with a slit …,True,tumJKlwAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2014-01/3/316/meta,,,,,,0,0,0

The studies of the latter are usually limited to the consideration of the processes in electrodes. particularly on the swelling of the electrodes due to lithium intercalation. However. it has been shown recently that the compression of the separator during the battery operation has significant impact on its performance [1. 2].In order to understand the mechanical behavior of the separator during the battery operation. it is necessary to study its response to both static and dynamic loading when it is immersed in fluid. Recently Sheidaei et al. [3] and then Avdeev et al. [4] performed the tensile tests of commercial separators showing the difference in the mechanical properties for dry and wet conditions.

1269201,Coupling Between Stack Stress and Chemical Degradation in Lithium-Ion Pouch Cells,2014,John Cannarella and Craig B Arnold,,ECS Meeting Abstracts,3,334,IOP Publishing,Knowledge of how stack-level mechanical stress affects cell aging is important for the long term performance of practical li-ion cells which spend their entire service lives under compressive stress. This compressive stress is set by an initial manufacturing stack pressure. fluctuates with electrode expansion/contraction during charge/discharge. and increases over time due to irreversible electrode expansion. In a previous aging study in which we monitored the stack stress of constrained li-ion cells during cycling. we observed that higher levels of stack stress led to higher rates of capacity fade [1]. Through a post mortem analysis. we determined that the primary source of capacity fade was cycleable lithium loss. such that higher levels of stack stress led to an increase in parasitic side reactions. This degradation occurred in a spatially non-uniform manner such that localized regions of the cell’s graphite anode were …,True,tumJKlwAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2014-01/3/334/meta,,,,,,0,0,0

These surface charges draw counter-ions toward the surface and repel co-ions. In the presence of a concentration gradient. counter-ions are transported through nanochannels much more easily than co-ions. which results in a net charge migration of one type of ions. The Gibbs free energy of mixing. which forces ion diffusion. thus can be converted into electrical energy by using inorganic ion-selective nanochannels. Silica nanochannels with heights of 4. 26. and 80 nm were used in this study.

However. the presence of free fatty acids. impurities and high viscosity of WCO may require several pretreatments before the transesterification. In this study WCO deacidification by esterification is investigated: the results show how both Amberlyst®46 and Purolite®D5081 catalysts maintain their performance in a Carberry reactor (where catalyst is confined to minimize mechanical stress) and a slurry reactor after several recycles. A46 was tested in the free fatty acids esterification of blends of WCO with different ratios of crude rapeseed oil and diesel as a solvent.

Mass transfer rates may be accelerated with ultrasound (US). In this paper. the performance of continuous flow US reactors. a Rosett US cell reactor. and a batch US reactor are compared to a conventional mechanically stirred batch reactor. The Rosett cell reactor combines acoustic cavitation and turbulence and achieved biodiesel yields greater than 90% in 5 min. whereas the same level of performance in the conventional reactor took more than 90 min. The most significant result of this work lies in achieving biodiesel yields greater than 90% after a single passage of the reagents in a continuous flow reactor in the presence of pulsed ultrasound.

1269299,CFD analysis on the thermal hydraulic performance of an SAH duct with multi V-shape roughened ribs,2016,Anil Kumar and Man-Hoe Kim,9,Energies,6,415,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This study presents the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics in a rib-roughened SAH (solar air heater) channel. The artificial roughness of the rectangular channel was in the form of a thin circular wire in discrete multi V-pattern rib geometries. The effect of this geometry on heat transfer. fluid flow. and performance augmentation was investigated using the CFD (computational fluid dynamics). The roughness parameters were a relative discrete distance of 0.69. a relative rib height of 0.043. a relative rib pitch of 10. a relative rib width of 6.0. and a flow-attack-angle of 60. The discrete width ratios and Reynolds numbers ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 and from 2000 to 20.000. respectively. The CFD results using the renormalization k-epsilon model were in good agreement with the empirical relationship. This model was used to investigate the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics in the multi V-pattern rib roughened SAH channel. The thermo-hydraulic performance was found to be the best for the discrete width ratio of 1.0. A discrete multi V-pattern rib combined with dimple staggered ribs also had better overall thermal performance compared to other rib shapes.

However. many countries are actively building and operating coal power plants. Here we use plant-level data to specify alternative trajectories for coal technologies in an integrated assessment model. We then quantify cost-effective retirement pathways for global and country-level coal fleets to limit long-term temperature change. We present our results using a decision-relevant metric: the operational lifetime limit. Even if no new plants are built. the lifetimes of existing units are reduced to approximately 35 years in a well-below 2 C scenario or 20 years in a 1.5 C scenario. The risk of continued coal expansion. including the near-term growth permitted in some Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). is large.

1269324,Exploring ambivalence: Techno-enthusiasm and skepticism in US nanotech deliberations,2011,Barbara Herr Harthorn and Christine Shearer and Jennifer Rogers,,,,75,IOS Press,This paper explores the perceptual and cultural bases for upstream nano-techno-ambivalence—the perceived constraints on the promised benefits of technology. and the narratives through which progress and its impediments are enacted. Analysis is based on a series of deliberative workshops held in the US in 2009 that explored the gendered and other social locational aspects of deliberative engagement. In particular. this paper addresses how social location is linked to ambivalence about technological futures. expressed through situated discourse about power and vulnerability. trust and distrust. strength and weakness. and attitudes toward environment and health. Surprisingly. many participants expressed views that suggest technological innovation is both something that can benefit them. and something that is being developed beyond their control. For example. participants in the US workshops combined unrestrained techno-enthusiasm about new nanotechnologies with sentiments of disgust with corporations and industry. hope for future distributional justice with pessimism about current inequities. longing for consumer access to new technologies along with self-censuring for the overindulgence represented by their use. and a number of other key contradictory views. Such views show public deliberation of nanotechnologies for energy/environment and health/human enhancement in the US simultaneously evoke protechnology sentiments and deep reservations about the benefits.

To date. no analysis has looked at the coal‐to‐gas shift from the perspective of commitment accounting—the cumulative future CO2 emissions expected from power infrastructure.

These are not suitable for the emerging mobile and wearable sensor platforms due to operating voltages and powers far exceeding the supply capability of batteries. Here we present a novel approach to decouple the chemically sensitive region from the conducting channel for reducing the drive voltage and increasing reliability. This chemically gated field effect transistor uses silicon nanowire for the current conduction channel with a tin oxide film on top of the nanowire serving as the gas sensitive medium. The potential change induced by the molecular adsorption and desorption allows the electrically floating tin oxide film to gate the silicon channel.

However. these substituents impact structural order and charge transport properties in thin-film devices. As a result. a trade-off must be found between material solubility and insulating alkyl content. It was recently shown that the substitution of furan for thiophene in the backbone of the polymer PDPP2FT significantly improves polymer solubility. allowing for the use of shorter branched side chains while maintaining high device efficiency. In this report. we use PDPP2FT to demonstrate that linear alkyl side chains can be used to promote thin-film nanostructural order. In particular. linear side chains are shown to shorten π–π stacking distances between backbones and increase the correlation lengths of both π–π stacking and …,True,87zwHiQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,483,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja2089662,14379043470876316966,/scholar?cites=14379043470876316966,,,,0,0,0

Methodology/Principal Findings We used Mass spectrometry-based proteomics (MSP) to identify and quantify thousands of proteins from healthy and collapsing bee colonies. MSP revealed two unreported RNA viruses in North American honey bees. Varroa destructor-1 virus and Kakugo virus. and identified an invertebrate iridescent virus (IIV) (Iridoviridae) associated with CCD colonies. Prevalence of IIV significantly discriminated among strong. failing. and collapsed colonies. In addition. bees in failing colonies contained not only IIV. but also Nosema.

(2) bees sequentially sampled as the disorder progressed in an observation hive colony in 2008. and (3) bees from a recurrence of CCD in Florida in 2009. The pathogen pairing was not observed in samples from colonies with no history of CCD. namely bees from Australia and a large. non-migratory beekeeping business in Montana. Laboratory cage trials with a strain of IIV type 6 and Nosema ceranae confirmed that co-infection with these two pathogens was more lethal to bees than either pathogen alone.

1269480,Determining the mass of cosmological neutrinos using Lyman-alpha forests,2017,Julien Baur,,,,,,In the work presented in this thesis. I use the power spectrum of the transmitted flux in the Lyman-alpha (Ly-$alpha$) forest of distant quasars to constrain the mass of cosmological neutrinos in the context of four seperate projects. Neutrinos leave a signature imprint on large scale structures in the Universe through their free-streaming. which manifests as a deficit of matter density fluctuations on typical length scales that are inversely proportional to their rest mass. This typical free-streeming scale. of order a few Mpc. can be probed by Ly-$alpha$ forests which are imprints of the neutral atomic Hydrogen density along the background quasar's line-of-sight. I use the Ly-$alpha$ flux power spectrum from mainly two large scale structure surveys: the $13.821$ low-resolution quasar spectra from the ninth data release of SDSS (BOSS) in 12 redshift bins from $langle z rangle = 2.2$ to $4.4$; and the $100$ high-resolution quasar spectra from the XQ-100 survey (of the VLT's XShooter spectrograph) in 3 redshift bins. $langle z rangle = 3.20. 3.56$ and $3.93$. This enables us to probe scales from $k geqslant 0.001~s/mathrm{km}$ to $k leqslant 0.02$ and $k leqslant 0.07~ s/mathrm{km}$ respectively.Modeling the flux power spectrum requires solving the non-linear regime of structure formation and the intergalactic gas in the cosmological hydrodynamics simulations that are used to that effect. I controlled for several of many systematic uncertainties related to the simulations. First. I ran simulations with different initial conditions to quantify the sampling variance.

1269482,Is a symmetric matter-antimatter universe excluded?,2015,Julien Baur and Alain Blanchard and Peter Von Ballmoos,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.08482,,,,We consider a non-standard cosmological model in which the universe contains as much matter as antimatter on large scales and presents a local baryon asymmetry. A key ingredient in our approach is that the baryon density distribution follows Gaussian fluctuations around a null value . Spatial domains featuring a positive (resp. negative) baryonic density value constitute regions dominated by matter (resp. antimatter). At the domains' annihilation interface. the typical density is going smoothly to zero. rather than following an abrupt step as assumed in previous symetric matter-antimatter models. As a consequence. the Cosmic Diffuse Gamma Background produced by annihilation is drastically reduced. allowing to easily pass COMPTEL's measurements limits. Similarly the Compton  distorsion and CMB'ribbons' are lowered by an appreciable factor. Therefore this model essentially escape previous constrainst on symetric matter-antimatter models. However. we produce an estimation of the CMB temperature fluctuations that would result from this model and confront it to data acquired from the Planck satellite. We construct a angular power spectrum in  assuming is can be approximated as an average of  over a Gaussian distribution of  using Lewis & Challinor's CAMB software. The resulting  are qualitatively satisfying. We quantify the goodness of fit using a simple  test.

Les neutrinos laissent une emprunte sur les grandes structures dans l'Univers à travers l'échelle à laquelle ils diffusent. qui se manifeste comme un déficit de fluctuations de densité de matière sur des distances inversement proportionnelles à leur masse. De l'ordre de quelques Mpc. ces échelles peuvent être sondées par les forêts Ly-$ alpha $ qui tracent la densité d'hydrogène neutre atomique suivant la ligne de visée du quasar en arrière-plan. J'utilise le spectre de puissance Ly-$ alpha $ construit grâce à deux relevés de grandes structures: les $13.821 $ spectres optiques de quasars basse-résolution de la 9ème publication des données du SDSS/BOSS à 12 redshifts de $ langle z rangle= 2.2$ à $4.4 $; ainsi que la centaine de spectres de quasar haute-résolution du relevé XQ-100 du VLT à $ langle z rangle= 3.20. 3.56$ et $3.93 $. Ces deux relevés nous permettent de sonder les échelles de $ k geqslant 0.001~ s/mathrm {km} $ à $ k leqslant 0.02$ et $ k leqslant 0.07~ s/mathrm {km} $ respectivement.

However. a solar based combined power and cooling cycle is still a subject for further study. Evaluating the efficiency of this cycle is made difficult by the fact that there are two different simultaneous outputs. namely power and refrigeration.

The external irreversibility is due to the thermal resistance between the system and the heat reservoirs while the internal irreversibility is due to the non-isentropic compression and expansion process within the system. The internal irreversibility of the irreversible cogeneration cycle is characterised by a single parameter representing the ratio of relevant entropy differences. The presence of this irreversibility parameter shows that a cogeneration power plant with internal irreversibilities delivers less exergy output and has a lower efficiency than those of the reversible and endoreversible cycles.

This study provides estimates of emissions of this important and often not well characterized greenhouse gas (GHG) emission related to transportation energy use. It aims to assist urban community planners and policymakers to prioritize and choose implementation strategies for low carbon cities. The paper focuses on emissions of CH 4 from vehicles. Unlike emissions of CO 2. which are relatively easy to estimate. emissions of CH 4 are a function of many complex aspects of combustion dynamics and depend on the type of emission control systems used. In this context. they cannot be derived easily and instead must be determined through the use of published emission factors for each combination of fuel. end-use technology. combustion conditions. and emission control systems. Emissions of CH 4 play a significant role with regards to the relative CO 2–equivalent GHG emissions of the use of alternative transportation fuels. in comparison with the use of conventional fuels. By analyzing a database based on literature review this study analyzes all the factors affecting the creation of CH 4 emissions from different vehicle types.

Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) is essential to sustainable consumption and production which will impact the use of limited resources. LCT is the process of taking into account in decision making both the resources consumed and the environmental and health pressures associated with the full life cycle of a product. It includes the extraction of resources. production. use. re-use. transport. recycling. and the ultimate waste disposal to provide goods and services and it helps in avoiding shifting the burdens among various life stages of a resource processing. It is important to use the life cycle thinking in analysing products because they may have different environmental impacts at different life cycle stages. It is important to note that some products have very high environmental impacts during the extraction and processing of their original natural resource but they may have minor environmental impacts when they are recycled. A good example is aluminium.

A GIS/wind resource assessment approach,2015,George Xydis and Evanthia Nanaki,6,Challenges,2,258-270,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The transportation sector is severely correlated with major problems in environment. citizens’ health. climate and economy. Issues such as traffic. fuel cost and parking space have make life more difficult. especially in the dense urban environment. Thus. there is a great need for the development of the electric vehicle (EV) sector. The number of cars in cities has increased so much that the current transportation system (roads. parking places. traffic lights. etc.) cannot accommodate them properly. The increasing number of vehicles does not affect only humans but also the environment. through air and noise pollution. According to EPA. the 39.2% of total gas emissions in 2007 was caused by transportation activities. Studies have shown that the pollutants are not only gathered in the major roads and/or highways but can travel depending on the meteorological conditions leading to generic pollution. The promotion of EVs and the charging stations are both equally required to be further developed in order EVs to move out of the cities and finally confront the range problem. In this work. a wind resource and a GIS analysis optimizes in a wider area the sitting of wind based charging stations and proposes an optimizing methodology.

The classical modeling approach is to fit the probability distribution to a known model and estimate statistical parameters like mean and variance. Such models lack the time variation properties and ignore cross-dependencies between other meteorological data.

This problem is considered to be a nonlinear programming-(NP-) hard problem because it is nonlinear. mixed-integer. and nonconvex. These three methods used for solving the problem are based on dual optimization techniques. ALPF method which combines the algorithmic aspects of both LR and PF methods is firstly used for solving the UC problem. These methods are compared to each other based on feasible schedule for each stage. feasible cost. dual cost. duality gap. duration time. and number of iterations.

This paper reports a facile. scalable and efficient method to produce self-assembled reduced graphene oxide with high packing density (1.55 g cm−3) via phosphoric acid treatment (PAT) at moderate temperatures (200–400 °C). The PAT process could not only controllably preserve redox-active C–OH and CO groups which can provide large and stable pseudocapacitance. but also contribute to the formation of a well self-assembled compact structure. Due to the pseudocapacitive behavior of the electrochemically active oxygen functional groups as well as the compact layered structure. the reduced graphene oxide (RGO-MP40) exhibits an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance (482 F cm−3 and 384 F cm−3 at a mass loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 and 19.7 mg …,True,0eYZul4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,3,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ta/d0ta06042a,3283244535215013291,/scholar?cites=3283244535215013291,,,,0,0,0

The chapter in particular focuses on the rectangular duct geometry. with emphasis on the friction factor and heat transfer behavior of non-Newtonian fluids. It is recognized that non-Newtonian behavior is generally more complicated than Newtonian flow. In the case of non-Newtonian fluids. the theoretical predictions yield low estimates of the heat transfer under laminar flow conditions. The fact that the available experimental heat transfer measurements lie above the predictions could reflect an inadequacy in the analytical model. For non-Newtonians in turbulent flow through rectangular channels. the situation is even more complicated.

The differences cannot be explained on the basis of a superimposed free convection effect. Rather. the increase is due primarily to secondary flows which are induced in the viscoelastic fluid as a result of the normal force differences acting at the boundaries which are unique to elastic fluids. The pressure drop behavior is unaffected by the presence of secondary flows and predictions based on a purely viscous power law model give good agreement with the measured values.,True,iunCFmkAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,102,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001793108590122X,10617852059487640687,/scholar?cites=10617852059487640687,,,,0,0,0

It is believed that elastic fluid properties are strongly related to these phenomena. However. not all drag-reducing fluids are viscoelastic. nor are all viscoelastic fluids drag-reducing. suggesting that drag reduction and viscoelasticity are probably incidentally accompanying phenomena. Furthermore. the limited research to date has revealed considerable heat transfer enhancement (virtually without friction drag increase) in laminar non-circular duct flows with certain polymer solutions. and has shown that all utilized fluids were indeed viscoelastic1.It is argued here that turbulence suppression (i.e. flow laminarization). due to flow-induced anisotropic fluid structure and properties. is a determining factor for the reduction phenomena—not the fluid elasticity—while …,True,iunCFmkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,74,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0017931094900175,3118867247068988716,/scholar?cites=3118867247068988716,,,,0,0,0

Extrusion is of vital importance to all plastics processing. In addition to providing raw stock such as sheet for thermoforming and pellets for injection molding and other extrusion processing. numerous end-use products are made with extrusion such as film. tubing. and a variety of profiles. Although the types of extruded products made can differ dramatically in shape. there are a set of common rules that govern basic die design. For example. it is important to streamline the flow from the inlet to the exit. and as a practical measure. to fine-tune the flow balance and product dimensions. flow adjustment devices could be included in the die design. Several unique products are made by extrusion and the dies needed to make these products are classified as: 1) sheet dies; 2) flat-film and blown-film dies; 3) pipe and tubing dies; 4) profile extrusion dies; and 5) co-extrusion dies. Furthermore. each product type has unique hardware downstream of the die to shape and cool the extruded melt. To aid the reader. detailed illustrations of the various die designs and the complementary downstream cooling and shaping hardware are shown. Predicting the required die profile to achieve the desired product dimensions is a very complex task and requires detailed knowledge of material characteristics and flow and heat transfer phenomena. and extensive experience with extrusion processing. Extrusion die design is still more an art than a science. even though the latter is becoming more and more relevant for design optimization …,True,iunCFmkAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,57,http://www.peraglobal.com/upload/contents/2015/11/20151113163050_27004.pdf,10769553227538092910,/scholar?cites=10769553227538092910,,,http://www.peraglobal.com/upload/contents/2015/11/20151113163050_27004.pdf,0,0,0

A platinum (Pt) wire of 50.8 µm diameter with a Teflon insulation coating of 25.4 µm thickness was used as the hot-wire heater and temperature sensor for the present application. The new apparatus employs innovative solutions for easy calibration of uniform Pt-wire tension and thus minimizing the strain influence on temperature measurement (ie. minimizing the well-known and unwanted “strain-gage effect” on Pt-wire electrical resistivity); measurement of Pt-wire voltage drop independently from power wiring (four wires); and an effective off-centered mechanical design to minimize the test fluid sample size (about 35 mL). but at the same time providing additional space for wiring. including three inside thermocouples for fluid temperature uniformity verification. Data acquisition hardware and LabVIEW application software are optimized to minimize signal noise and enhance acquisition and processing of useful data. The bias measurement error. based on calibration with distilled water and ethylene glycol. has been found to be within 1.5%. and precision. ie. repeatability error within 2.5%.

1269700,Viscosity measurement,1999,GE Leblanc and RA Secco and M Kostic,,,,,CRC Press,An important mechanical property of fluids is viscosity. Physical systems and applications as diverse as fluid flow in pipes. the flow of blood. lubrication of engine parts. the dynamics of raindrops. volcanic eruptions. planetary and stellar magnetic field generation. to name just a few. all involve fluid flow and are controlled to some degree by fluid viscosity. Viscosity is defined as the internal friction of a fluid. The microscopic nature of internal friction in a fluid is analogous to the macroscopic concept of mechanical friction in the system of an object moving on a stationary planar surface. Energy must be supplied (1) to overcome the inertial state of the interlocked object and plane caused by surface roughness. and (2) to initiate and sustain motion of the object over the plane. In a fluid. energy must be supplied (1) to create viscous flow units by breaking bonds between atoms and molecules. and (2) to cause the flow units to move relative to one another. The resistance of a fluid to the creation and motion of flow units is due to the viscosity of the fluid. which only manifests itself when motion in the fluid is set up. Since viscosity involves the transport of mass with a certain velocity. the viscous response is called a momentum transport process. The velocity of flow units within the fluid will vary. depending on location. Consider a liquid between two closely spaced parallel plates as shown in Figure 30.1. A force. F. applied to the top plate causes the fluid adjacent to the upper plate to be dragged in the direction of F. The applied force is communicated to neighboring layers of fluid below. each coupled to the driving layer above. but with diminishing magnitude.

1269706,The elusive nature of entropy and its physical meaning,2014,Milivoje M Kostic,16,Entropy,2,953-967,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Entropy is the most used and often abused concept in science. but also in philosophy and society. Further confusions are produced by some attempts to generalize entropy with similar but not the same concepts in other disciplines. The physical meaning of phenomenological. thermodynamic entropy is reasoned and elaborated by generalizing Clausius definition with inclusion of generated heat. since it is irrelevant if entropy is changed due to reversible heat transfer or irreversible heat generation. Irreversible. caloric heat transfer is introduced as complementing reversible heat transfer. It is also reasoned and thus proven why entropy cannot be destroyed but is always generated (and thus over-all increased) locally and globally. at every space and time scales. without any exception. It is concluded that entropy is a thermal displacement (dynamic thermal-volume) of thermal energy due to absolute temperature as a thermal potential (dQ= TdS). and thus associated with thermal heat and absolute temperature. ie. distribution of thermal energy within thermal micro-particles in space. Entropy is an integral measure of (random) thermal energy redistribution (due to heat transfer and/or irreversible heat generation) within a material system structure in space. per absolute temperature level: dS= dQ Sys/T= mC Sys dT/T. thus logarithmic integral function. with J/K unit. It may be also expressed as a measure of “thermal disorder”. being related to logarithm of number of all thermal. dynamic microstates W (their position and momenta).

However. despite their success in practice there are only a few works considering their theoretical properties. We show that feasibility pumps can be seen as alternating direction methods applied to special reformulations of the original problem. inheriting the convergence theory of these methods. Moreover. we propose a novel penalty framework that encompasses this alternating direction method. which allows us to refrain from random perturbations that are applied in standard versions of feasibility pumps in case of failure. We present a convergence theory for the new penalty based alternating direction method and compare the new variant of the feasibility pump with existing versions in an extensive numerical study for mixed-integer linear and nonlinear problems.,True,IiZJIdEAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,27,https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1069687,12081284942734473313,/scholar?cites=12081284942734473313,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09891,0,0,0

The two classical discrete optimization problems of network design and graph partitioning together with nonlinearities due to economic modeling yield extremely challenging mixed-integer nonlinear multilevel models for which we develop two problem-tailored solution techniques.

It is an up to now unanswered question to what extent existing network capacity remains unused in an entry-exit design and to what extent feasible adjustments of the market design could alleviate inefficiencies. In this paper. we offer a four-level modeling framework that is capable of analyzing these issues and provide some first results on the model structure. In order to decouple gas trading from network congestion management. the TSO is required to determine technical capacities and corresponding booking fees at every entry and exit node up front.

Inc.,Potential‐based flows are an extension of classical network flows in which the flow on an arc is determined by the difference of the potentials of its incident nodes. Such flows are unique and arise. for example. in energy networks. Two important algorithmic problems are to determine whether there exists a feasible flow and to maximize the flow between two designated nodes. We show that these problems can be solved for the single source and sink case by reducing the network to a single arc. However. if we additionally consider switches that allow to force the flow to 0 and decouple the potentials. these problems are NP‐hard. Nevertheless. for particular series‐parallel networks. one can use algorithms for the subset sum problem. Moreover. applying network presolving based on generalized series‐parallel structures allows to significantly reduce the size of realistic energy networks.,True,IiZJIdEAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,23,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/net.21865,1929029157448021072,/scholar?cites=1929029157448021072,,,https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-trr154/files/153/gas-trans-hardness_preprint.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Complex real-world optimization tasks often lead to mixed-integer nonlinear problems (MINLPs). However. current MINLP algorithms are not always able to solve the resulting large-scale problems. One remedy is to develop problem specific primal heuristics that quickly deliver feasible solutions. This paper presents such a primal heuristic for a certain class of MINLP models. Our approach features a clear distinction between nonsmooth but continuous and genuinely discrete aspects of the model. The former are handled by suitable smoothing techniques; for the latter we employ reformulations using complementarity constraints.

The latter step requires to determine some big-M constant in order to bound the lower level’s dual feasible set such that no bilevel-optimal solution is cut off. In practice. heuristics are often used to find a big-M although it is known that these approaches may fail. In this paper. we consider the hardness of two proxies for the above mentioned concept of a bilevel-correct big-M. First. we prove that verifying that a given big-M does not cut off any feasible vertex of the lower level’s dual polyhedron cannot be done in polynomial time unless P = NP.

This means that the arc sizes need to be feasible for an infinite set of scenarios. The problem can be seen as a strictly robust counterpart of a single-scenario network design problem. which is shown to be NP-complete even on trees. In order to obtain a tractable problem. we introduce a method for generating a finite scenario set such that optimality of a sizing for this finite set implies the sizing’s optimality for the originally given infinite set of scenarios. We further prove that the size of the finite scenario set is quadratically bounded above in the number of nodes of the underlying tree and that it can be computed in polynomial time.

MSPC is implemented using a variety of techniques including neural networks (NNs). In situations when the number of process attributes is sufficiently large (e.g. 10 or more) concerns can arise with respect to training of NNs for pattern recognition. A classification method known as novelty detection (ND) can provide an effective alternative to conventional NN solutions that suffer from the above problem. Despite its great potential. ND is still unknown to the broad community of manufacturing engineers.

LTO coated graphite is prepared by a sol–gel method coupled with hydrothermal reaction. LTO coating renders the electrochemical performance of graphite to be significantly improved compared to pristine graphite. Moreover. LTO coating layers affect the stability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) by making an even SEI film without further electrolyte decomposition and thus making it more stable. Also. LTO coating layers prevent the electrolyte decomposition species from going into the interior graphite. proving that LTO coating can contribute to not only the electrochemical properties of graphite but also its thermal stability.,True,PP0NpV0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22438887,,,,,,0,0,0

The computational analysis on a fine. unstructured mesh containing more than 3.5 million tetrahedral elements led to high‐resolution numerical data for velocity and pressure. Computed pressure drops agreed excellently with those in the literature. The flow in this static mixer is essentially independent of the flow rate up to Re = 1. thereby causing the flow characteristics to deviate substantially from those observed when Re < 1.

We show that the force to extend N − 1 interfaces can lead to strain hardening. We studied three PE/PP pairs: a Ziegler–Natta catalyzed pair and two metallocene pairs. one with high density PE and one with linear low density PE. Interfacial tension was measured on matrix/droplet blends of each pair using small amplitude oscillatory shear measurements fitted with the Palierne model. Multilayer coextrusion was used to fabricate bilayers and sheets with hundreds of layers for each polyolefin pair. Under shear deformation. disentangling of chains in the N − 1 interfaces led to a decrease in the overall shear viscosity. which is interpreted as an interfacial slip velocity and is in agreement with previous studies on multilayer films.

A facile method is employed to produce conductive films with UV-blocking properties. The direct addition of tannic acids (TAs) powders into PEDOT:PSS aqueous suspension lead to the enhancement of electrical conductivity of TA:PEDOT:PSS (TAPE) films. This improvement owes to the conformation change of the PEDOT chains from benzoid to quinoid configuration. Further investigations revealed the absence of phase separation in the highest conductive TAPE film. TAPE films are smoother and thicker than the pristine PEDOT:PSS film owing to the high density and good solubility of TAs. The absorbance increases with the increase of the TA content in TAPE films.

1269839,A multiscale domain decomposition approach for chemical vapor deposition,2013,J Bogers and K Kumar and PHL Notten and JFM Oudenhoven and Iuliu Sorin Pop,246,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,,65-73,North-Holland,We consider the process of chemical vapor deposition on a trenched Si substrate. To understand the process (including e.g. the layer conformality) at the trench scale (microscale). we need solutions at both the trench and reactor scales (macroscale). Due to the huge difference in size of these scales. straightforward numerical computations are very challenging. To overcome this difficulty. we consider a multiscale approach by introducing an intermediate scale (the mesoscale). We start with a time-continuous model describing the transport processes and then perform time discretization.

Research and Industry Association (IARIA),This paper describes the development and implementation of the SAFESENS (Sensor Technologies for Enhanced Safety and Security of Buildings and its Occupants) location tracking and first responder monitoring demonstrator. An international research collaboration has developed a stateof-the-art wireless indoor location tracking system for first responders. focused initially on fire fighter monitoring. Integrating multiple gas sensors and presence detection technologies with building safety sensors and personal monitors has resulted in more accurate and reliable fire and occupancy detection information. This is invaluable to firefighters in carrying out their duties in hostile environments. This demonstration system is capable of tracking occupancy levels in an indoor environment as well as the specific location of fire fighters within those buildings. using a multi-sensor hybrid tracking system. This ultra-wideband indoor tracking system is one of the first of itsâ   kind to provide indoor localization capability to sub meter accuracies with combined Bluetooth low energy capability for low power communications and additional inertial. temperature and pressure sensors. This facilitates increased precision in accuracy detection through data fusion. as well as the capability to communicate directly with smartphones and the cloud. without the need for additional gateway support.

1269841,Deposition and characterization of thin films for 3D lithium-ion micro-batteries,2011,JFM Oudenhoven,,,,,,Electricity has since its first discovery evolved to become one of the most commonly used energy carriers. It is clean and versatile and enables a large part of the technology that is currently playing an important role in everyday life. Storage of this electrical energy has been of interest since its discovery. One of the main storage methods of electrical energy is the use of galvanic cells. which are to the general public better known as batteries or accumulators. These cells have made feasible that electrical energy is not only available in stationary applications. but also for mobile applications. The miniaturization of these mobile wireless applications has created a demand for miniaturized batteries. Especially now a trend is observed towards distributed sensor networks. which consist of individual miniature sensor devices that communicate wirelessly with a base station. The energy for these sensors can be supplied by an energy harvester. e.g. based on photovoltaic. thermoelectric or piezoelectric generators. This energy needs. however. to be stored to ensure a continuous energy supply to the sensors. For this purpose. all-solid-state micro-batteries are a suitable form of energy storage. The disadvantage of these micro-batteries is. however. that their energy density is relatively low. To increase the energy density. the concept of 3D integrated all-solid-state thin-film micro-batteries was proposed. This concept is described in Chapter 1. Several concepts and fabrication methods for 3D all-solid-state batteries have been proposed in recent literature. which are reviewed in Chapter 2.

As in previous studies we find no cyclicality in the simple supply lag design with five players. Step by step we add investment lags and capacity vintages. and thus external validity to the basic design. As complexity increases. prices become autocorrelated with cyclical tendencies. Regressions and simulations suggest that players put too little weight on capacity vintages when making investment decisions. Different from the original cobweb design. adaptive price expectations do not suffice to eliminate fluctuations.

In this paper we address the question of what has been the impact of the capacity mechanisms adopted during the 2000s on technology choices for power generation in Colombia. Our approach is to analyze the evolution of market structure and regulation. We found that regulatory uncertainty and low prices drove a surge of small hydro plants during the 2000s. During the 2010s. the new regulatory focus on reliability of supply has resulted in increased coal-fueled generation and large hydro.

A number of policies and market mechanisms aiming for capacity adequacy and market stability exist; in this paper we focus on one of these. mothballing of generation capacity. In electricity markets. mothballing is the possibility for a power generation company to temporarily withdraw generation capacity for a time. often for a year or more. Our hypothesis is that mothballing will help to stabilize markets. but at the same time increase prices.

Such fluctuations have significant adverse effects onconsumers and producers. The properties of commodity price fluctuations are well known. However.there is considerable disagreement about the underlying causes of market fluctuations. Understandingsuch cycles is essential for policy analysis. We analyze the case of recently deregulated electricitymarkets. where several authors have expressed a concern that capacity cycles may emerge. Thepotential occurrence of cycles represents a major threat to electricity security. since there could beperiods with insufficient capacity to satisfy demand followed by periods with excess capacity andunsustainably low prices.Traditional economic literature argues that oscillations are caused by external shocks. We explore analternative explanation that comes from the internal structure of the system. The method is laboratoryexperiments. To link to the existing literature we start by investigating the simplest economic model ofcycles (the Cobweb model) with standard conditions. linear demand. and constant costs. Step by step.we add complexity (and realism) to the simple model. We introduce long lifetimes of productioncapacity and then we introduce a two period investment lag in addition to long lifetimes. Consistentwith previous experiments and the rational expectations hypothesis. we find no evidence of cycles inthe basic design and in the capacity lifetime treatment.

We solve a detailed national electricity market model and find the auction is roughly one-half the societal cost of the other approaches. This result holds under a variety of assumptions about the future state of economic regulation and competition in the electricity sector. The differences in the cost of the approaches flow from the effect of each approach on electricity price. Grandfathering is the best for producers but it imposes a substantial cost on consumers. The generation performance standard yields the lowest electricity price but highest natural gas price. The auction does better than the generation performance standard at protecting households and at preserving asset values for producers.

CA (United States),The blackouts of summer 2003 underscored the dependence of western economies on reliable supply of electricity with tight tolerances of quality. While demand for electricity continues to grow. expansion of the traditional electricity supply system is constrained and is unlikely to keep pace with the growing thirst western economies have for electricity. Furthermore. no compelling case has been made that perpetual improvement in the overall power quality and reliability (PQR) delivered is possible or desirable. An alternative path to providing for sensitive loads is to provide for generation close to them. This would alleviate the pressure for endless improvement in grid PQR and might allow the establishment of a sounder economically based level of universal grid service. Providing for loads by means of local power generation is becoming increasingly competitive with central station generation for a number of reasons. four key ones being non-technical constraints on expansion of the grid. improvements in small scale technologies. opportunities for CHP application. and the ubiquitous nature of sensitive loads in advanced economies.

Among the various initiatives undertaken to remedy this deficiency. public utility commissions (PUC) and utilities have considered implementing dynamic pricing tariffs. such as real-time pricing (RTP). and other retail pricing mechanisms that communicate an incentive for electricity consumers to reduce their usage during periods of high generation supply costs or system reliability contingencies. Efforts to introduce DR into retail electricity markets confront a range of basic policy issues. First. a fundamental issue in any market context is how to organize the process for developing and implementing DR mechanisms in a manner that facilitates productive participation by affected stakeholder groups. Second. in regions with retail choice. policymakers and stakeholders face the threshold question of whether it is appropriate for utilities to offer a range of dynamic pricing tariffs and DR programs. or just''plain vanilla''default service. Although positions on this issue may be based primarily on principle. two empirical questions may have some bearing--namely. what level of price response can be expected through the competitive retail market. and whether establishing RTP as the default service is likely to more»,True,IS2tjsgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,36,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/891019,670928562439989281,/scholar?cites=670928562439989281,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/891019,0,0,0

Berkeley. CA (United States),There is growing interest in policies. programs and tariffs that encourage customer loads to provide demand response (DR) to help discipline wholesale electricity markets. Proposals at the retail level range from eliminating fixed rate tariffs as the default service for some or all customer groups to reinstituting utility-sponsored load management programs with market-based inducements to curtail. Alternative rate designs include time-of-use (TOU). day-ahead real-time pricing (RTP). critical peak pricing. and even pricing usage at real-time market balancing prices. Some Independent System Operators (ISOs) have implemented their own DR programs whereby load curtailment capabilities are treated as a system resource and are paid an equivalent value. The resulting load reductions from these tariffs and programs provide a variety of benefits. including limiting the ability of suppliers to increase spot and long-term market-clearing prices above competitive levels (Neenan et al.. 2002; Boren stein. 2002; Ruff. 2002). Unfortunately. there is little information in the public domain to characterize and quantify how customers actually respond to these alternative dynamic pricing schemes. A few empirical studies of large customer RTP response have shown modest results for most customers. with a few very price-responsive customers providing most of the aggregate response (Herriges et al.. 1993; Schwarz more»,True,IS2tjsgAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,35,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/828668,11602713135506450505,/scholar?cites=11602713135506450505,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/828668,0,0,0

We find that without the NOx cap. nationwide restructuring leads to higher NOx and carbon emissions from the electricity sector. Adding either a seasonal or an annual NOx cap-and-trade regime in the eastern United States mitigates the increase in NOx emissions but has a much smaller effect on carbon emissions. The out-of-pocket compliance cost associated with achieving a seasonal or an annual NOx cap is moderately higher with nationwide restructuring than without. but the changes in economic surplus are significantly higher. However. the economic benefits of nationwide restructuring more than offset the higher costs of controlling NOx emissions in a more competitive environment. The foregone economic surplus is compared with the benefits resulting from NOx emission reductions using an integrated assessment model of atmospheric transport and valuation of human health effects.

This study examines the experience of 130 large (over 2 MW) industrial. commercial and institutional customers at Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation that have faced day-ahead electricity market prices as their default tariff since 1998. It is the first study of large customer response to RTP in the context of retail competition. Through a survey and interviews. we examine how customers adapted to RTP (their satisfaction. hedging choices. adoption of DR-enabling technologies and response capability). and we combined survey information with customer billing data to quantify price response. We find that customers are relatively satisfied. In 2003. 50-55% were exposed to RTP; many say they’d prefer to hedge but attractively priced options are rare. Only 45% of survey respondents have installed DR-enabling technologies since 1998. 54% indicated they were not price responsive at all; of the rest. most employ “low-tech” curtailment strategies and do not reschedule usage.

In a growing number of states. regulators have adopted real-time pricing (RTP) as the default service for large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. Although this trend is driven chiefly by policy objectives related to retail competition. default service RTP may have the added benefit of stimulating demand response. To evaluate the potential role of RTP as a means to both ends–retail market development and demand response–we conducted a comprehensive review of experience with default RTP in the US and examined the emergence of RTP as a product offering by competitive retail suppliers. Across the ten utilities with default RTP in place in 2005. between 5% and 35% of the applicable load remained on the rate. Based on interviews with competitive retailers. we find evidence to suggest that a comparable amount of load in these states has switched to hourly pricing arrangements with competitive retailers. Many customers on default or competitive hourly pricing are paying prices indexed to the real-time spot market. and thus have no advance knowledge of prices. Because the price responsiveness of customers under these conditions has yet to be formally analyzed. and relatively few efforts have been undertaken to help these customers become price responsive. the actual demand response impacts from hourly pricing in retail choice states remains largely an open question.

The main observations were that the C/H atom ratio and the equivalence ratio increased going from reactants to products along a radial profile when the reactant flow velocity was sufficiently high to push the flame close to the boundary of the recirculation zone. This phenomenon was attributed to preferential diffusion of H2 and H2O toward the reactants followed by convective transport of the hydrogen-species enriched fluid downstream and beyond the recirculation zone. leaving elevated levels of CO2 and the C/H and C/O atom ratios within the recirculation zone.The present work continues the investigation of this preferential …,True,BmkDQ90AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218014002740,10422293133934274985,/scholar?cites=10422293133934274985,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0010218014002740,0,0,0
1269919,Finite-rate chemistry effects in turbulent premixed combustion,2008,Matthew John Dunn,,,,,University of Sydney.,In recent times significant public attention has been drawn to the topic of combustion. This has been due to the fact that combustion is the underlying mechanism of several key challenges to modern society: climate change. energy security (finite reserves of fossil fuels) and air pollution. The further development of combustion science is undoubtedly necessary to find improved solutions to manage these combustion science related challenges in the near and long term future. Combustion is essentially an exothermic process. this exothermicity or heat release essentially occurs at small scales. by small scales it meant these scales are small relative to the fluid length scales. for example heat release layer thicknesses in flames are typically much less than the fluid integral length scales. As heat release occurs at small scales this means that in turbulent combustion the small scales of the turbulence (which can be of the order of the heat release layer thickness) can possibly interact and influence the heat release and thus chemistry of the flame reaction zone. Premixed combustion is a combustion mode where the fuel and oxidiser are completely premixed prior to the flame reaction zone. this mode of combustion has been shown to be a promising method to maximise combustion efficiency and minimise pollutant formation. The continued and further application of premixed combustion to practical applications is limited by the current understanding of turbulent premixed combustion. these limitations in understanding are linked to the specific flame phenomena that can significantly influence premixed combustion in a combustion device. examples of such …,True,BmkDQ90AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,18,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/5782,6723829698347655153,/scholar?cites=6723829698347655153,,,https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/5782/Dunn_PhD_thesis_2008.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

The shear is introduced by splitting the fuel-air mixture in two stream and feeding each stream at different velocities through two annular concentric tubes residing within the pilot annulus. The shear is varied by varying the proportion of fluid injected through the streams and also by changing the recess distance of the inner tube with respect to the jet exit plane.

Major species concentrations and temperature are measured with high spatial resolution by 1D Raman-Rayleigh scattering. A conditioning on local equivalence ratio (range from ϕ = 0.45 to ϕ = 1.25) and local stratification is applied to the large dataset and allows to analyze the impact of H2 addition on the flame structure. The local stratification level is determined as Δϕ/ΔT at the location of maximum CO mass fraction for each instantaneous flame realization. Due to the H2 addition. preferential diffusion of H2 is different than in pure methane flames. In addition to diffusing out of the reaction zone where it is formed. particularly in rich conditions.

1269931,Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for sepia melanin,2015,Agnes Mbonyiryivuze and Bonex W Mwakikunga and Simon Mokhotjwa Dhlamini and Malik Maaza,,,,,Science and Education Publishing,Melanin is of interest as a model system of understanding disorder in biological systems. The biological functionality of melanin depends on disorder which is considered as its essential part. This property distinguishes melanin from other much more intensively studied biomolecule systems such as nucleic acid. proteins and carbohydrates. Melanins have been reported to have a diverse number of functions in the biosystem. including photosensitization. metal ion chelation. photoprotection to absorb a broad range of electromagnetic radiation. antibiotic. thermoregulation. Melanins are found all over the body from the skin and blood to the nervous system but the role of melanin in all these system is unclear. FTIR spectroscopy technique is usually one of the most preferred techniques used to give a correct assignment of the observed spectral characteristic of functional groups corresponding to different absorption bands which are responsible of the absorption. FTIR is the characterization technique which is both rapid. non-destructive and requires small sized samples. In the material to be analysed. chemical bonds vibrate at a characteristic frequency representative of their structure. bond angle and length. FTIR spectrometer is important for the interpretation of the structure. binding capacity. affinity and sites of metal ions in melanin. These are important factors for better understanding the metals melanin complexity and its consequences. The analysis of sepia melanin by FTIR reveals that there is existence of functional groups that can be responsible for the binding cites of different metallic ions leading to many new applications of sepia melanin.,True,NSuxpPAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,46,http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/handle/10204/8587,14702519628964887721,/scholar?cites=14702519628964887721,,,https://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/handle/10204/8587/Mwakikunga2_2015.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Some of the most efficient sensitizers are synthetic dyes including transition metal coordination compounds such as Ruthenium polypyridyl complexes because of their highly efficient metal-to-ligand charge transfer. suitable ground and excited state energy levels with respect to titanium dioxide conduction band energy. They also have intense and wide range absorption in whole visible range. Even if they present such attractive features. their synthesis process is costly and complicated and they are not environment friendly because they contain heavy rare metals which are undesirable from the point of view of environmental conservation aspects. Natural dye can be the best alternative as they have acceptable efficiency in comparison to that one of transition coordination compounds and their extraction can be done by simple procedures from flowers. leaves. fruits. animals and other natural products.

Melanin pigments. in fact. are composed of many different types of monomeric units that are connected through strong carbon-carbon bonds. Its high insolubility and undefined chemical entities are two obstacles in its complete characterization. The morphological characterization and particle size distribution for sepia melanin by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) on surface structure and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to confirm the morphology obtained from SEM was done. Both results show that Sepia melanin is formed by many aggregates agglomerated together. These aggregates are formed also by small spherical granules with different size distributions that have been determined using image-J software. The small granule diameter obtained from different TEM and SEM micrographs were 100-200nm.

The samples were initially characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR). UV–Vis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The crystalline phase and morphological analysis revealed nanocrystals of monoclinic structure with an average crystallite size between 31.38 nm and 42.5 nm. The femtosecond Z-scan study at 800 nm central wavelength indicated a saturable absorption behavior of which the mechanism is closely related to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the particles.

Cellulose microfibers obtained were characterized by different techniques. The chemical analysis indicated an increase in α-cellulose content and decrease in lignin and hemicellulose for the cellulose microfibers over raw fibers. Fourier transform infrared and 13C NMR spectra confirmed the removal of non-cellulosic (lignin and hemicellulose) components after chemical treatments. The X-ray diffraction results revealed that the cellulose I was partly transformed into cellulose II by chemical treatments and the crystallinity index of cellulose microfibers was significantly increased as compared to raw fibers owing to removal of non-cellulosic components.

We incorporated ZnO:Ho3+ (0.5 mol% Ho) nanostructures in the pristine P3HT-conjugated polymer and systematically studied the effect of the nanostructures on the optical characteristics. Detailed UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis revealed enhanced absorption coefficient and optical conductivity in the P3HT-ZnO:Ho3+ film as compared to the pristine P3HT. Moreover. the obtained photoluminescence (PL) results established the improvement of exciton dissociation as a result of ZnO:Ho3+ nanostructures inclusion. The occurrence of PL quenching is the result of enhanced charge transfer due to ZnO:Ho3+ nanostructures in the polymer. whereas energy transfer from ZnO:Ho3+ to P3HT was verified.

The survey of 1213 adults was carried out using a questionnaire developed as a part of this research. The aim was to establish the extent of people’s awareness and acceptance of CCU and to elicit the importance they put on different sustainability issues relevant to CCU. The survey findings suggest that there is a very low level of public awareness of CCU — only 9% of the respondents expressed confidence in knowing what it was. The study indicates that. while the general public are willing and able to express preferences for sustainability issues relevant for CCU. a relatively high rate of ‘don’t know’ responses indicates that respondents were unable to comprehend certain aspects.

Three studies were conducted to assess whether key arguments used by government within this consultation might have influenced public opinion about the technology. Participants first read a passage of text that made salient certain positive (climate change mitigation. increased energy security) or negative (nuclear waste) aspects of the nuclear debate. Participants then completed a task that required them to create an electricity mix for the UK by varying the contributions made by each of five energy sources (coal. gas. nuclear. renewables and electric import). Study 1 seemed to indicate that pitching the debate in terms of climate change mitigation was effective in increasing endorsement of nuclear power.

It is thought that CGBs might help explain why people act in ways that appear to contradict their pro-environmental intentions. and inconsistently engage in pro-environmental behaviors. The present study sought to investigate the nature and use of CGBs. A series of interviews suggested that participants endorsed CGBs to (a) reduce feelings of guilt with respect to (the assumed or actual) negative environmental impact of their actions and (b) defend their green credentials in social situations. Participants also justified detrimental behaviors on the basis of higher loyalties (e.g.. family’s needs). or the perceived difficulty of performing more pro-environmental actions.

A number of studies have investigated positive and negative spillover effects. but empirical evidence is mixed. showing evidence for both positive and negative spillover effects. and lack of spillover altogether. Environmental identity has been identified as an influential factor for spillover effects. Building on identity process theory the current framework proposes that positive. negative. and a lack of spillover are determined by perceived threat of initial behaviour and identity process mechanisms evaluating the behaviour. It is proposed. that an environmental behaviour change intervention may threaten one’s existing identities. leading to either (a) integration. (b) compartmentalisation. or (c) conflict between one’s environmental identity and non-environmental identities. Initial evidence for the proposed framework is based on a field intervention which included a meat reduction programme in a canteen of a medium size private sector company. Semi-structured interviews and an explorative visualisation method that aimed at assessing identity change were implemented with thirteen employees (i.e. intervention participants) before and after the intervention. The qualitative data was analysed by using thematic analysis via NVivo12. Results of the visualisation task and interview method provided initial evidence of direct and indirect positive contextual spillover effects. with comparatively less evidence a lack of spillover and a relative absence of reported negative spillover.

In this context. the interest recently demonstrated in the Greek region concerning PVs encourages the investigation of optimum operation conditions for such systems. At the same time. summer-only applications. being rather common in Greece. require maximum exploitation of the local solar potential during the specific period of the year. For this purpose. an experimental study is currently carried out in the area of Athens. in order to evaluate the performance of different PV panel tilt angles during the summer period. According to the experimental results obtained. the angle of 15° (±2.5°) is designated as optimum for almost the entire summer period. while conclusions drawn are accordingly theoretically validated by means of …,True,rEpqEFoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211007894,3560400599955907132,/scholar?cites=3560400599955907132,,,,0,0,0

When available. natural gas can potentially substitute oil. Moreover. the high-quality wind energy potential found in many of these areas cannot be used extensively. Main reason is the operation of small-scale. weak electricity grids which cannot cope with wind energy intermittency.

Along with spray characteristics. the investigation of impinging sprays and of liquid wall film development is fundamental for predicting the mixture formation. Simulations of these phenomena for diesel sprays need to be validated and improved; nevertheless they can extend and complement experimental measurements. In this paper the wall film thickness for impinging sprays was investigated by evaluating the heat transfer across a temperature controlled wall. In fact. heat transfer is significantly affected by the wall film thickness. and both experiments and simulations were carried out to correlate the wall temperature variations and film height.

Brodeur,,,,2374,Engineers Australia,Project courses in which students design. build and test a device on their own are increasingly being used in engineering education. The reasons include that such projects do not only train design skills. they also give an improved understanding of engineering science knowledge. From a learning point of view a design-build-test (DBT) experience might be invaluable. For engineering design practice. understanding of and abstraction from real situations are vital skills. The students need to learn the ability to confront the concrete details of real problems and to abstract a relevant understanding of them–to build ties between these problems and abstract concepts [1]. The project-based learning also results in further advantages such as having the project as a unique learning motivator as well as giving possibilities for planned reflection loops for experience-reflection-generalization [2]. Last but definitely not the least. the students practice non-technical competencies such as communication. teamwork etc.. that are vital for their future role as engineers. However. it must be admitted that (DBT) experiences may also be costly. time-consuming. require new learning environments and different specialized faculty competence.The proper set-up of a DBT educational experience generally requires consideration of a large number of factors-identifying goals. selecting projects. budgeting. and so on-that differ from those in traditional educational situations.

Elliptic nozzle holes have the potential to increase air entrainment into the spray. which could lead to decreased emissions from diesel combustion. Previous work [6. 7] has shown some interesting results in a passenger car diesel engine and also in a single cylinder engine with optical access. The idea is based on results from investigations of gas jets. where the air entrainment for elliptical jets was increased substantially compared to circular jets. The present series of experiments were carried out to further investigate these effects. The non-circular holes. which were made with an aspect ratio of close to 2: 1. have a similar flow rate as the conventional circular holes.

1270057,Performance Analysis of a Reciprocating Piston Expander and a Plate Type Exhaust Gas Recirculation Boiler in a Water-Based Rankine Cycle for Heat Recovery from a Heavy Duty …,2016,Gunnar Latz and Olof Erlandsson and Thomas Skåre and Arnaud Contet and Sven Andersson and Karin Munch,9,Energies,7,495,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The exhaust gas in an internal combustion engine provides favorable conditions for a waste-heat recovery (WHR) system. The highest potential is achieved by the Rankine cycle as a heat recovery technology. There are only few experimental studies that investigate full-scale systems using water-based working fluids and their effects on the performance and operation of a Rankine cycle heat recovery system. This paper discusses experimental results and practical challenges with a WHR system when utilizing heat from the exhaust gas recirculation system of a truck engine. The results showed that the boiler’s pinch point necessitated trade-offs between maintaining adequate boiling pressure while achieving acceptable cooling of the EGR and superheating of the water. The expander used in the system had a geometric compression ratio of 21 together with a steam outlet timing that caused high re-compression. Inlet pressures of up to 30 bar were therefore required for a stable expander power output. Such high pressures increased the pump power. and reduced the EGR cooling in the boiler because of pinch-point effects. Simulations indicated that reducing the expander’s compression ratio from 21 to 13 would allow 30% lower steam supply pressures without adversely affecting the expander’s power output.

For soft (non-< 001>) oriented single crystals. the elongations at room temperature typically do not exceed 1--2%. Higher room temperature ductilities have been achieved using various schemes such as heat treatment. microalloying. etc. In one of the more controversial papers. Darolia et al. presented single crystal data suggesting that small (< 1%) additions of iron. gallium or molybdenum enhance the room temperature tensile ductility of< 110> single crystals to 5--6%; this spurned a large amount of work around the world aimed at elucidating the mechanism (s) responsible for this effect. While there has been no apparent independent confirmation of this unexpected ductilization effect. various investigators have suggested and. in some cases. shown that the following factors are of extreme importance to the mechanical behavior of this compound: impurity content. heat treatment (thermal vacancies). constitutional defects (due to deviations from stoichiometry). orientation. prestraining and surface condition.

Nanostructured materials possess properties superior to those of conventional. coarse grained materials. Hence designing potentially cost efficient and environmentally friendly products with better performance is a possibility. Among others. nanostructured materials exhibit increased strength. hardness and ductility and provide an opportunity for superplastic forming. When all the procedures in use for the production of nanostructured materials are examined. only severe plastic deformation (SPD) processes exhibit a potential for producing relatively large samples suitable for industrial applications.

As trovoadas foram relacionadas. em baixos níveis. aos Alísios com curvatura ciclônica e em altos níveis à presença de VCAN (Vórtice Ciclônico em Altos Níveis). CJNEB (Corrente de Jato no Nordeste do Brasil) e Anticiclone sobre o Estado de Alagoas. As trovoadas se formaram predominantemente a noroeste do VCAN e na região da entrada (lado quente) e na saída (lado frio) da CJNEB. As análises termodinâmicas mostraram que as curvas de temperatura do ar e de temperatura do ponto de orvalho observadas foram semelhantes às curvas previstas. construídas pelas trajetórias das parcelas de ar pelo modelo HYSPLIT. nas previsões até 48 e 24h de antecedência. respectivamente. Os índices LI e CAPE+ previram uma atmosfera muito instável com 48h de antecedência.,True,1FCNlUkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,15,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-77862011000200009&script=sci_arttext,974137614042517781,/scholar?cites=974137614042517781,,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-77862011000200009&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

The use of a horizontal distribution  of the equivalent potential temperature and its advection is the new aspect in frontal identification and will support forecasters in their daily operational practice. Six fronts over 3 years were identified by the method used in operational practice. Twenty fronts were registered by cloud bands together with the equivalent potential temperature and its advection maps.

Fog duration was short and its intensity was weak or moderate. The principal objectives of the study were: (1) analysis of the physical processes of fog formation (synoptic and thermodynamic conditions and processes). (2) PAFOG model testing. and (3) estimation of the effect of vegetation on fog forecast. Cyclonic curvature and divergence of the air current over the ocean at low levels and anticyclonic curvature at high levels were associated with the fog. Weak lifting at low levels was identified by the NCEP/DOE II. ECMWF. and WRF models for all eight events. Sinking at high levels was dominant in the ECMWF and WRF models. Absence of thermal inversion and conditional instability at low levels was identified by the NCEP/DOE II and ECMWF models. According to the WRF model …,True,1FCNlUkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,10,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-014-1027-0,333159827715109566,/scholar?cites=333159827715109566,,,,0,0,0

Data of the seventeen Alagoass pluviometric stations were used for precipitation analysis in the CCM events. National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis products were used for weather systems monitoring. Low level troughs and Wave Disturbances in the Trade Winds were mostly associated with the CCM formation. The CCMs were responsible for the precipitation measures≥ 5. 0 mm in only 7% of cases. but in 70% for the intense precipitation events. Zona da Mata region of the Alagoas was most affected by heavy precipitation. CCM dimensions were determined by the satellite infrared images using MATLAB software.

Easterly Waves. Wave Disturbance in the field of Trade Winds and Frontal Zones. The frontal zones are associated with extratropical baroclinic lows and are the principal mechanism of the weather changing at the South America (SA). A few frontal zones pass through NEB; only 20% of all fronts observed on Brazil. reach the NEB (KOUSKY. 1979; KOUSKY & FERREIRA. 1981; Gemiacki. 2005 and CLIMANÁLISE. 2003). The fronts in NEB can’t by identified by temperature variation. but high humidity and wind direction variation show the frontal passage. The frontal zones are associated with intensive convection on the all tropical regions of SA and with adverse meteorological phenomenon on NEB.The aim of this investigation is the mechanisms study of the frontal zones penetration into tropical region up to Alagoas State (latitude 10oS). Two mechanisms were described and the examples of both mechanisms are presented. The first example shows the conditions of the frontal passage from south of SA. The second and third examples present the frontal zones formation near NEB. witch were associated with cyclonic vortex at the atmospheric middle levels.,True,1FCNlUkAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC,9,http://bibdigital.sid.inpe.br/rep-/cptec.inpe.br/adm_conf/2005/10.18.17.33,15028336395084431693,/scholar?cites=15028336395084431693,,,http://bibdigital.sid.inpe.br/rep-/cptec.inpe.br/adm_conf/2005/10.18.17.33,0,0,0
