The altered surface structures can account for functional differences among the members of a family. Sliding of the intron-exon junctions may constitute one mechanism for generating length polymorphisms and divergent sequences found in protein families.

Underlying this disease is the aberrant action of the androgen receptor (AR). AR is distinguished from other nuclear receptors in that after hormone binding. it preferentially responds to a specialized set of coactivators bearing aromatic-rich motifs. while responding poorly to coactivators bearing the leucine-rich “NR box” motifs favored by other nuclear receptors. Under normal conditions. interactions with these AR-specific coactivators through aromatic-rich motifs underlie targeted gene transcription. However. during prostate cancer. abnormal association with such coactivators. as well as with coactivators containing canonical leucine-rich motifs. promotes disease progression. To understand the paradox of this unusual selectivity. we have derived a complete set of peptide motifs that interact with AR using phage display. Binding affinities were measured for a selected set of these peptides and their interactions with AR determined by X-ray crystallography. Structures of AR in complex with FxxLF. LxxLL. FxxLW. WxxLF. WxxVW. FxxFF. and FxxYF motifs reveal a changing surface of the AR coactivator binding interface that permits accommodation of both AR-specific aromatic-rich motifs and canonical leucine-rich motifs.

We have previously cloned the gene for glycogen phosphorylase (GPH1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To assess the role of glycogen and phosphorylase-catalyzed glycogenolysis in the yeast life cycle. yeast strains lacking a functional GPH1 gene or containing multiple copies of the gene were constructed. GPH1 was found not to be an essential gene in yeast cells. Haploid cells disrupted in GPH1 lacked phosphorylase activity and attained higher levels of intracellular glycogen but otherwise were similar to wild-type cells. Diploid cells homozygous for the disruption were able to sporulate and give rise to viable ascospores. Absence of functional GPH1 did not impair cells from synthesizing and storing trehalose. Increases in phosphorylase activity of 10- to 40-fold were detected in cells carrying …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,114,https://mcb.asm.org/content/9/4/1659.short,6564000900551859962,/scholar?cites=6564000900551859962,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/9/4/1659.full.pdf,0,0,0

T. foetus HGXPRTase crystallizes as an asymmetric dimer. with GMP bound to only one of the two molecules that form the asymmetric unit. Each molecule of HGXPRTase is formed by two lobes joined by a short “hinge” region. and the GMP binds in a cavity between the two lobes. A comparison of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit shows that the hinge region is flexible and that ligand binding affects the relative positions of the two lobes. The binding of GMP brings the two lobes closer together. rotating one lobe by about 5° relative to the other.

The TR-LBD folding. comprised mostly of α-helices. is likely to be general for the superfamily. The ligand. buried in the receptor. forms part of its hydrophobic core. Tight fitting of ligand into the receptor explains its high affinity for the TR. although the structure suggests that ligands with even higher affinities might be generated.

A polar cave provides the stabilization for maintaining the buried charge. and it features the conserved amino acid Ser214 adjacent to Aspl02. Ser214 has been replaced with Ala. Glu. and Lys in rat anionic trypsin. and the consequences of these changes have been determined. Three-dimensional structures of the Glu and Lys variant trypsins reveal that the new 214 side chains are buried. The 2.2-A crystal structure (R= 0.150) of trypsin S214K shows that Lys214occupies the position held by Ser214 and a buried water molecule in the buried polar cave. Lys214-Nf is solvent inaccessible and is less than 5 A from the catalytic Aspl02. The side chain of Glu214 (2.8 k. R=0.168) in trypsin S214E shows two conformations.

To address the structural basis of its broad specificity. the gene for ecotin has been cloned and its sequence determined. A promoter of the 17-base pair spacing class was identified. and the probable transcriptional start site lies 18 base pairs upstream from a ribosome binding locus. The gene is followed by a series of conserved repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences. Ecotin has a signal peptide of 20 amino acids which confirms its periplasmic localization.

This pan-specificity of inhibition is believed to derive from formation of a heterotetrameric complex with target proteases involving three types of interface: the dimerization interface. a primary substrate-like interaction. and a smaller secondary interaction between the partner ecotin subunit and the protease. A monomeric ecotin variant (mEcotin) and a single-chain ecotin dimer (scEcotin) were constructed to study the effect of a network of protein interactions on binding affinity and the role of dimerization in broad inhibitor specificity. mEcotin was produced by inserting a β-turn into the C-terminal arm. which normally exchanges with the other subunit.

Although LRH-1 is able to bind phospholipids. it is still considered an orphan nuclear receptor (NR) with an unknown regulatory hormone.

Presently. no natural or synthetic ligand has been identified for a large group of orphan NRs. Small molecules to target these orphan NRs will provide unique resources for uncovering regulatory systems that impact human health and to modulate these pathways with drugs. The orphan NR tailless (TLX. NR2E1). a transcriptional repressor. is a major player in neurogenesis and Neural Stem Cell (NSC) derived brain tumors. No chemical probes that modulate TLX activity are available. and it is not clear whether TLX is druggable. To assess TLX ligand binding capacity. we created homology models of the TLX ligand binding domain (LBD). Results suggest that TLX belongs to an emerging class of NRs that lack LBD helices α1 and α2 and that it has potential to form a large open ligand binding pocket (LBP). Using a medium throughput screening strategy. we investigated direct binding of 20.000 compounds to purified human TLX protein and verified interactions with a secondary (orthogonal) assay. We then assessed effects of verified binders on TLX activity using luciferase assays. As a result. we report identification of three compounds (ccrp1. ccrp2 and ccrp3) that bind to recombinant TLX protein with affinities in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range and enhance TLX transcriptional repressive activity.

FKBP52 is a positive regulator of AR in cellular and whole animal models and is required for the development of androgen-dependent tissues. We previously characterized an AR inhibitor termed MJC13 that putatively targets the AR BF3 surface to specifically inhibit FKBP52-regulated AR signaling. Predictive modeling suggests that β-catenin interacts with the AR hormone binding domain on a surface that overlaps with BF3. Here we demonstrate that FKBP52 and β-catenin interact directly in vitro and act in concert to promote a synergistic up-regulation of both hormone-independent and -dependent AR signaling. Our data demonstrate that FKBP52 promotes β-catenin interaction with AR and is required for β-catenin co-activation of AR activity in prostate cancer cells. MJC13 effectively blocks β-catenin interaction with the AR LBD and the synergistic up-regulation of AR by FKBP52 and β-catenin. Our data suggest that co-regulation of AR by FKBP52 and β-catenin does not require FKBP52 PPIase catalytic activity. nor FKBP52 binding to Hsp90.

Antiandrogens compete with the natural hormone and are front line therapeutics to treat prostate cancer. However. antiandrogens frequently become ineffective after prolonged treatment because of development of tumor resistance. This paper reviews design principles for new generations of antiandrogens: super antagonists and surface allosteric modulators. Super antiandrogens are compounds with higher binding affinity than natural agonists and that contain precisely engineered hydrophobic groups that disrupt AR function. AR surface is also an attractive alternative target. Surface inhibitors are small molecules that directly block the receptor–co-activator interface. preventing co-activator recruitment.

Here. we investigated whether disulfide-trapping. an approach new to nuclear receptors. would provide effective lead compounds targeting human liver receptor homolog 1 (hLRH-1. NR5A2). Despite the fact that hLRH-1 contains a large ligand binding pocket and binds phospholipids with high affinity. existing synthetic hLRH-1 ligands are of limited utility due to poor solubility. low efficacy or significant off-target effects. Using disulfide-trapping. we identified a lead compound that conjugates with remarkably high-efficiency to a native cysteine residue (Cys346) lining the hydrophobic cavity in the ligand binding domain of hLRH-1. Guided by computational modeling and cellular assays. the lead compound was elaborated into ligands PME8 and PME9 that bind hLRH-1 reversibly (no cysteine reactivity) and increase hLRH-1 activity in cells. When compared with the existing hLRH-1 synthetic agonist RJW100. both PME8 and PME9 showed comparable induction of the LRH-1 dependent target gene CYP24A1 in human HepG2 cells. beginning as early as 3 h after drug treatment. The induction is specific as siRNA-mediated knock-down of hLRH-1 renders both PME8 and PME9 ineffective. These data show that PME8 and PME9 are potent activators of hLRH-1 and suggest that with further development this lead series may yield useful chemical probes for manipulating LRH-1 activity in vivo.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159316,12721520700988632410,/scholar?cites=12721520700988632410,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159316,0,0,0

HIP1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. The binding of HIP1 to actin is regulated through an interaction with clathrin light chain. Clathrin light chain binds to a flexible coiled-coil domain in HIP1 and induces a compact state that is refractory to actin binding. To understand the mechanism of this conformational regulation. a high-resolution crystal structure of a stable fragment from the HIP1 coiled-coil domain was determined. The flexibility of the HIP1 coiled-coil region was evident from its variation from a previously determined structure of a similar region. A hydrogen-bond network and changes in coiled-coil monomer interaction suggest that the HIP1 coiled-coil domain is uniquely suited to allow conformational flexibility.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,7,https://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?S0907444909054535,2372503989890038333,/scholar?cites=2372503989890038333,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2827350/,0,0,0

The molecular mechanism of microtubule bundling by KCBP remains unknown. KCBP binding to microtubules is regulated by Ca2+-binding proteins that recognize its C-terminal regulatory domain. In this work. we have discovered a new function of the regulatory domain. We present a crystal structure of an Arabidopsis KCBP fragment showing that the C-terminal regulatory domain forms a dimerization interface for KCBP. This dimerization site is distinct from the dimerization interface within the N-terminal domain. Side chains of hydrophobic residues of the calmodulin binding helix of the regulatory domain form the C-terminal dimerization interface. Biochemical experiments show that another segment of the regulatory domain located beyond the dimerization interface. its negatively charged coil. is unexpectedly and absolutely required to stabilize the dimers. The strong microtubule bundling properties of KCBP are unaffected by deletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain. The slow minus-end directed motility of KCBP is also unchanged in vitro. Although the C-terminal domain is not essential for microtubule bundling. we suggest that KCBP may use its two independent dimerization interfaces to support different types of bundled microtubule structures in cells. Two distinct dimerization sites may provide a mechanism for microtubule rearrangement in response to Ca2+ signaling since Ca2+- binding proteins can disengage KCBP dimers dependent on its C …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC,5,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066669,17782376745118013296,/scholar?cites=17782376745118013296,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066669,0,0,0

Ebashi (Ebashi. 1963; Ebashi et al.. 1967) highlighted the importance of regulation of muscle contraction and sparked numerous experimental studies of the mysterious protein troponin whose properties are now becoming understood at satisfying resolution.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:OTTXONDVkokC,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-38453-3_6,13063464247752920039,/scholar?cites=13063464247752920039,,,0,0,0
86315,The androgen receptor coactivator-binding interface,2009,Eva Estébanez-Perpiñá and Robert J Fletterick,,,,297-311,Springer. New York. NY,When hormone binds to the androgen receptor (AR). the ligand-binding domain (LBD) becomes ordered. displaying a new protein–protein interaction surface called AF2 (coactivator-binding pocket). which is a hydrophobic groove that fits AR coregulators. The association of coregulators with AR LBD is often a critical step for its transcriptional function. Existing pharmaceuticals block AR activity by disrupting AF2 surface's ability to recruit coactivators. Such antagonists bind to the hormone-binding site inside the LBD core and perturb the structure of the most terminal helix of the LBD. distorting the AF2 surface. The AF2 pocket is also a potential candidate for pharmaceutical intervention by surface-directed small molecules that will directly block coactivator recruitment. Such molecules may be a novel generation of antiandrogens for treating prostate cancer.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC,3,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-69179-4_13,7214525691415354921,/scholar?cites=7214525691415354921,,,0,0,0

As with the first-line therapeutic bicalutamide (Casodex). resistance to newer antiandrogens (enzalutamide. ARN-509) develops quickly in patients. despite the fact that these drugs have ∼10-fold better affinity for the androgen receptor than bicalutamide. Improving affinity alone is often not sufficient to prevent resistance. and alternative strategies are needed to improve antiandrogen efficacy. Covalent and reversible covalent drugs are being used to thwart drug resistance in other contexts. and activated aryl nitriles are among the moieties being exploited for this purpose. We capitalized on the presence of an aryl nitrile in bicalutamide. and the existence of a native cysteine residue (Cys784) in the androgen receptor ligand binding pocket. to develop 5N-bicalutamide. a cysteine-reactive antiandrogen …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC,2,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschembio.7b00702,11773169962974339597,/scholar?cites=11773169962974339597,,,0,0,0

Our research is innovative in its approach because the target protein is known to control not just one but multiple regulatory mechanisms essential for tumor growth and spread. Thus by targeting this protein. one might be able to de-activate these mechanisms. inhibiting and even reversing the progression of pancreatic cancer. Conceivably. dietary modifications that affect LRH-1 function may spawn a prophylactic approach to the disease. An additional appeal of LRH-1 as a drug target includes its well-studied ligand-binding pocket. which could be targeted by specific drugs. and the proven efficiency of nuclear receptor inhibitors for treatment of different types of malignancies. including breast and prostate cancers. In this project. we show how to discover selective inhibitors of LRH-1 and analyze them in pancreatic cancer cells. The identified novel inhibitors of LRH-1 could then be developed into a pharmaceutical that will inhibit growth and proliferation of cancer cells in pancreatic tumors. advancing the existing pancreatic cancer therapies.Descriptors:,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,1,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA621081,6462131621620487894,/scholar?cites=6462131621620487894,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA621081.pdf,0,0,0

Colorectal cancers (CRC) account for nearly 10% of cancer deaths in industrialized countries. Recent evidence points to a central role for the nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1) in intestinal tumorigenesis. Interaction of LRH-1 with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. highly active in a critical subpopulation of CRC cancer cells. underscores the importance of elucidating LRH-1's role in this disease. Reduction of LRH-1 diminishes tumor burden in murine models of CRC. The central role of receptor LRH-1 in CRC pathogenesis and a wealth of structural data at atomic resolution make LRH-1 an attractive target. Methods: To evaluate the contributions of LRH-1 to CRC growth. we constructed stably transduced CRC cell lines expressing Tet-inducible shRNA directed against LRH-1.

Bell,2012,Stephen Sprang and Robert Fletterick and William J Rutter,,Gene Regulation,,35,Elsevier,The cloning and sequencing of genes of proteins whose structure is known allows a comparison of the localization of intervening sequences with the structural features of the proteins. In some instances. the intron positions seem to demarcate structural and/or functional units. but in others. there is no obvious relationship between the protein and gene structure. Comparison with tertiary structures indicates that the intron positions in the gene correspond to the external boundary rather than the interior of the protein. This localization is confirmed by a solvent accessible sur-face analysis which shows that the intron junctions are almost always located at the protein-solvent interface. While the surface rule is based on observations of a few relatively small globular proteins with known tertiary structure. it is further supported by the observation that the consensus sequences at the 5'(but not the 3') intron/exon splice junctions predominantly code for hydrophilic and surface type amino acids. These results suggest that intron placements may have played a role in protein evolution. For example. intron junctions may be sites of hypervariability and hence of structural change. If so. such junctions would be better accommo-dated on the surface. rather than the interior where changes would likely result in distortion or destruction of the architecture of the molecule. Consistent with these ideas. certain evolutionary variations in the Serine protease family appear to correlate with intron location. Experimental studies on the expression of the human insul in gene in heterologous mammalian cells using SV40 viral vectors show that the normal splicing can occur. but that …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Mv8rL9dhCDEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA35&dq=info:5vTv1JRpybcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=LUV69LfDXV&sig=Zg03-jaXSTcTTYdUQ7XNMev7AwE,,,,,0,0,0

Spectra of spin probes attached to single Cys (S1220C or S1215C) on the neck mimic showed a mobile and an immobilized component. There was a significantly higher content of the immobile component in the spectrum of the Cys1220 mutant.

86361,Inhibitors for Androgen Receptor Activation Surfaces,2006,Robert J Fletterick,,,,,CALIFORNIA UNIV SAN FRANCISCO,The androgen receptor AR is a proven therapeutic target for treating prostate cancer. Known therapeutics target the ligand binding domain LBD at the exact place where dihydrotestosterone DHT binds. Upon binding DHT. AR reorganizes to form new interaction surfaces such as the AF2 surface that attracts coregulators. AF2 has been proposed as a second therapeutic target as coactivator recruitment is a key step for AR function. We developed two screening methods to find compounds that bind to AF2. Our method has proved successful with the thyroid receptor. In solution. a competition assay reports coactivator displacement and 3D screening by X-ray crystallography visualizes the compounds on the receptor. Two classes of compounds have been identified that bind to AF2 the first class bind weakly and do not compete with coactivator binding 2-methylindole. and two protein kinase inhibitors. while the second class have micromolar affinity and compete with coactivator binding TRIAC. and three aspirin derivatives. Screening revealed a significant and undiscovered cryptic surface site that we call binding function 3 BF3. which might be implicated in AR regulation. These are the first compounds reported to block AR protein-protein interactions and might serve as starting templates for more selective and effective antiandrogens.Descriptors:,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA462434,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA462434.pdf,0,0,0

Most nuclear receptors recruit steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) to their ligand binding domain (LBD) using a leucine-rich motif (LXXLL). AR is believed to recruit unique coactivators to its LBD using an aromaticrich motif (FXXLF) while recruiting SRCs to its N-terminal domain (NTD) through an alternate mechanism. Here. we report that the AR-LBD interacts with both FXXLF motifs and a subset of LXXLL motifs and that contacts with these LXXLL motifs are both necessary and sufficient for SRC-mediated AR regulation of transcription. Crystal structures of the activated AR in complex with both recruitment motifs reveal that side chains unique to the AR-LBD rearrange to bind either the bulky FXXLF motifs or the more compact LXXLL motifs and that AR utilizes subsidiary contacts with LXXLL flanking sequences to discriminate between LXXLL motifs.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/46424384/The_molecular_mechanisms_of_coactivator_20160612-12332-19bjywo.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46424384/The_molecular_mechanisms_of_coactivator_20160612-12332-19bjywo.pdf,0,0,0

DC]: American Society for Microbiology. 1981-,Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is an orphan nuclear receptor with no known ligand. We showed previously that phosphorylation at serine 203 located N'-terminal to the ligand binding domain (LBD) enhanced cofactor recruitment. analogous to the ligand-mediated recruitment in ligand-dependent receptors. In this study. results of biochemical analyses and an LBD helix assembly assay suggest that the SF-1 LBD adopts an active conformation. with helices 1 and 12 packed against the predicted alpha-helical bundle. in the apparent absence of ligand. Fine mapping of the previously defined proximal activation function in SF-1 showed that the activation function mapped fully to helix 1 of the LBD. Limited proteolyses demonstrate that phosphorylation of S203 in the hinge region mimics the stabilizing effects of ligand on the LBD. Moreover. similar effects were observed in an SF-1/thyroid hormone LBD chimera receptor …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3573535130115288924&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

This reaction requires an efficient membrane binding. and the N-terminal beta-barrel domain of the enzyme has been implicated in this process. To obtain detailed information on the structural requirements for membrane oxygenation. we expressed the rabbit wild-type 15-lipoxygenase. its beta-barrel deletion mutant (catalytic domain). and several lipoxygenase point mutations as His-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and tested their membrane binding characteristics. We found that: (i) the beta-barrel deletion mutant was catalytically active and its enzymatic properties (KM. Vmax. pH optimum. substrate specificity) were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme; (ii) when compared with the wild-type lipoxygenase. the membrane binding properties …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1797044105383021922&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

We performed a comprehensive x-ray crystal structure-guided mutation analysis of the TR ligand binding domain (TR LBD) surface to map the functional interface for TR homodimers and heterodimers with RXR in the absence and/or in the presence of DNA. We also identified the molecular contacts in TR LBDs crystallized as dimers. The results show that crystal dimer contacts differ from those found in the functional studies. We found that identical TR LBD residues found in helices 10 and 11 are involved in TR homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR. Moreover. the same TR LBD surface is operative for dimerization with direct repeats spaced by 4 base pairs (DR-4) and with the inverted palindrome spaced by 6 base pairs (F2). but not …,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9942487542736126806&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Boston. MA,Most protozoan parasites. such as Leishmania. Plasmodium. Toxoplasma and Trypanosoma. rely on a salvage pathway for their supply of purine ribonucleotides (Wang. 1984). Inhibition of this pathway therefore presents an interesting approach in the fight against microbial infections. To explore the feasibility of this approach we have attempted to identify inhibitors of the essential purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGXPRTase) of the protozoan parasite Tritrichomonas foetus. This sexually transmitted parasite causes causes bovine trichomoniasis. which can lead to embryonic death and infertility in cows. T. foetus relies primarily on a single enzyme. HGXPRTase. to transfer ribose 5-phosphate from α-D-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to the N9 nitrogen atom of hypoxanthine. guanine or xanthine (Wang et al.. 1983).

We have developed an expression system for phosphorylases that allows us to investigate the structural basis of this regulatory difference. The genes or cDNAS to muscle. liver. and yeast phosphorylases were previously cloned. To serve as expression host. a yeast strain was constructed in which the endogenous phosphorylase gene was disabled. An expression vector was constructed from the yeast 2u plasmid YEp24 plus 5! and 3'flanking regions of the yeast phosphorylase gene. The vector was able to direct high-level expression of yeast phosphorylase (1-3% of total protein). Using this system. we attempted to express rabbit muscle and human liver phosphor-ylases. and a protein from a muscle-liver hybrid CDNA.,True,MAlNgd0AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12282642055292293741&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

In particular. ROI or by-products of ROI-initiated lipid peroxidation have been shown to be overproduced in animal models of endotoxic shock induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)[1. 2]. In these or related models. ROI inhibition by antioxidants has been shown to have a protective effect on the toxicity of LPS [3. 4]. thus indicating that they actually are working as pathogenetic mediators. It should be noted that in these models the source of ROI that are eventually overproduced has not been characterized. although phagocytes have been often pointed out as major suspects.

In a study described in the chapter. cytolytic activity of peritoneal Mφ was measured as 3H–TdR release from prelabeled mKSA–TU5 tumor cells after 48 h of cocultivation. Peritoneal Mφ of C3H/HeN mice can develop high cytolytic activity against tumor cells when exposed in vitro to partially purified mouse interferon (IFN-β). The kinetics of cytotoxicity enhancement also differed between IFN-β and Mφ activating factor (MAF). The ability of IFN-β to modulate in vitro another Mφ activity. thought to be controlled by the same mechanisms of Mφ cytolysis. was investigated. A variety of soluble factors released by Mφ have been hypothesized as responsible for their cytotoxic activity.

Cotreatment with neuroprotective agents and CDDP has been proposed for preventing or reversing the neuropathy. Erythropoietin given systemically has a wide range of neuroprotective actions in animal models of central and peripheral nervous system damage. However. the erythropoietic action is a potential cause of side effects if erythropoietin is used for neuroprotection. We have successfully identified derivatives of erythropoietin. including carbamylated erythropoietin. which do not raise the hematocrit but retain the neuroprotective action exerted by erythropoietin. Experimental Design: We have developed previously an experimental chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity that closely resembles CDDP neurotoxicity in humans. The present study compared the effects of erythropoietin and carbamylated erythropoietin (50 Ag/kg/d thrice weekly) on CDDP (2 mg/kg/d ip twice weekly for 4 weeks) neurotoxicity in vivo. Results: CDDP given toWistar rats significantly lowered their growth rate (P< 0.05). with slower sensory nerve conduction velocity (P< 0.001) and reduced intraepidermal nerve fibers density (P< 0.001 versus controls). Coadministration of CDDP and erythropoietin or carbamylated erythropoietin partially but significantly prevented the sensory nerve conduction velocity reduction. Both molecules preserved intraepidermal nerve fiber density. thus confirming their neuroprotective effect at the pathologic level.

GSH depletion occurs if supplies of cysteine are inadequate to maintain GSH homeostasis in the face of the increased GSH consumption. Thus. rapid administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). which is converted to cysteine by first pass metabolism and provides the cysteine necessary to replenish the depleted GSH. is the standard of care for preventing injury in acetaminophen overdose.GSH deficiency has also been recognized in a variety of apparently unrelated clinical conditions and diseases. NAC has been widely tested in randomized placebo-controlled trials for efficacy in these diseases and conditions. In this publication. we systematically review reports from these trials. which collectively indicate that cysteine/GSH deficiency is a common occurrence and that NAC may be a useful therapeutic adjunct for treating or preventing the development of this deficiency.,True,gyiXnVUAAAAJ:vkG2KsohqNgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hajime_Nakamura5/publication/327799571_CysteineGlutathione_Deficiency_A_Significant_and_Treatable_Corollary_of_Disease/links/5bb3fe6b299bf13e605ceb8a/Cysteine-Glutathione-Deficiency-A-Significant-and-Treatable-Corollary-of-Disease.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hajime_Nakamura5/publication/327799571_CysteineGlutathione_Deficiency_A_Significant_and_Treatable_Corollary_of_Disease/links/5bb3fe6b299bf13e605ceb8a/Cysteine-Glutathione-Deficiency-A-Significant-and-Treatable-Corollary-of-Disease.pdf,0,0,0

As population studies are essential for establishing these environment-organism interactions. biomarkers of oxidative stress or inflammation are critical in formulating mechanistic hypotheses. By using examples of stress induced by various mechanisms. we focus on the biomarkers that have been used to assess oxidative stress and inflammation in these conditions. We discuss the difference between biomarkers that are the result of a chemical reaction (such as lipid peroxides or oxidized proteins that are a result of the reaction of molecules with reactive oxygen species. ROS) and those that represent the biological response to stress. such as the transcription factor NRF2 or inflammation and inflammatory cytokines. The high-throughput and holistic approaches to biomarker discovery used extensively in large-scale molecular epidemiological exposome are also discussed in the context of human exposure to environmental stressors. Finally. we consider the role of biomarkers as signs and distinguish between signs that are just indicators of biological processes and proxies that one can interact with and modify the disease process.,True,gyiXnVUAAAAJ:T4xR6ACgc60C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/53099677/Ghezzi_Biomarkers.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53099677/Ghezzi_Biomarkers.pdf,0,0,0

Using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. we investigated whether erythropoietin mediates neuroprotection facilitating the transcription of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Erythropoietin (10 U/ml) reduced by~ 50% the neuronal death triggered by the prototypic neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT) and time-dependently induced BDNF mRNA. This effect resulted in an increased production of biologically active BDNF. which led to a sustained activation of the specific BDNF receptor TrkB. Reduction of TMT-induced neuronal death by erythropoietin was specifically prevented by a neutralizing anti-BDNF antibody (15 micrograms/ml). indicating the involvement of this neurotrophin in erythropoietin neuroprotective effect.,True,gyiXnVUAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17023518487317649728&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

87457,The Acetylcholine Receptor: What the Three-Dimensional Structure Tells Us about Ion Conductance,1987,ROBERT MICHAEL STROUD and JANET FINER-MOORE,,Biological Organization: Macromolecular Interactions at High Resolution,,307,Academic Press,Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) are the best understood of the neurochemical receptors. The most studied AChR's are those found at the junctions between nerve and muscle cells. or in the electrocytes of electric fish or eels. Located in the plasma membrane of the target cell. they translate the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into conductivity through an ion-conducting channel (1-5). Essentially all the modulation or regulation of function is seen in terms of the closing rate after an event. The channels are a binary logical element of the nervous system. being always either fully open or fully closed. We determined the three-dimensional structure of this molecule from acetylcholine-rich membrane fractions prepared from the electric fish Torpedo californica (6). The structure. at 25 A resolution. was obtained by a combination of electron microscope studies on tubular crystalline arrays of the native acetylcholine receptor (7) and by X-ray diffraction of AChR-rich membranes (8). Recently tubular arrays of extensively proteolyzed AChR from T. marmorata have been analyzed by frozen hydrated electron microscopy to give a 25-A-resolution three-dimensional structure (9. 10).

Only recently. with the dramatic success in crystallization of reaction centers by have suitable X-ray diffraction quality crystals of such proteins been obtained. The difficulties probably arise because of the amphipathic nature of membrane proteins. Thus structure analysis has relied upon development of new and sometimes novel techniques. However. alongside the sometime complex analysis of new types of data. even low resolution structures give rise to useful and testable models for aspects of the function of these proteins. In addition. there are certain types of characteristic structures which join the basic architectural alphabet in transmembrane proteins. For example. bundles of nearly parallel a helices. oriented perpendicular to the membrane. are often apparent in integral membrane proteins. and are found in both of the proteins discussed here.The acetylcholine receptor (ACChR) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) are both cell surface receptor proteins. Both have a function in trans-membrane signalling. in which receipt of a ligand in Acchr. or a photon in bR. effects changes on both sides of the plasma membrane. As such these two. much studied membrane proteins are archetypes for large classes of other related surface receptor proteins.

The structure has been refined using a constrained crystallographic refinement procedure. The final R value is 0.24 for 15.000 significantly measured reflections; the estimated standard deviation of atomic positions is 0.09 A. A more objective assessment of the error in the atomic positions is possible by comparing the two independently refined monomers. The mean deviation of main-chain atoms of the two chains in internal segments is 0.22 A. of main-chain dihedral angles 6.3 for these segments.

This. coupled with a scheme to account for twinning and specimen tilt in the microscope. yields results that are sensitive enough to rapidly quantitate any structure change in PM brought about by site-directed mutagenesis to the level of less than two carbon atoms.Removal of tightly bound divalent cations (mainly Ca2'and Mg2+) from PM causes a color change to blue and is accompanied by a severely altered photocycle of the protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR). a light-driven proton pump.

Blois. Heedeok Hong. Tae H. Kim. James U. Bowie. University of California. Los Angeles. Los Angeles. CA. USA. An understanding of the molecular forces that specify a protein’s structure is essential for many of the central quests of structural biology. While there has been a larger effort to understand soluble protein folding. we know very little about membrane protein folding energetics. We are developing a novel method to study the forces that stabilize membrane proteins in lipid bilayers. which we termed the ‘Steric Trap method.’The steric trap method couples protein unfolding to a measurable binding event by exploiting steric repulsion and the high affinity of the streptavidin/biotin interaction. To do this. we introduce two biotin tags on a target protein that are close in space and employ monovalent streptavidin (mSA) as our steric trap. A single mSA can bind without steric hindrance to the folded protein. but a second mSA can only bind when the protein unfolds due to steric overlap. Thus. the binding affinity of the second streptavidin provides a measure of unfolding free energy because binding is coupled to unfolding. We have developed this method on the water-soluble protein. dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). When two biotin-labeling sites were rationally designed to be close to one another in space and near the enzyme active site of DHFR. enzymatic activity was reversibly abolished upon incubation with a molar excess of monovalent streptavidin. Incubation with a stabilizing ligand shifted streptavidin binding curves. confirming that the steric trapping can …,True,sIx6igMAAAAJ:Nufq_to8ts0C,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82491444.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82491444.pdf,0,0,0

Learner issues with forming and supporting opinions. responding to other viewpoints. structuring speech across time. and L2 grammar use can often result in quiet or silent group discussions. One approach to reducing such a heavy cognitive load for students is pre-discussion planning. Important design factors for discussion planning include group size and mode (spoken versus written) as well as planning focus. After having experience using differing combinations across 7 weeks of classes. 82 non-English major Japanese university students responded to a survey about combinations of planning group size and the mode they preferred to use. If given 10 minutes of planning time. the students generally preferred to plan in groups using a mixture of oral rehearsal and written planning.

Current programs in the College have been represented in the University’s academic offerings almost from the very beginning of the institution. The School of Technology has the distinction of being the oldest unit in the College. having established its roots at Eastern in 1902 when courses in manual training were offered as handwork courses for teachers. Following technology in 1913. what was to become today’s School of Family and Consumer Sciences began with the offering of a two-year degree program in Domestic Sciences. The forerunner of our present School of Business. the Department of Commerce. was initiated in 1937 as part of Eastern’s teacher preparation program. The relative newcomer. the Department of Military Science. began in 1980 as an extension center of the University of Illinois. There is thus a combined 272 years of experience in program development. offering. and enhancement within the College.

The protein has also been crystallized and this 300.000 Dalton complex has been subjected to x-ray diffraction. Analysis of the sequence suggests a secondary structural pathway for the polypeptides that is common to all four gene products. Proteases have been used to cleave the protein and to identify sites of post translational modifications. Changes in conformation associated with activation and desensitization have been probed using tritiumhydrogen exchange. The large conformational changes associated with toxin binding can be understood in terms of the high resolution structure of a-bungarotoxin and the target site on the receptor.,True,sIx6igMAAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12409282259258243957&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The individual nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) are diluted to desired concentrations and are mixed in equimolar ratios to make a stock solution. If they are supplied in ethanol and will be used in large amounts. the ethanol should be removed prior to use.

87523,[9] Specific labeling of 3′ termini of RNA with T4 RNA ligase,1980,TE England and AG Bruce and OC Uhlenbeck,65,,,65-74,Academic Press,This chapter deals with specific labeling of 3' termini of RNA with T4 RNA ligase. T4 RNA ligase catalyzes the formation of an internucleotide phosphodiester bond between a 5' terminal phosphate and a 3' terminal hydroxyl of oligo- or polyribonucleotides with the accompanying hydrolysis of ATE. If the two termini are present on the same molecule. a cyclic RNA product is formed. However. if the oligoribonucleotide with the Y-phosphate (the donor) is too short to cyclize or has a blocked 3' terminus. it will join with another oligoribonucleotide with a free 3'- hydroxyl (the acceptor) to form an intermolecular ligation product. One important application of the RNA ligase reaction is the use of an RNA molecule as an acceptor and a [5'-32P]nucleoside 3'.5'-bisphosphate as a donor to form a product RNA one nucleotide longer with a 3' terminal phosphate and a 3∼P-phosphate in the last internucleotide …,True,SXf3gxgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,451,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0076687980650113,985342568170839142,/scholar?cites=985342568170839142,,,0,0,0

These molecules form intramolecular hairpin loops at low temperatures and therefore are useful models for similar structures which occur in larger. natural RNA molecules.

Analysis of the reaction indicated that the product resulted from initial DNA-directed run-off transcription followed by RNA template-directed RNA synthesis. This reaction occurred because the RNA made from the DNA template displayed self-complementarity at its 39 end and therefore could form an intra- or intermolecular primed template. In reactions containing only an RNA template. the rate of incorporation of NTPs was quite comparable to DNA-dependent transcription. RNA template-directed RNA synthesis has been found to occur with a great number of oligoribonucleotides. even with primed templates that are only marginally stable.

Ltd,Escherichia coli DbpA is a member of the DEAD/H family of proteins which has been shown to have robust ATPase activity only in the presence of a specific region of 23S rRNA. A series of bimolecular RNA substrates were designed based on this activating region of rRNA and used to demonstrate that DbpA is also a non-processive. sequence-specific RNA helicase. The high affinity of DbpA for the RNA substrates allowed both single and multiple turnover helicase assays to be performed. Helicase activity of DbpA is dependent on the presence of ATP or dATP. the sequence of the loop of hairpin 92 of 23S rRNA and the position of the substrate helix with respect to hairpin 92.

We have tested this model by examining the cleavage properties of a hammerhead containing a unique phosphorothioate at position 9. The R p-. but notS p-. phosphorothioate reduces the cleavage rate by 103-fold. and the rate can be fully restored by addition of low concentrations of Cd2+. a thiophilic metal ion. These results strongly suggest that this bound metal ion is critical for catalysis. despite its location ∼20 Å from the cleavage site in the crystal structure.

87575,The role of metal ions in RNA biochemistry,1999,Andrew L Feig and Olke C Uhlenbeck,37,Cold Spring Harbor Monograph Series,,287-320,CSH COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY PRESS,Approximately two-thirds of the elements in the periodic table can be categorized as metals. Besides luster. malleability. and conductivity. one of the fundamental characteristics of metals is their low ionization potential. As a result. the ionic forms of these elements predominate in the biosphere. Considering the diverse properties of these ions. it is not surprising that through the process of evolution. metal ions have been co-opted into numerous roles in biology. Metal ions are required for so many biochemical reactions that it is likely that they also had an important role in the RNA world. To understand both modern and prebiotic RNA biochemistry. it is therefore essential to have a basic understanding of these inorganic elements.Metal ions were abundant in the primordial soup. It is believed that 3.8× 109 years ago. the ocean was between 80 C and 100 C with a pH possibly as low as 6 (Bengston 1994). Table 1 shows the concentrations of the most common metal ions in today’s seas and in blood plasma. Although the concentrations of most of these ions in the prebiotic ocean are not known. the higher temperature and lower pH relative to the current ocean would have solvated a variety of ions and leached metal ions from the mineral-rich ocean beds. Therefore. the concentrations would have been significantly higher than the current values. One important additional difference is the extremely low concentration of easily oxidized metal ions such as Fe (II). Ferrous ion has been predicted to have been very abundant in the primordial ocean. as high as 0.1 mM (Bengston 1994). Interestingly. this change is probably due to the fact that early life forms …,True,SXf3gxgAAAAJ:7T2F9Uy0os0C,114,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.692.5206&rep=rep1&type=pdf,12445146372020118990,/scholar?cites=12445146372020118990,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.692.5206&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Furthermore. this specificity can be altered by introducing a mutation in the amino acid binding pocket on the surface of EF-Tu.

For a series of RNA oligomers of the same chain length. sequences that bind coat protein dimer with a lower affinity require higher concentrations of RNA and protein for assembly. Among a series of non-specific RNA molecules of differing lengths. lower protein and RNA concentrations are required for assembly of capsids containing longer RNAs. For RNA molecules of any length. the presence of a single high-affinity translational operator sequence lowered the concentration requirements for capsid assembly.

A series of RNA subfragments and sequence changes were used to identify the recognition elements of this RNA-protein interaction. Reducing the size of the fully active 153-nt RNA yields compromised substrates in which both RNA and ATP binding are weakened considerably without affecting the maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis. All RNAs that stimulate ATPase activity contain hairpin 92 of 23S rRNA. which is known to interact with the 3' end of tRNAs in the ribosomal A-site. RNAs with base mutations within this hairpin fail to activate ATP hydrolysis. suggesting that it is a critical recognition element for DbpA. Although the isolated hairpin fails to activate DbpA.

Each hammerhead was constructed from two oligoribonucleotides in two different configurations. Although cleavage was observed in all nine cases. the rates of cleavage varied by more than a thousand fold. The presence of RNA secondary structure incompatible with hammerhead formation in the individual oligos may be responsible for the large rate differences.

Identical association and dissociation rate constants were observed for all eight aa-tRNAs in both the ribosomal A and P sites despite substantial differences in tRNA sequence. the type of esterified amino acid. and posttranscriptional modifications. These results indicate that the overall binding of all aa-tRNAs to the ribosome is uniform. However. when either the esterified amino acid or the tRNA modifications were removed. binding was no longer uniform. These results suggest that differences in tRNA sequences and tRNA modifications have evolved to offset differential thermodynamic contributions of the esterified amino acid and the codon-anticodon interaction so that ribosomal binding of all aa-tRNAs remains uniform.,True,SXf3gxgAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,108,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276504006550,12099100039685565242,/scholar?cites=12099100039685565242,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276504006550,0,0,0

All DEx D H proteins contain a two-domain catalytic core that enables their RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA helicase activities.

An analysis of chimeras composed of tRNA 2 Ala and various amounts of either tRNA 3 Gly or tRNA 2 Arg indicates that the presence of the parental 32-38 nucleotide pair is sufficient to restore ribosome binding of the transplanted anticodons. Furthermore. mutagenesis of tRNA 2 Ala showed that its highly conserved A32-U38 pair serves to weaken ribosome affinity.

HH16 is unable to discriminate between its full‐length substrate and 3′‐truncated substrates. even when six fewer base pairs are formed between HH16 and the substrate. This striking lack of specificity arises because all the substrates bind to the ribozyme with sufficient affinity so that cleavage occurs before their affinity differences are manifested.

The mechanism by which a signal is transmitted from the site of codon−anticodon interaction in the decoding center of the 30S ribosomal subunit to the site of EF-Tu binding on the 50S subunit is not known. Here we examine the role of the tRNA in this process.

At saturating EF-Tu concentrations. weaker-binding aa-tRNAs decode their cognate codons similarly to wild-type tRNAs. However. tighter-binding aa-tRNAs show reduced rates of peptide bond formation due to slow release from EF-Tu•GDP. Thus. the affinities of aa-tRNAs for EF-Tu are constrained to be uniform by their need to bind tightly enough to form the ternary complex but weakly enough to release from EF-Tu during decoding.

Although originally found as a bimolecular hammerhead assembled through helices I and II. fast cleavage was observed in hammerheads in the more conventional helix I−helix III form. provided the sequence of helix I of the fast hammerhead was preserved. Mutations indicated that the fast rate of cleavage was due to the presence of both the U1.1-A2.1 and A1.2-U2.2 base pairs. The faster rate of cleavage was due to a small increase in the activation entropy of the reaction.

Biochemical evidence indicating a thermodynamic contribution of the esterified amino acid to binding aminoacyl-tRNA to either the ribosomal P- and A-sites has been inconsistent. partly because of the labile nature of the aminoacyl linkage and the long times required to reach equilibrium. Measuring the association and dissociation rates of deacylated and aminoacylated tRNAs to the A-site and P-site of E. coli ribosomes afforded an accurate estimate of the contribution of the amino acid. While esterified phenylalanine or methionine has no effect on the affinity of tRNA to the P-site. an esterified pheylalanine stabilizes binding to the A-site by 7 kJ/mol. in agreement with the contacts observed in the X-ray crystal structure.

87657,Identification of thermodynamically relevant interactions between EF-Tu and backbone elements of tRNA,2001,Jeffrey A Pleiss and Olke C Uhlenbeck,308,Journal of molecular biology,5,895-905,Academic Press,A set of 45 different tRNAs. each containing a single deoxynucleotide substitution covering the upper half of the molecule was used in conjunction with a high-throughput ribonuclease protection assay to investigate the thermodynamic role of 2′ hydroxyl groups in stabilizing a complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) from Thermus thermophilus. Five distinct 2′ hydroxyl groups were identified where substitution with a proton resulted in an approximately tenfold decrease in the binding affinity. The same five 2′ hydroxyl groups reduced the affinity of the interaction with the nearly identical Thermus aquaticus EF-Tu. Four of these 2′ hydroxyl groups were observed to form hydrogen bonds in a co-crystal structure of tRNAPhe and T. aquaticus EF-Tu. while the fifth 2′ hydroxyl group can be associated with an intramolecular hydrogen bond in the tRNA.

Kinetic parameters of tRNA aminoacylation by Escherichia coli AlaRS obtained by the new method are in excellent agreement with those measured by the conventional method.

A substrate lacking the 2′ hydroxyl adjacent to the cleavage site showed no detectable cleavage under a variety of reaction conditions. Competition experiments indicate that this fragment binds to the ribozyme with an affinity similar to the all RNA fragment. suggesting that the attacking 2′ hydroxyl does not substantially contribute to the binding of substrate to ribozyme. Similar competition experiments with the all DNA substrate indicate a much lower affinity for the ribozyme perhaps due to the lack of other 2′ hydroxyls.

This supports the model that both hammerheads utilize a similar catalytic mechanism but HH16 is slower because it infrequently samples the active conformation. The relative effect of different mutations at positions 3 and 8 also depends on the identity of residue 17 in both nHH8 and HH16.

Three X-ray cocrystal structures reveal that while most of the contacts with the protein involve the phosphodiester backbone of tRNA. a single hydrogen bond is observed between the Glu390 and the amino group of a guanine in the 51–63 base pair in the T-stem of tRNA. Here we show that the Glu390Ala mutation of Thermus thermophilus EF-Tu selectively destabilizes binding of those tRNAs containing a guanine at either position 51 or 63 and that mutagenesis of the 51–63 base pair in several tRNAs modulates their binding affinities to EF-Tu.

These analogs test whether disruption of the hydrogen bonds normally formed by uridine 33 and steric crowding in the anticodon loop are detrimental to tRNA function on the ribosome. Single-turnover kinetic studies of the reaction of these ternary complexes with ribosomes show that these Phe-tRNA analogs decrease the apparent rate of GTP hydrolysis (kGTP) and the ratio of peptide formed to GTP hydrolyzed. Thus. the substitution of uridine 33 affects not only the selection of a ternary complex by the ribosome but also the selection of an aminoacyl-tRNA in the proofreading reaction.

Here the directionality of the helicase activity of DbpA was determined by using substrates containing a short reporter helix in the presence of a second adjacent helix of varying stability placed either 5‘ or 3‘ of the reporter helix. When the second helix was on the 5‘ side of the reporter helix. it had no effect on the dissociation rate of the reporter helix. However. when the second helix was on the 3‘ side of the reporter helix. its dissociation rate determined the dissociation rate of the reporter helix. This defines DbpA as a 3‘ → 5‘ helicase.

On the basis of experiments determining the Mg2+ concentration dependence of the cleavage rate and the stimulation of cleavage by thiophilic Cd2+ ion. the lesser catalytic rate enhancement of the dithioate linkage is primarily due to the loss of a single Mg2+ ion bound near the cleavage site.

Surprisingly. all 16 aa-tRNAs displayed similar dissociation rate constants from the A site.

In each case. conditions were found where one of the two activities of the enzyme could be eliminated without greatly reducing the other. Taken together. these data indicate that the two activities are catalyzed by amino acid residues located in separate active sites on the polypeptide chain. Specific exopeptidase digestion indicates that the kinase activity lies in the NH2-terminal and the phosphatase in the COOH-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain.

The 63 nucleotide library consisted of the acceptor stem and portions of the D and T stems of E. coli tRNAPhe flanking a 32 nucleotide randomized region. Because FRS binding relies on a correctly folded tRNA substrate. the selected variants from this library were expected to resemble tRNAPhe structure. After seven cycles of selection. the RNA library bound to FRS with similar affinity to that of the E. coli tRNAPhe. but did not show detectable aminoacylation. Fourteen FRS-specific isolates were sequenced and found to contain an anticodon stem-loop including the anticodon triplet of tRNAPhe.

A nitrocellulose filter binding assay was used to measure the change in binding affinity upon introduction of a single methylphosphonate stereoisomer at 13 different positions in the RNA hairpin. Comparing these data to the available crystal structure of the complex shows that all phosphates that are in proximity to the protein show a weaker binding affinity when substituted with a phosphorothioate and control positions show no change.

87723,tRNA residues evolved to promote translational accuracy,2013,Irina Shepotinovskaya and Olke C Uhlenbeck,19,RNA,4,510-516,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,The decoding properties of 22 structurally conservative base-pair and base-triple mutations in the anticodon hairpin and tertiary core of Escherichia coli tRNAAlaGGC were determined under single turnover conditions using E. coli ribosomes. While all of the mutations were able to efficiently decode the cognate GCC codon. many showed substantial misreading of near-cognate GUC or ACC codons. Although all the misreading mutations were present in the sequences of other E. coli tRNAs. they were never found among bacterial tRNAAlaGGC sequences. This suggests that the sequences of bacterial tRNAAlaGGC have evolved to avoid reading incorrect codons.,True,SXf3gxgAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,15,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/4/510.short,3660288846143620012,/scholar?cites=3660288846143620012,,https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/4/510.full.pdf,0,0,0

Quantitation consisted of counting (scoring) the number of grains formed over both interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes on slides after various hybridization procedures. The average number of grains/nucleus per slide was then used to determine hybridization percentages. As with nitrocellulose filter hybridizations the kinetics of in situ hybridizations can be fit with a single first-order rate constant. However. the in situ hybridization rate was approximately 10 times slower than the corresponding filter hybridization rate. The efficiency of in situ hybridization was found to range between 5 and 15% for both leukocyte and fibroblast cell types and for both metaphase and interphase nuclei.

The affinities of eight aminoacyl-tRNAs were differentially destabilized by the introduction of the H66A mutation into Escherichia coli EF-Tu. whereas Ala-tRNAAla and Gly-tRNAGly were unaffected. The H66F and H66W proteins each show a different pattern of binding of 10 different aminoacyl-tRNAs. clearly showing that this position is critical in establishing the specificity of EF-Tu for different esterified amino acids. However. the H66A mutation does not greatly affect the ability of the ternary complex to bind ribosomes. hydrolyze GTP. or form dipeptide. suggesting that this residue does not directly participate in ribosomal decoding.

These eight amino acids and five nearby control positions were individually changed to an alanine residue and the binding affinities of the mutant proteins to the RNA were determined. In general. the data agreed well with the crystal structure and previous RNA modification data. Interestingly. amino acid residues that are energetically most important for complex formation cluster in the middle of the RNA binding interface. forming thermodynamic hot spots. and are surrounded by energetically less relevant amino acids.

Constraining the position of helices I and II in this manner did not significantly alter the rate constant for cleavage. consistent with no large rearrangement of the helices occurring during catalysis. Unexpectedly. the “internal” equilibrium between the cleavage and ligation reactions for the circular hammerheads was shifted further toward cleavage. This effect was due to the rate of ligation of the circular substrate being slower than the corresponding linear substrate. The temperature dependence of the internal equilibrium of the circular substrate revealed that although restricting the flexibility of the hammerhead reduced the favorable entropy change associated with cleavage as expected …,True,SXf3gxgAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C,11,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi980307z,14233504384577313186,/scholar?cites=14233504384577313186,,,0,0,0
87731,RNA biophysics has come of age,2009,Olke C Uhlenbeck,91,,10,811-814,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,The study of RNA using biophysical techniques began in the late 1950s. not long after the importance of RNA in cellular function became evident. The limited availability of materials focused early work on homopolymers. a few tRNAs and intact viral RNA genomes. The field took off in the past two decades as it became easier to make RNA and as the astonishingly elaborate pathways of RNA metabolism were revealed. A recent volume of the Springer Series of Biophysics entitled ‘‘Nonprotein Coding RNAs’’edited by Nils G. Walter. Sarah A. Woodson. and Robert T. Batey successfully provides a snapshot of the current status of the field. Looking through its chapters. it is clear that RNA biophysics has come of age.

Comparison of ΔΔGo values for binding EF-Tu to aa-tRNA show that the majority of the interface residues stabilize the ternary complex and their thermodynamic contribution can depend on the tRNA species that is used. Experiments with a very tight binding mutation of tRNATyr indicate that interface amino acids distant from the tRNA mutation can contribute to the specificity. For nearly all of the mutations. the values of ΔΔGo were identical to those previously determined at the orthologous positions of Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) EF-Tu indicating that the thermodynamic properties of the interface …,True,SXf3gxgAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,9,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi500533x,8445911304728018583,/scholar?cites=8445911304728018583,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/bi500533x,0,0,0
87733,Enhanced product stability in the hammerhead ribozyme,2010,Irina Shepotinovskaya and Olke C Uhlenbeck,49,Biochemistry,21,4494-4500,American Chemical Society,The rate of dissociation of P1. the 5′ product of hammerhead cleavage. is 100−300-fold slower in full-length hammerheads than in hammerheads that either lack or have disrupting mutations in the loop−loop tertiary interaction. The added stability requires the presence of residue 17 at the 3′ terminus of P1 but not the 2′. 3′ terminal phosphate. Since residue 17 is buried within the catalytic core of the hammerhead in the X-ray structure. we propose that the enhanced P1 stability is a result of the cooperative folding of the hammerhead around this residue. However. since P1 is fully stabilized at >2.5 mM MgCl2 while hammerhead activity continues to increase with an increase in MgCl2 concentration. it is clear that the hammerhead structure in the transition state must differ from that of the product complex.

While RNA molecules can be synthesised by entirely chemical or enzymatic methods. a combination of both is often the best. In this chapter. we focus on two enzymatic methods that have made the synthesis of olgioribonucleotides accessible to any laboratory familiar with simple biochemical reactions.

The sequence of the two RNA binding sites differ by 2 of 20 nucleotides and two coat proteins by 17 of 129 amino acids. An analysis of the binding of fr coat protein to 24 operator variants revealed that the two proteins recognize operator sequences in virtually the same way. However. fr coat protein binds to nearly every RNA 6 to 14-fold tighter than R17 coat protein. Since the fr operator is a weaker binding variant and the fr coat protein shows a different temperature dependence of binding. it is unlikely that the two systems have different K             a             s              in vivo             .
