The performance of conventional diesel fuel (CDF) and various percentages of diesel blended with palm oil-based biodiesel is also studied to evaluate their performance. The performance of the various fuels is evaluated based on the temperature profile of the combustor’s wall and emissions. such as nitrogen oxides (NO x) and carbon monoxide (CO). The combustion experiments were conducted using three different oil burner nozzles (1.25. 1.50 and 1.75 USgal/h) under lean (equivalence ratio (Φ)= 0.8). stoichiometric (Φ= 1) and rich fuel (Φ= 1.2) ratio conditions. The results show that the rate of emission formation decreases as the volume percent of palm biodiesel in a blend increases. PME combustion tests present a lower temperature inside the chamber compared to CDF combustion. High rates of NO x formation occur under lean mixture conditions with the presence of high nitrogen and sufficient temperature. whereas high CO occurs for rich mixtures with low oxygen presence.

The global flame appearance and emissions performance were examined for high (H2/CO = 3) and moderate (H2/CO = 1.2) H2-rich syngases. Results showed that higher H2 fractions in the syngases produce lower NOx emissions per kWh basis across all equivalence ratios tested. CO emissions are equivalence ratio dependent and are less affected by the H2 fraction in the syngas. Increasing CO2 diluent ratios result in the decrease of NOx. particularly for moderate H2-rich syngases.

1089019,Investigation of radial swirler effect on flow pattern inside a gas turbine combustor,2009,Yehia A Eldrainy and MF bin Ahmad and MNM Jaafar,3,Modern Applied Science,5,21,,A study was conducted to investigate the flow pattern in a gas turbine combustor using numerical and experimental approaches. The main function of a combustor is to burn the air-fuel mixture then to admit the high energy burnt gases. with uniform and limited temperature. to drive the turbine blades. The gas temperature must not exceed a certain allowable temperature to prevent any damage of the blades. Flow pattern within the combustor has a great effect on the self sustaining flame. mixing of fuel and air. combustion intensity and combustor exit temperature uniformity. For this reason. a radial vaned swirler was used in this study to demonstrate its effect on the flow pattern within the combustor. The radial swirler vanes had an aerodynamically curved profile to allow the incoming axial flow to turn gradually and hence to inhibit the flow separation on the suction side of the vane. Therefore. smooth flow turning. higher tangential and radial-velocity components can be generated at the swirler exit with lower pressure loss. Three swirler vane angles 40. 50 and 60 corresponding to swirl numbers of 0.35. 0.54 and 1.13 were used to evaluate their effect on the combustor aerodynamics.

1089022,A multiple inlet swirler for gas turbine combustors,2009,Yehia A Eldrainy and Hossam S Aly and Khalid M Saqr and Mohammad Nazri Mohd Jaafar,53,"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology",,,,The central recirculation zone (CRZ) in a swirl stabilized gas turbine combustor has a dominant effect on the fuel air mixing process and flame stability. Most of state of the art swirlers share one disadvantage; the fixed swirl number for the same swirler configuration. Thus. in a mathematical sense. Reynolds number becomes the sole parameter for controlling the flow characteristics inside the combustor. As a result. at low load operation. the generated swirl is more likely to become feeble affecting the flame stabilization and mixing process. This paper introduces a new swirler concept which overcomes the mentioned weakness of the modern configurations. The new swirler introduces air tangentially and axially to the combustor through tangential vanes and an axial vanes respectively. Therefore. it provides different swirl numbers for the same configuration by regulating the ratio between the axial and tangential flow momenta. The swirler aerodynamic performance was investigated using four CFD simulations in order to demonstrate the impact of tangential to axial flow rate ratio on the CRZ. It was found that the length of the CRZ is directly proportional to the tangential to axial air flow rate ratio.,True,RP_qp4UAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,22,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.2363&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6222930787892617051,/scholar?cites=6222930787892617051,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.2363&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1089039,Performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled by rapeseed oil bio-fuel,2011,Wira Jazair and Syunsuke Kubo and Masazumi Takayasu and Tomoaki Yatsufusa and Yoshiyuki Kidoguchi,33,Jurnal Mekanikal,2,,,This study had used straight vegetable oil (SVO) particularly neat rapeseed oil as a fuel in a direct injection diesel engine. Combustion performance and exhaust emissions of using the fuel have been measured from no load up to full load engine condition. For comparison diesel fuel JIS# 2 have been used. SVO gives higher NOx but lower smoke emissions at high load compared with JIS# 2. Lower smoke emissions at high load is due to oxygen content in the SVO that can eliminate partially unburned fuel at stratified fuel rich zone during combustion. Enhanced combustion raises the temperature inside the combustion chamber and caused higher NOx emission. In addition of using SVO as fuel. this study also had blend several percentages of ethanol into SVO with the presence of octanol as surfactant. As percentage of ethanol increased in this SVO-ethanol blend. smoke and particulate emissions reduced with unchanged NOx level. This is because the reduction of kinematic viscosity of SVO-ethanol blend improves the atomization and vaporization of injected fuel droplets that leads to lower particulate emission. Simultaneous reduction of NOx and particulate emissions can be obtained by transform the SVO into an emulsion fuel by blending some percentages of water into SVO with existence of castor oil as surfactant. Evaporation of water during combustion reduces the combustion temperature and causes the reduction of NOx emission. Reduction of particulate emission is due to water gas reaction. However. the use of SVO emulsion in diesel engine shows deterioration of CO and THC emissions.,True,304soNMAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,25,https://jurnalmekanikal.utm.my/index.php/jurnalmekanikal/article/view/84,9109344116104281847,/scholar?cites=9109344116104281847,,https://jurnalmekanikal.utm.my/index.php/jurnalmekanikal/article/viewFile/84/83,0,0,0

A model following the control structure is adopted consisting of a feed-forward and feedback compensation strategy that serves as correction inputs to enhance the vehicle’s dynamic behavior. The velocity dependent feed-forward control inputs are based on the driver’s steering intention while the feedback control inputs are based on the vehicle’s state feedback errors. being the sideslip and yaw rate of the vehicle. Numerical simulations are conducted using the Matlab/Simulink platform to evaluate the control system’s performance. The performance of the 4WAS controller is tested in two designated open loop tests. being the constant steer and the lane change maneuver. to evaluate its effectiveness. A comparison with conventional passive front-wheel-steering (FWS) and conventional four-wheel-steering (4WS) systems shows the preeminent result performance of the proposed control strategy in terms of the response tracking capability and versatility of the controller to adapt to the system’s speed environment. In high speed maneuvers. the improvement in terms of yaw rate tracking error in rms is evaluated and the proposed active steering system considerably beat the other two structures with 0.2% normalized error compared to the desired yaw rate response. Meanwhile. in low speed. turning radius reductions of 25% and 50% with respect to the capability of normal or typical FWS vehicles are successfully achieved.,True,304soNMAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,17,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohd_Azizi_Abdul_Rahman/publication/283097421_Optimal_control_strategy_for_low_speed_and_high_speed_four-wheel-active_steering_vehicle/links/57351aa208ae298602df0a7c/Optimal-control-strategy-for-low-speed-and-high-speed-four-wheel-active-steering-vehicle.pdf,8718706810310462519,/scholar?cites=8718706810310462519,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohd_Azizi_Abdul_Rahman/publication/283097421_Optimal_control_strategy_for_low_speed_and_high_speed_four-wheel-active_steering_vehicle/links/57351aa208ae298602df0a7c/Optimal-control-strategy-for-low-speed-and-high-speed-four-wheel-active-steering-vehicle.pdf,0,0,0

Basic and modified burner designs utilizing OEC in the aluminum melting process in a rotary tilting furnace were studied. A combined approach comprising experimental measurement and simulation modeling was adopted aimed at assessing GHG emissions production. Reduction of up to 60% fuel consumption of the total natural gas used in the laboratory-scale furnace was achieved. The optimal oxygen concentration in the oxidizer regarding the amount of total GHG emissions produced per charge expressed as CO 2 equivalent was 35% vol. Its further increase led only to marginal fuel savings. while the nitrogen oxide emissions increased rapidly. Using the modified burner along with OEC led to around 10% lower CO 2 emissions and around 15% lower total GHG emissions. compared to using a standard air/fuel burner. CFD simulations revealed the reasons for these observations: improved mixing patterns and more uniform temperature field. Modified burner application. moreover. enables furnace productivity to be increased by shortening the charge melting time by up to 16%.

Presented are results of simulations computed using a similarity theory-based numerical model. They imply that the current empirical formulas based on the theory of similarity. derived for analogous model cases of convective heat transfer do not allow to achieve satisfactory accuracy.

1089091,RMTP: A reliable multicast transport protocol,1996,John C Lin and Sanjoy Paul,3,,,1414-1424,IEEE,This paper describes the design and implementation of a multi-cast transport protocol called RMTP. RMTP provides sequenced. lossless delivery of bulk data from one sender to a group of receivers. RMTP achieves reliability by using a packet-based selective repeat retransmission scheme. in which each acknowledgment (ACK) packet carries a sequence number and a bitmap. ACK handling is based on a multi-level hierarchical approach. in which the receivers are grouped into a hierarchy of local regions. with a designated receiver (DR) in each local region. Receivers in each local region periodically send ACKs to their corresponding DR. DRs send ACKs to the higher-level DRs. until the DRs in the highest level send ACKs to the sender. thereby avoiding the ACK-implosion problem. DRs cache received data and respond to retransmission requests of the receivers in their corresponding local regions. thereby …,True,R3gBbQ0AAAAJ:hImZayhCRfQC,930,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/493090/,13403131643687580256,/scholar?cites=13403131643687580256,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.48.2306&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

A grey relational grade obtained from the grey relational analysis is used to solve the EDM process with the multiple performance characteristics. Optimal machining parameters can then be determined by the grey relational grade as the performance index. In this study. the machining parameters. namely workpiece polarity. pulse on time. duty factor. open discharge voltage. discharge current. and dielectric fluid are optimized with considerations of multiple performance characteristics including material removal rate. surface roughness. and electrode wear ratio.

Several minutes after injection of the JLB7 antibody virtually all of the intermediate filaments of the cells were found to be aggregated into tight bundles near or around the nucleus. In contrast. injection of the JLB1 antibody caused little or no aggregation of the intermediate filaments. Electron microscopy showed that the perinuclear bundles that formed after injection of the JLB7 antibody each consisted of ten or more intermediate filaments apparently crosslinked together. Double-label immunofluorescence microscopy showed that virtually all of the vimentin-containing intermediate filaments in the JLB7 antibody-injected cells were redistributed to the perinuclear region and remained there for at least 24 hr.

From these distributions. rovibronic distributions of the OH radical product as well as the state resolved angular anisotropy parameters were determined.

Two clear alternations in the OH(X.v=0) rotational distribution have been observed. with each alternation corresponding to an oscillation in the anisotropy distribution.

The solution rests on recasting the relationship between displacements and tractions into Fourier space. where the recovery of the traction field is especially simple.

We report here unexpected invariants of cytoskeletal behavior that comprise such an empirical framework. We measured elastic and frictional moduli of a variety of cell types over a wide range of time scales and using a variety of biological interventions. In all instances elastic stresses dominated at frequencies below 300 Hz. increased only weakly with frequency. and followed a power law; no characteristic time scale was evident. Frictional stresses paralleled the elastic behavior at frequencies below 10 Hz but approached a Newtonian viscous behavior at higher frequencies. Surprisingly. all data could be collapsed onto master curves. the existence of which implies that elastic and frictional stresses share a common underlying mechanism.

Studies under standard (static) culture conditions revealed that normal airway epithelia possess an adenosine-regulated pathway that blends Na+ absorption and Cl- secretion to optimize PCL volume. In cystic fibrosis (CF). the absence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator results in a failure of adenosine regulation of PCL volume. which is predicted to initiate mucus stasis and infection. However. under conditions that mimic the phasic motion of the lung in vivo. ATP release into PCL was increased. CF ion transport was rebalanced. and PCL volume was restored to levels adequate for lung defense.

1089132,Obesity. smooth muscle. and airway hyperresponsiveness,2005,Stephanie A Shore and Jeffrey J Fredberg,115,,5,925-927,Mosby,Both asthma and obesity are large and growing public health issues. Mounting evidence now implicates obesity as a major risk factor for asthma. thus linking these 2 major epidemics. Moreover. both in human subjects and in mice. obesity appears to predispose toward airway hyperresponsiveness. This review describes potential mechanisms whereby obesity might modify airway smooth muscle function to explain these observations. These mechanisms include both static and dynamic mechanical factors attributable to decreases in functional residual capacity and decreases in tidal volume that are observed in the obese. They include also obesity-related changes in lung development. chronic systemic inflammation (including increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines). and adipocyte-derived factors. including leptin. adiponectin. and plasminogen activator inhibitor.,True,FKdk9BQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,347,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674905003258,15284545397200773288,/scholar?cites=15284545397200773288,,https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(05)00325-8/fulltext,0,0,0

We show here that regulation of airway smooth muscle length corresponds  to a dynamically equilibrated steady state. not the static mechanical equilibrium that had been previously assumed. This dynamic steady state requires as an essential feature a continuous supply of external mechanical energy (derived from tidal lung inflations) that acts to perturb the interactions of  myosin with actin. drive the molecular state of the system far away from thermodynamic equilibrium.  and bias the muscle toward lengthening. This mechanism leads naturally to the suggestion that excessive airway narrowing in asthma may be associated with the destabilization of that dynamic process and its resulting collapse back to static equilibrium.

With subjects breathing 80% He-20% O2 there was good intrasubject agreement between acoustic and radiographic data in spite of large intersubject variability.

The purpose of this report is to consider the implications of an alternative approach that emphasizes the discrete nature of stress bearing elements in the cell and is based on the known structural properties of the cytoskeleton.

On the basis of that analysis we attempt to identify unifying principles that might underlie the shape stability of the cytoskeleton.

The polymer additives lead to the motion of the contact line (CL) resulted from the viscosity and Marangoni effect. The viscosity provides a large resistance to the radially outward flow. It results in a small amount of spheres deposited at droplet edge. which do not facilitate the pinning of the CL. The Marangoni effect resulted from the variation of polymer concentration at droplet edge during droplet evaporation contributes to the motion of the CL. Thus. uniform and ordered macroscale SiO2 microspheres deposition is achieved. What’s more. the coffee ring effect can be eliminated by different hydrosoluble polymer.

Using the yeast two-hybrid system. we screened a mouse brain cDNA library with bait constructs for mouse IP3R type 1 (IP3R1) to identify IP3R1-associated proteins. In this way. we found that carbonic anhydrase-related protein (CARP) is a novel IP3R1-binding protein. Western blot analysis revealed that CARP is expressed exclusively in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. in which IP3R1 is abundantly expressed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the subcellular localization of CARP in Purkinje cells is coincident with that of IP3R1.

Heterozygous knockout of brain-dominant type1 IP3R (IP3R1) resulted in neuronal vulnerability to ER stress in vivo. and IP3R1 knockdown enhanced ER stress-induced apoptosis via mitochondria in cultured cells. The IP3R1 tetrameric assembly was positively regulated by the ER chaperone GRP78 in an energy-dependent manner.

While neuronal spiking activity in the SCN provides a functional circadian oscillator that propagates throughout the brain. the ultradian sleep–wake state is regulated by the basal forebrain/preoptic area (BF/POA). How this SCN circadian oscillation is integrated into the shorter sleep–wake cycles remains unclear. We examined the temporal patterns of neuronal activity in these key brain regions in freely behaving rats. Neuronal activity in various brain regions presented diurnal rhythmicity and/or sleep–wake state dependence.

Subsaturating concentration of ouabain triggers intracellular calcium oscillations. stimulates cell proliferation and adhesion. and protects from apoptosis. However. it is controversial whether ouabain‐bound NKA is considered a signal transducer. To address this question. we performed a global analysis of protein phosphorylation in COS‐7 cells. identifying 2580 regulated phosphorylation events on 1242 proteins upon 10‐ and 20‐min treatment with ouabain.

IP 3 Rs are functionally coupled with CRAC channels and other Ca 2+ handling proteins. However. it still remains less well defined as to whether IP 3 Rs could regulate ER-mediated Ca 2+ signals independent of their Ca 2+ releasing ability. To address this. we generated IP 3 Rs triple and double knockout human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell lines (IP 3 Rs-TKO. IP 3 Rs-DKO). and systemically examined ER Ca 2+ dynamics and CRAC channel activity in these cells. The results showed that the rate of ER Ca 2+ leakage and refilling. as well as SOCE were all significantly reduced in IP 3 Rs-TKO cells. And these TKO effects could be rescued by over-expression of IP 3 R3. Further. results showed that the diminished SOCE was caused by NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination of Orai1 protein.

Recent evidence suggests that serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) is induced by aldosterone and acts as a key mediator of aldosterone action in epithelial tissues. Induction of SGK messenger RNA (mRNA) has previously been shown within 30 min of addition of supraphysiological doses of aldosterone to Xenopus A6 cells and within 4 h in rat kidney in vivo. In this study we determined the time course of SGK induction. at doses of aldosterone in the physiological range. in rat kidney and colon. using Northern and Western blot analyses and in situ hybridization and determined concurrent changes in urinary sodium and potassium excretion by Kagawa bioassay.

The pathway of gluconeogenesis is activated in liver shortly after birth due to the combined effects of glucocorticoids and glucagon. We have defined the essential cis-regulatory elements directing hormone-dependent liver-specific expression of the gene for tyrosine aminotransferase. a key gluconeogenic enzyme.

In the case of glucocorticoids. the glucocorticoid-dependent enhancer is composed of the glucocorticoid response element and binding sites for liver cell-enriched transcription factors. in particular hepatocyte nuclear factor-3.

The active antenna is simply composed of a flexible beam. actuators to move the beam. position sensors to measure the rotational angle of the beam. and a moment sensor. We first show that the contact distance under no lateral slip is proportional to the rotational compliance that the beam can sense at the rotational center. The lateral slip. which possibly occurs according to the pushing direction and the environment's geometry. overestimates the rotational compliance. and as a result. brings a large sensing error for the localizing contact point. The goal of this paper is to find the contact location under such conditions.

However. there are few epidemiologic studies on excessive daytime sleepiness in a large scale sample targeting Japanese general population.METHODS: The survey was performed using a self-administered questionnaire in June 2000. targeting a population randomly selected from among 300 communities throughout Japan. This questionnaire included information about sleep habits and sleep problems. Excessive daytime sleepiness measured according to a question"" Do you fall asleep when you must not sleep (for example when you are driving a car)?""RESULTS: A total of 28.714 subjects completed the questionnaire. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was 2.5%(male= 2.8% and female= 2.2%). Backward elimination analysis showed that the following were associated with excessive daytime sleepiness: male sex. young age. short sleep duration. subjective insufficient sleep. loss of deep sleep. disagreeable sensations in the legs. interruption of sleep by snoring or dyspnea. and feeling psychological stress.

The chef handles a tool called ldquopizza peel.rdquo where a plate is attached at the tip of a bar. and he remotely manipulates a pizza on the plate. We found that he aggressively utilizes only two degrees of freedom (DOFs) from the remote handling location during manipulation: translation along the bar and rotation about the bar. From the viewpoint of a dynamic system. the inertial loads for these specific DOFs are never affected by the length of the bar. This is important for the production of quick plate motions so that the object on the plate can be dynamically and remotely manipulated. Applying this handling mechanism to a robot system. we first reveal how to make the object's motion for three DOFs by using two DOFs of plate motion.

The timing of the intake valve closing was adjusted to alter the negative valve overlap and effective compression ratio to provide suitable HCCI conditions. The effect of mixture formation on auto-ignition was also investigated using a direct injection engine. As a result. HCCI combustion was achieved with a relatively low compression ratio when the intake air was heated by internal EGR. The resulting combustion was at a high thermal efficiency. comparable to that of modern diesel engines. and produced almost no NO x emissions or smoke. The mixture stratification increased the local A/F concentration. resulting in higher reactivity. A wide range of combustible A/F ratios was used to control the compression ignition timing. Photographs showed that the flame filled the entire chamber during combustion. reducing both emissions and fuel consumption.,True,1qTa2gQAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,57,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsmeb/46/1/46_1_31/_article/-char/ja/,6213796042601262319,/scholar?cites=6213796042601262319,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jsmeb/46/1/46_1_31/_pdf,0,0,0

In contrast to HFrEF. there is no established therapy for HFpEF. Chronic inflammation contributes to cardiac fibrosis. a crucial factor in HFpEF; however. inflammatory mechanisms and mediators involved in the development of HFpEF remain unclear. Therefore. we sought to identify novel inflammatory mediators involved in this process.  Methods and Results An analysis by multiplex-bead array assay revealed that serum interleukin-16 (IL-16) levels were specifically elevated in patients with HFpEF compared with HFrEF and controls. This was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in HFpEF patients and controls. and serum IL-16 levels showed a significant association with indices of LV diastolic dysfunction. Serum IL-16 levels were also elevated in a rat model of HFpEF and positively correlated with LV end-diastolic pressure. lung weight and LV myocardial stiffness constant. The cardiac expression of IL-16 was upregulated in the HFpEF rat model. Enhanced cardiac expression of IL-16 in transgenic mice induced cardiac fibrosis and LV myocardial stiffening accompanied by increased macrophage infiltration. Treatment with anti-IL-16 neutralizing antibody ameliorated cardiac fibrosis in the mouse model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension.

In vitro experiments indicated that this interaction was mediated by the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Here we report data suggesting that the major autophosphorylation site of FAK (Tyr-397) is the binding site for the SH2 domains of p85 in vitro and is also required for the association of FAK with PI 3-kinase in vivo. We also show that Tyr-397 is responsible for the increased FAK:PI 3-kinase association upon PDGF stimulation. implying that no additional site of FAK was involved in its binding to PI 3-kinase after PDGF stimulation.

Moreover. every resident cell within the heart. great vessels. bladder. gut or lung routinely experiences large periodic stretches. As an acute response to such stretches the cytoskeleton can stiffen. increase traction forces and reinforce. as reported by some. or can soften and fluidize. as reported more recently by our laboratory. but in any given circumstance it remains unknown which response might prevail or why. Using a novel nanotechnology. we show here that in loading conditions expected in most physiological circumstances the localized reinforcement response fails to scale up to the level of homogeneous cell stretch; fluidization trumps reinforcement. Whereas the reinforcement response is known to be mediated by upstream mechanosensing and downstream signaling. results presented here show the fluidization response to be altogether novel: it is a direct physical effect of mechanical force acting upon a structural lattice that is soft and fragile. Cytoskeletal softness and fragility. we argue. is consistent with early evolutionary adaptations of the eukaryotic cell to material properties of a soft inert microenvironment.,True,haAvNxEAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,252,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005486,17908189501690809958,/scholar?cites=17908189501690809958,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005486,0,0,0

Macrophage elasticity is modulated not only by classical biologic activators such as LPS and IFN-γ. but to an equal extent by substrate rigidity and substrate stretch. Macrophage elasticity is dependent upon actin polymerization and small rhoGTPase activation. but functional effects of elasticity are not predicted by examination of gene expression profiles alone.

We have shown recently that in response to a transient stretch the adherent eukaryotic cell promptly fluidizes and then gradually resolidifies. but mechanism is not yet understood.  Principal Findings In the isolated human bladder smooth muscle cell. here we applied a 10% transient stretch while measuring cell traction forces. elastic modulus. F-actin imaging and the F-actin/G-actin ratio. Immediately after a transient stretch. F-actin levels and cell stiffness were lower by about 50%. and traction forces were lower by about 70%. both indicative of prompt fluidization. Within 5min. F-actin levels recovered completely. cell stiffness recovered by about 90%. and traction forces recovered by about 60%. all indicative of resolidification. The extent of the fluidization response was uninfluenced by a variety of signaling inhibitors. and. surprisingly. was localized to the unstretch phase of the stretch-unstretch maneuver in a manner suggestive of cytoskeletal catch bonds. When we applied an “unstretch-restretch” (transient compression). rather than a “stretch-unstretch” (transient stretch). the cell did not fluidize and the actin network did not depolymerize.

While it is well established that stress fibers are mechanosensitive structures. physical mechanisms by which they assemble. align. and mature have remained elusive. Here we show that arcs. which serve as precursors for ventral stress fibers. undergo lateral fusion during their centripetal flow to form thick actomyosin bundles that apply tension to focal adhesions at their ends. Importantly. this myosin II-derived force inhibits vectorial actin polymerization at focal adhesions through AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of VASP. and thereby halts stress fiber elongation and ensures their proper contractility. Stress fiber maturation additionally requires ADF/cofilin-mediated disassembly of non-contractile stress fibers. whereas contractile fibers are protected from severing. Taken together. these data reveal that myosin-derived tension precisely controls both actin filament assembly and disassembly to ensure generation and proper alignment of contractile stress fibers in migrating cells.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06126.001,True,haAvNxEAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,103,https://elifesciences.org/articles/06126,3537372431050341733,/scholar?cites=3537372431050341733,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/06126.pdf,0,0,0

It is often asserted that substrate thickness (as opposed to stiffness) plays a negligible role and therefore may be considered semi-infinite. This assertion has been recently challenged. but the characteristic length scale to consider in this regard is poorly understood. We show here that this characteristic length scale is the lateral cell size. As substrate thickness approaches the lateral dimension of the cell. the apparent stiffness of the substrate is amplified to levels much greater than the intrinsic stiffness of the substrate. This change in apparent stiffness is readily sensed by the cell. leading to changes in cell spreading area. stiffness. and contractile forces.

To support these diverse functions. mitochondria form an extensive network with smaller clusters that are able to move along microtubules aided by motor proteins. Mitochondria are also associated with the actin network. which is involved in cellular responses to various mechanical factors. In this review. we discuss mitochondrial structure and function in relation to the cytoskeleton and various mechanical factors influencing cell functions. We first summarize the morphological features of mitochondria with an emphasis on fission and fusion as well as how network properties govern function. We then review the relationship between the mitochondria and the cytoskeletal structures. including mechanical interactions. We also discuss how stretch and its dynamic pattern affect mitochondrial structure and function. Finally. we present preliminary data on how extracellular matrix stiffness influences mitochondrial morphology and ATP generation. We conclude by discussing the more general role that mitochondria may play in mechanobiology and how the mechanosensitivity of mitochondria may contribute to the development of several diseases and aging.

These findings highlight ASM remodeling processes that are innately out-of-equilibrium and dynamic. and bring to the forefront a striking intersection between topics in condensed matter physics and ASM cytoskeletal biology. By doing so. they place in a new light the role of enhanced ASM mass in airway hyper-responsiveness as well as in the failure of a deep inspiration to relax the asthmatic airway. These findings have established that (i) ASM length is equilibrated dynamically. not statically; (ii) ASM dynamics closely resemble physical features exhibited by so-called soft glassy materials; (iii) static force–length relationships fail to describe dynamically contracted ASM states; (iv) stretch …,True,haAvNxEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,65,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569904808000992,4985119515741065825,/scholar?cites=4985119515741065825,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2591927/,0,0,0

A recent study showed that enzymatic treatment with chondroitinase ABC causes a decrease in the maximum fluid load support of bovine articular cartilage in unconfined compression. The hypothesis of this study is that treatment with chondroitinase ABC will increase the friction coefficient of articular cartilage in stress relaxation.

Here we report prompt fluidization of a cell and dramatic acceleration of its remodeling dynamics when exposed to low intensity ultrasound. These physical changes are caused by very small strains (10−5) at ultrasonic frequencies (106 Hz). but are closely analogous to those caused by relatively large strains (10−1) at physiological frequencies (100 Hz). Moreover. these changes are reminiscent of rejuvenation and aging phenomena that are well-established in certain soft inert materials.

To elucidate mechanisms. we used cell mapping rheometry to measure traction forces in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells subjected to periodic uniaxial stretches. Onset of periodic stretch of 10% strain amplitude caused a fluidization response typified by attenuation of traction forces almost to zero. As periodic stretch continued. the prompt fluidization response was followed by a slow resolidification response typified by recovery of the traction forces. but now aligned along the axis perpendicular to the imposed stretch.

The proteins are adsorbed on hydrophilic silica and on hydrophobic methylated surfaces at different values of pH and ionic strength.

Two of these latices are hydrophobic. one being positively and the other negative charged; the third is a negatively charged hydrophilic latex. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were systematically studied by performing adsorption and electrophoresis experiments as a function of pH and ionic strength. and by using two IgGs which differ in isoelectric point. The affinity of the proteins for the hydrophobic latices was barely influenced by electrostatic interactions.

1089304,[26] Methods for studying protein adsorption,1999,Vladimir Hlady and Jos Buijs and Herbert P Jennissen,309,,,402-429,Academic Press,Proteins are interfacially active molecules; this is easily demonstrated by the spontaneous accumulation of proteins at interfaces. Protein is an amphoteric polyelectrolyte. Its amino acids have different characteristics; some are apolar and like to be buried inside the protein globule. whereas others are polar and charged and are often found on the outside protein surface. A strong. long-ranged electrostatic attraction between a charged adsorbent and oppositely charged amino acid side chains will lead to a significant free energy change favoring the adsorption process. In other cases. the interfacial activity of the protein may be driven by its marginal structural stability.

However. BMP-2 delivery in a conventional collagen scaffold necessitates a high dose to achieve an efficacious outcome. To lower its effective dose. we precomplexed BMP-2 with the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulfate (DS) or heparin (HP). prior to loading it into a hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel. In vitro release studies showed that BMP-2 precomplexed with DS or HP had a prolonged delivery compared to without GAG. BMP-2-DS complexes achieved a slightly faster release in the first 24 h than HP; however. both delivered BMP-2 for an equal duration. Analysis of the kinetic interaction between BMP-2 and DS or HP showed that HP had approximately 10 times higher affinity for BMP-2 than DS. yet it equally stabilized the protein. as determined by alkaline phosphatase activity. Ectopic bone formation assays at subcutaneous sites in rats demonstrated that HA hydrogel-delivered BMP-2 precomplexed with GAG induced twice the volume of bone compared with BMP-2 delivered uncomplexed to GAG.,True,chKlHF0AAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC,60,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078551,14031763972399260173,/scholar?cites=14031763972399260173,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078551,0,0,0

With regard to starch/non-starch hydrocolloid combinations. chemically modified starches receive much less attention than their native counterparts. despite their commercial and scientific value. The use of cross-linked waxy starches allows to treat the combined systems as dispersions of undisrupted. swollen granules. surrounded by the gum solution. This hypothesis was verified by using confocal scanning laser microscopy with fluorescently labeled gums. The average swollen granule sizes were derived by laser light scattering. and the corresponding total volume fraction occupied by the swollen starch (Φ) was calculated.

There is still however. considerable ambiguity throughout the scientific literature regarding the mechanistic role(s) of cytokines in this context. thereby warranting a comprehensive in vitro investigation into how different cytokines may cause dysregulation of adherens and tight junctions leading to BBB permeabilization.  Methods The present study employs human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMvECs) to compare/contrast the effects of TNF-α and IL-6 on BBB characteristics ranging from the expression of interendothelial junction proteins (VE-cadherin. occludin and claudin-5) to endothelial monolayer permeability. The contribution of cytokine-induced NADPH oxidase activation to altered barrier phenotype was also investigated.  Results In response to treatment with either TNF-α or IL-6 (0–100 ng/ml. 0–24 hrs). our studies consistently demonstrated significant dose- and time-dependent decreases in the expression of all interendothelial junction proteins examined. in parallel with dose- and time-dependent increases in ROS generation and HBMvEC permeability.

TRAIL is expressed by numerous cell types including vascular cells. immune cells and adipocytes. Although originally thought to induce apoptosis in malignant or transformed cells only. it is now known that TRAIL can bind up to 5 distinct receptors to activate complex signalling pathways. and is capable of exerting pleiotropic effects in non-transformed cells. In this respect. a number of clinical and animal studies point to the potential vasoprotective influence of TRAIL. with TRAIL deficiency being linked to accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. Moreover. exogenous TRAIL administration has been shown to exhibit anti-atherosclerotic activity in-vivo.

Release of functional TM from the endothelium surface into plasma has also been reported. Much is still unknown however about how endothelial TM is regulated by physiologic hemodynamic forces (and particularly cyclic strain) intrinsic to endothelial-mediated vascular homeostasis.  Methods This study employed human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to investigate the effects of equibiaxial cyclic strain (7.5%. 60 cycles/min. 24 hrs). and to a lesser extent. laminar shear stress (10 dynes/cm2. 24 hrs). on TM expression and release. Time-. dose- and frequency-dependency studies were performed.  Results Our initial studies demonstrated that cyclic strain strongly downregulated TM expression in a p38- and receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. This was in contrast to the upregulatory effect of shear stress. Moreover. both forces significantly upregulated TM release over a 48 hr period. With continuing focus on the cyclic strain-induced TM release. we noted both dose (0–7.5%) and frequency (0.5–2.0 Hz) dependency. with no attenuation of strain-induced TM release observed following inhibition of MAP kinases (p38.

Accessibility. sensitivity. and specificity are significant factors in biomarker suitability. New biomarkers continue to be discovered. and questions over appropriate selection and assessment of their usefulness remain. If traditional markers of inflammation are not sufficiently robust in their specificity. then perhaps alternative means of detection may provide more information. Epigenetic drift (epigenetic modifications as they occur as a direct function with age). and its ancillary elements. including platelets. secreted microvesicles (MVs). and microRNA (miRNA). may hold enormous predictive potential. The majority of epigenetic drift observed in blood is independent of variations in blood cell composition. addressing concerns affecting traditional blood-based biomarker efficacy. MVs are found in plasma and other biological fluids in healthy individuals. Altered MV/miRNA profiles may also be found in individuals with various diseases.

Due to their robust operations and the ease of fabrication. tremendous microfluidic systems have been developed with the multiple microvalves for higher throughput and extended functionalities. Therefore. operation performance of the microvalves in the integrated microfluidic devices is crucial to the related applications. in fields such as micro-flows. cell analyses. drug discovery. and physical/chemical detections. It has been reported that operation performance of the microvalves are highly sensitive to the device configuration and pressurization scheme. This implies the further development of integrated microfluidics with a larger number of the valves may suffer the problems of undetermined microvalve behaviors during operations. which can become an unavoidable hurdle in the device design and optimization processes.

This conclusion is based primarily on in vitro kinetic experiments using relatively low concentrations of profilin (1–5 μm). However. the cell contains actin regulatory proteins with multiple profilin binding sites that potentially can attract millimolar concentrations of profilin to areas requiring rapid actin filament turnover. We have studied the effects of higher concentrations of profilin (10–100 μm) on actin monomer kinetics at the barbed end.

We now show that latrunculin A. a marine natural product that inhibits actin polymerization. arrests polylysine-induced nucleation at the level of an antiparallel dimer. resulting in its accumulation. These dimers. when composed of pyrene-labeled actin subunits. give rise to a fluorescent excimer. permitting detection during polymerizationin vitro. We report the crystallographic structure of the polylysine-actin-latrunculin A complex at 3.5-Å resolution. The non-crystallographic contact is consistent with a dimeric structure and confirms the antiparallel orientation of its subunits.

These proteins define a new family of actin-binding proteins. They bind G-actin in a 1:1 complex with thermodynamic and kinetic parameters similar to β-thymosins. Like β-thymosins. they slow down nucleotide exchange on G-actin and make a ternary complex with G-actin and Latrunculin A.

We now present evidence for the existence of two actin-binding sites that not only mutually compete but also specifically compete with the actin-binding proteins thymosin β4 and actobindin to bind to actin.

Profilin is one of the most important actin‐binding proteins; it regulates actin polymerization and interacts with many cytoskeletal proteins that link actin to extracellular membrane. The molecular mechanism of profilin has been extensively considered and debated in the literature for over two decades.

Analysis of Tmod3 effects on kinetics of actin polymerization and steady state monomer levels revealed that Tmod3. unlike previously characterized tropomodulins. sequesters actin monomers with an affinity similar to its affinity for capping pointed ends. Furthermore. Tmod3 is found bound to actin in high speed supernatant cytosolic extracts. suggesting that Tmod3 can bind to monomers in the context of other cytosolic monomer binding proteins.

Our recent studies revealed that thymosin β4 affects actin critical concentration and forms a ternary complex with actin and profilin. The consequences of this complex formation can be very significant. Our new data demonstrate that it is likely that profilin affects binding of thymosin β4 to actin in the ternary complex through allosteric changes in actin rather than through competition for the binding site. The N‐ and C‐terminal thymosin β4 helices are known to be unstructured in aqueous solution and to adopt helical conformation in organic solvents or upon binding to actin.

Magnetic capture is validated in highly viscous fluids. such as bovine synovial fluid (η~ 1 Pa·s). A first-order theoretical model has been developed to predict the particle motion. as well as a numerical multiphysics model. Both models exhibit good agreement with in vitro experimental magnetic collection results. The velocity of the magnetic particles is shown to be inversely proportional to fluid viscosity. and two magnetic structures are compared in term of collection efficiency: a cylindrical Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet and a laser-machined conical Nd-Fe-B permanent magnet.,True,Z-MCs1AAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7056672/,16871494977414029397,/scholar?cites=16871494977414029397,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandra_Garraud/publication/261854172_Collection_of_magnetic_particles_from_synovial_fluid_using_Nd-Fe-B_micromagnets/links/0deec5363da0a46fcb000000.pdf,0,0,0

The Japanese journal of anesthesiology,7,1005-1009,,Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) involves many factors for generating free radicals. It is difficult to detect free radical directly in clinical situations. Vitamin E is recognized as an intrinsic radical scavenger. We examined the change of vitamin E level to prove indirectly the evidence of free radical generation during CPB. Moreover. we investigated the effect of ulinastatin on the free radical during CPB by determining the vitamin E level. Twenty patients who received cardiac surgery were divided into the membrane oxygenator group and the bubble oxygenator group. In each group. five patients received 12.000 units. kg-1 of ulinastatin 15 min after starting CPB. Blood samples were obtained 15 min after starting CPB and 15 min after reperfusion of coronary artery. In the bubble oxygenator group without ulinastatin. vitamin E level at reperfusion phase decreased significantly compared with that at the start of CPB. In the bubble oxygenator group with ulinastatin. vitamin E level at reperfusion phase showed no decrease compared with the level at the start of CPB. In the membrane oxygenator group. there was no significant change in vitamin E level. Therefore. we suspect that a decrease of vitamin E during CPB with bubble oxygenator demonstrates the evidence of free radical generation and these results suggest that ulinastatin may scavenge free radicals during CPB.,True,ZCxtEbwAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC,57,https://europepmc.org/article/med/7637174,2571987618531292614,/scholar?cites=2571987618531292614,,,0,0,0

We have now cloned and characterized two additional members of the ras gene subfamily in Dictyostelium. rasC and rasS. These genes are developmentally regulated and unlike the previously isolated Dictyostelium ras genes. maximum levels of their transcripts were detected during aggregation. suggesting that the encoded proteins have distinct functions during aggregation. The rasC cDNA encodes a 189 amino acid protein that is 65% identical to the Dictyostelium RasD and RasG proteins and 56% identical to the human H-Ras protein. The predicted 194 amino acid gene product encoded by rasS is 60% identical to the Dictyostelium RasD and RasG proteins and 54% identical to the human H-Ras protein. Whereas RasD. RasG. RasB and Rap1 are totally conserved in their putative effector domains relative to H-Ras. RasC and RasS have single amino acid substitutions in their effector domains. consistent with the idea that they have unique functions. In RasC. aspartic acid-38 has been replaced by asparagine (D38N). and in RasS. isoleucine-36 has been replaced by leucine (I36L). In addition. both proteins have several differences in the effector-proximal domain. a domain which is believed to play a role in Ras target activation.

Therefore. antioxidant treatment may alleviate age-related impairment in spatial memory. Cognitive impairment could also involve the agerelated morphological alterations of the hippocampal formation. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the effects of deprenyl. an irreversible monoamine-oxidase B inhibitor. on spatial memory by oxidant stress and on the total number of neurons in the hippocampus CA1 region of aged male rats. In this study. 24-month-old male rats were used. Rats were divided into control and experimental groups which received an injection of deprenyl for 21 days. Learning experiments were performed for six days in the Morris water maze. Spatial learning was significantly better in deprenyl-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats. Deprenyl treatment elicited a significant decrease of lipid peroxidation in the prefrontal cortex. striatum and hippocampus regions and a significant increase of glutathione peroxidase activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. It was observed that deprenyl had no effect on superoxide dismutase activity. The total number of neurons in the hippocampus CA1 region was significantly higher in the deprenyl group than in the control group. In conclusion. we demonstrated that deprenyl increases spatial memory performance in aged male rats and this increase may be related to suppression of lipid peroxidation and alleviation of the age-related decrease of the number of neurons in the hippocampus. The results of such studies may be useful in pharmacological alleviation of …,True,Dyh19_AAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,48,http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/55/55_205.pdf,2083674331992315591,/scholar?cites=2083674331992315591,,http://www.biomed.cas.cz/physiolres/pdf/55/55_205.pdf,0,0,0

It is generally accepted that ASD is caused by abnormalities in the structure or functions of the brain. Recent genome-wide analyses have identified copy number variations (CNVs) of neuronal genes in the genomes of ASD patients. CNV is a commonly observed phenomenon in human beings. During the first cell division of meiosis. irregular crossing over between homologous chromosomes results in loss or duplication of a segment. From 2007 to 2010. several groups performed a large-scale virtual screening of CNVs in ASD genomes. Genes affected by CNV. de novo CNVs. and rare CNVs were more prevalent in ASD. The results highlighted the CNVs of many neuronal genes associated with ASD. A fraction of these genes was previously identified in ASD but some were newly identified in each study. The CNVs implicated in ASD include neuronal genes belonging to 4 classes. These genes encode (1) neural adhesion molecules. including cadherins. neuroligin. and neurexin;(2) scaffold proteins such as SHANK3;(3) protein kinases and other intracellular signaling molecules; and (4) proteins that regulate protein syntheses. In general. these proteins play a role in synapse of glutamatergic neurons. The CNVs detected in the ASD patient genomes of imply a link between the synaptic proteins and pathological characteristics of ASD. Altered protein dosage by the CNVs may alter the functional quality of ASD patient's synapses. and may consequently affect their development of language and communication skills.

In this work. poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-block-polystyrene (PNIPAAm-b-PS) brushes were prepared via surface-initiated consecutive atom-transfer radical polymerization on initiator-immobilized silicon. Because of the inherent thermosensitivity of PNIPAAm and the hydrophobicity difference between the two blocks. the modified surfaces were responsive to both temperature and solvent. Moreover. the diblock copolymer brushes exhibited both resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption and unique cell interaction properties.

Herein. we report a paper-based nucleic acid hybridization assay using immobilized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as donors in luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET). UCNPs with intense green emission served as donors with Cy3 dye as the acceptor.

Introduction of unlabeled oligonucleotide targets resulted in a formation of probe-target duplexes. A subsequent hybridization of Cy3 labeled reporter with the remaining single stranded portion of target brought the Cy3 dye in close proximity to the UCNPs to trigger a LRET-sensitized emission from the acceptor dye. The hybridization assays provided a limit of detection (LOD) of 146.0 fmol and exhibited selectivity for one base pair mismatch discrimination. The assay was functional even in undiluted serum samples. This work embodies important progress in developing DNA hybridization assays on paper.

CA (USA),Unlike a genetic map which provides information on the relative position of genes or markers based upon the frequency of genetic recombination. a physical map provides a topographical picture of DNA. ie distances in base pairs between landmarks. The landmarks may be genes. gene markers. anonymous sequences. or cloned DNA fragments. Perhaps the most useful type of physical map is one that consists of an overlapping set of cloned DNA fragments (contigs) that span the chromosome. Once genes are assigned to this contig map. sequencing of the genomic DNA can be prioritized to complete the most interesting regions first. While. in practice. complete coverage of a complex genome in recombinant clones may not be possible to achieve. many gaps in a clone map may be closed by using multiple cloning vectors or uncloned large DNA fragments such as those separated by electrophoretic methods. Human chromosome 19 contains about 60 million base pairs of DNA and represents about 2% of the haploid genome.

We also show that H3.3 combines with H3 acetylation and K4 methylation to form a stable mark that persists during mitosis. Our results suggest that H3.3 is deposited principally through the action of chromatin‐remodelling complexes associated with transcriptional initiation. with deposition mediated by RNA polymerase II elongation having only a minor role.,True,S1NVBKIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,199,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/sj.embor.7400366,13085948278737019584,/scholar?cites=13085948278737019584,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/sj.embor.7400366,0,0,0

We have isolated αTT from a partial plasmid library. using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii α-tubulin gene as a probe. This gene as well as the two β-tubulin genes. βTT1 and βTT2. have been sequenced. None of these genes contains introns and all use TGA as the stop codon. In the coding region of the two β-tubulin genes. there are several TAA and TAG stop codons that probably code for glutamine. The codon usage is very biased. Regions flanking the tubulin coding sequences are A + T-rich (75%) and quite different among themselves. In these regions there are several putative transcription-regulatory sequences. Nuclear transcripts begin and terminate at multiple sites.

The Vif of HIV-1 overcomes the innate antiviral activity of a cytidine deaminase Apobec3G (CEM15) that induces G to A hypermutation in the viral genome. resulting in enhancement of viral replication infectivity. Here. we have developed a minimal scaffold VH fragment with intrabody properties derived from anti-Vif single-chain antibody that was engineered to mimic camelid antibody domains. Non-specific binding of VH by its interface for the light chain variable domain (VL) was prevented through amino acid mutations in framework 2 and 4 (Val37F. G44E. L45R. W47G and W103R).

However. testing for high glycemia often requires invasive and painful blood testing. limiting its large-scale applicability. We have combined new. unpublished data with published data comparing salivary glucose levels in type 2 DM patients and controls and/or looked at the correlation between salivary glucose and glycemia/HbA1c to systematically review the effectiveness of salivary glucose to estimate glycemia and HbA1c. We further discuss salivary glucose as a biomarker for large-scale screening of diabetes or developing type 2 DM.  Methods and Findings We conducted a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed published articles that reported data regarding mean salivary glucose levels and/or correlation between salivary glucose levels and glycemia or HbA1c for type 2 DM and non-diabetic individuals and combined them with our own unpublished results. Our global meta-analysis of standardized mean differences on salivary glucose levels shows an overall large positive effect of type 2 DM over salivary glucose (Hedge's g = 1.37). The global correlation coefficient (r) between salivary glucose and glycemia was large (r = 0.49). with subgroups ranging from medium (r = 0.30 in non-diabetics) to very large (r = 0.67 in diabetics). Meta-analysis of the global correlation between salivary glucose and HbA1c showed an overall association of medium strength (r = 0.37).

This protein is essential for viral replication in vivo and for productive infection of nonpermissive cells. such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Vif counteracts an antiretroviral cellular factor in nonpermissive cells named CEM15/APOBEC3G. Although HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Vif protein (Vif1) can be functionally replaced by HIV-2 Vif protein (Vif2). its identity is very small. Most of the functional studies have been carried out with Vif1. Characterization of functional domains of Vif2 may elucidate its function. as well as differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infectivity.

The variation in the levels of α and β‐tubulin mRNAs was analyzed by Northern‐blot hybridization using homologous genomic probes (αTT and βTT1). The results obtained show that heat shock induces a drastic and coordinate reduction in the amount of α and β‐tubulin mRNAs isolated from polysomes.

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels have raised special interest for this application due to their biocompatibility. high swelling capacity and chemical stability. In this work. the effect of post-processing treatments (annealing. high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and gamma-radiation) on the performance of PVA gels obtained by cast-drying was investigated and. their ability to be used as delivery vehicles of the anti-inflammatories diclofenac or ketorolac was evaluated. HHP damaged the hydrogels. breaking some bonds in the polymeric matrix. and therefore led to poor mechanical and tribological properties. The remaining treatments. in general. improved the performance of the materials. increasing their crystallinity. Annealing at 150 C generated the best mechanical and tribological results: higher resistance to compressive and tensile loads. lower friction coefficients and ability to support higher loads in sliding movement. This material was loaded with the anti-inflammatories. both without and with vitamin E (Vit. E) or Vit. E+ cetalkonium chloride (CKC). Vit. E+ CKC helped to control the release of the drugs which occurred in 24 h.

However. the molecular mechanisms underlying the insulin secretion are unclear. Improving our understanding of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) mechanisms under normal conditions is a prerequisite for developing better interventions against diabetes.

The AT1 receptor is a seven-transmembrane (7TM) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) mediating the majority of the physiological functions of AngII. The AT1R mediates its effects through both G protein-dependent and independent signaling. which can be separated by functionally selective agonists. In the present study we investigate the effect of AngII and the β-arrestin biased agonist [SII]AngII on ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat hearts. Isolated hearts mounted in a Langendorff perfused rat heart preparations showed that preconditioning with [SII]AngII reduced the infarct size induced by global ischemia from 46±8.4% to 22±3.4%.

The angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1aR) is one of the most studied 7TMRs with respect to selective activation of the β-arrestin dependent signalling. Two complimentary global phosphoproteomics studies have analyzed the complex signalling induced by the AT1aR. Here we integrate the data sets from these studies and perform a joint analysis using a novel method for prediction of differential kinase activity from phosphoproteomics data. The method builds upon NetworKIN. which applies sophisticated linear motif analysis in combination with contextual network modelling to predict kinase-substrate associations with high accuracy and sensitivity. These predictions form the basis for subsequently nonparametric statistical analysis to identify likely activated kinases. This suggested that AT1aR-dependent signalling activates 48 of the 285 kinases detected in HEK293 cells. Of these. Aurora B. CLK3 and PKG1 have not previously been described in the pathway whereas others. such as PKA. PKB and PKC. are well known.

The opioidergic system plays an important role in regulation of reward circuits that may be produced via dopamine-dependent mechanisms. It has been suggested that the dopaminergic system of the nucleus accumbens is necessary in conditioned place preference (CPP). The aim of this study is. therefore. to test if cholestasis can alter the reward system and the involvement of opioidergic and dopaminergic systems in this phenomenon.METHODS: We used CPP and hole-board paradigms to measure the reward effect and exploratory behaviors. respectively. in mice. Cholestasis was induced by ligation of the main bile duct. using two ligatures and transecting the duct between them (BDL mice).RESULTS: The data showed that morphine (1 and 2 mg/kg). sulpiride (80 mg/kg) and SKF38393 (20 mg/kg) produced CPP. while naloxone (1 mg/kg) and SCH23390 (1mg/kg) produced conditioned place aversion (CPA). whereas quinpirole had no effect in sham-operated mice.

Molecular-genetic analyses have implicated gap junctions – key mediators of cell-cell communication – in carcinogenesis. We recently showed that the resting voltage potential of distant cell groups is a key determinant of metastatic transformation and tumor induction. Here. we show in the Xenopus laevis model that gap junctional communication (GJC) is a modulator of the long-range bioelectric signaling that regulates tumor formation. Genetic disruption of GJC taking place within tumors. within remote host tissues. or between the host and tumors – significantly lowers the incidence of tumors induced by KRAS mutations. The most pronounced suppression of tumor incidence was observed upon GJC disruption taking place farther away from oncogene-expressing cells. revealing a role for GJC in distant cells in the control of tumor growth. In contrast. enhanced GJC communication through the overexpression of wild-type connexin Cx26 increased tumor incidence. Our data confirm a role for GJC in tumorigenesis. and reveal that this effect is non-local. Based on these results and on published data on movement of ions through GJs. we present a quantitative model linking the GJC coupling and bioelectrical state of cells to the ability of oncogenes to initiate tumorigenesis. When integrated with data on endogenous bioelectric signaling during left-right patterning. the model predicts differential tumor incidence outcomes depending on the spatial configurations of gap junction paths relative to tumor location and major anatomical body axes …,True,1DhF27MAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,54,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00519/full,8792408135618664275,/scholar?cites=8792408135618664275,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00519/full,0,0,0

The ability to express exogenous mRNA or introduce morpholinos into cleavage-stage Xenopus embryos has allowed gain-and loss-of-function experiments that reveal molecular-genetic control of development and regeneration. However. injection of mRNAs into cleavage-stage embryos provides limited spatio-temporal control: It is difficult to limit targeting to small regions (eg. inducing foci of expression) and the fate map does not facilitate targeting some tissues. such as those of the tail.

We describe a previously unknown mode of regulation of DNMT1 protein stability through the coordinated action of an array of DNMT1-associated proteins. DNMT1 was destabilized by acetylation by the acetyltransferase Tip60. which triggered ubiquitination by the E3 ligase UHRF1. thereby targeting DNMT1 for proteasomal degradation. In contrast. DNMT1 was stabilized by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and the deubiquitinase HAUSP (herpes virus–associated ubiquitin-specific protease). Analysis of the abundance of DNMT1 and Tip60. as well as the association between HAUSP and DNMT1. suggested that during the cell cycle the initiation of DNMT1 degradation was coordinated with the end of DNA replication and the need for DNMT activity.

1089706,Effect of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn on proliferation of progenitor cells in mice with bone marrow depression,2005,陈东辉,11,高技术通讯: 英文版,4,443-448,, AIM: To study the effect of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn on the proliferation and hematonic mechanism of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn. Methods: The techniques of culture of hematopoietic cell and hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) assay were used. The method of semi-solid culture with methylcellulose of CFU-GM. CFU-E. BFU-E.CFU-Meg was adopted in bone marrow depressed mice which treated with Spatholobus suberectus Dunn for a long time. Results: Spatholobus suberectus Dunn could obviously promote the proliferation of bone marrow cells and spleen lymphocytes in healthy and anaemic mice. The culture medium of spleen cell. macrophage. lung and skeletal muscle treated with Spatholobus suberectus Dunn had much stronger stimulating effects on hematopoietic cells. The numbers of CFU-GM. CFU-E.BFU-E.CFU-Meg in bone marrow depressed mice were raised distinctly under the control of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn as compared with those of contrast group. Conclusions: Spatholobus suberectus Dunn may enhance hematopoiesis by stimulating directly and/or indirectly stroma cell in hematopoietic inductive microenvironment and muscle tissue to secrete some HGF (Epo. GM-CSF. IL. and MK-CSF). It can promote the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in anaemic mice. This is one of the biological mechanisms for hematonic effect of Spatholobus suberectus Dunn.,True,xeS5StwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7595109571701348278&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
