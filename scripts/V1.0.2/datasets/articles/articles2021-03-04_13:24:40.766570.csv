1137966,Pesticides and conservation of natural enemies in pest management,1998,John Ruberson and Hisashi Nemoto and Yoshimi Hirose,,,,207-220,Academic Press,Pesticides have long overshadowed the importance of natural enemies in pest management programs. The high efficacy. easy accessibility. and consistent performance of chemical controls have made them the tool of choice for growers in managing their pest problems. But frequent outbreaks of secondary pests after pesticide applications and the increasing prevalence of pesticide resistance in various pests have pointed out the risks of unilateral reliance on pesticides. Although pesticides and natural enemies have often been viewed as incompatible. there are many opportunities to integrate these two elements in comprehensive pest management programs. and this trend is likely to increase substantially in the future. In the pesticide industry. there is a growing emphasis on developing pesticides that have minimal environmental impact and exhibit greater natural enemy selectivity. Similarly …,True,urn2GY8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,163,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120781478500578,9982633048886879622,/scholar?cites=9982633048886879622,,,0,0,0

Numerous factors influence plants’ growth. defense. reproduction. and survival. One critical factor in plant life histories and subsequent trophic levels is nitrogen (N). Because of its importance to plant productivity. N is one of the most frequently used anthropogenic fertilizers in agricultural production and can exert a variety of bottom-up effects and potentially significantly alter tritrophic interactions through various mechanisms. In this paper. the potential effects of N on tritrophic interactions are reviewed. First. in plant-herbivore interactions.

The plants possess a wide range of direct and indirect resistance mechanisms against herbivorous arthropods. Direct resistance mechanisms include morphological traits such as trichomes and a range of secondary metabolites. The best known insecticidal compounds are the terpenoid gossypol and its precursors and related compounds. Indirect resistance mechanisms include herbivore-induced volatiles and extrafloral nectaries that allow plants to attract and sustain natural enemy populations.

1137986,Effect of selected insecticides on natural enemies in cotton: laboratory studies,1999,JR Ruberson and PG Tillman and P Dugger and D Richter,,Proceedings of the Beltwide Cotton Conferences,,1210-1213,Memphis TN,Conserving natural enemies can provide economic benefit to growers. as natural enemies help to reduce pest populations. Using selective insecticides (those insecticides which mainly target pest species) can conserve populations of natural enemies. We evaluated the toxicity of several insecticides (Karate. Tracer. Steward. S-1812) to selected key natural enemies (green lacewing. Chrysoperla rufilabris; big-eyed bug. Geocoris punctipes; insidiosus flower bug. Orius insidiosus; Trichogramma pretiosum; Cotesia marginiventris) in residual assays. The purpose of this study was to determine if any of the insecticides exhibited low toxicity to the natural enemies tested. Karate and Tracer were generally more toxic to the natural enemies than were the other compounds. although the degree of this difference was quite variable. Steward and S-1812 exhibited good to excellent selectivity to natural enemies. although S-1812 had some toxic effects on Trichogramma pretiosum and Orius insidiosus. Tracer exhibited marginal to good selectivity. but was quite toxic to Trichogramma pretiosum and moderately toxic to Cotesia marginiventris. Tracer is currently a valuable IPM tool because of its selectivity. but does have some toxic effects on parasitoids. at least at the rate tested here. Steward and S-1812 also hold considerable promise as IPM tools as they exhibit good levels of selectivity.Technical Abstract: We evaluated the toxicity of several insecticides (Karate. Tracer.

Foraging is ultimately a nutrient consumption exercise. but the effect of seasonality per se on changes in foraging behavior. particularly as it relates to nutrient regulation. is poorly understood. Here. we show that field-collected fire ant colonies. returned to the laboratory and maintained under identical photoperiod. temperature. and humidity regimes. and presented with experimental foods that had different protein (p) to carbohydrate (c) ratios. practice summer- and fall-specific foraging behaviors with respect to protein-carbohydrate regulation. Summer colonies increased the amount of food collected as the p:c ratio of their food became increasingly imbalanced. but fall colonies collected similar amounts of food regardless of the p:c ratio of their food. Choice experiments revealed that feeding was non-random. and that both fall and summer ants preferred carbohydrate-biased food. However. ants rarely ate all the food they collected. and their cached or discarded food always contained little carbohydrate relative to protein. From a nutrient regulation strategy. ants consumed most of the carbohydrate they collected. but regulated protein consumption to a similar level. regardless of season. We suggest that varied seasonal food collection behaviors and nutrient regulation strategies may be an adaptation that allows long-lived animals to meet current and future nutrient demands when nutrient-rich foods are abundant (e.g. spring and summer). and to conserve energy and be metabolically more efficient when nutritionally balanced foods are less abundant.,True,2uFow8MAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,41,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025407,1518635804031852882,/scholar?cites=1518635804031852882,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025407,0,0,0

Most often. this hypothesis has been tested using interspecific comparisons of dispersal capability and qualitative estimates of habitat persistence. Consequently. most assessments have failed to control for possible phylogenetic nonindependence and they also lack quantitative rigor. We capitalized on existing intraspecific variation in the dispersal capability of Prokelisia planthoppers to examine the relationship between habitat persistence and dispersal. thereby minimizing possible phylogenetic effects.

In particular. if predators are attracted to areas containing one prey species. another prey species may suffer greater predation if it occurs in the same areas. If the predator is omnivorous. this may occur even if one prey species is an animal and the other is a plant. We investigated the role of local dandelion densities on the impact of the predator Coleomegilla maculata on pea aphids in alfalfa fields. At small spatial scales. increased dandelion densities were associated with high C. maculata densities. presumably because these omnivorous ladybird beetles aggregated to pollen resources.

Field populations from non-Bt maize in 2012–2013 exhibited 18.8-fold to >85.4-fold resistance to purified Cry1F protein and those collected from unexpectedly damaged Bt maize plants at several locations in Florida and North Carolina had >85.4-fold resistance. In addition. reduced efficacy and control failure of Cry1F maize against natural populations of S. frugiperda were documented in field trials using Cry1F-based and pyramided Bt maize products in south Florida. The Cry1F-resistant S. frugiperda also showed a low level of cross-resistance to Cry1A.105 and related maize products. but not to Cry2Ab2 or Vip3A.

Insecticides. however. can cause unintended. adverse consequences for non-target organisms. Previous studies focused on the effects of pesticides on target and non-target pests. predatory arthropods. and concomitant ecological disruptions. Little research. however. has focused on the direct effects of insecticides on plants. Here we demonstrate that applications of neonicotinoid insecticides. one of the most important insecticide classes worldwide. suppress expression of important plant defense genes. alter levels of phytohormones involved in plant defense. and decrease plant resistance to unsusceptible herbivores. spider mites Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae). in multiple. distantly related crop plants.  Methodology/Principal Findings Using cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). corn (Zea mays) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants. we show that transcription of phenylalanine amonia lyase. coenzyme A ligase. trypsin protease inhibitor and chitinase are suppressed and concentrations of the phytohormone OPDA and salicylic acid were altered by neonicotinoid insecticides.

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize growers in the U.S. are required to plant structured non-Bt maize refuges. Concerns with refuge compliance led to the introduction of seed mixtures. also called RIB (refuge-in-the-bag). as an alternative approach for implementing refuge for Bt maize products in the U.S. Maize Belt. A major concern in RIB is cross-pollination of maize hybrids that can cause Bt proteins to be present in refuge maize kernels and negatively affect refuge insects. Here we show that a mixed planting of 5% nonBt and 95% Bt maize containing the SmartStax traits expressing Cry1A.105. Cry2Ab2 and Cry1F did not provide an effective refuge for an important above-ground ear-feeding pest. the corn earworm. Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). Cross-pollination in RIB caused a majority (>90%) of refuge kernels to express ≥ one Bt protein. The contamination of Bt proteins in the refuge ears reduced neonate-to-adult survivorship of H. zea to only 4.6%. a reduction of 88.1% relative to larvae feeding on ears of pure non-Bt maize plantings.

Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). is a major pest of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize and cotton in the US Reduced efficacy of Bt plants expressing Cry1 and Cry2 against H. zea has been reported in some areas of the US In this study. we evaluated the occurrence and ear damage of H. zea on transgenic Bt maize expressing Cry proteins or a combination of Vip3A and Cry proteins in the field in Texas in 2018. We found that the occurrence of H. zea larvae and the viable kernel damage area on the ear were not different between non-Bt maize and Bt maize expressing Cry1A. 105+ Cry2Ab2 and Cry1Ab+ Cry1F proteins. A total of 67.5% of the pyramided Bt maize expressing Cry1Ab+ Cry1F+ Vip3A was damaged by 2nd–4th instar larvae of H. zea. Diet bioassays showed that the resistance ratio against Vip3Aa51 for H. zea obtained from Cry1Ab+ Cry1F+ Vip3A maize was 20.4 compared to a field population collected from Cry1F+ Cry1A. 105+ Cry2Ab2 maize.

1138080,The evolution of inflorescence size in Asclepias (Asclepiadaceae),1977,Mary F Willson and Peter W Price,,Evolution,,495-511,Society for the Study of Evolution,Larger inflorescences usually received more pollen than smaller inflorescences. and had a higher average rate of insect visitation. but only sometimes produced more mature pods. Mortality of developing pods of several (but not all) species was greatest in inflorescences that initiated larger numbers of young pods. suggesting 'brood reduction' and competition among young fruits for parental expenditure. We suggest that inflorescence size may not have evolved primarily as a result of capacity to produce pods but rather the capacity to contribute pollen. Each plant is both mother and father. but each parental role has had different effects on the evolution of the total floral display in Asclepias. and we suggest that the allocation of investment to each parental role may vary with the plant's budget of energy and nutrients.

1138082,Rapid herbivore growth enhances enemy attack: sublethal plant defenses remain a paradox,1987,Karen M Clancy and Peter W Price,68,Ecology,3,733-737,Ecological Society of America,Plant traits that impair herbivore growth rates (ie. exert sublethal effects) present a paradox in understanding plant-herbivore interactions (Price et al. 1980). Phytophagous insects feeding on plants with low nutritive quality. low digestibility (eg. high cellulose or lignin content). or digestibility-reducers (eg. tannins) show strong tendencies to compensate through increased consumption of plant tissue (Feeny 1970. Barton Browne 1975. Slansky and Feeny 1977. Moran and Hamilton 1980. Price et al. 1980). Thus. herbivores can be expected to cause more per capita damage on plants with these traits than on plants without sublethal or other types of defenses. Low nutritive quality is unlikely to be an effective plant defense against insect herbivores in many cases (Moran and Hamilton 1980). However. the paradox is resolved if sublethal plant defenses result in prolonged development times for insect larvae. which. in tum …,True,PDbR4tAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,357,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1938479,13779618351286731314,/scholar?cites=13779618351286731314,,,0,0,0

The oviposition preference hierarchy of Euura lasiolepis. a shoot—galling sawfly. for plant shoots of different lengths strongly corresponded with the rank of shoot lengths for larval survival.

Euura lasiolepis. on the growth and branch age structure of the arroyo willow. Salix lasiolepis. Normally. as willows age they become less susceptible to galling. but heavy Euura galling maintains willows at a young. relatively susceptible juvenile stage. The Euura form more galls and long shoots. Long shoots are found on clones with young branches. Heavy galling stunts or kills growth distal to the gall. stimulating sprouting by indefinitely dormant buds located near branch bases. The resulting young branches keep the clone susceptible to further galling. In contrast. increasing branch age of lightly galled clones confers resistance to galling.

1138104,Street tree diversity in eastern North America and its potential for tree loss to exotic borers,2006,Michael J Raupp and Anne Buckelew Cumming and Erin C Raupp,,,,,,In light of catastrophic tree losses caused by Dutch elm disease. foresters recommended that the urban forest be diversified. The intent was to create a more sustainable urban forest that would not be decimated by a single pathogen or insect pest. However. recent introductions of deadly borers such as Asian longhorned beetle and emerald ash borer reveal that new introductions can have disastrous consequences for urban forests. An analysis of tree inventories from 12 cities in eastern North America reveals an overabundance of certain genera of trees such as Acer and Fraxinus. Introduced pests with broad host ranges such as the Asian longhorned beetle may be capable of killing or forcing intervention on large numbers of trees. Even cities that have diversified at a low taxonomic level (cultivar or species) may suffer greatly from the depredations of insect pests such as the emerald ash borer that specialize on plants at the generic level. Generalists capable of feeding on plants in several families will create problems for urban forests even when attempts have been made to diversify at higher taxonomic levels. Urban foresters should avoid planting susceptible taxa of trees. especially in cities that are overstocked in these taxa. and consider diversifying greatly the types of trees in cities.,True,LBpAB_QAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,210,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/27863,11151380011529650436,/scholar?cites=11151380011529650436,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/27863/PDF,0,0,0

An effort to remove an alien beetle from Central Park in New York City. USA. resulted in widespread treatments of trees with the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid. Imidacloprid's systemic activity and mode of entry via roots or trunk injections reduce risk of environmental contamination and limit exposure of non-target organisms to pesticide residues. However. unexpected outbreaks of a formerly innocuous herbivore. Tetranychus schoenei (Acari: Tetranychidae). followed imidacloprid applications to elms in Central Park. This undesirable outcome necessitated an assessment of imidacloprid's impact on communities of arthropods. its effects on predators. and enhancement of the performance of T. schoenei.   Methodology/Principal Findings By sampling arthropods in elm canopies over three years in two locations. we document changes in the structure of communities following applications of imidacloprid. Differences in community structure were mostly attributable to increases in the abundance of T. schoenei on elms treated with imidacloprid. In laboratory experiments. predators of T. schoenei were poisoned through ingestion of prey exposed to imidacloprid. Imidacloprid's proclivity to elevate fecundity of T. schoenei also contributed to their elevated densities on treated elms.   Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to report the effects of pesticide applications on the arthropod communities in urban landscapes and demonstrate that imidacloprid increases spider mite fecundity through a plant-mediated mechanism.

Insecticides. however. can cause unintended. adverse consequences for non-target organisms. Previous studies focused on the effects of pesticides on target and non-target pests. predatory arthropods. and concomitant ecological disruptions. Little research. however. has focused on the direct effects of insecticides on plants. Here we demonstrate that applications of neonicotinoid insecticides. one of the most important insecticide classes worldwide. suppress expression of important plant defense genes. alter levels of phytohormones involved in plant defense. and decrease plant resistance to unsusceptible herbivores. spider mites Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae). in multiple. distantly related crop plants.

Trees in residential landscapes that received three cover sprays annually for at least 4 years harbored a greater diversity of scale insect pests and were much more likely to be infested with scales than trees in landscapes treated with cover sprays for shorter periods of time. Oak (Quercus palustris) trees in an institutional landscape treated with residual insecticides harbored significantly lower numbers of beneficial arthropods than trees treated with a pesticide that lacked residual activity. The suppressive effect of the residual insecticides on natural enemies was pronounced on the community of parasitic wasps that attack the obscure scale (Melanaspis obscura). a common scale insect pest of oak. The effect of residual insecticides on individual wasp species persisted 4 weeks after the pesticides were applied.

We created a “phantom road” using an array of speakers to apply traffic noise to a roadless landscape. directly testing the effect of noise alone on an entire songbird community during autumn migration. Thirty-one percent of the bird community avoided the phantom road. For individuals that stayed despite the noise. overall body condition decreased by a full SD and some species showed a change in ability to gain body condition when exposed to traffic noise during migratory stopover. We conducted complementary laboratory experiments that implicate foraging-vigilance behavior as one mechanism driving this pattern.

We pit luna moths against big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and demonstrate a survival advantage of ∼47% for moths with tails versus those that had their tails removed. The benefit of hindwing tails is equivalent to the advantage conferred to moths by bat-detecting ears. Moth tails lured bat attacks to these wing regions during 55% of interactions between bats and intact luna moths. We analyzed flight kinematics of moths with and without hindwing tails and suggest that tails have a minimal role in flight performance.

If these networks have consistent properties. then studying the structure of well-understood networks could lead to extrapolation of these properties to others. including those that support emerging pathogens. Borrowing a quantitative measure of network structure from studies of mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators. we analyzed 29 ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks—including three derived from molecular bloodmeal analysis of mosquito feeding patterns—using measures of nestedness to identify non-random interactions among species. We found significant nestedness in ectoparasite-vertebrate host lists for habitats ranging from tropical rainforests to polar environments. These networks showed non-random patterns of nesting. and did not differ significantly from published estimates of nestedness from mutualistic networks. Mutualistic and antagonistic networks appear to be organized similarly. with generalized ectoparasites interacting with hosts that attract many ectoparasites and more specialized ectoparasites usually interacting with these same “generalized” hosts. This finding has implications for understanding the network dynamics of vector-born pathogens. We suggest that nestedness (rather than random ectoparasite-host associations) can allow rapid transfer of pathogens throughout a network. and expand upon such concepts as the dilution effect. bridge vectors. and host switching in the context of nested ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks.,True,R4rmXMEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,65,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007873,7140588882632312293,/scholar?cites=7140588882632312293,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007873,0,0,0

The biological mechanism underlying these shifts has been a matter of debate. with hypotheses falling into two camps: (1) the shift is driven by changes in host abundance. or (2) the shift is driven by seasonal changes in the foraging behavior of mosquitoes. Here we explored the idea that seasonal changes in host use by mosquitoes are driven by temporal patterns of host reproduction. We investigated the relationship between seasonal patterns of host use by mosquitoes and host reproductive phenology by examining a seven-year dataset of blood meal identifications from a site in Tuskegee National Forest. Alabama USA and data on reproduction from the most commonly utilized endothermic (white-tailed deer. great blue heron. yellow-crowned night heron) and ectothermic (frogs) hosts. Our analysis revealed that feeding on each host peaked during periods of reproductive activity. Specifically. mosquitoes utilized herons in the spring and early summer. during periods of peak nest occupancy. whereas deer were fed upon most during the late summer and fall. the period corresponding to the peak in births for deer.

To evaluate the Hellbender’s current status in Alabama. we verified several recent anecdotal sightings of Hellbenders. and conducted 355 person hours of surveys and 31 trap nights in most historical collection localities and at several additional sites that we considered suitable for this species. We failed to find any Hellbenders during our survey. If Hellbenders still exist in Alabama. they represent relict populations that occur in very low population densities. and likely will be extirpated from the state in the near future. The apparent decline and possible extirpation of Hellbenders in Alabama is probably related to degradation of habitat and water quality resulting from large scale impoundments and land use patterns.

Both species are highly associated with aquatic habitats. to the extent that at least one. the Red-bellied Mudsnake. has been described as “fully aquatic”(Lutterschmidt et al. 2006). Adults of both species have highly specialized diets: Red-bellied Mudsnakes feed primarily on aquatic. elongate. eellike salamanders (Sirens [Siren spp.. Pseudobranchus spp.] and Amphiumas [Amphiuma spp.]). while adult Rainbow Snakes feed almost exclusively on a stream-dwelling. catadromous fish. the American Eel (Anguilla rostrata; Neill 1964). Because Farancia are difficult to observe or study. we know little about their ecology and natural history; however. both species are known to undertake terrestrial movements. Our knowledge regarding terrestrial activity of these snakes is based largely on captures from drift fences surrounding Carolina bays (eg.

Similarly. natural enemies may increase the expression of inbreeding depression in their hosts. resulting in altered selection on host mating‐system evolution. To examine effects of inbreeding on tolerance to herbivory. we transplanted experimentally self‐ and cross‐fertilized plants into four field populations of Mimulus guttatus and applied single Philaenus spumarius (spittlebug) nymphs to half.

One process corresponds to the polarization of the mineral/water interface coating the surface of the grains. The other process corresponds to the Maxwell–Wagner polarization associated with accumulation of the electrical charges in the pore space of the composite medium. A model of low-frequency conductivity dispersion is proposed. This model is connected to a triple-layer model of electrochemical processes occurring at the surface of silica. This model accounts for the partition of the counterions between the Stern and the diffuse layers. The polarization of the mineral/water interface is modeled by the electrochemical polarization model of Schurr for a spherical grain.

One of the boundaries of the sample is submitted to a sharp pressure (or salinity change). The migration of the resulting pressure (or saline) front through the core specimen is responsible for the apparition of an electrical field. which is called the streaming potential (the diffusion potential for a salinity gradient. respectively). The temporal variation of this electrical field is recorded with Ag/AgCl nonpolarizable electrodes and used to monitor the evolution of the pressure (or saline) front between the two reservoirs.

This model accounts for the polarization of the grains through an electrical double layer model with a polarization model of the inner part of the electrical double layer called the Stern layer. The polarization model accounts also for the Maxwell–Wagner polarization at frequencies higher than 100 Hz. The Maxwell–Wagner polarization is modelled by using a conductivity model modified to account for the presence of a non-wetting immiscible phase like air in the pore space. The resulting model is consistent with the first and second Archie's laws in the case where surface conductivity can be neglected.

We set out to examine the linkage disequilibrium and diversity in maize elite inbred lines. which have been subject to population bottlenecks and intense selection by breeders. Such population events are expected to increase the amount of linkage disequilibrium. but reduce diversity. The results of this study will inform the design of genetic association studies. We examined the frequency and distribution of DNA polymorphisms at 18 maize genes in 36 maize inbreds. chosen to represent most of the genetic diversity in U.S. elite maize breeding pool. The frequency of nucleotide changes is high. on average one polymorphism per 31 bp in non-coding regions and 1 polymorphism per 124 bp in coding regions. Insertions and deletions are frequent in non-coding regions (1 per 85 bp). but rare in coding regions. A small number (2–8) of distinct and highly diverse haplotypes can be distinguished at all loci examined. Within genes. SNP loci comprising the haplotypes are in linkage disequilibrium with each other. No decline of linkage disequilibrium within a few hundred base pairs was found in the elite maize germplasm. This finding. as well as the small number of haplotypes. relative to neutral expectation. is consistent with the effects of breeding-induced bottlenecks and selection on the elite germplasm pool.

The alleles contain extended regions of nonhomology. On average. more than 50% of the compared sequence is noncolinear. mainly because of the insertion of large numbers of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons. Only 27 LTR-retroelements are shared between alleles. whereas 62 are allele specific. The insertion of LTR-retrotransposons into the maize genome is statistically more recent for nonshared than shared ones. Most surprisingly. more than one-third of the genes (27/72) are absent in one of the inbreds at the loci examined. Such nonshared genes usually appear to be truncated and form clusters in which they are oriented in the same direction.

They are mobile endogenous genetic elements. with a large variety of structure and transposition mechanism. In crops. they compose the major part of the nucleic DNA. up to 80% in some cereals like maize and wheat.

Over the last few decades they have gradually attracted increasing interest from research scientists. Initially they were viewed as totally marginal and anecdotic. but TEs have been revealed as potentially harmful parasitic entities. ubiquitous in genomes. and finally as unavoidable actors in the diversity. structure. and evolution of the genome. Since Darwin's theory of evolution. and the progress of molecular biology. transposable elements may be the discovery that has most influenced our vision of (genome) evolution. In this review. we provide a synopsis of what is known about the complex interactions that exist between transposable elements and the host genome. Numerous examples of these interactions are provided. first from the standpoint of the genome. and then from that of the transposable elements. We also explore the evolutionary aspects of TEs in the light of post-Darwinian theories of evolution. This article was reviewed by Jerzy Jurka. Jürgen Brosius and I. King Jordan.

It is now widely acknowledged that a substantial part of genetic variability can be buffered or released as the result of complex genetic interactions. However. the impact of hidden genetic diversity on phenotypic evolution is still not clear. Here. we argue that a common term to describe the impact of hidden genetic variation on phenotypic change is needed and will help to provide new insights into the contribution of different components of genetic architectures to the evolvability of a character.

Their evolutive dynamics are complex. due to the interaction between their intrinsic amplification capacity. selection at the host level. transposition regulation. and genetic drift. Here. we propose modeling the first steps of TE invasion. i.e.. just after a horizontal transfer. when a single copy is present in the genome of one individual. If the element has a constant transposition rate. it will disappear in most cases: the elements with low-transposition rate are frequently lost through genetic drift. while those with high-transposition rate may amplify. leading to the sterility of their host. Elements whose transposition rate is regulated are able to successfully invade the populations. thanks to an initial transposition burst followed by a strong limitation of their activity.

These two classes of elements are usually distinguished on the basis of their differing mechanisms of transposition. However. their respective frequencies. their intragenomic dynamics and distributions. and the frequencies of their horizontal transfer from one species to another can also differ. The main objective of this review is to compare these two types of elements from a new perspective. using data provided by genome sequencing projects and relating this to the theoretical and observed dynamics. It is shown that the traditional division into two classes. based on the transposition mechanisms. becomes less obvious when other factors are taken into consideration.

Whether measured during growth (ontogenetic allometry). among individuals at similar developmental stage (static allometry). or among populations or species (evolutionary allometry). allometric relationships are often tight and relatively invariant. Consequently. it has been suggested that allometries have low evolvability and could constrain phenotypic evolution by forcing evolving species along fixed trajectories. Alternatively. allometric relationships may result from natural selection for functional optimization. Despite nearly a century of active research. distinguishing between these alternatives remains difficult. partly due to wide differences in the meaning assigned to the term allometry. In particular. a broad use of the term. encompassing any monotonic relationship between body parts. has become common. This usage breaks the connection to the proportional growth regulation that motivated Huxley's original narrow-sense use of allometry to refer to power–law relationships between traits. Focusing on the narrow-sense definition of allometry. we review here evidence for and against the allometry-as-a-constraint hypothesis. Although the low evolvability and the evolutionary invariance of the static allometric slope observed in some studies suggest a possible constraining effect of this parameter on phenotypic evolution. the lack of knowledge about selection on allometry prevents firm conclusions.,True,HumZpaIAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,135,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2463867,11144086336382442538,/scholar?cites=11144086336382442538,,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2463867/s1-ln1638702295844769-1939656818Hwf-653591066IdV-164339851016387022PDF_HI0001.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

By extending the classical models of population genetics. several approaches have been developed to account for the dynamics of TEs. especially in Drosophila melanogaster. While the formalism of these models is based on simplifications. they enable us to understand better how TEs invade genomes. as a result of multiple evolutionary forces including duplication. deletion. self-regulation. natural selection and genetic drift. The aim of this paper is to review the assumptions and the predictions of these different models by highlighting the importance of the specific characteristics of both the TEs and the hosts. and the host/TE relationships.

A prerequisite for the constraint hypothesis is that static allometries are hard to change. Several studies have attempted to test this hypothesis with artificial‐selection experiments. but their results remain inconclusive due to various methodological issues. Here. we present results from an experiment in which we selected independently on the slope and the elevation of the allometric relationship between caudal‐fin size and body size in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). After three episodes of selection. the allometric elevation (i.e. intercept at constant slope) had diverged markedly between the lines selected to increase or decrease it. and showed a realized heritability of 50%.

Therefore. FA-metabolic enzymes are potential targets for drug therapy. although the consequence of these treatments must be precisely evaluated at the organismal and cellular levels. In healthy organism. synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs)—composed of three FA units esterified to a glycerol backbone—is increased in response to dietary sugar. Saturation in the storage and synthesis capacity of TAGs is associated with type 2 diabetes progression. Sugar toxicity likely depends on advanced-glycation-end-products (AGEs) that form through covalent bounding between amine groups and carbonyl groups of sugar or their derivatives α-oxoaldehydes. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive α-oxoaldehyde that is derived from glycolysis through a non-enzymatic reaction. Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) works to neutralize MG. reducing its deleterious effects. Here. we have used the power of Drosophila genetics to generate Fatty acid synthase (FASN) mutants. allowing us to investigate the consequence of this deficiency upon sugar-supplemented diets. We found that FASN mutants are lethal but can be rescued by an appropriate lipid diet. Rescued animals do not exhibit insulin resistance. are dramatically sensitive to dietary sugar and accumulate AGEs.

Here. we use a two-locus genetic system in simulated populations with epistasis to show the convenience of using a recently developed model. NOIA. to perform estimates of genetic effects and the decomposition of the genetic variance that are orthogonal even under deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions. We develop the theory for how to use this model in interval mapping of quantitative trait loci using Halley-Knott regressions. and we analyze a real data set to illustrate the advantage of using this approach in practice. In this example. we show that departures from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions that are expected by sampling alone substantially alter the orthogonal estimates of genetic effects when other statistical models. like F2 or G2A. are used instead of NOIA. Finally. for the first time from real data. we provide estimates of functional genetic effects as sets of effects of natural allele substitutions in a particular genotype. which enriches the debate on the interpretation of genetic effects as implemented both in functional and in statistical models.

However. the extent of HTTs in eukaryotes is largely unknown. due to the lack of efficient. statistically supported methods that can be applied to multiple species sequence data sets.

One of the main objectives of genetic mapping studies is to identify the genetic factors underlying complex traits and understand how they contribute to phenotypic expression. Presently. we are good at identifying and locating individual loci with large effects. but there is a void in describing more complex genetic architectures. Although large networks of connected genes have been reported. there is an almost complete lack of information on how polymorphisms in these networks contribute to phenotypic variation and change. To date. most of our understanding comes from theoretical. model-based studies. and it remains difficult to assess how realistic their conclusions are as they lack empirical support. A previous study provided evidence that nearly half of the difference in eight-week body weight between two divergently selected lines of chickens was a result of four loci organized in a 'radial' network (one central locus interacting with three 'radial' loci that. in turn. only interacted with the central locus). Here. we study the relationship between phenotypic change and genetic polymorphism in this empirically detected network. We use a model-free approach to study. through individual-based simulations. the dynamic properties of this polymorphic and epistatic genetic architecture. The study provides new insights to how epistasis can modify the selection response. buffer and reveal effects of major loci leading to a progressive release of genetic variation.

Negative effects of harvesting are often ascribed to size truncation (i.e. strictly directional selection against large individuals) and resultant decrease in trait variability. which depresses capacity to buffer environmental change. hinders evolutionary rebound and ultimately impairs population recovery. However. the exact form of harvest-induced selection is generally unknown and the effects of harvest on trait variability remain unexplored. Here we use unique data from the Windermere (UK) long-term ecological experiment to show in a top predator (pike. Esox lucius) that the fishery does not induce size truncation but disruptive (diversifying) selection. and does not decrease but rather increases variability in pike somatic growth rate and size at age.

We show that the total selection acting on an allele can be divided into a component deriving from adaptation of the trait mean. a component of canalizing selection favoring alleles that epistatically reduce the effects of other allele substitutions. and a component of conservative selection disfavoring rare alleles. While canalizing selection operates in both stable and fluctuating environments. it may not typically maximize canalization. because it gets less efficient with increasing canalization. and reaches a balance with drift. mutation and indirect selection. Fluctuating selection leads to less canalized equilibria than stabilizing selection of comparable strength. because canalization then …,True,HumZpaIAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,35,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9218-z,15028267307321821301,/scholar?cites=15028267307321821301,,https://www.academia.edu/download/31951338/2013.LeRouzic.etal.pdf,0,0,0

However. most of them only focus on populations of sexual diploid individuals. and TE dynamics in populations partly composed by autogamous individuals remains poorly investigated. To estimate the impact of selfing on TE dynamics. the short- and long-term evolution of TEs was simulated in outcrossing populations with various proportions of selfing individuals. Selfing has a deep impact on TE dynamics: the higher the selfing rate. the lower the probability of invasion. Already known non-equilibrium dynamics (complete loss. domestication. cyclical invasion of TEs) can all be described whatever the mating system. However. their pattern and their respective frequencies greatly depend on the selfing rate. For instance. in cyclical dynamics resulting from interactions between autonomous and non-autonomous copies. cycles are faster when the selfing rate increases. Interestingly. an abrupt change in the mating system from sexuality to complete asexuality leads to the loss of all the elements over a few hundred generations. In general. for intermediate selfing rates. the transposition activity remains maintained. Our theoretical results evidence that a clear and systematic contrast in TE content according to the mating system is expected. with a smooth transition for intermediate selfing rates. Several parameters impact the TE copy number. and all dynamics described in allogamous populations can be also observed in partly autogamous species.

NCLDV were proposed to have evolved by simplification from cellular organism although some of the giant NCLDV have clearly grown by gene accretion from a bacterial origin. We demonstrate here that many NCLDV lineages appear to have undergone frequent gene exchange in two different ways. Viruses which infect protists directly (Mimivirus) or algae which exist as intracellular protists symbionts (Phycodnaviruses) acquire genes from a bacterial source. Metazoan viruses such as the Poxviruses show a predominant acquisition of host genes. In both cases. the laterally acquired genes show a strong tendency to be positioned at the tip of the genome. Surprisingly. several core genes believed to be ancestral in the family appear to have undergone lateral gene transfers. suggesting that the NCLDV ancestor might have had a smaller genome than previously believed. Moreover. our data show that the larger the genome. the higher is the number of laterally acquired genes. This pattern is incompatible with a genome reduction from a cellular ancestor.

This fact has led to the general acceptance of the notion that rampant and promiscuous lateral gene transfer (LGT) plays a critical role in phage evolution. However. recent sequencing of a series of the T4-type phages has revealed that these large and complex genomes all share 2 substantial syntenous blocks of genes encoding the replication and virion structural genes. To analyze the pattern of inheritance of this core T4 genome. we compared the complete genome sequences of 16 T4-type phages. We identified a set of 24 genes present in all these T4-type genomes. Somewhat surprisingly. only one of these genes. that encodes for ribonucleotide reductase (NrdA). displayed evidence of LGT with the bacterial host.

The invention of DNA required the appearance of enzymatic activities for both synthesis of DNA precursors. retro-transcription of RNA templates and replication of single- and double-stranded DNA molecules. Recent data from comparative genomics. structural biology and traditional biochemistry have revealed that several of these enzymatic activities have been invented independently more than once. indicating that the transition from RNA to DNA genomes was more complex than previously thought. The distribution of the different protein families corresponding to these activities in the three domains of life (Archaea. Eukarya. and Bacteria) is puzzling. In many cases.

Origin and evolution of these Giant Viruses (GVs) remain open questions. Interestingly. availability of a collection of closely related GV genomes enabling genomic comparisons offer the opportunity to better understand the different evolutionary forces acting on these genomes. Whole genome alignment for 5 groups of viruses belonging to the Mimiviridae and Phycodnaviridae families show that there is no trend of genome expansion or general tendency of genome contraction. Instead. GV genomes accumulated genomic mutations over the time with gene gains compensating the different losses. In addition. each lineage displays specific patterns of genome evolution. Mimiviridae (megaviruses and mimiviruses) and Chlorella Phycodnaviruses evolved mainly by duplications and losses of genes belonging to large paralogous families (including movements of diverse mobiles genetic elements). whereas Micromonas and Ostreococcus Phycodnaviruses derive most of their genetic novelties thought lateral gene transfers.

R. prolixus can also transfer transposable elements horizontally across a wide range of species. We have taken advantage of the availability of the 700 Mbp complete genome sequence of R. prolixus to study the dynamics of invasion and persistence of transposable elements in this species. Using both library-based and de novo methods of transposon detection. we found less than 6 % of transposable elements in the R. prolixus genome. a relatively low percentage compared to other insect genomes with a similar genome size. DNA transposons are surprisingly abundant and elements belonging to the mariner family are by far the most preponderant components of the mobile part of this genome with 11.015 mariner transposons that could be clustered in 89 groups (75 % of the mobilome). Our analysis allowed the detection of a new mariner clade in the R. prolixus genome. that we called nosferatis. We demonstrated that a large diversity of mariner elements invaded the genome and expanded successfully over time via three main processes. (i) several families experienced recent and massive expansion. for example an explosive burst of a single mariner family led to the generation of more than 8000 copies. These recent expansion events explain the unusual prevalence of mariner transposons in the R. prolixus genome.

However. the short size of the reads and the propensity of transposable elements to nest in highly repeated regions of genomes limits the efficiency of bioinformatic tools when Illumina or 454 technologies are used. Fortunately. long read sequencing technologies generating read length that may span the entire length of full transposons are now available. However. existing TE population genomic softwares were not designed to handle long reads and the development of new dedicated tools is needed. LoRTE is the first tool able to use PacBio long read sequences to identify transposon deletions and insertions between a reference genome and genomes of different strains or populations. Tested against simulated and genuine Drosophila melanogaster PacBio datasets. LoRTE appears to be a reliable and broadly applicable tool to study the dynamic and evolutionary impact of transposable elements using low coverage. long read sequences.

Although ISs and MITEs are relatively simple and basic genetic elements. their detection remains a difficult task due to their remarkable sequence diversity. With the advent of high-throughput genome and metagenome sequencing technologies. the development of fast. reliable and sensitive methods of ISs and MITEs detection become an important challenge. So far. almost all studies dealing with prokaryotic transposons have used classical BLAST-based detection methods against reference libraries. Here we introduce alternative methods of detection either taking advantages of the structural properties of the elements (de novo methods) or using an additional library-based method using profile HMM searches. In this study. we have developed three different work flows dedicated to ISs and MITEs detection: the first two use de novo methods detecting either repeated sequences or presence of Inverted Repeats; the third one use 28 in-house transposase alignment profiles with HMM search methods. We have compared the respective performances of each method using a reference dataset of 30 archaeal and 30 bacterial genomes in addition to simulated and real metagenomes. Compared to a BLAST-based method using ISFinder as library. de novo methods significantly improve ISs and MITEs detection.

In recent years. a number of alternative technologies became available. among them adaptations of the pyrosequencing procedure (i.e. ""454 sequencing""). promising a ~100-fold increase in throughput over Sanger technology – an advancement which is needed to make large and complex genomes more amenable to full genome sequencing at affordable costs. Although several studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for sequencing small and compact microbial genomes. it was unclear how the new technology would perform in large and highly repetitive genomes such as those of wheat or barley. To study its performance in complex genomes. we used 454 technology to sequence four barley Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones and compared the results to those from ABI-Sanger sequencing. All gene containing regions were covered efficiently and at high quality with 454 sequencing whereas repetitive sequences were more problematic with 454 sequencing than with ABI-Sanger sequencing. 454 sequencing provided a much more even coverage of the BAC clones than ABI-Sanger sequencing. resulting in almost complete assembly of all genic sequences even at only 9 to 10-fold coverage.

These protocols are managed towards minimal mortality in the controls. which is not representative for natural systems where mortality is often high. This methodological bias. generated from assays where mortality in the control group is systematically disregarded. makes it difficult to measure therapeutic effects of pharmaceutical contaminants leading to lower mortality. This is of concern considering that such effects on exposed organisms still may have substantial ecological consequences.

Rensch's rule states that sexual size dimorphism (SSD) would increase with body size in taxa where males are larger than females and decrease with body size in taxa where females are larger. We tested this trend in dragonflies (Odonata) by analysing body size of 21 species and found support for Rensch's rule. The increase in SSD with increasing size among species can be explained by sexual selection favouring large males. We also estimated the slope of the relationship between sex ratio and size ratio in populations of the 21 species. A negative slope would suggest that the larger sex suffers from high mortality in the larval stage. consistent with riskier foraging.

As activity level is known to correlate with susceptibility to fish predation this indicates that these communities are structured by fish predation.

Studies of population differentiation in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits along latitudinal gradients are important for understanding how organisms have adapted to seasonal environments and predict how they respond to climate changes. Such studies have been scarce for species with a northern distribution.   Methodology/Principle Finding Larvae of the northern damselfly Coenagrion johanssoni originating from semivoltine central. partivoltine northern. and partivoltine northernmost Swedish populations were reared in the laboratory. To investigate whether larvae use photoperiodic cues to induce compensatory growth along this latitudinal gradient. larvae were reared under two different photoperiods corresponding to a northern and southern latitude. In addition. field adult size was assessed to test the strength of possible compensatory growth mechanisms under natural conditions and hatchling size was measured to test for maternal effects. We hypothesized that populations originating from lower latitudes would be more time constrained than high-latitude populations because they have a shorter life cycle. The results showed that low-latitude populations had higher growth rates in summer/fall. In general northern photoperiods induced higher growth rates. but this plastic response to photoperiod was strongest in the southernmost populations and negligible in the northernmost population. During spring. central populations grew faster under the southern rather than the northern photoperiod.

We studied genetic variance in life history traits and their reaction norms in response to manipulated photoperiods in central. northern. and northernmost peripheral populations of the damselfly Lestes sponsa (Hansemann). After the central‐marginal hypothesis. it is predicted that central populations will express the highest genetic variance. Northern and northernmost populations showed the highest development and growth rates.

One form of predation is cannibalism. which is affected by many factors such as size structure and resource density. However. cannibalism may also be influenced by abiotic factors such as seasonal time constraints. Since time constraints are greater at high latitudes. cannibalism could be stronger at such latitudes. but we know next to nothing about latitudinal variation in cannibalism. In this study. we examined cannibalism and activity in larvae of the damselfly Lestes sponsa along a latitudinal gradient across Europe. We did this by raising larvae from the egg stage at different temperatures and photoperiods corresponding to different latitudes. We found that the more seasonally time-constrained populations in northern latitudes and individuals subjected to greater seasonal time constraints exhibited a higher level of cannibalism. We also found that activity was higher at north latitude conditions. and thus correlated with cannibalism. suggesting that this behaviour mediates higher levels of cannibalism in time-constrained animals. Our results go counter to the classical latitude-predation pattern which predicts higher predation at lower latitudes. since we found that predation was stronger at higher latitudes.

Polish Academy of Sciences,Patrolling behavior plays an important role in resource defense and in shaping social interactions in territorial species. However. it is not clear whether and how resource deterioration affects patrolling and interactions between territorial males. We addressed this issue by studying the territorial patrolling of damselfly Calopteryx splendens males. which use riverine vegetation patches composed of floating rafts of Potamogeton natans as territories. Males can hold single territories established on one vegetation patch (solitary residents) or hold adjacent territories established on shared vegetation patch (contiguous residents). The study predicted that solitary males engage more in patrolling than contiguous residents and that patrolling intensity is proportional to patch quality. Two types of semi-natural vegetation patches were sunk: of high and low quality measured on the basis of the patch size (range 2–5 m2) and its …,True,UKkJCvsAAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C,1,https://bioone.org/journals/polish-journal-of-ecology/volume-65/issue-1/15052249PJE2017.65.1.011/The-Effects-of-Habitat-Deterioration-and-Social-Status-on-Patrolling/10.3161/15052249PJE2017.65.1.011.short,11042284652583486650,/scholar?cites=11042284652583486650,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge_Contreras-Garduno2/publication/316565597_The_Effects_of_Habitat_Deterioration_and_Social_Status_on_Patrolling_Behavior_in_the_Territorial_Damselfly_Calopteryx_splendens/links/59089cdaaca272f658f71b66/The-Effects-of-Habitat-Deterioration-and-Social-Status-on-Patrolling-Behavior-in-the-Territorial-Damselfly-Calopteryx-splendens.pdf,0,0,0

We examined the relationship between antipredator behavior and morphological defense in larvae of three closely related dragonfly species within the genus Leucorrhinia. The three species differ with regard to their morphological defense as expressed in the length of the larval abdominal spines. Results showed that longer abdominal spines provided protection against an attacking fish predator (perch) because the probability of being rejected after an attack was significantly higher in the species with the longest abdominal spines.

We reared larvae in three different predator treatments; no predator. predator feeding on conspecifics and predator feeding on heterospecifics. We found that. independent of food availability. larvae displayed the strongest anti-predator behaviours where predators consumed prey conspecifics.

Behavioural adaptations to avoid and evade predators are common. Many studies have investigated population divergence in response to changes in predation regime within species. but studies exploring interspecific patterns are scant. Studies on interspecific divergence can infer common outcomes from evolutionary processes and highlight the role of environmental constraints in shaping species traits.2. Species of the dragonfly genus Leucorrhinia underwent well‐studied shifts from habitats being dominated by predatory fish (fish lakes) to habitat being dominated by predatory invertebrates (dragonfly lakes). This change in top predators resulted in a set of adaptive trait modifications in response to the different hunting styles of both predator types: whereas predatory fish actively search and pursue prey. invertebrate predator follow a sit‐and‐wait strategy. not pursuing prey.3.

However. while some odonate species can occupy various changing habitats. other species are adapted to a narrow range of environmental conditions. Commonly. behavioural modifications are applied to avoid detection and encounters with predators.

Using larval Ischnura elegans we quantified predator induced plastic behavioural reaction norms in order to manifest variance. and by this evolvability of larval behavioural plasticity.

We studied geographical variation in larval spine length of the dragonfly Leucorrhinia dubia across Western Europe using a phylogenetic approach. Larvae were raised in a common garden laboratory experiment in the absence of fish predators. Results show that larvae from northern Europe (Sweden and Finland) had significantly longer larval spines compared to larvae from western and central Europe.

In many organisms. a move to a different environment during ontogeny is accompanied by metamorphosis. In such organisms phenotypic induction early in ontogeny can affect later phenotypes. In laboratory experiments we first investigated correlations between body morphology and the locomotor performance traits expressed in different life stages of the common frog. Rana temporaria: swimming speed and acceleration in tadpoles; and jump-distance in froglets. We then tested for correlations between these performances across life stages. We also subjected tadpoles to unchanging or decreasing water levels to explore whether decreasing water levels might induce any carry-over effects. Body morphology and performance were correlated in tadpoles; morphology and performance were correlated in froglets: hence body shape and morphology affect performance within each life stage. However. performance was decoupled across life stages. as there was no correlation between performance in tadpoles and performance in froglets. While size did not influence tadpole performance. it was correlated with performance of the metamorphosed froglets.

Environmentally induced phenotypes can in this way persist for several generations. due to the transmission of molecular factors that determine how DNA is read and expressed (Jablonka and Raz 2009; Bonduriansky and Day 2009). Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is a common process that acts during the differentiation of somatic cells. as well as in response to environmental cues and stresses. and the passing on of these modulations to the offspring constitutes epigenetic inheritance.

This tragedy of the commons can be magnified by intralocus sexual conflict (IaSC) whenever alleles that reduce fecundity when expressed in females spread in the population because of their benefits in males.

By analysing the relationship between development rate and growth rate. it can be determined whether plasticity in life‐history traits is caused by changed physiology or behaviour. We extended this to examine whether plasticity had been aiding local adaptation. by investigating whether the plastic response had been fixed in locally adapted populations. Tadpoles from island populations of Rana temporaria. locally adapted to different pool‐drying regimes. were monitored in a common garden. Individual differences in development rate were caused by different foraging efficiency. However. developmental plasticity was physiologically mediated by trading off growth against development rate.

Here. we explored putative intralocus sexual conflict and genetic (co)variance in a poorly understood behavior with near male-limited expression. Same-sex sexual behaviors (SSBs) generally do not conform to classic evolutionary models of adaptation but are common in male animals and have been hypothesized to result from perception errors and selection for high male mating rates. However. perspectives incorporating sex-specific selection on genes shared by males and females to explain the expression and evolution of SSBs have largely been neglected. We performed two parallel sex-limited artificial selection experiments on SSB in male and female seed beetles. followed by sex-specific assays of locomotor activity and male sex recognition (two traits hypothesized to be functionally related to SSB) and adult reproductive success (allowing us to assess fitness consequences of genetic variance in SSB and its correlated components). Our experiments reveal both shared and sex-limited genetic variance for SSB.

Much of this research is centred on the central‐marginal hypothesis. which posits that populations at range margins are sparse. small and genetically diminished compared to those at the centre of a species’ distribution range. We tested predictions derived from the central‐marginal hypothesis for the distribution of genetic variation and population differentiation in five European Coenagrionid damselfly species.

Studies of population differentiation in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits along latitudinal gradients are important for understanding how organisms have adapted to seasonal environments and predict how they respond to climate changes. Such studies have been scarce for species with a northern distribution.   Methodology/Principle Finding Larvae of the northern damselfly Coenagrion johanssoni originating from semivoltine central. partivoltine northern. and partivoltine northernmost Swedish populations were reared in the laboratory. To investigate whether larvae use photoperiodic cues to induce compensatory growth along this latitudinal gradient. larvae were reared under two different photoperiods corresponding to a northern and southern latitude. In addition. field adult size was assessed to test the strength of possible compensatory growth mechanisms under natural conditions and hatchling size was measured to test for maternal effects. We hypothesized that populations originating from lower latitudes would be more time constrained than high-latitude populations because they have a shorter life cycle. The results showed that low-latitude populations had higher growth rates in summer/fall. In general northern photoperiods induced higher growth rates. but this plastic response to photoperiod was strongest in the southernmost populations and negligible in the northernmost population. During spring. central populations grew faster under the southern rather than the northern photoperiod.

For over a century. researchers have studied the form and function of wings to understand the determinants of flight performance. However. to understand the evolution of flight. we must comprehend not only how morphology affects performance. but also how morphology and performance affect fitness. Natural and sexual selection can either reinforce or oppose each other. but their role in flight evolution remains poorly understood. Here. we show that wing shape is under antagonistic selection with regard to sexual and natural selection in a scrambling damselfly.

1138548,Using taxonomic revision data to estimate the global species richness and characteristics of undescribed species of diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae),2010,Viktor Nilsson-Örtman and Anders N Nilsson,7,Biodiversity Informatics,1,,,Many methods used for estimating species richness are either difficult to use on poorly known taxa or require input data that are laborious and expensive to collect. In this paper we apply a method which takes advantage of the carefully conducted tests of how the described diversity compares to real species richness that are inherent in taxonomic revisions. We analyze the quantitative outcome from such revisions with respect to body size. zoogeographical region and phylogenetic relationship. The best fitting model is used to predict the diversity of unrevised groups if these would have been subject to as rigorous species level hypothesis-testing as the revised groups. The sensitivity of the predictive model to single observations is estimated by bootstrapping over resampled subsets of the original data. The Dytiscidae is with its 4080 described species (end of May 2009) the most diverse group of aquatic beetles and have a world-wide distribution. Extensive taxonomic work has been carried out on the family but still the number of described species increases exponentially in most zoogeographical regions making many commonly used methods of estimation difficult to apply. We provide independent species richness estimates of subsamples for which species richness estimates can be reached through extrapolation and compare these to the species richness estimates obtained through the method using revision data. We estimate there to be 5405 species of dytiscids. a 1.32-fold increase over the present number of described species.

1138560,Thermal adaptation along a latitudinal gradient in damselflies,2012,Viktor Nilsson-Örtman,,,,,,Understanding how temperature affects biological systems is a central question in ecology and evolutionary biology. Anthropogenic climate change adds urgency to this topic. as the demise or success of species under climate change is expected to depend on how temperature affects important aspects of organismal performance. such as growth. development. survival and reproduction. Rates of biological processes generally increase with increasing temperature up to some maximal temperature. Variation in the slope of the initial. rising phase has attracted considerable interest and forms the focus of this thesis. I explore variation in growth rate-temperature relationships over several levels of biological organization. both between and within species. over individuals’ lifetime. depending on the ecological context and in relation to important life history characteristics such as generation length and winter dormancy. Specifically. I examine how a clade of temperate damselflies have adapted to their thermal environment along a 3.600 km long latitudinal transect spanning from Southern Spain to Northern Sweden. For each of six species. I sampled populations from close to the northern and southern range margin. as well from the center of the latitudinal range. I reared larvae in the laboratory at several temperatures in order to measure individual growth rates.

One form of predation is cannibalism. which is affected by many factors such as size structure and resource density. However. cannibalism may also be influenced by abiotic factors such as seasonal time constraints. Since time constraints are greater at high latitudes. cannibalism could be stronger at such latitudes. but we know next to nothing about latitudinal variation in cannibalism. In this study. we examined cannibalism and activity in larvae of the damselfly Lestes sponsa along a latitudinal gradient across Europe. We did this by raising larvae from the egg stage at different temperatures and photoperiods corresponding to different latitudes. We found that the more seasonally time-constrained populations in northern latitudes and individuals subjected to greater seasonal time constraints exhibited a higher level of cannibalism. We also found that activity was higher at north latitude conditions. and thus correlated with cannibalism. suggesting that this behaviour mediates higher levels of cannibalism in time-constrained animals. Our results go counter to the classical latitude-predation pattern which predicts higher predation at lower latitudes. since we found that predation was stronger at higher latitudes.

However. one important aspect that is often neglected when studying behavioral expressions among populations is if/how the experimental design might affect the results. This is unfortunate since animals often plastically modify their behavior to the environment. for example. rearing conditions. We studied behavioral traits and trait correlations in larvae of a univoltine damselfly. Lestes sponsa. along its latitudinal distribution. spreading over 3.300 km.

Polish Academy of Sciences,Patrolling behavior plays an important role in resource defense and in shaping social interactions in territorial species. However. it is not clear whether and how resource deterioration affects patrolling and interactions between territorial males. We addressed this issue by studying the territorial patrolling of damselfly Calopteryx splendens males. which use riverine vegetation patches composed of floating rafts of Potamogeton natans as territories. Males can hold single territories established on one vegetation patch (solitary residents) or hold adjacent territories established on shared vegetation patch (contiguous residents). The study predicted that solitary males engage more in patrolling than contiguous residents and that patrolling intensity is proportional to patch quality.

The reproductive behaviour was observed at 29 sites for S. fusca and at 16 ones for S. paedisca. Both species preferred oxbows that during high water periods were temporarily connected with the river. ie those situated inside rather than outside of the levees (Fig. 2). Specifically. 63% sites of S. fusca and 76% sites of S. paedisca were located between the levees of the Vistula River. With respect to hydrochemical conditions. both species occurred in habitats with wide ranges of all measured water parameters and there was no significant difference between their preferences in this matter (Fig. 3). Regarding nutrients. both species were found at concentrations reaching 1. 5 mg L–1 PO4 3–and 1. 6 mg L–1 NH4+. Nevertheless. a comparison between inhabited and uninhabited waters revealed preferences of both species to relatively low contents of phosphate and ammonium. With respect to nitrate. S. paedisca occurred at their low concentrations. whereas S. fusca did not show any pattern. We conclude that oxbows. particularly those seasonally flooded due to the river proximity. are important habitats for S. fusca and S. paedisca.

In this paper. we offer a simple and general mechanism to explain this observation. Our explanation offers a resolution to the lek paradox and rests on only two assumptions; condition dependence of sexually selected traits and high genetic variance in condition. The former assumption is well supported by empirical evidence. We discuss the evidence for the latter assumption. These two assumptions lead inevitably to the capture of genetic variance into sexually selected traits concomitantly with the evolution of condition dependence. We present a simple genetic model to illustrate this view. We then explore some implications of genic capture for the coevolution of female preference and male traits.

1138599,Developmental thresholds and the evolution of reaction norms for age and size at life-history transitions,2002,Troy Day and Locke Rowe,159,The American Naturalist,4,338-350,The University of Chicago Press,It is quite common in studies of life‐history plasticity to find a negative relationship between the age at which various life‐history transitions occur and the growth conditions under which individuals develop. In particular. high growth typically results in earlier transitions. often at a larger size. Here. we use a relatively general optimization model for age and size at life‐history transitions to argue that current life‐history theory cannot adequately explain these results. Specifically. most such theory requires key assumptions that are unlikely to be generally met. This suggests that some important component of the biology of many organisms must be missing from many of the models in life‐history theory. We suggest that this missing component might be the phenomenon of developmental thresholds. There are at least two different types of developmental thresholds possible. and we incorporate these into our general …,True,JFHHjacAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,309,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/338989,15229129582119521888,/scholar?cites=15229129582119521888,,https://mast.queensu.ca/~tday/pdf/Day%20Rowe%2002.pdf,0,0,0

B,1360,123-127,The Royal Society,Conflict between the sexes over control of copulation may drive the coevolution of elaborate genitalia and other secondary sexual structures. Support for this hypothesis is limited to male adaptations that function to enhance male control over females in copulation (e. g. structures that function to clasp females). Evidence for morphological adaptation in females is critical to the hypothesis. yet lacking. Here. we present the first experimental evidence demonstrating that female abdominal spines in water striders function to increase female control over copulation. By experimentally extending the phenotypic size range of these spines. we show that this morphological adaptation. specific to females. allows them to thwart harassing males. and as a result. reduce the frequency of costly matings to females.

Ltd.,Sexual selection is responsible for much of the spectacular natural diversity of mating traits. It is unclear. however. how this powerful evolutionary force affects the evolution of traits unrelated to mating. Four recent theoretical studies have argued that sexual selection might increase the rate of adaptation. but each relies on the assumption of a substantial positive covariance between male condition (non-mating fitness) and display. Here we demonstrate. with an explicit genetic model. that sexual selection itself can easily lead to the evolution and maintenance of this covariance. This process occurs through the evolution of condition-dependent male display and the resultant transfer of genetic variance for condition into variance in male display. We also track the effect of the covariance between condition and display on the rate of adaptation.

We undertake a comparative study of correlated evolution of male and female morphologies in a clade of 15 water strider species in the genus Gerris (Heteroptera: Gerridae). Earlier studies have shown that superfluous matings impose costs on females. including increased energetic expenditure and predation risk. and females therefore resist males with premating struggles. Males of some species possess grasping structures and females of some species exhibit distinct antigrasping structures. which are used to further the interests of each sex during these premating struggles.

We provide a direct test of the trade–up hypothesis using guppies (Poecilia reticulata). and evaluate both behavioural and paternity data. Virgin female guppies were presented sequentially with two males of varying attractiveness. and their responsiveness to each male was quantified.

The conflict between foraging demands and mating was examined and the convenience polyandry hypothesis for superfluous mating was tested directly. Mating is multiple. females are reluctant. males are persistent and mating consists of a period of copulation followed by a guarding phase in which the male and female remain in tandem without genital contact. Males make frequent attempts to mate with females that often lead to vigorous struggles initiated by the females. All matings were terminated with a struggle initiated by the female that continued until males were dislodged. Field data support the hypothesis that mating conflicts with foraging.

1138621,Testing for equal rates of cladogenesis in diverse taxa,2003,Folmer Bokma,57,Evolution,11,2469-2474,Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Taxa differ widely in numbers of species. which may be due either to chance alone or to factors that cause differences in speciation and extinction rates between taxa. To test whether an observed distribution of species over taxa differs from the distribution expected from chance alone. one must take into account that neither speciation nor extinction rates are known. This paper introduces a way to estimate speciation and extinction probabilities from the distribution of extant species over families and to test whether the observed distribution is different from expected. Application of this procedure to the distributions of bird. hexapod. primate. and angiosperm species over taxa provides statistical evidence of differences in rates of cladogenesis between taxa.,True,RVHhsp8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,60,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb01492.x,17920776248788406464,/scholar?cites=17920776248788406464,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb01492.x,0,0,0

It has also been suggested that ""enemy-free space"" provided by novel host plants could promote host shifts by herbivores. and that parasitoids could similarly drive diversification of gall form in insects that induce galls on plants. Because these central coevolutionary hypotheses have never been tested in a phylogenetic framework. we combined phylogenetic information on willow-galling sawflies with data on their host plants. gall types. and enemy communities. We found that evolutionary shifts in host plant use and habitat have led to dramatic prunings of parasitoid communities. and that changes in gall phenotype can provide ""enemy-free morphospace"" for millions of years even in the absence of host plant shifts. Some parasites have nevertheless managed to colonize recently-evolved gall types. and this has apparently led to adaptive speciation in several enemy groups. However. having fewer enemies does not in itself increase speciation probabilities in individual sawfly lineages. partly because the high diversity of the enemy community facilitates compensatory attack by remaining parasite taxa.

Although lakes (and ponds) are particularly suited for macroecological research due to their discrete nature and non geographically-structured variability. the development of this discipline in lentic habitats is comparatively much smaller than for terrestrial environments. This is despite the interest of limnologists for large-scale phenomena. which results in the high level of development of some disciplines such as predictive limnology. Here we discuss how current state-of-the-art in macroecology may benefit from research in lentic habitats at five topics. First. by including an island biogeography analytical framework to incorporate the effects of lake origin and history on lentic biodiversity. Second. by studying local and regional effects on the latitudinal gradients of species richness. Third. by considering lakes and ponds altogether for the study of beta diversity and metacommunity structure. which is already common ground in limnological research. Fourth. by relating species traits with ecosystem structure and functioning; here we consider in particular the potential effects of body size-determined dispersal and competitive exclusion processes on lake-wide trophic organization. And fifth. by incorporating current research in functional (i.e.. trait) and phylogenetic diversity to the study of community structure.

The finding in several recent studies that species richness of clades is decoupled from stem age has been interpreted as evidence for ecological limits to species richness. Here we demonstrate that the absence of a positive age-diversity relationship. or even a negative relationship. may also occur when taxa are defined based on time or some correlate of time such as genetic distance or perhaps morphological distinctness. Thus. inferring underlying processes from distributions of species across higher taxa requires caution concerning the way in which higher taxa are defined.

Also of some interest is a related conjecture that parasitic elements. such as transposons and introns. might have provided the genes responsible for the establishment of the sexual cycle itself2–4. We wish to emphasize a point made by Hickey2. 5 that it is the capacity for intergenomic spread. through outcrossing. that provides the transposons of sexually reproducing organisms with a greater potential for multiplication within a population than is possible for their asexual counterparts. Intragenomic spread through copy number increase is possible in both asexual and sexual organisms. but intergenomic spread is limited in frequency in clonal organisms.It has been claimed that differences in breeding system are expected to favor the evolution of different predominant modes of host–TE interactions5. If correct. this has interesting implications for the levels of selection on TEs that were described in our review6. Prokaryotic transposon survival depends on a combination of transposition and plasmid-mediated transfer7. Because of the low frequencies of both processes. it was argued7 that bacterial transposons would be unlikely to evolve as molecular parasites. Rather. the survival and evolution of these transposons would probably depend on their ability to confer a fitness advantage to their hosts. an outcome for which there is good experimental evidence8. 9.

Theory suggests that reproductive isolation develops through accumulation of epistatic genic incompatibilities. also known as Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller (BDM) incompatibilities. We can detect these from marker transmission ratio distortion (TRD) in hybrid progenies of crosses between species or populations. where TRD is expected to result from selection against heterospecific allele combinations in hybrids. TRD may also manifest itself because of intragenomic conflicts or competition between gametes or zygotes.

Recently. a number of methods have been published showing that these rates can be estimated even if the phylogeny is incomplete. that is. if not all extant species are included. We show that the accuracy of such methods strongly depends on making the correct assumptions about how the sampling process was performed. We focus on phylogenies that are incomplete because some subclades (e.g.. genera and families) are each represented as a single lineage. We show that previous methods implicitly assumed that such subclades are defined by randomly (or in an extreme deterministic way) choosing the edges that define the subclades from the complete species phylogeny. We show that these methods produce biased results if higher taxa are defined in a different manner.

Coastal populations are either from the Baltic coast (n = 5) or from nearby coastal lakes (n = 3) that became isolated from the Baltic Sea (< 100 years before present. ybp). Inland populations are from freshwater lakes that became isolated from the Baltic approximately 10.000 ybp; either single species lakes without predators (n = 5). or lakes with a recent history of predation (n = 5) from stocking of salmonid predators (~50 ybp). Coastal populations showed little variation in 11 morphological traits and had longer spines per unit of body length than inland populations. Inland populations were larger. on average. and showed greater morphological variation than coastal populations. A principal component analysis (PCA) across all populations revealed two major morphological axes related to spine length (PC1. 47.7% variation) and body size (PC2. 32.9% variation). Analysis of PCA scores showed marked similarity in coastal (Baltic coast and coastal lake) populations. PCA scores indicate that inland populations with predators have higher within-group variance in spine length and lower within-group variance in body size than inland populations without predators.

The difficulty of fitting more advanced models of diversification to phylogenies is largely due to the fact that molecular phylogenies only provide information about the evolutionary history of the species that exist at present: they are pruned of all extinct species. If extinct species are observed (as is the case in palaeontological studies of fossil data). it is not particularly difficult to determine whether the number of species arising in a time window is related to the number of existing species in that time window.

This runs counter to the perception that non-Mendelian genes are rare genetic curiosities. a view that seems to be supported by the near ubiquity of the Mendelian system of inheritance. There are several reasons why segregation distortion may be more important than is evidenced by known empirical examples. One possibility is that the types of segregation distorters we have found are only a subset of a broader range of non-Mendelian systems. many of which go undetected. In this paper. we review what is known about the sex-linked meiotic drive system in the plant. Silene latifolia. and present some data on the mechanism of segregation distortion.

Beneficial alleles neither fix in all populations nor equilibrate at the same frequency. Instead. populations reach a mutation–selection–drift–migration balance with sufficient among-population variance that some partially recessive. deleterious mutations can be masked upon crossbreeding. This heterosis is greatest with intermediate mutation rates. intermediate selection coefficients. low migration rates and recessive alleles. Hybrid vigour should not be taken as evidence for the complete isolation of populations. Moreover. we show that heterosis in crosses between populations has a different genetic basis than inbreeding depression within populations and is much more likely …,True,24HiW0kAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,233,https://www.nature.com/articles/6886930,715984917123442341,/scholar?cites=715984917123442341,,https://www.nature.com/articles/6886930,0,0,0

Mating system variation is known to have important consequences for how genetic variation is distributed within and among populations. Selfing is known to reduce effective population size. and inbreeding species are therefore expected to have lower levels of genetic variation than comparable out crossing taxa. However. several recent empirical studies have shown that reductions in genetic diversity within populations of inbreeding species are far greater than the expected reductions based on the reduced effective population size. Two different processes have been argued to cause these patterns. selective sweeps (or hitchhiking) and background selection. Both are expected to be most effective in reducing genetic variation in regions of low recombination rates.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1450,1321-1326,The Royal Society,Individuals coming from the same subpopulation are more likely to share deleterious mutations at any given locus than hybrids formed between parents from different populations. Offspring of migrants therefore may experience heterosis and have higher fitness than resident individuals. This will. in turn. result in the immigrant alleles being present in higher frequencies than predicted from neutral expectations and thus a higher effective migration rate. In this paper we derive a formula to calculate the effective migration rate in the presence of heterosis. It is shown that the effect of heterosis on the migration rate can be substantial when fitness reduction within local populations is severe. The effect will be more pronounced in species with relatively short map lengths. Furthermore the heterosis effect will be highly variable throughout the genome. with the largest effect seen near selected genes and in regions of high …,True,24HiW0kAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,120,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2000.1145,3879765729629561457,/scholar?cites=3879765729629561457,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690676/pdf/10972127.pdf,0,0,0

However. gene flow may also lead to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. We investigated the effect of gene flow on local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in development time in island populations of the common frog Rana temporaria which breed in pools that differ in drying regimes. This was done by investigating associations between traits (measured in a common garden experiment) and selective factors (pool drying regimes and gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments) by regression analyses and by comparing pairwise FST values (obtained from microsatellite analyses) with pairwise QST values. We found that the degree of phenotypic plasticity was positively correlated with gene flow from other populations inhabiting different environments (among …,True,24HiW0kAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,104,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01122.x,3838323131699461793,/scholar?cites=3838323131699461793,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01122.x,0,0,0

To ensure a correct initiation of critical developmental processes. such as the initiation and cessation of growth. plants have adapted to a spatially variable light regime and genes in the photoperiodic pathway have been implicated as likely sources for these adaptations. Here we examine genetic variation in genes from the photoperiodic pathway in Populus tremula (Salicaceae) for signatures diversifying selection in response to varying light regimes across a latitudinal gradient.

Although some attention has been given to flowering plants. reports of molecular evolutionary rates for their sister plant clade (gymnosperms) are scarce. and to our knowledge differences in molecular evolution among seed plant clades have never been tested in a phylogenetic framework.

Here. I use multilocus data to show that natural selection on both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations plays an important role in shaping levels of synonymous polymorphism in European aspen (Populus tremula). Previous studies have documented a preferential fixation of synonymous mutations encoding preferred codons in P. tremula. The results presented here show that this has resulted in an increase in codon bias in P. tremula. consistent with stronger selection acting on synonymous codon usage. In addition. positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations appears to be common in P. tremula. with approximately 30% of all mutations having been fixed by positive selection.

1138663,Molecular evolution of synonymous codon usage in Populus,2008,Pär K Ingvarsson,8,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-13,BioMed Central,Evolution of synonymous codon usage is thought to be determined by a balance between mutation. genetic drift and natural selection on translational efficiency. However. natural selection on codon usage is considered to be a weak evolutionary force and selection on codon usage is expected to be strongest in species with large effective population sizes. I examined the evolution of synonymous codons using EST data from five species of Populus. Data on relative synonymous codon usage in genes with high and low gene expression were used to identify 25 codons from 18 different amino acids that were deemed to be preferred codons across all five species. All five species show significant correlations between codon bias and gene expression. independent of base composition. thus indicating that translational selection has shaped synonymous codon usage. Using a set of 158 orthologous genes I detected an excess of unpreferred to preferred (U → P) mutations in two lineages. P. tremula and P. deltoides. Maximum likelihood estimates of the strength of selection acting on synonymous codons was also significantly greater than zero in P. tremula. with the ML estimate of 4N                     e                   s = 0.720. The data is consistent with weak selection on preferred codons in all five species. There is also evidence suggesting that selection on synonymous codons has increased in P. tremula. Although the reasons for the increase in selection on codon usage in the P. tremula lineage are not clear. one possible explanation is an increase in the effective population size in P. tremula.,True,24HiW0kAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,77,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-8-307,15805514616544622840,/scholar?cites=15805514616544622840,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-8-307,0,0,0

We show that the standard way of setting up Bayes factor tests of the monophyly of a group. or the placement of a sample sequence in a known reference tree. can be misleading. The reason for this is related to the well-known dependency of Bayes factors on model-specific priors. Specifically. when testing tree hypotheses it is important that each hypothesis is associated with an appropriate tree space in the prior. This can be achieved by using appropriately constrained searches or by filtering trees in the posterior sample. but in a more elaborate way than typically implemented. If it is difficult to find the appropriate tree sets to be contrasted. then the posterior model odds may be more informative than the Bayes factor.

As predicted. suction cups in males and modified dorsal surfaces in females showed a pronounced coevolutionary pattern. The female dorsal modifications impair the attachment ability of male suction cups. but each antagonistic novelty in females corresponds to counter-differentiation of suction cups in males.ConclusionsA recently diverged sibling species pair in Japan is possibly one consequence of this arms race and we suggest that future studies on hypoxia might reveal the key to the extraordinary selection for female counter-adaptations in diving beetles.,True,gjC5lywAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,75,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000522,16716463115318701872,/scholar?cites=16716463115318701872,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000522,0,0,0

Genetic analyses suggest that many supposedly generalist parasitoid species should rather be defined as multiple species with a more narrow diet. reducing the probability that such species may mediate indirect interactions such as apparent competition among hosts. Recent studies showed that the parasitoid Asecodes lucens mediate apparent competition between two hosts. Galerucella tenella and G. calmariensis. affecting both interaction strengths and evolutionary feedbacks. The same parasitoid was also recorded from other species in the genus Galerucella. suggesting that similar indirect effects may also occur for other species pairs. To explore the possibility of such interactions. we sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers to resolve the phylogeny of both host and parasitoid and to test the number of parasitoid species involved. We thus collected 139 Galerucella larvae from 8 host plant species and sequenced 31 adult beetle and 108 parasitoid individuals. The analysis of the Galerucella data. that also included sequences from previous studies. verified the five species previously documented as reciprocally monophyletic. but the Bayesian species delimitation for A. lucens suggested 3–4 cryptic taxa with a more specialised host use than previously suggested. The gene data analyzed under the multispecies coalescent model allowed us to reconstruct the species tree phylogeny for both host and parasitoid and we found a fully congruent coevolutionary pattern suggesting …,True,gjC5lywAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,48,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-13-92,10670471067402595170,/scholar?cites=10670471067402595170,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-13-92,0,0,0

Theory predicts that natural selection should favour females that are able to correctly assess the risk of predation and then use that information to avoid high‐risk oviposition sites to reduce the risk of offspring predation. Despite the potential significance of such behaviour on individual fitness. population dynamics and community structure. relatively few studies of oviposition behaviour connected to the risk of predation have been carried out.2. However. some recent studies suggest that oviposition site selection in response to risk of predation may be a common phenomenon. at least among amphibians and mosquitoes.

Such coevolutionary chases may be perpetual. However. we show here that the coevolutionary process may also lead to a stable state in which multiple offense‐defense trait pairs are maintained. This type of polymorphism below the species level is a result of sexual conflict in combination with nonrandom mating. Our results show that if nonrandom mating occurs with respect to male and female conflict traits. genetic correlations will act to stabilize the trait frequencies so that all morphs are maintained.

The pattern of distribution with several genera confined to different continents of the Southern Hemisphere raises the yet untested hypothesis of a Gondwana vicariance origin. The monophyly of Aciliini has been questioned with regard to Eretini. and there are competing hypotheses about the intergeneric relationship in the tribe. This study is the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis focused on the tribe Aciliini and it is based on eight gene fragments. The aims of the present study are: 1) to test the monophyly of Aciliini and clarify the position of the tribe Eretini and to resolve the relationship among genera within Aciliini. 2) to calibrate the divergence times within Aciliini and test different biogeographical scenarios. and 3) to evaluate the utility of the gene CAD for phylogenetic analysis in Dytiscidae. Our analyses confirm monophyly of Aciliini with Eretini as its sister group. Each of six genera which have multiple species are also supported as monophyletic. The origin of the tribe is firmly based in the Southern Hemisphere with the arrangement of Neotropical and Afrotropical taxa as the most basal clades suggesting a Gondwana vicariance origin. However. the uncertainty as to whether a fossil can be used as a stem-or crowngroup calibration point for Acilius influenced the result: as crowngroup calibration. the 95% HPD interval for the basal nodes included the geological age estimate for the Gondwana break-up. but as a stem group calibration the basal nodes were too young.

Because the proportion deposited declined as the amount removed increased. an individual plant would maximize its total pollen dispersal by relying on many pollen-removing visits while limiting the pollen removed by each pollinator. This restriction of pollen removal could be achieved by a plant presenting only a small portion of its pollen at one time (packaging) and/or by limiting the amount of presented pollen that a pollinator removes during a single visit (dispensing). The restriction of pollen removal required to maximize the expected total deposition on stigmas depends on the number of pollinator visits a plant receives. variation in the frequency of visits. and the pattern of pollen removal during a series of visits.

Commercially-produced bumble bees used in greenhouse pollination often have higher levels of various pathogens than wild bumble bees. These pathogens may spread to wild bees when commercial bees escape from greenhouses and interact with their wild counterparts at nearby flowers. We examined the prevalence of four pathogens in wild bumble bee populations at locations near and distant to commercial greenhouses in southern Ontario. Canada. Bumble bees collected near commercial greenhouses were more frequently infected by those pathogens capable of being transmitted at flowers (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi) than bees collected at sites away from greenhouses.

Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might be at risk of such decoupling. there have been few attempts to test this hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and flowering at the same localities.

This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called. ‘Colony Collapse Disorder’); yet. we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen ‘spillover’ from commercially reared bumble bees. which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops. is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and. using laboratory experiments and the literature. estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi. a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover. and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that. during the first three months of spillover. transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However. a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly. infecting up to 35–100% of wild Bombus. and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk.

The way in which pollinators divide their visits among simultaneously blooming plant species determines the outcome of plant competition for pollinators. which may affect community structure. Although the hawkweeds are apomictic. these stands are simple communities that embody many of the assumptions of published models concerning the effects of stand composition on insect foraging. Existing theory suggests that visitation on one of two competing species should increase with its proportion in the stand. Visitation on H. aurantiacum follows this relationship. but H. florentinum receives more visits with H. aurantiacum present than when it blooms alone.

Convergent conformity to syndromes implies the existence of “evolutionary attractors” toward which phenotypes are drawn; divergent breaks from conformity show that populations can escape one attractor and be drawn to another. We discuss how these two opposed processes can be reconciled for the special case of evolutionary transitions between bee pollination and hummingbird pollination. In this case. a third phenomenon. the directional bias in favor of transitions from melittophily to ornithophily. also needs explanation.

Nectar‐seeking foragers can rapidly associate a flower's cues with its profitability. measured as caloric value or ‘net energy gain.’ and generally develop preferences for more profitable species. If two flower types are equally easy to discover and feed from. differences in profitability will arise from differences in the volume or the sugar concentration of their nectar crops. Although there has been much study of how bees respond to one or the other of these two kinds of nectar variation. few studies have considered both at once.

Because of the potential impact of nongenetic factors on the ability of pollen to fertilize ovules. researchers conducting hand‐pollinations should attempt to control the freshness or viability of pollen used.

Accordingly. we measured. for 49 species of Penstemon and close relatives. both the morphology of the flowers and visitation by pollinators. We describe the mechanics of pollination for representative species. Ordinations show a distinct difference between hummingbird‐pollinated species and hymenopteran‐pollinated species.

The subjects are penstemons. The ﬂowers of certain closely related penstemons differ dramatically. whereas certain distantly related species are eerily similar. This is due to the repeated evolution of hummingbird pollination from bee pollination. Our chapter explores the biology surrounding these evolutionary shifts. We start by deﬁning some useful shorthand. We construe “penstemons” to include the genus Penstemon and closely related genera. particularly Keckiella. a genus that has both bee-and bird-pollinated species. By “bees” we mean the superfamily Apoidea plus (improperly) the wasp Pseudomasaris vespoides. which forages like a bee and like a bee rears its young on pollen. We use “bee-ﬂowers.”“bird-ﬂowers.” and “pollination syndromes” to refer to species on one side or another of a pollinator shift. The degree to which a shift from bees to birds has occurred varies from case to case. and. in general. the notion of pollination syndromes tends to have unfortunate typological connotations (Armbruster et al. 2000; Thomson et al. 2000; Fenster et al. 2004; Waser. chap. 1 in this volume). By choosing penstemons. we focus on bilaterally symmetrical. nototribically pollinated ﬂowers with deeply recessed nectaries capable of quickly replenishing nectar after it has been removed; on ﬂowers that often bloom late in the season. when pollinators are generally abundant and hungry; and on plants that have diversiﬁed in patchy continental habitats.

Theory suggests that a plant’s pollen dosing strategy should evolve to match the abundance and pollen transfer efficiency of its pollinators. Simultaneous pollen presentation should be favored when pollinators are infrequent or efficient at delivering the pollen they remove. whereas gradual dosing should optimize delivery by frequent and wasteful pollinators. Among Penstemon and Keckiella species. anthers vary in ways that affect pollen release. and the morphology of dried anthers reliably indicates how they dispense pollen.

In the genus Penstemon. evolutionary shifts from insect pollination to more efficient hummingbird pollination have occurred repeatedly. resulting in the convergent evolution of floral traits commonly present in hummingbird-pollinated flowers. Two of these traits. a reduced or reflexed lower petal lip and a narrow corolla. were found in a previous flight-cage study to affect floral handling time by bumble bees. therefore potentially acting as “anti-bee” traits affecting preference. To test whether these traits do reduce bumble bee visitation in natural populations. we manipulated these two traits in flowers of bee-pollinated Penstemon strictus to resemble hummingbird-adapted close relatives and measured the preferences of …,True,HVvY9XwAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,17,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10682-014-9716-9.pdf,11167311993803814618,/scholar?cites=11167311993803814618,,https://www.uv.es/maclacas/PDFs/Zung.etal.EvolEcol.15.pdf,0,0,0
1138737,Meta-analysis of meta-analyses in plant evolutionary ecology,2012,Maria Clara Castellanos and Miguel Verdú,26,Evolutionary Ecology,5,1187-1196,Springer Netherlands,After two decades of meta-analyses on plant traits. we can now look for global emergent patterns in plant evolutionary ecology. Hundreds of meta-analyses have focused on the effects of specific selection pressures on plant fitness. and the buildup of such results allows us to ask general questions regarding selection pressures and plant responses. a major focus of evolutionary ecology. Plant traits are affected by both abiotic and biotic factors. For example. biotic pressures like herbivory may affect physiological (i.e. secondary defences) and reproductive (i.e. seed predation) traits. Similarly. abiotic pressures such as increased CO2 may affect both plant physiology and reproduction. We tested whether biotic or abiotic selective pressures are more important for plant traits. and if the strength of the response to those pressures depends on the plant trait studied by meta-analyzing published meta-analyses on …,True,HVvY9XwAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,17,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10682-012-9562-6.pdf,4469306237068031958,/scholar?cites=4469306237068031958,,https://www.uv.es/~verducam/Meta_Metaanalysis.pdf,0,0,0
1138738,Subindividual variation and genetic versus environmental effects on seed traits in a European Aquilegia,2008,MC Castellanos and M Medrano and CM Herrera,86,Botany,10,1125-1132,,Repetitive plant parts such as seeds can be characterized at the within-individual level not only by average values but also by higher moments of their distributions. such as the standard deviation. skewness. and kurtosis. These parameters can potentially be adaptive and shaped by selection like any other individual trait. but tend to be understudied. We present an example of how within-individual variation might be studied. We used a diallel crossing design to investigate the sources of phenotypic variance of among- and within-individual variation in seed and germination traits of the endemic columbine Aquilegia pyrenaica subsp. cazorlensis (Heywood) Galiano & Rivas Martínez. Individual plants and even fruits have their characteristic mean. standard deviation. skewness. and kurtosis and therefore these parameters could potentially respond to selection. However. we only found evidence of genetic variance in …,True,HVvY9XwAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,17,https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/B08-078,3420107495914404413,/scholar?cites=3420107495914404413,,https://www.uv.es/maclacas/PDFs/Castellanos.etal.Botany.08.pdf,0,0,0

1138740,Differential pollinator response underlies plant reproductive resilience after fires,2018,Yedra García and María Clara Castellanos and Juli G Pausas,122,Annals of botany,6,961-971,Oxford University Press,Assessing the resilience of plant–animal interactions is critical to understanding how plant communities respond to habitat disturbances. Most ecosystems experience some level of natural disturbance (e.g. wildfires) to which many organisms are adapted. Wildfires have structured biotic communities for millennia; however. the effects of fire on interactions such as pollination have only recently received attention. A few studies have shown that generalist plants can buffer the impact of fires by pollinator replacement. suggesting that the resilience to disturbance could depend on the level of specialization of the interactions. Here. we hypothesize that (1) fires could impose negative effects on plants with specialized pollination systems. and (2) in large wildfires. these negative effects will be stronger with increasing distance inside the burnt area because pollinators will need more …,True,HVvY9XwAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,12,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/122/6/961/5049247,16589347914445644763,/scholar?cites=16589347914445644763,,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/122/6/961/5049247,0,0,0

Knowledge on the effect of ecological factors in shaping their genetic patterns is also limited. In this study we investigate genetic diversity and population structure across 18 populations of Rosmarinus officinalis. a Mediterranean shrubland plant. Populations were sampled along two elevational gradients. one each on calcareous and siliceous soils in a mountain system in the eastern Iberian Peninsula. to decipher the effect of ecological factors on the genetic diversity and structure based on 11 microsatellite loci. We found overall high levels of genetic diversity and weak population structure.

1138742,Can facilitation influence the spatial genetics of the beneficiary plant population?,2014,Maria Clara Castellanos and Santiago Donat‐Caerols and Santiago C González‐Martínez and Miguel Verdú,102,Journal of ecology,5,1214-1221,,  Plant facilitation is a positive interaction where a nurse or nurse plant community alters the local conditions. improving the lifetime fitness of other beneficiary plants. In stressful environments. a common consequence is the formation of discrete vegetation patches under nurse plants. surrounded by open space. The consequences of such spatial patterns have been studied mostly at the community level. At the population level. facilitation causes a distribution of beneficiary individuals that could have intraspecific genetic consequences. The spatial patchiness and the increase in local aggregation can potentially affect the population fine‐scale genetic structure. In addition. marked microenvironmental differences under nurses versus outside could lead to plastic phenotypic variation between facilitated and non‐facilitated individuals. as for example reproductive asynchrony. potentially producing assortative mating …,True,HVvY9XwAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,12,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2745.12278,1178081878156705312,/scholar?cites=1178081878156705312,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2745.12278,0,0,0
