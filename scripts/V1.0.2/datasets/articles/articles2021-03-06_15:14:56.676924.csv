1158048,An essential role for a phospholipid transfer protein in yeast Golgi function,1990,Vytas A Bankaitis and Jacqueline R Aitken and Ann E Cleves and William Dowhan,347,Nature,6293,561-562,Nature Publishing Group,PROGRESSION of proteins through the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells involves a continuous rearrangement of macromolecular structures made up of proteins and phospholipids. The protein SEC14p is essential for transport of proteins from the yeast Golgi complex 1. Independent characterization of the SEC14 gene 2 and the PIT1 gene 3. which encodes a phosphatidy-linositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein in yeast. indicated that these two genes are identical. Phospholipid transfer proteins are a class of cytosolic proteins that are ubiquitous among eukaryotic cells and are distinguished by their ability to catalyse the exchange of phospholipids between membranesin vitro 4. We show here that the SEC14 and PIT1 genes are indeed identical and that the growth phenotype of a sec 14-1 ts mutant extends to the inability of its transfer protein to effect phospholipid transfer in vitro 4. 5.

1158049,Isolation of yeast mutants defective in protein targeting to the vacuole,1986,Vytas A Bankaitis and Lianna M Johnson and Scott D Emr,83,Proceedings of the national academy of sciences,23,9075-9079,National Academy of Sciences,"We have constructed a PRC1-SUC2 gene fusion that directs the synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of a hybrid polypeptide consisting of a 433-residue amino-terminal domain derived from the yeast vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y (CPY; EC 3.4.16.1) and a 511-residue carboxyl-terminal domain derived from the secreted yeast enzyme invertase (EC 3.2.1.26). Fractionation data indicated that this amount of CPY primary sequence is sufficient to quantitatively divert invertase to the yeast vacuole. The phenotypic consequence of localizing active invertase to the vacuole has enabled us to select for mutants that ""mislocalize"" the hybrid protein to the cell surface. The corresponding mutations that lead to this effect are all trans-acting and recessive. and they define at least eight complementation groups.

The most potent of these was found to be SEC9. a gene required for post-Golgi transport. The sole essential domain of Sec9 has significant sequence similarity to the neuronal protein SNAP-25. a component of the SNARE complex. that is implicated in vesicle targeting and fusion. Analogous to SNAP-25. Sec9 is bound to the yeast plasma membrane and is absent from post-Golgi vesicles. Furthermore. Sec9 is physically associated with two proteins that are homologous to components of the neuronal SNARE complex. Our results identify Sec9 as the yeast cognate of SNAP-25 and suggest that SNARE complexes acting at specific stages of vesicular transport serve as the ultimate targets of regulation by members of the Sec4/Ypt1/Rab family of GTPases.,True,LInsrMEAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,411,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867494901945,1945539167719394519,/scholar?cites=1945539167719394519,,,0,0,0
1158052,Mutations in the CDP-choline pathway for phospholipid biosynthesis bypass the requirement for an essential phospholipid transfer protein,1991,Ann E Cleves and Todd P McGee and Eric A Whitters and Kathleen M Champlon and Jacqueline R Altken and William Dowhan and Mark Goebl and Vytas A Bankaitis,64,Cell,4,789-800,Cell Press,SEC14p is the yeast phosphatidylinositol (PI)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) transfer protein. and it effects an essential stimulation of yeast Golgi secretory function. We now report that the SEC14p localizes to the yeast Golgi and that the SEC14p requirement can be specifically and efficiently bypassed by mutations in any one of at least six genes. One of these suppressor genes was the structural gene for yeast choline kinase (CKI). disruption of which rendered the cell independent of the normally essential SEC14p requirement.

The interaction of SecB with MBP was indicated by the finding that synthesis of various export-defective MBP species interfered with normal protein export by limiting SecB availability. The antifolding activity of SecB was demonstrated by the following: the defect in MBP export in SecB cells was suppressed by mutational alterations affecting MBP folding; export of a mutant MBP that is accomplished in a strictly posttranslational mode was totally blocked in SecB cells; and the rate of folding of wild-type MBP synthesized in vitro was found to be accelerated when SecB was absent and greatly retarded when excess SecB was present.,True,LInsrMEAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,361,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867488903893,6116066747736761626,/scholar?cites=6116066747736761626,,,0,0,0

Through the study of hybrid proteins. consisting of aminoterminal segments of CPY fused to the secretory enzyme invertase. we have found that the N-terminal 50 amino acids of CPY are sufficient to direct delivery of a CPY-Inv hybrid protein to the yeast vacuole. Our data suggest that this 50 amino acid segment of CPY contains two distinct functional domains; an N-terminal signal peptide followed by a segment of 30 amino acids that contains the vacuolar sorting signal. Deletion of this putative vacuole sorting signal from an otherwise wild-type CPY protein leads to missorting of CPY. Furthermore. examination of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides present on CPY and CPY-Inv hybrid proteins suggests that an additional determinant in CPY specifies the extent to which these …,True,LInsrMEAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC,323,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867487900845,13039609223832336086,/scholar?cites=13039609223832336086,,,0,0,0

This requirement can be relieved by inactivation of the cytosine 5'diphosphate (CDP)-choline pathway for phosphatidy1choline biosynthesis. indicating that Secl4p is an essential component of a regulatory pathway linking phospholipid metabolism with vesicle trafficking (the Secl4p pathway 1-6). Sac1p (refs 7 and 8) is an integral membrane protein related to inositol-5-phosphatases such as synaptojanin 9. a protein found in rat brain. Here we show that defects in Sac1p also relieve the requirement for Secl4p by altering phospholipid metabolism so as to expand the pool of diacylglycerol (DAG) in the Golgi. Moreover. although shortchain DAG improves secretory function in strains with a temperature-sensitive Secl4p. expression of diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli further impairs it.

In vivo. Sec14 activity is essential for vesicle budding from the Golgi complex 3. Here we report a three-dimensional structure for Sec14 at 2.5 Å resolution. Sec14 consists of twelve α-helices. six β-strands. eight 3 10-helices and has two distinct domains. The carboxy-terminal domain forms a hydrophobic pocket which. in the crystal ructure. is occupied by two molecules of n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and represents the phospholipid-binding domain. This pocket is reinforced by a string motif whose disruption in a sec14 temperature-sensitive mutant results in destabilization of the phospholipid-binding domain.

The Gα subunit Gpa1 can also promote signaling. but the effectors in this pathway are not well characterized. To identify candidate Gpa1 effectors. we expressed the constitutively active Gpa1Q323L mutant in each of nearly 5000 gene-deletion strains and measured mating-specific responses. Our analysis reveals a requirement for both the catalytic (Vps34) and regulatory (Vps15) subunits of the sole phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in yeast. We demonstrate that Gpa1 is present at endosomes. where it interacts directly with both Vps34 and Vps15 and stimulates increased production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Notably. Vps15 binds to GDP-bound Gpa1 and is predicted to have a seven-WD repeat structure similar to that of known G protein β subunits.

Despite much speculation. we know little about how and why specificity/promiscuity evolves in natural proteins. It is widely assumed that specific proteins evolved from more promiscuous ancient forms and that most proteins' specificity has been tuned to an optimal state by selection. Here we use ancestral protein reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of ligand recognition in the steroid hormone receptors (SRs). a family of hormone-regulated animal transcription factors. We resurrected the deepest ancestral proteins in the SR family and characterized the structure-activity relationships by which they distinguished among ligands. We found that that the most ancient split in SR evolution involved a discrete switch from an ancient receptor for aromatized estrogens—including xenobiotics—to a derived receptor that recognized non-aromatized progestagens and corticosteroids. The family's history. viewed in relation to the evolution of their ligands. suggests that SRs evolved according to a principle of minimal specificity: at each point in time. receptors evolved ligand recognition criteria that were just specific enough to parse the set of endogenous substances to which they were exposed. By studying the atomic structures of resurrected SR proteins. we found that their promiscuity evolved because the ancestral binding cavity was larger than the primary ligand and contained excess hydrogen bonding capacity. allowing adventitious recognition of larger molecules with additional functional groups.

High-order epistasis models assume the effects of mutations should add. when they could in fact multiply or combine in some other nonlinear way.

The ionizable moiety is ∼7 Å from solvent and ion paired with Glu‐122. This suggests that the pKa value of Lys‐38 is normal because the energetic penalty for dehydration is offset by a favorable Coulomb interaction.

We then compared trajectories through maps both with and without high-order epistasis. We found that high-order epistasis strongly shapes the accessibility and probability of evolutionary trajectories. A closer analysis revealed that the magnitude of epistasis. not its order. predicts is effects on evolutionary trajectories.

Usually. some sequence sites are ambiguously reconstructed. with two or more statistically plausible states. The extent to which the inferred functions and mutational effects are robust to uncertainty about the ancestral sequence has not been studied systematically.

Here we show. using a simple computational protein model. that protein evolution remains unpredictable. even if one knows the effects of all mutations in an ancestral protein background. We performed a virtual deep mutational scan—revealing the individual and pairwise epistatic effects of every mutation to our model protein—and then used this information to predict evolutionary trajectories. Our predictions were poor. This is a consequence of statistical thermodynamics. Proteins exist as ensembles of similar conformations. The effect of a mutation depends on the relative probabilities of conformations in the ensemble. which in turn. depend on the exact amino acid sequence of the protein.

The rates and energetics of a protein’s folding process. which is described by its energy landscape. are encoded in the amino acid sequence. Over the course of evolution. this landscape must be maintained such that the protein folds and remains folded over a biologically relevant time scale. How exactly a protein’s energy landscape is maintained or altered throughout evolution is unclear. To study how a protein’s energy landscape changed over time. we characterized the folding trajectories of ancestral proteins of the ribonuclease H (RNase H) family using ancestral sequence reconstruction to access the evolutionary history between RNases H from mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria.

Many S100 proteins bind Zn2+. Cu2+. and/or Mn2+ as part of their biological functions; however. the evolutionary origins of binding remain obscure. One key question is whether divalent transition metal binding is ancestral. or instead arose independently on multiple lineages. To tackle this question. we combined phylogenetics with biophysical characterization of modern S100 proteins. We demonstrate an earlier origin for established S100 subfamilies than previously believed. and reveal that transition metal binding is widely distributed across the tree. Using isothermal titration calorimetry. we found that Cu2+ and Zn2+ binding are common features of the family: the full breadth of human S100 paralogs—as well as two early-branching S100 proteins found in the tunicate Oikopleura dioica—bind these metals with μM affinity and stoichiometries ranging from 1:1 to 3:1 (metal:protein). While binding is consistent across the tree. structural responses to binding are quite variable. Further. mutational analysis and structural modeling revealed that transition metal binding occurs at different sites in different S100 proteins. This is consistent with multiple origins of transition metal binding over the evolution of this protein family. Our work reveals an evolutionary pattern in which the overall phenotype of binding is a constant feature of S100 proteins. even while the site and mechanism of binding is evolutionarily labile.,True,l-IhoaQAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,21,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164740,8102528054337530831,/scholar?cites=8102528054337530831,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164740,0,0,0

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) recognition by TLR4 has been shown to occur across the amniotes. but endogenous signaling through TLR4 has not been validated outside of placental mammals. To determine whether endogenous danger signaling is also shared across amniotes. we studied the evolution of TLR4-activation by the calgranulin proteins (S100A8. S100A9. and S100A12). a clade of host molecules that potently activate TLR4 in placental mammals. We performed phylogenetic and syntenic analysis and found MRP-126 — a gene in birds and reptiles — is likely orthologous to the mammalian calgranulins. We then used an ex vivo TLR4 activation assay to establish that calgranulin pro-inflammatory activity is not specific to placental mammals. but is also exhibited by representative marsupial and sauropsid species. This activity is strongly dependent on the cofactors CD14 and MD2 for all species studied. suggesting a conserved mode of activation across the amniotes. Ortholog complementation experiments between the calgranulins. TLR4. CD14. and MD2 revealed extensive lineage specific-coevolution and multi-way interactions between components that are necessary for the activation of NF-κB signaling by calgranulins and LPS.

S100A9 is one such multifunctional protein. It potently amplifies inflammation via Toll-like receptor four and is antimicrobial as part of a heterocomplex with S100A8. These two functions are seemingly regulated by proteolysis: S100A9 is readily degraded. while S100A8/S100A9 is resistant. We take an evolutionary biochemical approach to show that S100A9 evolved both functions and lost proteolytic resistance from a weakly proinflammatory. proteolytically resistant amniote ancestor. We identify a historical substitution that has pleiotropic effects on S100A9 proinflammatory activity and proteolytic resistance but has little effect on S100A8/S100A9 antimicrobial activity. We thus propose that mammals evolved S100A8/S100A9 antimicrobial and S100A9 proinflammatory activities concomitantly with a proteolytic ‘timer’ to selectively regulate S100A9.

Analyses in mouse and zebrafish have shown that myocardial function is not required for early steps of organogenesis. such as formation of the heart tube or chamber specification. However. whether myocardial function is required for later steps of cardiac development. such as endocardial cushion (EC) formation. has not been established. Recent technical advances and approaches have provided novel inroads toward the study of organogenesis. allowing us to examine the effects of both genetic and pharmacological perturbations of myocardial function on EC formation in zebrafish. To address whether myocardial function is required for EC formation. we examined silent heart (sih−/−) embryos. which lack a heartbeat due to mutation of cardiac troponin T (tnnt2). and observed that atrioventricular (AV) ECs do not form. Likewise. we determined that cushion formation is blocked in cardiofunk (cfk−/−) embryos. which exhibit cardiac dilation and no early blood flow. In order to further analyze the heart defects in cfk−/− embryos. we positionally cloned cfk and show that it encodes a novel sarcomeric actin expressed in the embryonic myocardium. The Cfks11 variant exhibits a change in a universally conserved residue (R177H). We show that in yeast this mutation negatively affects actin polymerization.

These lipids have both intrinsic signaling capabilities. and also serve as reservoirs for production of other second messengers. As general examples of the former case. phosphoinositides form discerning chemical platforms for spatial and temporal regulation of protein activities. and also serve as co-factors that allosterically regulate the activities of various enzymes and ion channels (McLaughlin and Murray. 2005).

The amplified products were ligated into the EcoR I and Xho I sites of the pET30a plasmid. a prokaryotic expressing vector. Then the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. Plasmids with correct cDNA fragment inserts were identified by digestion with two restriction enzymes and by DNA sequencing. Expression of cDNA fragments was made by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction. Western blotting was carried out to identify the functional site of Fc alpha R. Monoclonal antibodies against Fc alpha R were used as primary antibodies. RESULTS: Five recombinant plasmids expressing various fragments of Fc alpha R were constructed.

One-dimensional (1D) 19F NMR spectra of proteins can be broad. irregular and complex. due to exchange of probe nuclei between distinct electrostatic environments; and therefore cannot be deconvoluted and analyzed in an objective way using currently available software. We have developed a Python-based deconvolution program. decon1d. which uses Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to objectively determine which model (number of peaks) would most likely produce the experimentally obtained data. The method also allows for fitting of intermediate exchange spectra. which is not supported by current software in the absence of a specific kinetic model. In current methods. determination of the deconvolution model best supported by the data is done manually through comparison of residual error values. which can be time consuming and requires model selection by the user. In contrast. the BIC method used by decond1d provides a quantitative method for model comparison that penalizes for model complexity helping to prevent over-fitting of the data and allows identification of the most parsimonious model.

The study focuses on the optimal responses of size. development time. and growth rate to changes in the amount of time available for completion of the life cycle.

While it has been shown that herbivory has repeatedly led to increased diversification rates in insects. there has been no compelling explanation for how plant-feeding has promoted speciation rates. There is a growing awareness that ecological factors can lead to rapid diversification and. as one of the most prominent features of most insect-plant interactions. specialization onto a diverse resource has often been assumed to be the main process behind this diversification. However. specialization is mainly a pruning process. and is not able to actually generate diversity by itself. Here we investigate the role of host colonizations in generating insect diversity. by testing if insect speciation rate is correlated with resource diversity.

Male and female reproductive optima invariably differ because the potential reproductive rate of males almost always exceeds that of females: females are selected to maximize mate ‘quality’. while males can increase fitness through mate ‘quantity’. A dynamic. sexually selected conflict therefore exists in which ‘competitive’ males are selected to override the preference tactics evolved by ‘choosy’ females. The wide variation across taxa in mating systems therefore generates variance in the outcome of intrasexual conflict and the strength of sexual selection: monandry constrains reproductive heterozygosity and allows female choice to select and maintain particular (preferred) genes; polyandry promotes reproductive heterozygosity and will more likely override female choice.

A high SSD could. however. be attained if the larvae of the larger sex pass through a higher number of larval instars.2. Based on a survey of published case studies. the present review shows that sex‐related difference in the number of instars is a widespread phenomenon among insects. In the great majority of species with a sexually dimorphic instar number. females develop through a higher number of instars than males.3. Female‐biased sexual dimorphism in final sizes in species with sexually dimorphic instar number was found to considerably exceed a previously estimated median value of SSD for insects in general. This suggests a causal connection between high female‐biased SSD. and additional instars in females.

In this paper we investigate host plant preference of the polyphagous butterfly Polygonia c-album (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) and compare it with several aspects of the life history of its offspring (growth rate. development time. adult size. survival and female fecundity). Females and offspring were tested on four naturally used host plants (Urtica dioica. Ulmus glabra. Salix caprea. and Betula pubescens). There was substantial individual variation in host plant preference. including reversals in rank order. but the differences were largely confined to differences in the ranking of Urtica dioica and S. caprea.

For this purpose we develop a general method for reconstructing the coevolutionary history of an association from the phylogenies of the component groups and an association matrix describing the associations between the species. We focus on the evolution of the traits that determine which species are associated. and therefore set up a null model with no change in these traits. Furthermore. we distinguish among three different processes that change association patterns: (1) colonization. whereby new associations are created; (2) exclusion. whereby old associations disappear; and (3) successive specialization. through which ancestral associations split into two or more descendant associations.

1158164,Why do males emerge before females?,1977,Christer Wiklund and Torbjörn Fagerström,31,Oecologia,2,153-158,Springer-Verlag,In butterflies and many other insects there is a general tendency for males to emerge before females. This is known as protandry. In this paper we advance the hypothesis that protandry is a reproductive strategy of males. resulting from competition for mates. and should primarily occur in species maintaining female monogamy. Our hypothesis is corroborated by applying a mathematical treatment to a theoretical population with seven defined properties. all of which are argued to be reasonable assumptions for natural populations.,True,CM5_HzIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,454,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00346917.pdf,10439705398361883025,/scholar?cites=10439705398361883025,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christer_Wiklund/publication/226820056_Why_do_males_emerge_before_females/links/004635360e8a7a6d85000000.pdf,0,0,0

Unlike most previous studies. our models assume that growth rate is an adaptively flexible character that can be increased at the expense of a greater juvenile mortality rate. Three components of fitness are considered: the cost of developing at a suboptimal time of the year. the reproductive advantage of larger adult size. and the increased mortality from rapid juvenile growth. The study focuses on the optimal responses of size. development time. and growth rate to changes in the amount of time available for completion of the life cycle. The models show that the optimal growth rate and size at maturity may respond in several different ways.

To decide whether these preferences are controlled by one or two gene complexes. oviposition preferences and larval survival of a Scandinavian population were investigated with regard to all potential host plants in the region. The experiments revealed a substantial difference between the potential host plant ranges of the adults and the larvae. indicating that adult and larval host plant preferences are determined by separate gene complexes.Based on this inference. a theoretical model is developed for the co-evolutionary relationship between adult oviposition preferences and larval feeding preferences for species in which the host plant choice is exercised by the adults.,True,CM5_HzIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,343,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00345421,7749772073334487360,/scholar?cites=7749772073334487360,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42353996/Wiklund_C._The_evolutionary_relationship20160207-29532-5lxyd7.pdf,0,0,0

The allometric line between ejaculate mass and male body mass has a higher elevation in the pierids compared to the satyrids. The mean number of matings performed by the pierid species is also higher compared to the mean of the satyrids.

However. after reviewing the literature we find that the fundamental basis of this theory. i.e.. that aposematic prey are killed when tasted by predators. has not been demonstrated but only assumed. In fact it has repeatedly been shown that aposematic prey are often released unharmed after being tasted by wild. or wildcaught. amphibian. reptile. avian. and mammal predators. In the present paper we demonstrate that naive bird predators also often release distasteful prey insects unharmed after tasting them.

We have earlier shown that. if the eclosion period of females is regarded as given. males should emerge before females to achieve maximal reproductive success. However. females may also be considered to have a reproductive strategy with respect to the issue “when to emerge”. In this paper we assume that females are selected to minimize the time spent unmated (to minimize prereproductive death). and analyze when females should optimally emerge in relation to males to achieve this end. We show that there is no conflict between the sexes with respect to the timing of eclosion when the length of the eclosion period is approximately equal for males and females.

Releases of virgin females suggest that the sunspots are used as mating rendezvous sites.

A dynamic. sexually selected conflict therefore exists in which ‘competitive’ males are selected to override the preference tactics evolved by ‘choosy’ females. The wide variation across taxa in mating systems therefore generates variance in the outcome of intrasexual conflict and the strength of sexual selection: monandry constrains reproductive heterozygosity and allows female choice to select and maintain particular (preferred) genes; polyandry promotes reproductive heterozygosity and will more likely override female choice.

Therefore selection should favour an increase in body size given that these females get opportunities to realize their potential advantage by maturing and laying more eggs. However. ectotherm physiology is strongly temperature‐dependent. and activities are carried out sufficiently only within certain temperature ranges. Thus it remains unclear if the fecundity advantage of a large size is fully realized in natural environments. where thermal conditions are limiting.  2 Insect fecundity might be limited by temperature at two levels; first eggs need to mature. and then the female needs time for strategic ovipositing of the egg. Since a female cannot foresee the number of oviposition opportunities that she will encounter on a given day. the optimal rate of egg maturation will be governed by trade‐offs associated with egg‐ and time‐limited oviposition.

A high rate of reproduction may be costly if ecological factors limit immediate reproductive output as a fast metabolism compromises own future survival. Individuals with more reserves need more time and opportunity to realize their reproductive potential. Theory therefore predicts that the reproductive rate. defined as the investment in early reproduction in proportion to total potential. should decrease with body size within species.2. However. metabolic constraints on body size‐ and temperature‐dependent biological rates may impede biophysical adaptation. Furthermore. the sequential manner resources that are allocated to somatic vs. reproductive tissue during ontogeny may. when juveniles develop in unpredictable environments. further contribute to non‐adaptive variation in adult reproductive rates.3.

As individuals that follow alternative developmental pathways will experience different selective environments the diapause decision may evolve to a cascade switch that induces additional adaptive developmental differences downstream of the diapause decision.

In the population with ongoing selection on both pathways. the difference between pathways in development time and growth rate was larger. whereas the difference in body size was smaller compared with the population experiencing relaxed selection on one pathway.

Intralocus sexual conflict can be alleviated by the evolution of sex-limited genetic architectures and phenotypic expression. but pleiotropic constraints may hinder this process. Here. we explored putative intralocus sexual conflict and genetic (co)variance in a poorly understood behavior with near male-limited expression. Same-sex sexual behaviors (SSBs) generally do not conform to classic evolutionary models of adaptation but are common in male animals and have been hypothesized to result from perception errors and selection for high male mating rates. However. perspectives incorporating sex-specific selection on genes shared by males and females to explain the expression and evolution of SSBs have largely been neglected. We performed two parallel sex-limited artificial selection experiments on SSB in male and female seed beetles. followed by sex-specific assays of locomotor activity and male sex recognition (two traits hypothesized to be functionally related to SSB) and adult reproductive success (allowing us to assess fitness consequences of genetic variance in SSB and its correlated components). Our experiments reveal both shared and sex-limited genetic variance for SSB. Strikingly. genetically correlated responses in locomotor activity and male sex-recognition were associated with sexually antagonistic fitness effects. but these effects differed qualitatively between male and female selection lines. implicating intralocus sexual conflict at both male- and female-specific …,True,91ko_8EAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,22,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0658-4?optIn=false,7296746071435370864,/scholar?cites=7296746071435370864,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-016-0658-4?optIn=false,0,0,0

Using three closely related butterflies. we first show that foraging behaviours differ between species and change remarkably throughout ontogeny causing corresponding differences in the thermal niches experienced by the foraging larvae.

To critically assess which approaches represent advances towards the goal of joint predictions of abundance and distribution. we review recent work on changing distributions and on effects of environmental drivers on single populations. Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance. but others cannot. In parallel. demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single …,True,5q7OGUAAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC,279,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12410,17512655371656519074,/scholar?cites=17512655371656519074,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ele.12410,0,0,0

In this review. we first present a conceptual framework of the strength of pre-dispersal seed predation and its variation in space and time. We consider the interaction between plants and their seed predators to be “strong” when it affects plant population dynamics or causes changes in plant trait–fitness relationships. and “weak” when it has no such effects. and propose ways of how to adequately assess these effects. Second. we review the ecological literature between 1991 and 2005 to evaluate documented effects of pre-dispersal seed predation on plants and draw five major conclusions.

1158225,The mechanisms causing extinction debts,2013,Kristoffer Hylander and Johan Ehrlén,28,,6,341-346,Elsevier Current Trends,Extinction debts can result from many types of habitat changes involving mechanisms other than metapopulation processes. This is a fact that most recent literature on extinction debts pays little attention to. We argue that extinction debts can arise because (i) individuals survive in resistant life-cycle stages long after habitat quality change. (ii) stochastic extinctions of populations that have become small are not immediate. and (iii) metapopulations survive long after that connectivity has decreased if colonization–extinction dynamics is slow. A failure to distinguish between these different mechanisms and to simultaneously consider both the size of the extinction debt and the relaxation time hampers our understanding of how extinction debts arise and our ability to prevent ultimate extinctions.,True,5q7OGUAAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,186,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953471300027X,3077594739003542025,/scholar?cites=3077594739003542025,,,0,0,0

A reserve-ovary model,1991,Johan Ehrlen,138,The American Naturalist,4,918-933,University of Chicago Press,A low fruit: flower ratio has been observed in many plant species. and several functional advantages of nonfruiting flowers have been proposed. One hypothesis is that surplus flowers provide an ovary reserve in case of loss due to unpredictable external mortality at the flower level. In this article a quantitative model is proposed in which the optimal flower number is a function of two fitness costs. First. each flower represents a cost that reduces potential seed production. Second. those cases in which fruit production is ovary limited represent a cost. The model predicts that more flowers may be produced than there are resources necessary for them to develop to maturity. even if the only function of the surplus flowers is to serve as reserve ovaries. The number of surplus flowers increases with increasing fruit-cost: flower-cost ratio and increasing ovary mortality.

The largest contribution to this decrease in total fitness occurred through a decreased survival of established plants.

This follows under the hypothesis that both females and offspring are ultimately favoured by utilizing only the most suitable host(s). We develop an experimental approach to identify such trade-offs. i.e. larval costs associated with being a host generalist. and apply a suite of experiments to two sympatric and syntopic populations of the closely related butterflies Pieris napi and Pieris rapae.

Seasonal timing is expected to be particularly important for species that are dependent on resources available during a short time window—so-called phenological specialists—and latitudinal clines in seasonality are expected to favor local adaptation in phenological timing. However. to what degree latitudinal variation in diapause dynamics and post-winter development due to such local adaptation is influenced by the degree of phenological specialization is not well known.

Therefore. many insect–plant interactions result in a developmental race. where herbivores need to complete their development before plants become unsuitable. while plants strive to minimize damage from herbivores by outgrowing them.

1158253,Effects of climate on phenological synchrony between butterflies and their host plants,2015,Diana Posledovich,,,,,,Phenology–seasonal timing of life history events–is an essential and at the same time easily observed trait of periodic biological phenomena. An appropriate phenological timetable ensures that life-cycle activities are welltimed to coincide with environmental conditions most suitable for growth. reproduction or dormancy. Moreover. in order to occur. the majority of species interactions require a temporal overlap of organisms in certain developmental stages. For example. larval emergence needs to coincide with leaf unfolding in trees. while hatching of bird nestlings needs to be timed to larval peak abundance. The degree of the temporal overlap determines the strength of a species interaction (Russell & Louda 2004; van Asch & Visser 2007). Interactions that can occur only within a narrow time window are considered to be more sensitive to temporal mismatches between the partner species. Therefore. such relationships are likely to face more severe fitness consequences from phenological asynchrony. caused by shifts in species spring phenologies under climate change.Changes in species phenologies. associated with climate change. have been well-documented in many systems across the world (Root et al. 2003; Parmesan 2007).

Here. we examine the immune system response and consequences of exposing a lepidopteran agricultural pest to non-infectious microorganisms via simple oral consumption. Immune system response was compared between Trichoplusia ni larvae reared on diets with or without non-pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus). Two major immune response-related enzymatic activities responded to diets differently – phenoloxidase activity was inhibited in the bacteria-fed larvae. whereas general antibacterial activity was enhanced. Eight proteins were highly expressed in the hemolymph of the bacteria fed larvae. among them immune response related proteins arylphorin. apolipophorin III and gloverin. Expression response among 25 putative immune response-related genes were assayed via RT-qPCR. Seven showed more than fivefold up regulation in the presence of bacterial diet. with 22 in total being differentially expressed. among them apolipophorin III. cecropin. gallerimycin. gloverin. lysozyme. and phenoloxidase …,True,UNYiJysAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,179,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-5-56,15623730639682344681,/scholar?cites=15623730639682344681,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-5-56,0,0,0

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of polyandry. It is assumed that females gain either material or genetic benefits from multiple matings. or that they are coerced into mating by males. In water striders. mating is generally assumed to be costly to females. and they are thought to mate for reasons of convenience. adjusting their resistance to mating according to male harassment. Here. we tested the effect of number of matings (with the same male) and number of partners on female fitness in a water strider Aquarius paludum.

We tested this by exploring mating frequencies of Pieris napi females along a latitudinal gradient in different generations. Pieris napi is a bivoltine butterfly. and genetically polyandrous females enjoy higher lifetime fecundity than monandrous ones. Polyandry is. however. coupled with a relatively low early fecundity.

This phenomenon has been little explored so far. yet it can have significant impact on resource use. realized niches and species co-existence. In particular. the time-scale and the ecological context over which such shifts can occur are unknown. We examined with a long-term (four years) field experiment whether experimentally manipulated. species-specific. nest-site feature preferences (symbols on nest boxes) are transmitted across breeding seasons and affect future nest-site preferences in a guild of three cavity-nesting birds. Of the examined species. resident great tits (Parus major) preferred the symbol that had been associated with unoccupied nest boxes in the previous year. i.e.. their preference shifted towards niche space previously unused by putative competitors and conspecifics. Our results show that animals can remember the earlier resource use of conspecifics and other guild members and adjust own decisions accordingly one year after. Our experiment cannot reveal the ultimate mechanism(s) behind the observed behaviour but avoiding costs of intra- or interspecific competition or ectoparasite load in old nests are plausible reasons.

Copying behavior was stronger for naive individuals but also differed between years. which could be explained by contrasting seasonality in the demonstrator species. Past experience as reflected by age affected subsequent use of social information: pairs with a yearling male were more likely to copy the heterospecific preference than pairs with older immigrant males. There was no general pattern in successive individual choices over the years. Accordingly. individual repeatability in copying tit preference was very low. At the pair level. we estimated sex-specific direct and indirect genetic effects on the joint nest site decision and found no sex-specific heritability and no cross-sex genetic correlation.

The magnitude of inbreeding costs varies among taxa and may increase under stressful conditions. Inbreeding tolerance is expected to be low and selection for inbreeding avoidance intense when both sexes invest substantially in shared offspring like in nuptial gift-giving butterflies. This is especially true for increasing mating rate for inbreeding avoidance as nuptial feeding decreases net costs of mating for females. We explored implications of inbreeding in the nuptial gift-giving green-veined white butterfly. Pieris napi. Compared to outbred ones. partially inbred (F = 0.25) eggs and neonate larvae had 25% lower hatching success and 30% lower survival until adult eclosion. respectively.

This oxygen-dependent induction of moulting (ODIM) hypothesis stems from the fact that the tracheal respiratory system of insects grows primarily at moults. whereas tissue mass increases massively between moults. This may result in a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand at the end of each larval instar because oxygen demand of growing tissues exceeds the relatively fixed supply capacity of the respiratory system. The ODIM hypothesis predicts that. within larval instars. respiration and metabolic rates of an individual larva first increase with increasing body mass but eventually level off once the supply capacity of the tracheal system starts to constrain metabolism. Here. we provide the first individual-level test of this key prediction of the ODIM hypothesis.

In holometabolous insects. resource allocation to different functions during metamorphosis relies completely on larval-derived resources. At adult eclosion. resource allocation to the abdomen at the expense of other body parts can be seen as a rough estimate of resource allocation to reproduction. Theory suggests geographic variation in resource allocation to the abdomen. but there are currently no empirical data on it. We measured resource allocation to the abdomen at adult eclosion in four geometrid moths along a latitudinal gradient.

Such knowledge is accumulating for holometabolous insects. whose growth is characterised and body size affected by moulting. According to the oxygen-dependent induction of moulting (ODIM) hypothesis. moult is induced at a critical mass at which oxygen demand of growing tissues overrides the supply from the tracheal respiratory system. which principally grows only at moults. Support for the ODIM hypothesis is controversial. partly because of a lack of proper data to explicitly test the hypothesis.

A recent meta‐analysis of phenotypic selection studies in natural populations suggested that directional sexual selection may be stronger in magnitude than directional natural selection. although this pattern may have partly been confounded by the different time scales over which selection was estimated.

This reciprocal exploitation is evident in the more than a thousand plant species that are pollinated exclusively by insects specialized to lay their eggs in the flowers they pollinate. By pollinating each flower in which she lays eggs. an insect guarantees that her larval offspring have developing seeds on which to feed. whereas the plant gains a specialized pollinator at the cost of some seeds. These mutualisms are often reciprocally obligate. potentially driving not only ongoing coadaptation but also diversification.

The butterflies of the cryptic Leptidea complex are sympatrically distributed in different combinations across their Eurasian range. Interestingly. the same species is a habitat generalist in some regions and a habitat specialist in others. where a sibling species has the habitat generalist role. Previous studies suggest that this geographically variable niche divergence is generated by local processes in different contact zones. By varying the absolute and relative densities of Leptidea sinapis and Leptidea juvernica in large outdoor cages. we show that female mating success is unaffected by conspecific density. but strongly negatively affected by the density of the other species.

This decision is typically guided by environmental cues experienced during development. An early decision makes it possible to adjust growth rate. which would allow the growing larva to respond to time stress involved in direct development. whereas a last-minute decision would instead allow the larva to use up-to-date information about which developmental pathway is the most favourable under the current circumstances.

The trade-off of either using few host plant species and being a strong competitor on them due to effective utilization or using a wide host plant range but being a poor competitor is further predicted to result in host plant specialization. This follows under the hypothesis that both females and offspring are ultimately favoured by utilizing only the most suitable host(s).

In this study. floral scent variation was investigated in four species of woodland stars (Lithophragma spp.) that share the same major pollinator (the moth Greya politella. a floral parasite). Three specific hypotheses were tested: (1) sharing the same specific major pollinator favours conservation of floral scent among close relatives; (2) selection favours ‘private channels’ of rare compounds particularly aimed at the specialist pollinator; or (3) selection from rare. less-specialized co-pollinators mitigates the conservation of floral scent and occurrence of private channels …,True,-qkgZLcAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,35,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/111/4/539/113984,10610061879133440322,/scholar?cites=10610061879133440322,,https://academic.oup.com/aob/article-pdf/111/4/539/17069483/mct007.pdf,0,0,0

A high rate of reproduction may be costly if ecological factors limit immediate reproductive output as a fast metabolism compromises own future survival. Individuals with more reserves need more time and opportunity to realize their reproductive potential. Theory therefore predicts that the reproductive rate. defined as the investment in early reproduction in proportion to total potential. should decrease with body size within species.2. However. metabolic constraints on body size‐ and temperature‐dependent biological rates may impede biophysical adaptation. Furthermore. the sequential manner resources that are allocated to somatic vs. reproductive tissue during ontogeny may. when juveniles develop in unpredictable environments. further contribute to non‐adaptive variation in adult reproductive rates.3.

When natural selection acts on a phenotype. it usually results in reduction in the levels of genetic variation at the causal loci. and the surrounding linked loci. due to recombination dynamics (ie linkage); the degree to which natural selection influences the genetic differentiation in the linked regions depends on the local recombination rates.Studies investigating the role of genetic divergence and recombination are common in model species such as Drosophila melanogaster.

The Colorado potato beetle. Leptinotarsa decemlineata. is an invasive pest of potato that has rapidly spread from low latitudes to higher latitudes. During the last 30 years. a decrease in range expansion speed is apparent in Europe.

Yet despite their importance. we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs. Many species of Colias butterflies exhibit an alternative life history strategy (ALHS) where females divert resources from wing pigment synthesis to reproductive and somatic development. Due to this reallocation. a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS: either yellow/orange or white. Here we map the locus associated with this ALHS in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion located downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1. a homeobox transcription factor.

Direct effects of climate change on agricultural pests in Europe are difficult to dissect from all the human-induced changes that have taken place in parallel with an increased mean annual temperature. During the past decade. agriculture has become more professionalized in terms of land use. crop cultivation techniques and pest management strategies. We review the effect of climate change on agricultural pests by comparing the speed of range expansion of pest species to non-pest species. It seems that the poleward range shift has been faster for pest than non-pest species. We attribute this partly to the globalization of agriculture as human-assisted movement has broken many natural dispersal barriers.

One such ALHS. known as Alba. exists within females of many species in the butterfly genus Colias.

An empirical test at the individual level,2016,Sami M Kivelä and Philipp Lehmann and Karl Gotthard,219,Journal of Experimental Biology,19,3061-3071,The Company of Biologists Ltd,Recent data suggest that oxygen limitation may induce moulting in larval insects. This oxygen-dependent induction of moulting (ODIM) hypothesis stems from the fact that the tracheal respiratory system of insects grows primarily at moults. whereas tissue mass increases massively between moults. This may result in a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand at the end of each larval instar because oxygen demand of growing tissues exceeds the relatively fixed supply capacity of the respiratory system. The ODIM hypothesis predicts that. within larval instars. respiration and metabolic rates of an individual larva first increase with increasing body mass but eventually level off once the supply capacity of the tracheal system starts to constrain metabolism. Here. we provide the first individual-level test of this key prediction of the ODIM hypothesis.

Undergoing range expansion insects can face a change in the local photoperiod to which they need to resynchronize. Rapid range expansion can be associated with rapid photoperiodic adaptation. which can be associated with intense selection on strongly heritable polygenic traits. Alternatively. it is proposed that. in insects with an XO sex‐determination system. genes with large effect residing on the sex chromosome could drive photoperiodic adaptation because the gene or genes are exposed to selection in the sex carrying only a single X‐chromosome.

Eight insulin-like peptides (DILP1-8) have been identified in Drosophila and several of these are known to regulate growth. metabolism. reproduction. stress responses and lifespan. However. the functional role of DILP1 is far from understood. Previous work has shown that dilp1/DILP1 is transiently expressed mainly during the pupal stage and the first days of adult life. Here we study the role of dilp1 in the pupa. as well as in first week of adult life. and make some comparisons to dilp6 that displays a similar pupal expression profile. but is expressed in fat body rather than brain neurosecretory cells. We show that mutation of dilp1 diminishes organismal weight during pupal development. whereas overexpression increases it. similar to dilp6 manipulations. No growth effects of dilp1 or dilp6 manipulations were detected during larval development. We next show that dilp1 and dilp6 increase metabolic rate in the late pupa and promote lipids as the primary source of catabolic energy. Effects of dilp1 manipulations can also be seen in the adult fly. In newly eclosed female flies. survival during starvation is strongly diminished in dilp1 mutants. but not in dilp2 and dilp1-dilp2 mutants. whereas in older flies only the double mutants display reduced starvation resistance. Starvation resistance is not affected in male dilp1 mutant flies. suggesting a sex dimorphism in dilp1 function.

However. how metabolic rate and life-history traits co-evolve remains unclear. For instance. the energetic demands of life-history traits. including the number of energy allocation trade-offs. is unlikely to remain constant over ontogeny. Therefore. the predicted coevolution between metabolic rate and life-history could be specific to particular ontogenetic stages. rather than a stable property of an organism. Here. we test the ontogenetic dependency of the coevolution between metabolic rate and the pace of life-history. under strictly standardized conditions using 30 species of killifish. which are either annual species adapted to ephemeral pools or non-annual species inhabiting more permanent waterbodies. Standard metabolic rates were estimated at three ontogenetic stages. together with relevant life-history traits. i.e. growth (juveniles). maturity (young adults). and reproductive rate (reproductive adults). Life-history traits largely followed predicted pace-of-life patterns. with overall faster/higher rates in annual species. The divergences in life-history traits across species tended to increase over ontogeny. being smallest during juvenile growth and largest in reproductive adults. However. associations between life-history strategy and metabolic rate followed a reversed pattern. being strongest in juveniles. but lowest in reproductive adults.

Although this temperature‐size rule is well established. a general explanation for this phenomenon has remained elusive.

Body size‐and temperature‐dependent egg maturation and oviposition in a butterfly,2008,David Berger and Richard Walters and Karl Gotthard,22,Functional Ecology,3,523-529,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,  1 Large female insects usually have high potential fecundity. Therefore selection should favour an increase in body size given that these females get opportunities to realize their potential advantage by maturing and laying more eggs. However. ectotherm physiology is strongly temperature‐dependent. and activities are carried out sufficiently only within certain temperature ranges. Thus it remains unclear if the fecundity advantage of a large size is fully realized in natural environments. where thermal conditions are limiting.  2 Insect fecundity might be limited by temperature at two levels; first eggs need to mature. and then the female needs time for strategic ovipositing of the egg. Since a female cannot foresee the number of oviposition opportunities that she will encounter on a given day. the optimal rate of egg maturation will be governed by trade‐offs associated with egg‐ and time‐limited oviposition.

Time limitation during oviposition reduces the fecundity benefit of female size in a butterfly,2007,Karl Gotthard and David Berger and Richard Walters,169,The American Naturalist,6,768-779,The University of Chicago Press,Laboratory studies of insects suggest that female fecundity may increase very rapidly with adult size and that mass may often increase close to exponentially with time during larval growth. These relationships make it difficult to see how realistic levels of larval mortality can outweigh the fecundity benefit of prolonged growth. Hence. it is unclear why many insects do not become bigger. In this study. we experimentally explore the relationship between female size and fecundity in the butterfly Pararge aegeria and show that thermally induced time limitation during oviposition may substantially reduce the fecundity benefit of larger females.

Mechanisms that can balance the benefits associated with increased growth are poorly understood. raising the question: what keeps insects from becoming larger? If predation risk was to increase with juvenile size. it would make an extension of development very risky. favouring smaller final sizes.

This variation had a significant genetic component. There was a trade‐off between clutch size and offspring size between and within populations. Under favourable thermal and feeding conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced the largest clutches of the smallest eggs. but under poor conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced small clutches of very large offspring.

Yet. the constraints set by these molecular features are often neglected within eco-evolutionary theory. Here. by applying a biophysical model of protein evolution. we demonstrate that rising global temperatures are expected to intensify natural selection systematically throughout the genome by increasing the effects of sequence variation on protein phenotypes. Our model further suggests that warm and cold adapted species are expected to show the same temperature-dependent increase in the strength of selection. We tested these predictions using lines of seed beetle evolved at ancestral or warm temperature for 70-85 generations. According to predictions. fitness effects of randomly induced mutations were stronger at elevated temperature for both ancestral and warm-adapted lines. We then calculated 98 estimates from the literature. comparing selection on induced mutations across stressful and benign environments in a diverse set of ectothermic organisms. ranging from viruses and unicellular bacteria and fungi. to multicellular plants and animals. We first show that environmental stress per se generally does not increase the strength of selection on new mutations. However. according to prediction. elevated temperature systematically increased the mean strength of selection on genome-wide polymorphism. These results bear witness to and extend the universal temperature dependence of biological rates and have important implications for global patterns of genetic diversity and the rate and …,True,mqCzSoIAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C,7,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/12/14/268011.full.pdf,2398408288209686465,/scholar?cites=2398408288209686465,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/12/14/268011.full.pdf,0,0,0

Movement is often studied using mechanistic models. extrapolating short-term observations of individuals to longer-term predictions. but the role of weather variables such as air temperature and solar radiation. key determinants of ectotherm activity. are generally neglected. We aim to show how the effects of weather can be incorporated into individual-based models of butterfly movement thus allowing analysis of their effects. We constructed a mechanistic movement model and calibrated it with high precision movement data on a widely studied species of butterfly. the meadow brown (Maniola jurtina). collected over a 21-week period at four sites in southern England. Day time temperatures during the study ranged from 14.5 to 31.5 °C and solar radiation from heavy cloud to bright sunshine. The effects of weather are integrated into the individual-based model through weather-dependent scaling of parametric distributions representing key behaviours: the durations of flight and periods of inactivity. Flight speed was unaffected by weather. time between successive flights increased as solar radiation decreased. and flight duration showed a unimodal response to air temperature that peaked between approximately 23 °C and 26 °C. After validation. the model demonstrated that weather alone can produce a more than two-fold difference in predicted weekly displacement.

Such changes in distribution would occur at the level of the population. stemming not from changes in the pattern of individuals' movements. but from changes in the ratios of extinctions to colonizations at the northern and southern boundaries of the range.

This work was conducted to assess validity of this assumption. As a result of a systematic literature survey. datasets for 158 insect species were retrieved. Each dataset contained adult or pupal weights of males and females for two or more different subsets. typically originating from different conditions during immature development. For each species. an analysis was conducted to examine dependence of SSD on body size. the latter variable being used as a proxy of environmental quality. A considerable variation in SSD was revealed at the intraspecific level in insects.

Ltd.,Potential fecundity of Epirrita autumnata females is strongly correlated with pupal weight. Adult feeding weakly increases fecundity but does not eliminate its dependence on body size. Daily numbers of eggs laid are positively correlated with body size. However. night minimum temperature is the main determinant of oviposition rate under fluctuating natural temperatures. Adult mortality was estimated to be low in a subarctic forest in autumn. Based on these results. we constructed a simulation model predicting oviposition rate and realized fecundity under given weather conditions. The model indicates that expected realized fecundity strongly depends on female size also under field conditions. This causes selection for large body (abdomen) size which is a probable reason for lack of fine-tuned adult behaviour in E. autumnata.

Directional selection favouring increased body sizes is thus predicted in the absence of opposing selection pressure. The evolutionary forces capable of counterbalancing such a 'fecundity advantage' are poorly documented. This study focuses on revealing the costs of large body size in the wingless females of Orgyia antiqua and O. leucostigma. two related species of lymantriid moths. Extreme behavioural simplicity of these animals allows systematic assessment of various fitness components in conditions that are close to natural.

Reaction norms for size and age at maturity were studied in Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera. Geometridae). Growth rates were manipulated by rearing larvae on different levels of food quality and quantity. and instar‐specific final weights and development times were recorded.2. Food level and initial weight of an instar accounted for most of the variance in final weights. Sexual dimorphism in pupal weights could be entirely ascribed to sex differences in initial weights of the last instar.3. There were problems with considering the reaction norms optimal within the conventional demographic explanatory framework. Because fecundity increases linearly with body size and no costs of large adult size are known. one should expect female larvae to grow larger to increase their individual fitness.

Therefore. the oviposition behaviour of E. autumnata is typical for an outbreak species and certainly contributes to the eruptive population dynamics of the species.

We proceeded from the idea that a maximiser should be unable to further improve its growth performance. i.e. there should be no adaptive plasticity in relative growth rates. In the case of an insect larva always maximising its weight gain. we should thus expect no increase in growth rate following a short‐term environmental perturbation. Another prediction is that initial and final weights of a larval instar should be highly correlated. We applied this approach to test for the growth rate maximiser status of the geometrid moth Epirrita autumnata.

In particular. it is often not clear if the individuals of the ultimately larger sex are larger already at hatching/birth. do they grow faster. or do they grow for a longer time.

The inspection of postfire trends in the diversity of ecological communities incorporating phylogenetic information allows to better understand the mechanisms driving fire resilience. While fire reduces plant phylogenetic diversity based on the recruitment of evolutionarily related species with postfire seed persistence. it increases that of soil microbes by limiting soil resources and changing the dominance of competing microbes. Thus. during postfire community reassembly. plant and soil microbes might experience opposing temporal trends in their phylogenetic diversity that are linked through changes in the soil conditions.

The short average dispersal distances suggest that the probability of colonisation of vacant patches decreases rapidly as the distance between the source and target patches increases. which means that a dense habitat network is needed for the conservation of the species. Both emigration rate and the number of immigrants varied among patches and were not affected only by isolation but also by several other patch characteristics. The model that explained most of the variation in emigration rates among patches included patch area and the number of conspecifics.

In some insects. there is variation in fecundity and timing of reproduction among females. If the length of the favourable season does not allow all offspring to develop into adults without diapause. the benefits of high early fecundity may outweigh the associated cost of low lifetime fecundity. We tested this by exploring mating frequencies of Pieris napi females along a latitudinal gradient in different generations. Pieris napi is a bivoltine butterfly. and genetically polyandrous females enjoy higher lifetime fecundity than monandrous ones. Polyandry is. however. coupled with a relatively low early fecundity.

1158477,Evolution of fighting behaviour: decision rules and assessment of relative strength,1983,Magnus Enquist and Olof Leimar,102,Journal of theoretical Biology,3,387-410,Academic Press,A mathematical model of fighting behaviour is developed. The contestants belong to a population with varying fighting abilities and the fights consist of the repetition of one type of interaction. At each interaction in the sequence the opponents acquire some information about the true fighting abilities. The fights are seen as a motion of each opponent through a causal factor space; the current position of an animal in the space represents all information obtained by the animals so far. A decision rule (strategy) is a specification of what action to take at each point in the causal factor space. Evolutionarily stable strategies are calculated numerically and are found to be pure and unique. The distribution of fighting times and the probabilities of winning are calculated for pairs of contestants from a population using the ESS.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1468,745-753,The Royal Society,How can cooperation through indirect reciprocity evolve and what would it be like? This problem has previously been studied by simulating evolution in a small group of interacting individuals. assuming no gene flow between groups. In these simulations. certain ‘image scoring’ strategies were found to be the most successful. However. analytical arguments show that it would not be in an individual's interest to use these strategies. Starting with this puzzle. we investigate indirect reciprocity in simulations based on an island model. This has an advantage in that the role of genetic drift can be examined. Our results show that the image scoring strategies depend on very strong drift or a very small cost of giving help. As soon as these factors are absent. selection eliminates image scoring. We also consider other possibilities for the evolution of indirect reciprocity. In particular. we find that the strategy of aiming for ‘good …,True,Go754xMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,649,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2000.1573,16636037840781997744,/scholar?cites=16636037840781997744,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088665/pdf/PB010745.pdf,0,0,0

We apply evolutionary game theory to investigate how variation in resource value influences the evolution of fighting behaviour. Although no completely general predictions can be made concerning the cost of fighting and the probability of victory. for most situations of biological relevance the cost of fighting will increase when resource value increases and the probability of victory for an animal will increase when resource value is increased only to that animal. In order to study the effect of variation in resource value when differences in fighting ability exist and are assessed. sequential assessment games are developed for two situations. In the first situation. contestants do not know each other's subjective resource value.

Unlike most previous studies. our models assume that growth rate is an adaptively flexible character that can be increased at the expense of a greater juvenile mortality rate. Three components of fitness are considered: the cost of developing at a suboptimal time of the year. the reproductive advantage of larger adult size. and the increased mortality from rapid juvenile growth. The study focuses on the optimal responses of size. development time. and growth rate to changes in the amount of time available for completion of the life cycle.

Since such situations cannot be understood by means of a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game. new theory is developed which considers both a current partner and the access to other partners. It is shown that mobility seriously restricts the evoluton of cooperation: an efficient free rider could move rapidly through a population of cooperative individuals. searching out victims to exploit. Properties of the social environment. such as population size and density. influence the search time for a free rider and thus the possibilities for the evolution of cooperation. Behavioural adaptations. such as initial suspiciousness towards strangers. and gossiping. may to some extent counteract the effects of mobility and favour cooperation.

It is likely that the function of these behaviour patterns is the assessment of asymmetries between contestants in physical variables (e.g. size or strength). Theoretical models of fighting behaviour such as the war of attrition and the hawk-dove game do not incorporate any behavioural mechanisms allowing assessment. and. therefore. yield no predictions about the use of behaviour patterns. In a sequential assessment game. on the other hand. the assessment of asymmetries is a major activity during a fight. Recently. a version of the sequential assessment game with several behavioural options has been developed. and here predictions from this model are tested using data from 102 staged fights between males of the cichlid fish Nannacara anomala.

General considerations about the lifetime consequences of fighting behaviour are first discussed. A sequential assessment game is then developed in which a fight can end because a contestant either gives up or is killed. The results show that the balance between the value of the contested resource and the value of the future is one important factor influencing the frequency of death or severe injury in fights. When the value of a contested resource is similar to or greater than the value of the future. strategies will evolve that result in contestants being severely injured or killed during fights. When the value of the future is close to zero contestants will never give up after starting to fight; such fights will always be fatal for at least one of the opponents.

Many studies show that owners win most of these conflicts. We investigate how various asymmetries between contestants that might be present in owner-intruder conflicts will affect the outcome and nature of such interactions. A mathematical model is used to represent a fight between an owner and an intruder. A fight in this model consists of a sequence of behaviours; at each step in the sequence the contestants assess their relative strength and each of them decides whether to give up or to continue to fight on the basis of these assessments. For such contests it is shown that the role asymmetry inherent in an owner-intruder conflict can give rise to an ESS where the individual in one role is less willing to continue fighting than the individual in the other role.

In species with discrete alternative phenotypes. evolutionary sequences can be inferred from transitions between environmental and genetic phenotype control. and from losses of phenotypic alternatives. From the available evidence. sequences appear equally probable to start with genetic polymorphism as with polyphenism. with a possible dominance of one or the other for specific trait types.

1158493,GST is still a useful measure of genetic differentiation — a comment on Jost's D,2009,Nils Ryman and Olof Leimar,18,Molecular ecology,10,2084-2087,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,In a recent issue of Molecular Ecology. Jost (2008) suggests that the widely used measure of genetic differentiation GST and its relatives do not measure differentiation. His conjecture is based on the now well-known dependence of GST on average within population heterozygosity (HS) which prevents GST from taking values larger than average homozygosity (1− HS; Jin & Chakraborty 1995; Charlesworth 1998; Nagylaki 1998; Hedrick 1999. 2005). To eliminate the influence of heterozygosity on GST. Jost (2008) suggests that genetic diversity is quantified in terms of effective number of alleles rather than heterozygosity. and he derives an alternative measure. D. claimed to be independent of heterozygosity. He proposes that D should replace GST when differentiation is the quantity of interest. We are not convinced that GST has served its time as a measure of genetic differentiation. Whereas GST is mathematically constrained by HS. there is no such constraint on D. implying that D can take any value in the range 0–1 regardless of HS. The lack of such a restriction does not imply that D is expected to change independently of heterozygosity. however. We argue that D shares the same problems of dependence on HS and mutation rate as GST and its relatives. and that these problems are sometimes even more pronounced for D than for GST. There is current and renewed interest in the assessment of diversity in ecology and population genetics (eg Pavoine et al. 2005; Ricotta & Szeidl 2006; Jost 2007).

In particular. when analysing the evolution of cooperation it is often implicitly assumed that ignoring variation will produce predictions that approximate the solution when differences are included. This need not be true. As we demonstrate. differences are not innocuous noise. but can fundamentally change the nature of a game. Even small amounts of variability can stabilize cooperation by. for example. maintaining the need to deal with cheaters. Differences promote the need to learn about others in an interaction. leading to contingent behaviour that can reduce conflict. and to negotiated outcomes that may or may not be more cooperative than unconditional actions.

The evolution of gregariousness in insects may seem disadvantageous because aggregations are easily discovered by a predator and because insects are small and slow in relation to many potential predators that then have the capacity to consume an entire group. For animals in general. a benefit of group living may be a decreased risk of predator attack on any particular individual. For insects. this effect. called dilution. can be a consequence of distastefulness. which limits the number of prey that a predator can take. A model is developed in which we vary the risk of detection in relation to group size and the degree of prey distastefulness and aposematic coloration. both of which affect the number of prey a predator samples during avoidance learning.

1158498,Associational effects of plant defences in relation to within-and between-patch food choice by a mammalian herbivore: neighbour contrast susceptibility and defence,2006,Ulrika Alm Bergvall and Pasi Rautio and Kari Kesti and Juha Tuomi and Olof Leimar,147,Oecologia,2,253-260,Springer-Verlag,A basic idea of plant defences is that a plant should gain protection from its own defence. In addition. there is evidence that defence traits of the neighbouring plants can influence the degree of protection of an individual plant. These associational effects depend in part on the spatial scale of herbivore selectivity. A strong between-patch selectivity together with a weak within-patch selectivity leads to a situation where a palatable plant could avoid being grazed by growing in a patch with unpalatable plants. which is referred to as associational defence. Quite different associational effects will come about if the herbivore instead is unselective between patches and selective within a patch. We studied these effects in a manipulative experiment where we followed the food choice of fallow deer when they encountered two patches of overall different quality. One of the two patches consisted of pellets with low-tannin …,True,Go754xMAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,122,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00442-005-0260-8.pdf,11612674476709904816,/scholar?cites=11612674476709904816,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ulrika_Bergvall/publication/7577522_Associational_effects_of_plant_defences_in_relation_to_within-_and_between-patch_food_choice_by_a_mammalian_herbivore_Neighbour_contrast_susceptibility_and_defence/links/00b495177d94f79326000000/Associational-effects-of-plant-defences-in-relation-to-within-and-between-patch-food-choice-by-a-mammalian-herbivore-Neighbour-contrast-susceptibility-and-defence.pdf,0,0,0

Relative neck tests did not suggest that the low diversity is due to a lower substitution rate in sperm whale mtDNA. Rather. it is more likely that demographic factors have reduced diversity.

How such multimodal patterns in phenotype space can emerge from a single ancestral species is a fundamental question in biology. Frequency-dependent competition is one potential mechanism for such pattern formation. as has previously been shown in models based on the theory of adaptive dynamics. Here. we demonstrate that also in models similar to those used in quantitative genetics. phenotype distributions can split into multiple modes under the force of frequency-dependent competition. In sexual populations. this requires assortative mating. and we show that the multimodal splitting of initially unimodal distributions occurs over a range of assortment parameters.

Accordingly. female fecundity is generally correlated with female mass. both within and across species. However. the females of some species can be partly characterized as income breeders. in the sense that their reproductive output is dependent not only on larval–derived capital but also on resources acquired during the adult stage. These adult resources can be derived from female feeding or from male–transferred nuptial gifts.

1158519,Landscape connectivity and animal behavior: functional grain as a key determinant for dispersal,2007,Michel Baguette and Hans Van Dyck,22,,8,1117-1129,Springer Netherlands,Landscape connectivity can be viewed from two perspectives that could be considered as extremes of a gradient: functional connectivity (refers to how the behavior of a dispersing organism is affected by landscape structure and elements) and structural connectivity (depends on the spatial configuration of habitat patches in the landscape like vicinity or presence of barriers). Here we argue that dispersal behavior changes with landscape configuration stressing the evolutionary dimension that has often been ignored in landscape ecology.

1158520,Towards a functional resource-based concept for habitat: a butterfly biology viewpoint,2003,Roger LH Dennis and Tim G Shreeve and Hans Van Dyck,,Oikos,,417-426,Blackwell Publishers,The habitat is the basic unit for developments in life history. population dynamics. landscape ecology and conservation of organisms. It is frequently treated as a particulate. invariant and homogeneous entity (a patch). Here we examine the implications of using this concept of habitat in butterfly biology. In doing so. we suggest the alternative approach of applying a functional resource-based concept of habitat. This recognises the fundamental requirements of organisms. consumables and utilities. the latter describing suitable environmental conditions as well as essential substrates. We argue that a resource-based concept is critical for butterfly conservation and call for the development of a resource database on butterfly biology.,True,r9YUxewAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,446,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3548046,6893021136036853430,/scholar?cites=6893021136036853430,,,0,0,0

Studies like mark-release-recapture work. show patterns of movement. but do not provide insight into the behavioural mechanisms. We review and comment recent results on animal dispersal behaviour. Dispersal through a landscape can be realised in two different ways: as a by-product of routine movements associated with resource exploitation (like foraging or mate-searching) with high levels of returning. or. as special. fast and directed movements designed for displacement. We illustrate and discuss both classes of movements as behaviourally different types. These types of movement imply different assumptions and consequences.

Nineteen of the 64 indigenous species went extinct and half of the remaining species are threatened at present. Flanders is shown to be the region with the highest number of extinct butterflies in Europe. More intensive agriculture practices and expansion of house and road building increased the extinction rate more than eightfold in the second half of the 20th century. The number of hot spots decreased considerably and the present-day hot spots are almost exclusively in the northeast of Flanders.

Relationships with total body mass. forewing area. forewing length and wing loading were stronger in males. This can be explained by different mass allocation: males allocate proportionally more mass to the thorax. females more to the abdomen. 3. Evidence for the combined effect of morphological traits on acceleration capacity was found by multivariate analysis.

Here we focus on the case of variation in dorsal wing melanization in a satyrine butterfly Pararge aegeria. Because melanin is a complex polymer. its synthesis may be constrained if ambient conditions limit the resource budget. This hypothesis was tested by comparing melanization among butterflies that fed as larvae on host grasses experiencing different drought‐stress treatments. Treatment differences were validated both at the level of the host plant (nitrogen. carbonate. and water content) and of the butterfly (life‐history traits: survival. development time. and size at maturity). Melanization rate was measured as average gray value of the basal dorsal wing area.

Identifying the dispersal’s relationships to other life‐history traits will help to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of dispersal. and the consequences for species persistence and ecosystem functioning under global changes.

As distance between suitable habitats increases. the ongoing process of habitat fragmentation is expected to generate strong selection pressures on movement behaviour. This leads to an increase or decrease of dispersal according to its cost relative to landscape structure. To limit the cost of dispersal in an increasingly hostile matrix. we predict that organisms would adopt special dispersal behaviour between habitats. which are different from movements associated with resource searching in suitable habitats.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1446,861-866,The Royal Society,More than 50% of the lycaenid butterflies have an ant–associated lifestyle (myrmecophily) which may vary from coexistence to specific mutualistic or even parasitic interactions. Ant–related host–plant selection and oviposition has been observed in some myrmecophilous lycaenids. Therefore. it is remarkable that there is no evidence for this behaviour in the highly specialized. obligate myrmecophilous butterflies of the genus Maculinea. In contrast with previous findings. our results provide evidence for ant–related oviposition patterns in Maculinea alcon in relation to the distribution of specific host–ant nests (i.e.Myrmica ruginodis) based on repeated egg counts during the flight period in two populations. We also show that ant–related oviposition can be counterbalanced by intraspecific competition and oviposition deterrency when host plants already carry several eggs.

For terrestrial species. habitat is often defined as physical patches of a certain vegetation type in a matrix of non-habitat.

The research effort that has gone into studying these cyclical life history events. or phenological traits. has increased greatly in recent decades. As phenological traits are often correlated to temperature. they are relevant to study in terms of understanding the effect of short term environmental variation as well as long term climate change. Because of this. changes in phenology are the most obvious and among the most commonly reported responses to climate change. Moreover. phenological traits are important for fitness as they determine the biotic and abiotic environment an individual encounters. Fine-tuning of phenology allows for synchronisation at a local scale to mates. food resources and appropriate weather conditions. On a between-population scale. variation in phenology may reflect regional variation in climate. Such differences can not only give insights to life cycle adaptation. but also to how populations may respond to environmental change through time. This applies both on an ecological scale through phenotypic plasticity as well as an evolutionary scale through genetic adaptation. In this thesis I have used statistical and experimental methods to investigate both the larger geographical patterns as well as mechanisms of fine-tuning of phenology of several butterfly species.

We examined the role of structural ultraviolet (UV) reflectance and pheromones in the butterfly Colias eurytheme.

Although the proximate optical mechanisms are often well defined. we know much less about the morphological basis for intraspecific variation in structural colour.  2 Males of the butterfly Colias eurytheme L. possess a thin‐film interference array on their dorsal wing scales that generates a bright and iridescent ultraviolet (UV) signal. This signal is used in mate choice.  3 Using scanning electron microscopy. we investigated the covariance between nano‐structural architecture and UV reflectance in samples that were variously subject to either nutrient stress (using a larval host‐plant manipulation). or thermal stress (using transient heat and cold shocks during the pupal period).

Males allocate differently. with smaller amounts of resources allocated to the abdomen. As among females. heavy males have a higher proportion of their total carbon allocated to the abdomen compared to light males. but abdominal nitrogen is unaffected by body size. These resource allocation patterns are predicted to affect reproductive output. particularly in butterflies with insignificant adult intake of nitrogenous compounds. In accordance with this. heavy females in this study have a proportionately higher lifetime fecundity compared to light females.

According to the resource distribution hypothesis. butterflies in more fragmented landscapes would have higher levels of mobility as resources are more scattered.

The flight apparatus. however. is costly to manufacture and therefore trade-offs are expected since resources are limited and must be allocated between flight ability and other functions. such as reproduction. Trade-offs between flight and reproduction may be difficult to reveal since they interact with other factors and can be confounded by differences in resource consumption.

Ltd.,Three species of nymphalid butterflies with different types of adult feeding behaviour were examined to see how the allocation of larval-derived resources to abdomen vs thorax change with age. Adults of Pararge aegeria and Speyeria mormonia feed on poor-quality diets. They are expected to be more dependent on larval-derived reserves stored in the abdomen for reproduction than are species with high-quality diets. In accordance with these expectations abdomen mass decreases with age in both males and females. Furthermore. thorax mass of females also decreases with age. Since the bulk of the thorax consists of flight muscles. this suggests that old females use resources derived from flight muscles for egg production.

Adult female weight varies between 30 mg and 300 mg. and since scaling of morphological character traits is usually observed. we would expect a positive correlation between egg and female size as a result of nonadaptive allometry (in the sense of Huxley 1932) in the absence of selective pressures on egg size. However. two such pressures can readily be recognized. both of which should cause egg size to depart from the baseline allometry. First. a positive correlation between egg size and offspring fitness may select for bigger eggs.

Although egg weights of Papilio machaon L. were similar to the highest satyrid egg weights. newly hatched larvae of P.machaon showed significantly higher mortality after 1 day of starvation when compared to all of the satyrid larvae. This indicates that the capability of newly hatched larvae to endure starvation is not necessarily correlated with egg weight. and consequently that this character trait of satyrid larvae has been selected for (i.e. should be regarded as an adaptation).

By following females in the field. or by capturing wild females. and noting the colour of their eggs. it was established that younger females showed higher oviposition rates and laid heavier eggs than older females.3. Hence. wild C.pamphilus females are unable to sustain a constant egg production by extracting amino acids or any other nutrients from nectar. We hypothesize that this is a general phenomenon in nectar feeding butterflies.4. The egg colour did not seem to match the colour of the substrate on which the female chose to deposit the egg.,True,U8VNdSwAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,39,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2311.1987.tb00989.x,16815355563562809198,/scholar?cites=16815355563562809198,,,0,0,0

Series B: Biological Sciences,1367,187-192,The Royal Society,"Females mate several times in many butterfly species. In these so called polyandrous butterflies. males deliver heavier and more nutrient rich ejaculates than males in species where females mate only once. Recent studies show that polyandry in butterflies functions as a system where males transfer nutrients which the female is in short supply of. and is later used by females to boost reproductive performance and somatic maintenance. This suggests that males in polyandrous species are selected for having reproductive reserves of ""high quality’. i. e. relatively high levels of a material important for female reproductive output. Nitrogen was chosen as a suitable nutrient to measure because it is likely to be important for reproductive success and is a limiting nutrient for most herbivores.

Here we establish the first current baseline and gradient of ecosystem structure of nearshore rocky reefs at the Mediterranean scale. We conducted underwater surveys in 14 marine protected areas and 18 open access sites across the Mediterranean. and across a 31-fold range of fish biomass (from 3.8 to 118 g m−2). Our data showed remarkable variation in the structure of rocky reef ecosystems. Multivariate analysis showed three alternative community states: (1) large fish biomass and reefs dominated by non-canopy algae. (2) lower fish biomass but abundant native algal canopies and suspension feeders. and (3) low fish biomass and extensive barrens. with areas covered by turf algae. Our results suggest that the healthiest shallow rocky reef ecosystems in the Mediterranean have both large fish and algal biomass. Protection level and primary production were the only variables significantly correlated to community biomass structure. Fish biomass was significantly larger in well-enforced no-take marine reserves. but there were no significant differences between multi-use marine protected areas (which allow some fishing) and open access areas at the regional scale.

Labrids species recruit during summer months. from July to September. whereas sparids recruit at different times of the year. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the species recruit in well-defined habitats. Sparid species recruit primarily in the shallowest zone (0 to 2 m). and most of them prefer varied bottoms (sand. gravel or small blocks). Some species of the genus Diplodus have similar habitat requirements. but show a clear seasonal segregation. with each species occupying successively the same zones at a different time of the year.

Several studies assessed the effectiveness of individual MPAs in protecting fish assemblages. but regional assessments of multiple MPAs are scarce. Moreover. empirical evidence on the role of MPAs in contrasting the propagation of non-indigenous-species (NIS) and thermophilic species (ThS) is missing. We simultaneously investigated here the role of MPAs in reversing the effects of overfishing and in limiting the spread of NIS and ThS. The Mediterranean Sea was selected as study area as it is a region where 1) MPAs are numerous. 2) fishing has affected species and ecosystems. and 3) the arrival of NIS and the northward expansion of ThS took place. Fish surveys were done in well-enforced no-take MPAs (HP). partially-protected MPAs (IP) and fished areas (F) at 30 locations across the Mediterranean. Significantly higher fish biomass was found in HP compared to IP MPAs and F. Along a recovery trajectory from F to HP MPAs. IP were similar to F. showing that just well enforced MPAs triggers an effective recovery. Within HP MPAs. trophic structure of fish assemblages resembled a top-heavy biomass pyramid. Although the functional structure of fish assemblages was consistent among HP MPAs. species driving the recovery in HP MPAs differed among locations: this suggests that the recovery trajectories in HP MPAs are likely to be functionally similar (i.e.. represented by predictable changes in trophic groups. especially fish predators). but the specific composition of the resulting assemblages may depend on …,True,e_9Zu6AAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C,141,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091841,8440825091620476044,/scholar?cites=8440825091620476044,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091841,0,0,0

This complexity has led to interesting biogeographical processes that have resulted in the current diversity and distribution of fauna in the region. The fish genus Astyanax represents a useful model to assess biogeographical hypotheses due to it being one of the most diverse and widely distributed freshwater fish species in the New World. We used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the genus in Mesoamerica. and to develop historical biogeographical hypotheses to explain its current distribution. Analysis of the entire mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene in 208 individuals from 147 localities and of a subset of individuals for three mitochondrial genes (Cytb. 16 S. and COI) and a single nuclear gene (RAG1) yielded similar topologies. recovering six major groups with significant phylogeographic structure. Populations from North America and Upper Central America formed a monophyletic group. while Middle Central America showed evidence of rapid radiation with incompletely resolved relationships. Lower Central America lineages showed a fragmented structure. with geographically restricted taxa showing high levels of molecular divergence. All Bramocharax samples grouped with their sympatric Astyanax lineages (in some cases even with allopatric Astyanax populations). with less than 1% divergence between them.

Furthermore. nine species belonging to the L. cephalus complex were also analysed (over the whole cytochrome b) in order to test potential allopatric hybridization with L. cephalus sensu stricto (i.e. the chub). Our results show that the chub includes four highly divergent lineages descending from a quick radiation that took place three million years ago. The geographical distribution of these lineages and results of the nested clade analysis indicated that the chub may have originated from Mesopotamia.

We also assessed overall spatial and temporal patterns of species diversity and identified major changes and threats. Our results listed approximately 17.000 marine species occurring in the Mediterranean Sea.

Diversity for microbes is substantially underestimated. and the deep-sea areas and portions of the southern and eastern region are still poorly known. In addition. the invasion of alien species is a crucial factor that will continue to change the biodiversity of the Mediterranean. mainly in its eastern basin that can spread rapidly northwards and westwards due to the warming of the Mediterranean Sea.

Hence. gastropod mitochondrial genomes constitute a good model system to study patterns. rates. and mechanisms of mitochondrial genome rearrangement. However. this kind of evolutionary comparative analysis requires a robust phylogenetic framework of the group under study. which has been elusive so far for gastropods in spite of the efforts carried out during the last two decades.

It gives urgency to a better understanding of the factors that affect marine biological invasions. A chemoecological approach is proposed here to define biotic conditions that promote biological invasions in terms of enemy escape and resource opportunities. Research has focused on the secondary metabolite composition of three exotic sea slugs found in Greece that have most probably entered the Mediterranean basin by Lessepsian migration. an exchange that contributes significantly to Mediterranean biodiversity. We have found toxic compounds with significant activity as feeding deterrents both in the cephalaspidean Haminoea cyanomarginata and in the nudibranch Melibe viridis.

The aim of this study was to characterize its genetic structure throughout its whole distribution range using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data. Because of its sessile adult lifestyle and lack of a pelagic larval stage. we expected a markedly subdivided population structure with limited levels of gene flow. Fragments of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA (16S). were sequenced. along with the nuclear ribosomal cluster (internal transcribed spacer; ITS) in specimens from 18 localities.

It apparently is a gonochorisric species with the sex ratio biased toward females (71%). A broad peak of more intense reproductive activity occurs in spring months and an inactive reproductive period during winter. The gonad of the males develops about two months before those of females. and storage of sperm by females has been observed. Internal fertilization takes place after the capture of pelagic spermatophores.The egg capsules lie free within the female mantle cavity. and females brood up to 86 capsules simultaneously (the highest number reported for any vermetid gastropod).

Some of the changes observed may be sometimes interpreted as natural changes (cyclical. episodic or catastrophic). but most of them are of human origin. Each of the main anthropogenic impacts (habitat fragmentation and loss. overfishing and exploitation of living resources. pollution. species introductions and others) are analysed separately. although it is noted that predictions of how all the impacts interact synergistically are necessary. Furthermore. the effects of the so called “global change” (including both global warming and ocean acidification) on Mediterranean biodiversity are highlighted.

Anthropogenic debris travels across large distances and is ubiquitous in the water and on the shorelines. yet. observations of its sources. composition. pathways and distributions in the ocean are very sparse and inaccurate. Total amounts of plastics and other man-made debris in the ocean and on the shore. temporal trends in these amounts under exponentially increasing production. as well as degradation processes. vertical fluxes and time scales are largely unknown. Present ocean circulation models are not able to accurately simulate drift of debris because of its complex hydrodynamics. In this paper we discuss the structure of the future integrated marine debris observing system (IMDOS) that is required to provide long-term monitoring of the state of the anthropogenic pollution and support operational activities to mitigate impacts on the ecosystem and safety of maritime activity. The proposed observing system integrates remote sensing and in situ observations. Also. models are used to optimize the design of the system and. in turn. they will be gradually improved using the products of the system.

(2) check population structure. (3) test the widespread connectivity hypothesis and (4) assess the utility of different nuclear and mitochondrial markers currently in use. To carry out these goals. DNA sequence data from nuclear (ITS and 28S) and mitochondrial (16S and COI) markers were analyzed for several coral species and for Mediterranean populations of D. dianthus. Three phylogenetic methodologies (ML. MP and BI). based on data from the four molecular markers. all supported D. dianthus as clearly belonging to the “robust” clade. in which the species Lophelia pertusa and D. dianthus not only grouped together. but also shared haplotypes for some DNA markers. Molecular results also showed shared haplotypes among D. dianthus populations distributed in regions separated by several thousands of kilometers and by clear geographic barriers. These results could reflect limited molecular and morphological taxonomic resolution rather than real widespread connectivity. Additional studies are needed in order to find molecular markers and morphological features able to disentangle the complex phylogenetic relationship in the Order Scleractinia and to differentiate isolated populations. thus avoiding the homoplasy found in some morphological characters that are still considered in the literature.,True,KUYz_24AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,28,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050215,14796808728102104661,/scholar?cites=14796808728102104661,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050215,0,0,0

They constitute one of the most important threats to biodiversity. causing severe ecological and socio-economic impacts (Mack et al. 2000; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005; Ricciardi et al. 2013; Jeschke et al. 2014). As a conservative estimate. IAS cost the European Union (EU) Member States€ 12 billion in damages on annual basis (Kettunen et al. 2009) but cumulated costs probably reach€ 20 billion per year (http://www. ieep. eu/workareas/biodiversity/invasive-alien-species/accessed on 4 November 2016). In addition. there is an increasing trend towards introduction of new IAS. with the vast majority being introduced unintentionally (Hulme 2009; Essl et al. 2015; Roques et al. 2016). To this end. economic resources invested by the EU in both the research and management of IAS have been growing steadily over the years (Scalera 2010; Silva et al. 2014).About 14.000 alien species have been reported so far in Europe (Katsanevakis et al. 2015). Plenty of information is available about them. but it is generally scattered across many different information systems and databases (Panov & Gollasch 2004; Gatto et al. 2013). In addition. data format and information about the data (metadata) is a frequent limitation to the interoperability of data repositories and information systems (Katsanevakis et al. 2012; Essl et al. 2015).

Desmophyllum dianthus. a widespread solitary coral. exhibits a high degree of morphological variation in corallum forms that has never been analysed quantitatively. To assess if the clear morphological variation of D. dianthus follows a specific pattern based on environmental (or others) variables. this study combines three different morphometric approaches: (1) classical linear external morphology.

1158719,The origin and correlated evolution of symbiosis and coloniality in scleractinian corals,2020,Ana Navarro Campoy and Anna Maria Addamo and Annie Machordom and Andrew Meade and Marcelo M Rivadeneira and Cristián E Hernández and Chris Venditti,7,Frontiers in Marine Science,,461,Frontiers Media SA,Symbiosis and coloniality are ecologically important traits for corals of the order Scleractinia. Symbiotic (zooxanthellate) species are highly successful in shallow waters of tropical and subtropical seas and most of them are colonial. On the other hand. azooxanthellate species present wide distribution ranges and expand to the deep-sea at more than 6.000 m depth. These are mostly solitary. with only few species colonial that form extensive deep reefs. Each ecologically distinctive group encompasses half of the biodiversity of the order and they are not grouped into differentiated monophyletic clades. Paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have debated for decades whether modern scleractinian corals have evolved from symbiotic or colonial ancestors and how these traits have evolved and being involved in the diversification process in corals. Previous comparative analyses throw evidence in favor of coevolution of these characters and toward repetitive loss of symbiosis and coloniality. Nevertheless. the discovery of the origin of the group deep in the Paleozoic. with a deep divergent clade composed of only azooxanthellate corals has questioned these findings. With this work. we disentangle the patterns in the evolution of symbiosis and coloniality. testing if they are correlated and if they follow a gradual or episodic mode of evolution. To this end. we first produce the most complete time-calibrated phylogenetic tree for the order Scleractinia. including new sequences of never-before sampled species and genera. These novel sequences contribute to alleviate the current molecular under sampling of azooxanthellate species.

Few studies have assessed the relationship among populations across the global range of the species' distribution. and the presence of oceanographic barriers that might influence gene flow among populations are underestimated. 2.In this study. evolutionary and ecological drivers of connectivity patterns have been inferred among populations of the cold‐water coral Desmophyllum dianthus. a common and widespread solitary scleractinian species. whose reproduction strategy and larval dispersal are still poorly unknown. 3.The genetic structure of D. dianthus was explored using 30 microsatellites in 347 specimens from 13 localities …,True,KUYz_24AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,1,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.3421,2631897937130782892,/scholar?cites=2631897937130782892,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/aqc.3421,0,0,0

Accordingly. they suggested the reclassification of these parasites in two new genera. Choleoeimeria and Acroeimeria. The validity of the genera proposed to classify reptilian Eimeria species remained unresolved due to the lack of species genetically characterized.

Cobitidae),2008,Anabel Perdices and Jörg Bohlen and Ignacio Doadrio,46,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,1,382-390,Academic Press,The sharp contrast in diversity observed between Central and Southern European freshwater biotas in the Euro-Mediterranean peninsulas (Iberian. Italian. and Balkans) has attracted the interest of many biologists (Banarescu. 1992; Hewitt. 2000). These faunal differences are especially noticeable in the primary freshwater fishes that exclusively dispersed across continental routes (Myers. 1949). The generally impoverished nature of species-level taxa in Central European waters (see. however. Kottelat and Persat. 2005) appears to be related to the smooth topography of Central Europe. which favored river captures and contact among fishes. In contrast. the ancient separation of Euro-Mediterranean peninsulas by old mountain systems promoted the endemicity of their freshwater fish fauna. Today’s Adriatic region encompasses Italy and the western Balkans as a well-defined geographical area of southern Europe enclosed by the Alps. the Apennines and the Dinaric and Balkan Mountains (Fig. 1). This area is drained by relatively old. short river systems and contains the oldest European Lakes. lakes Ohrid and Skadar. The Adriatic area spanned the Paratethys border from the Middle Miocene (15 MYA) and is a geologically active region. The geological record suggests the presence of a well-established terrestrial zone in the Western Balkans from the Middle Miocene to the present ( Hsü et al.. 1977; Steininger and Rögl. 1984).

Radiocarbon ages of the macrofossils. which are interpreted in view of the complexities of the Antarctic marine radiocarbon reservoir and resolution of this dating technique. show a bimodal distribution. The data indicate that marine species inhabited coastal environments from at least 35000 to 20000 yr sp. during Marine Isotope Stage 3 when extensive iceberg calving created a'meltwater lid'over the Southern Ocean. The general absence of these marine species from 20000 to 8500 yr sp coincides with the subsequent advance of the Antarctic ice sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum. Synchronous re-appearance of the Antarctic marine fossils in emerged beaches around the continent. all of wh ich have Holocene marine-limit elevations an order of magnitude lower than those in the Arctic. reflect minimal isostatic rebound as relative sea-level rise decelerated. Antarctic coastal marine habitat changes around the continent also coincided with increasing sea-ice extent and outlet glacial advances during the mid-Holocene. in view of the diverse environmental changes that occurred around the Earth during this period. it is suggested that Antarctic coastal areas were responding to a mid-Holocene climatic shift associated with the hydrological cycle.

Whilst the measurement of mollusk δ18O to develop records of past climate change is a commonly used approach. it has proven challenging to develop reliable independent paleothermometers that can be used to deconvolve the contributions of temperature and fluid composition on molluscan oxygen isotope compositions. Here we investigate the temperature dependence of 13C–18O bond abundance. denoted by the measured parameter Δ47. in shell carbonates of bivalve mollusks and assess its potential to be a useful paleothermometer. We report measurements on cultured specimens spanning a range in water temperatures of 5 to 25 °C. and field collected specimens spanning a range of −1 to 29 °C. In addition we investigate the potential influence of carbonate saturation state on bivalve stable isotope compositions by making measurements on both calcitic and aragonitic specimens that have been cultured in seawater that is either supersaturated or undersaturated with respect to aragonite. We find a robust relationship between Δ47 and growth temperature. We also find that the slope of a linear regression through all the Δ47 data for bivalves plotted against seawater temperature is significantly shallower than previously published inorganic and biogenic carbonate calibration studies produced in our laboratory and go on to discuss the possible sources of this difference. We find that changing seawater saturation state does not have significant effect on the Δ47 of bivalve shell carbonate in two taxa that we examined. and we do not observe …,True,qfolpccAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC,103,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/4591/2013/,17135131555128321081,/scholar?cites=17135131555128321081,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/4591/2013/bg-10-4591-2013.pdf,0,0,0

Planktonic hatchlings are small and go through some degree of morphological changes during the planktonic phase. which can last from days to months. with ocean currents enhancing their dispersal capacity. Benthic hatchlings are usually large. miniature-like adults and have comparatively reduced dispersal potential. We examined the relationship between early developmental mode. hatchling size and species latitudinal distribution range of 110 species hatched in the laboratory. which represent 13% of the total number of live cephalopod species described to date. Results showed that species with planktonic hatchlings reach broader distributional ranges in comparison with species with benthic hatchlings. In addition. squids and octopods follow an inverse relationship between hatchling size and species latitudinal distribution. In both groups. species with smaller hatchlings have broader latitudinal distribution ranges. Thus. squid and octopod species with larger hatchlings have latitudinal distributions of comparatively minor extension. This pattern also emerges when all species are grouped by genus (n = 41). but was not detected for cuttlefishes. a group composed mainly of species with large and benthic hatchlings. However. when hatchling size was compared to adult size. it was observed that the smaller the hatchlings. the broader the latitudinal distributional range of the species for cuttlefishes. squids and octopuses.

Nemertean classification has closely followed Stiasny‐Wijnhoff’s scheme (1936) that was based on Schultze’s (1851) division of the taxon into the two classes Anopla and Enopla. In August 2018. the 9th International Conference of Nemertean Biology took place in the Wadden Sea Station of the Alfred Wegener Institute in List auf Sylt. Germany. At this meeting. the community reached consensus to revise nemertean taxonomy at the class level. based on the compiled evidence from studies on nemertean systematics published in the last 15 years (Andrade et al.. 2014. 2012; Thollesson & Norenburg. 2003). Previous classifications (eg. Stiasny‐Wijnhoff. 1936) are not based on phylogenetic grounds. and the use of these names is therefore nowadays not wholly informative. With the purpose of facilitating the practical use of the nemertean taxonomy and also making nemertean taxonomy reflect a wealth of more recent information. we conclude that the ranks Anopla and Enopla should be eliminated with the following argumentation:“Enopla” has for long held no more information than the name “Hoplonemertea”.“Anopla” is paraphyletic and the name usually corresponds to the following traits:(a) not bearing stylet; and (b) mouth and proboscis having separate openings. This information is equally well presented in a system that also bears information on natural groups. The names “Anopla” and “Enopla” are hence dismissed and the following system of the Nemertea phylum is implemented:,True,zGr2mtAAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,10,https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/99152,17954745810765735606,/scholar?cites=17954745810765735606,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/99152/StrandNorenburgEtAl2019.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Salamandridae),2011,Fernando Ángel Fernández-Álvarez and Ernesto Recuero and Inigo Martinez-Solano and David Buckley,,,,,University of Oradea,Teratologies are frequent among vertebrates. but with differing prevalence among groups. For instance. cases of bicephaly are extremely scarce in amphibians. in contrast with other groups. like reptiles. Here we report the first case of bicephaly in Lissotriton boscai. The anomaly is a consequence of the duplication of the skeleton axis and the subsequent development of most of the cephalic structures in each axis. with heads fused at the level of the cranial post-otic structures. Despite its young age and small size. the larva presents an advanced stage of development. The low frequency of cases of bicephaly among amphibians can be a consequence of high mortality rates in early stages. but it could also reflect differences in the developmental properties between vertebrate lineages.,True,zGr2mtAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,10,https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/88503,17362085811593834122,/scholar?cites=17362085811593834122,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/88503/1/NWJZ_2011.pdf,0,0,0

Recently. this has been proposed also for protists (eg Fenchel and Finlay. 2004) and further extended to micrometazoans (animals smaller than 2 mm)(Foissner. 2006). This hypothesis assumes that microorganisms disperse worldwide due to their microscopic sizes and dormancy capabilities. and that their distributions are restricted only by environmental limitations. High local: global diversity ratios for species assemblages and high gene flow between populations are thus expected. Micrometazoans share a common evolutionary history and the multicellular condition with macroscopic animals. while they are similar in terms of resources used. microscopic size and dormancy capability to microscopic unicellular organisms. which are supposed to be without biogeographies.

We found that temperature has relatively low -but not negligible- effects in the three spatiotemporal scales. once accounting for alternative factors. More importantly. the estimated thermal responses were largely incongruent across scales. This shows that species have multidimensional thermal niches. entailing that adjustments to fulfil temperature requirements for one biological aspect. such as seasonal ontogenetic cycles. may result in detrimental effects on other aspects. like diel activity. These trade-offs can expose individuals to inadequate temperatures. reducing populations9 performance.

Here. we analysed the patterns of genetic variability in the marine snail Gibbula divaricata from five coastal locations in the Adriatic Sea (central Mediterranean) and one in the adjacent northern Ionian Sea. using 21 previously described polymorphic microsatellite loci. Observed and expected heterozygosity varied from 0.582-0.635 and 0.684-0.780. respectively. AMOVA analyses showed that 97% of genetic variation was observed within populations. Significant genetic differentiation was found among nearly all of the pairwise FST comparisons. Three groups of populations were identified: eastern Adriatic populations. western Adriatic populations. and a third group represented by the single northern Ionian Sea population. Gibbula divaricata is thought to have a limited dispersal capacity related to its lecithotrophic trochophore larval stage. In fact. our results indicated that gene flow is mainly restricted along the coastline. with populations separated by the lack of suitable habitats or deep waters being almost isolated. Though the circulation system operating in this region certainly affects connectivity. our genetic analyses of Adriatic populations of G. divaricata suggest that the reproductive strategies and habitat requirements of this coastal species also play an important role in its population dynamics.,True,iiKNDEcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,3,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00177/full,6397340649244613956,/scholar?cites=6397340649244613956,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00177/full,0,0,0

Íñigo,La historia biogeográfica de S. salamandra es bastante compleja. Los datos genéticos analizados hasta la fecha apuntan a una colonización del centro y norte de Europa en el período postglacial (Steinfartz et al.. 2000). Esta colonización debió originarse desde al menos dos áreas geográficas situadas en el sur de Europa: la Península Ibérica y la Península Balcánica (Steinfartz et al.. 2000). Sin embargo. la enorme diversidad y diferenciación genética observada entre las subespecies de la Península Ibérica (Dopazo et al.. 1998; García-París et al.. 2003; Velo-Antón et al.. 2007) indican un proceso de diversificación anterior a la colonización del centro y norte de Europa. Los diferentes ciclos climáticos ocurridos durante el Plioceno-Pleistoceno llevarían a esta especie a buscar micro-refugios dentro de la Península Ibérica. conduciendo a procesos de subespeciación alopátrica. Durante periodos con condiciones climáticas más propicias para esta especie. se producirían expansiones desde los microrefugios. dando lugar a las diferentes zonas de contacto existentes actualmente. Este escenario podría explicar la enorme complejidad morfológica y el polimorfismo observado en esta especie. Un ejemplo de la complejidad biogeográfica de S. salamandra es la agrupación. a nivel mitocondrial de las subespecies S. s. bernardezi (restringida al noroeste de la Península Ibérica) y S. s. gigliolii (distribuida por el sur de la Península Itálica) en un grupo monofilético (Steinfartz et al.. 2000; García-París et al.. 2003; Vences et al.. 2014). el cual está claramente diferenciado del resto de subespecies.

How this structure develops and how it has evolved in the different vertebrate lineages is. however. a matter of debate. Vertebrae and vertebral structures are derived from the embryonic somites. although the mechanisms of development are different between lineages. Using the anecdotal description of a teratological newt (Triturus dobrogicus) with an unusual malformation in its axial skeleton. we review. compare. and discuss the development of vertebral structures and. in particular. the development of centra from somitic cellular domains in different vertebrate groups. Vertebrae development through re-segmentation of the somitic sclerotomal cells is considered the general mechanism among vertebrates. which has been generalized from studies in amniotic model organisms. The prevalence of this mechanism among anamniotes is. however. controversial. We propose alternative developmental mechanisms for vertebrae formation that should be experimentally tested. Research in model organisms. especially amniotes. is laying the foundations for a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of development of the axial skeleton in vertebrates. foundations that should expand the extent of future comparative studies.

The mechanisms by which fish allocate energy from lipids for metabolism. development. growth. and reproduction are critical for understanding key life-history strategies and transitions. Currently. the major lipid component in aquaculture diets is fish oil (FO). derived from wild capture fisheries that are exploited at their maximum sustainable limit. The increasing demand from aquaculture for FO will soon exceed supply and threaten the viability of aquaculture. Thus. it is essential to minimize FO use in aquaculture diets. This might be achieved by a greater understanding of lipid storage and muscle growth. or the identification of alternatives to FO in feeds.

In order to assess the origin of these turtles. sequences of the mtDNA control region were obtained from 70 turtles caught by bottom trawlers in the area. and compared with known sequences from turtles from Mediterranean and Atlantic nesting sites. Five haplotypes were identified (Haplotype diversity= 0.262; nucleotide diversity= 5.4× 10-3). Specific haplotypes indicate contributions from distant rookeries such as Turkey and the Atlantic. which shows that Atlantic turtles entering the Mediterranean while in the oceanic phase use at least one Mediterranean continental shelf as a neritic foraging ground. A new haplotype and another one previously found only in foraging areas. highlight the genetic information gaps for nesting sites. which undermine powerful mixed stock analyses. Despite these limitations. the results reveal the regional importance of the study area as a neritic foraging ground for turtles that are probably from most of the Mediterranean nesting aggregates.

Gastropoda),2015,Maria Vittoria Modica and Fabrizio Lombardo and Paolo Franchini and Marco Oliverio,16,BMC genomics,1,1-21,BioMed Central,Hematophagy arose independently multiple times during metazoan evolution. with several lineages of vampire animals particularly diversified in invertebrates. However. the biochemistry of hematophagy has been studied in a few species of direct medical interest and is still underdeveloped in most invertebrates. as in general is the study of venom toxins. In cone snails. leeches. arthropods and snakes. the strong target specificity of venom toxins uniquely aligns them to industrial and academic pursuits (pharmacological applications. pest control etc.) and provides a biochemical tool for studying biological activities including cell signalling and immunological response. Neogastropod snails (cones. oyster drills etc.) are carnivorous and include active predators. scavengers. grazers on sessile invertebrates and hematophagous parasites; most of them use venoms to efficiently feed. It has been hypothesized that trophic innovations were the main drivers of rapid radiation of Neogastropoda in the late Cretaceous. We present here the first molecular characterization of the alimentary secretion of a non-conoidean neogastropod. Colubraria reticulata. Colubrariids successfully feed on the blood of fishes. throughout the secretion into the host of a complex mixture of anaesthetics and anticoagulants.

Alteration of such asymmetry results in severe congenital defects particularly affecting the cardiovascular system. The earliest known genes involved in asymmetry. the Nodal signalling cascade. are expressed asymmetrically during embryonic development. Nodal was discovered in the mouse. but orthologs (also involved in left‐right specification) were reported in ascidians. sea‐urchins. and snails. Mutations in Nodal‐pathway genes cause alteration of several aspects of chirality. but not entirely mirror phenotypes of the body. Other factors upstream of nodal must be involved in the generation of left–right asymmetry.

Meloidae),2005,Marco A Bologna and Benedetta D’Inzillo and Manuela Cervelli and Marco Oliverio and Paolo Mariottini,37,Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution,1,306-311,Elsevier Science,The blister beetles (Coleoptera. Tenebrionoidea. Meloidae) include over 2500 species in approximately 125 genera. This family is of general biological relevance because of its hypermetabolic larval development. the parasitoid biology of the larval phases and the production of cantharidin. The latter is a defensive and probably aggregative terpenoid. almost exclusive to this family. with a long history of pharmacological use in different countries of the World. The presence of this defensive substance may have allowed the evolution of very complex and prolonged sexual behaviours in the largest subfamily Meloinae. Several specialists (eg. Cros. 1940; Escherich. 1897; MacSwain. 1956; Selander. 1964) repeatedly used ontogeny. larval and adult morphology. as well as behaviour. to propose different classifications of this family. Bologna (1991) summarised morphological and biological information on the family and proposed a classification. which was largely confirmed in the major grouping (subfamilies and tribes) by the recent phylogenetic studies made by Bologna and Pinto (2001). In the latter work. analysing a total of 85 genera and subgenera on behavioural and morphological (adult and larval) characters. relationships of genera within some tribes (particularly. Lyttini and Mylabrini) remained partly unresolved and/or contrasting. An undetermined number of characters in the different subsets employed (larval. adult. ethological. etc.) could be under severe adaptive pressures. thus likely homoplastic. in relation to the peculiar biology of meloids.

Traditional methods like mark-recapture are ineffective to study broad-scale bat migratory patterns. Stable hydrogen isotopes (δD) have been proven useful in establishing spatial migratory connectivity of animal populations. Before applying this tool. the method was calibrated using bat samples of known origin. Here we established the potential of δD as a robust geographical tracer of breeding origins of European bats by measuring δD in hair of five sedentary bat species from 45 locations throughout Europe. The δD of bat hair strongly correlated with well-established spatial isotopic patterns in mean annual precipitation in Europe. and therefore was highly correlated with latitude. We calculated a linear mixed-effects model. with species as random effect. linking δD of bat hair to precipitation δD of the areas of hair growth. This model can be used to predict breeding origins of European migrating bats. We used δ13C and δ15N to discriminate among potential origins of bats. and found that these isotopes can be used as variables to further refine origin predictions. A triple-isotope approach could thereby pinpoint populations or subpopulations that have distinct origins.

Phylogenetic analyses indicated that morphology-based subfamilies and most suprageneric groups are nonnatural assemblages. They also support the existence of an endemic African clade of fruitbats. The discrepancy between the evolutionary relationships yielded by molecular and morphological data sets may be. at least in part. explained by the recurrent retention of primitive morphology (Rousettus-like) across different lineages. The maintenance of primitive characters in different groups of flying foxes. as well as morphological convergence in nectar-feeding bats and possibly also in short-muzzle bats. may have led to high levels of homoplasy. resulting in misleading taxonomic arrangements.

In species trees. the nodes represent the actual separation between species. thus providing essential information about their evolutionary history. In addition. multilocus phylogenies can help in analyses of species delimitation. gene flow and genetic differentiation within species. However. few adequate markers are available for such studies. In order to develop nuclear markers that can be useful in multilocus studies of mammals. we analyzed the mammalian genomes of human. chimpanzee. macaque. dog and cow. Rodents were excluded due to their unusual genomic features. Introns were extracted from the mammalian genomes because of their greater genetic variability and ease of amplification from the flanking exons.

In the past. this was believed to be indicative of moult state; green crabs having recently moulted and red ones being in late inter-moult. A series of different studies carried out in recent years has shown that this is not the full story. Green males have been shown to be more tolerant of salinity fluctuations and aerial exposure than red males. Conversely. red males compete more successfully for mates and food. It is hypothesized that some crabs remain in inter-moult longer than others. developing stronger and thicker carapaces and chelae. and are thus more likely to win mating conflicts. This advantage is gained at the cost of reduced tolerance to the conditions of intertidal life.

The peak moulting period in females occurred at the end of spring. when copulation took place. Ovarian maturation then began. The maximum proportion of females with fully developed ovaries was found towards the end of summer and in autumn. The main spawning period began in November and lasted until January. however small numbers of ovigerous females occurred throughout the year. Most posteedysial females had sperm plugs in the gonophores. Size at sexual maturity in females is considered to be around 18-20 mm carapace length. Number of eggs carried by ovigerous females increased with size. ranging from about 30000 to about 230000.

Samples were taken on the shelf and upper slope in the northwestern Mediterranean. Males reached larger sizes than females in both species. The sex-ratio did not differ from 1:1 in the smaller sizes; medium sizes were dominated by females. whereas males were more abundant in the larger sizes. No significant differences were found in carapace relative growth between male and female crabs. Males showed a low positive allometry in chela growth. In females. relative chela growth was closer to isometry. The low levels of positive allometry in chelar relative growth are in accordance with the swimming ability shown by most members of the family Portunidae. Both species had allometry levels lower than those shown by strictly benthic species of the family. A mean size at sexual maturity of 24 mm carapace length is estimated for male L. depurator. Sexual dimorphism in chela length is stronger in M. tuberculatus than in L. depurator. Both species are heterochelic. the right chela usually being the crusher. and the left one the cutter.

However. empirical assessment of the performance of EN designs is critical to evaluate the utility of these networks to mitigate effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Landscape genetics provides a particularly valuable framework to address the question of functional connectivity by providing a direct means to investigate the effects of landscape structure on gene flow. The goals of this study are (1) to evaluate the landscape features that drive gene flow of an EN target species (European pine marten). and (2) evaluate the optimality of a regional EN design in providing connectivity for this species within the Basque Country (North Spain). Using partial Mantel tests in a reciprocal causal modeling framework we competed 59 alternative models. including isolation by distance and the regional EN. Our analysis indicated that the regional EN was among the most supported resistance models for the pine marten. but was not the best supported model.

For numerous monogenean fish parasites. infecting different hosts is associated with morphological adaptations. in particular of the attachment organ (haptor). However. haptoral morphology in Cichlidogyrus spp. (Monogenea. Dactylogyridea). parasites of African cichlids. has been mainly linked to phylogenetic rather than to host constraints. Here we determined the position of Cichlidogyrus amieti. a parasite of species of Aphyosemion (Cyprinodontiformes.

The DNA of specimens of C. amieti isolated from Aphyosemion cameronense in Cameroon was sequenced and analyzed together with that of Cichlidogyrus spp. from cichlid hosts. In order to highlight the influence of the lateral transfer of C. amieti on the haptoral sclerotised parts we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compare the attachment organ structure of C. amieti to that of congeners infecting cichlids.

Kenya,2014,Titus Chemandwa Ndiwa and Dorothy Wanja Nyingi and Jean-François Agnese,9,PloS One,9,e106972,Public Library of Science,The need to improve food security in Africa through culture of tilapias has led to transfer of different species from their natural ranges causing negative impacts on wild fish genetic resources. Loboi swamp in Kenya is fed by three hot springs: Lake Bogoria Hotel. Chelaba and Turtle Springs. hosting natural populations of Oreochromis niloticus. The present study aimed at better genetic characterization of these threatened populations. Partial mtDNA sequences of the D-loop region and variations at 16 microsatellite loci were assessed in the three hot spring populations and compared with three other natural populations of O. niloticus in the region. Results obtained indicated that the hot spring populations had mitochondrial and nuclear genetic variability similar to or higher than the large closely related populations. This may be attributed to the perennial nature of the hot springs. which do not depend on rainfall but rather receive permanent water supply from deep aquifers. The study also revealed that gene flow between the three different hot spring populations was sufficiently low thus allowing their differentiation. This differentiation was unexpected considering the very close proximity of the springs to each other. It is possible that the swamp creates a barrier to free movement of fish from one spring to the other thereby diminishing gene flow. Finally. the most surprising and worrying results were that the three hot spring populations are introgressed by mtDNA genes of O. leucostictus. while microsatellite analysis suggested that some nuclear genes may also have crossed the species barrier.

Two species from each group (mass ∼350 mg) were acclimated to 19. 25 and 28°C. with 19 and 28°C estimated to be outside the thermal envelope for LA or HA. respectively. in the wild. Wild-caught animals (F0 generation) were compared with animals raised in captivity at 25°C (F1 generation) to investigate the contribution of adaptation versus plasticity. Temperature significantly increased routine metabolic rate in all groups and generations. However. LA and HA species differed in the effects of temperature on their ability to process a meal. At 25°C. the specific dynamic action (SDA) response was completed within 8 h in all groups. but acclimation to temperatures beyond the thermal envelope caused profound declines in SDA performance. At 19°C. the LA required ∼14 h to complete the SDA. whereas the HA required only ∼7 h. The opposite effect was observed at 28°C. This effect was evident in both F0 and F1. Reaction norms for effects of temperature on SDA therefore revealed a trade-off. with superior performance at warmer temperatures by LA being associated with inferior performance at cooler temperatures. and vice-versa in HA.

The species was reported in 28 localities. mostly consisting of sporadic observations of single individuals. In central Spain an apparently thriving population of raccoons has been recently discovered. Our data confirmed the spread of feral raccoons throughout this region. where the species has already colonized about 100 km of streams and rivers. Predation on local fauna was also proved. and the first approximation for spatial movement and habitat use analyses in Spain is presented. Our results suggest that deliberate releases of raccoons by pet owners are an important cause for the existence of feral raccoons in Spain.

However. species delimitation is problematic in many taxa. including ‘non-adaptive radiations’ containing morphologically cryptic lineages. Fortunately. coalescent-based species delimitation methods hold promise for objectively estimating species limits in such radiations. using multilocus genetic data. Using coalescent-based approaches. we delimit species and infer evolutionary relationships in a morphologically conserved group of Central American freshwater fishes. the Poecilia sphenops species complex. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple genetic markers (sequences of two mitochondrial DNA genes and five nuclear loci) from 10/15 species and genetic lineages recognized in the group support the P. sphenops species complex as monophyletic with respect to outgroups. with eight mitochondrial ‘major-lineages’ diverged by ≥2% pairwise genetic distances. From general mixed Yule-coalescent models. we discovered (conservatively) 10 species within our concatenated mitochondrial DNA dataset. 9 of which were strongly supported by subsequent multilocus Bayesian species delimitation and species tree analyses. Results suggested species-level diversity is underestimated or overestimated by at least ~15% in different lineages in the complex.

Hence. an understanding of the mating system and breeding strategies of reintroduced species can be critical to the success. evaluation and effective management of reintroduction programs. As one of the most threatened crocodile species in the world. the Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius) has been reduced to only a few wild populations in the Llanos of Venezuela and Colombia. One of these populations was founded by reintroduction at Caño Macanillal and La Ramera lagoon within the El Frío Biological Station. Venezuela. Twenty egg clutches of C. intermedius were collected at the El Frío Biological Station for incubation in the lab and release of juveniles after one year. Analyzing 17 polymorphic microsatellite loci from 335 hatchlings we found multiple paternity in C. intermedius. with half of the 20 clutches fathered by two or three males. Sixteen mothers and 14 fathers were inferred by reconstruction of multilocus parental genotypes. Our findings showed skewed paternal contributions to multiple-sired clutches in four of the clutches (40%). leading to an overall unequal contribution of offspring among fathers with six of the 14 inferred males fathering 90% of the total offspring. and three of those six males fathering more than 70% of the total offspring.

Because of the distribution of this genus. it could be hypothesized that the evolutionary patterns in this genus. including a pair of geminate species across the Central American Isthmus. could be explained by vicariance following the break-up of Gondwana. However. the evolutionary history of this group has not been evaluated. We constructed a time-scaled molecular phylogeny of Dormitator using mitochondrial (Cytochrome b) and nuclear (Rhodopsin and β-actin) DNA sequence data to infer and date the cladogenetic events that drove the diversification of the genus and to relate them to the biogeographical history of Central America. Two divergent lineages of Dormitator were recovered: one that included all of the Pacific samples and another that included all of the eastern and western Atlantic samples. In contrast to the Pacific lineage. which showed no phylogeographic structure. the Atlantic lineage was geographically structured into four clades: Cameroon. Gulf of Mexico. West Cuba and Caribbean. showing evidence of potential cryptic species. The separation of the Pacific and Atlantic lineages was estimated to have occurred ~1 million years ago (Mya). whereas the four Atlantic clades showed mean times of divergence between 0.2 and 0.4 Mya.

One reason might be that neural circuits contain hidden variability that becomes relevant only when those individuals are challenged by injury. We found that in the mollusc. Tritonia diomedea. subtle differences between animals within the neural circuit underlying swimming behavior had no behavioral relevance under normal conditions but caused differential vulnerability of the behavior to a particular brain lesion. The extent of motor impairment correlated with the site of spike initiation in a specific neuron in the neural circuit. which was determined by the strength of an inhibitory synapse onto this neuron. Artificially increasing or decreasing this inhibitory synaptic conductance with dynamic clamp correspondingly altered the extent of motor impairment by the lesion without affecting normal operation.

Serotonin has no effects when bath-applied alone. but it modulates the D-glutamate-activated swimming pattern. Three major effects are observed: a dose-dependent reduction in the frequency of rhythmic ventral root burst discharge; enhancement of the intensity of burst discharge. due in part to the recruitment of previously inactive motoneurones; prolongation of the intersegmental phase lag. Motoneurone activation appears to result from enhanced synaptic drive from the central pattern generator; no direct effects of serotonin on the motoneurones themselves (resting potential. input resistance or threshold for action potential generation) were observed.

The gastropyloric receptor (GPR) cells. which are described in the preceding paper. are a set of proprioceptive cells in the crabs Cancer borealis and Cancer irroratus that contain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine. 5-HT) and choline acetyltransferase. These cells have a variety of synaptic effects on cells in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). We used pharmacologic methods to distinguish the effects that were due to acetylcholine (ACh) from those that could be due to serotonin. 2. The GPR cells evoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in two gastric mill motor neurons [lateral and dorsal gastric (LG and DG)] in the stomatogastric ganglion. The EPSPs exhibit nicotinic pharmacology. indicating that they may be due to the release of ACh from the GPR cells. 3.

The lateral pyloric (LP) neuron is a component of the 14-neuron pyloric central pattern generator in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster. Panulirus interruptus. In the pyloric rhythm. this neuron fires rhythmic bursts of action potentials whose phasing depends on the pattern of synaptic inhibition from other network neurons and on the intrinsic postinhibitory rebound properties of the LP cell itself. Bath-applied dopamine excites the LP cell and causes its activity to be phase advanced in the pyloric motor pattern. At least part of this modulatory effect is due to dopaminergic modulation of the intrinsic rate of postinhibitory rebound in the LP cell. 2.

The neural basis of gait control and its dependence on speed are not fully understood. Mice normally use a single “trotting” gait while running at all speeds. either over ground or on a treadmill. Transgenic mouse mutants in which the trotting is replaced by hopping also lack a speed-dependent change in gait. Here we describe a transgenic mouse model in which the V2a interneurons have been ablated by targeted expression of diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA) under the control of the Chx10 gene promoter (Chx10::DTA mice). Chx10::DTA mice show normal trotting gait at slow speeds but transition to a galloping gait as speed increases.

The nudibranch Tritonia diomedea swims by flexing its body dorsally and ventrally. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) are components of the central pattern generator (CPG) underlying this rhythmic motor pattern and also activate crawling. Homologues of the DSIs were identified in six nudibranchs that do not exhibit dorsal–ventral swimming: Tochuina tetraquetra. Melibe leonina. Dendronotus iris. D. frondosus. Armina californica. and Triopha catalinae. Homology was based upon shared features that distinguish the DSIs from all other neurons: (1) serotonin immunoreactivity.

The nudibranch molluscs Tritonia diomedea and Melibe leonina swim differently. yet their nervous systems contain homologous serotonergic neurons. In Tritonia. the dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) are members of the swim central pattern generator (CPG) and their neurotransmitter serotonin is both necessary and sufficient to elicit a swim motor pattern. Here it is shown that the DSI homologues in Melibe. the cerebral serotonergic posterior-A neurons (CeSP-As). are extrinsic to the swim CPG. and that neither the CeSP-As nor their neurotransmitter serotonin is necessary for swim motor pattern initiation. which occurred when the CeSP-As were inactive.

Here the relationship between neural circuits and behavior is explored with respect to the swimming behaviors of the Nudipleura (Mollusca. Gastropoda. Opithobranchia). Nudipleura is a diverse monophyletic clade of sea slugs among which only a small percentage of species can swim. Swimming falls into a limited number of categories. the most prevalent of which are rhythmic left–right body flexions (LR) and rhythmic dorsal–ventral body flexions (DV). The phylogenetic distribution of these behaviors suggests a high degree of homoplasy.

Here we present the complete mitochondrial genomes of Melibe leonina and Tritonia diomedea (more recently named T. tetraquetra). two nudibranchs from the unrepresented Cladobranchia group. and report on the resulting phylogenetic analyses. Both genomes coded for the typical thirteen protein-coding genes. twenty-two transfer RNAs. and two ribosomal RNAs seen in other species. The twelve-nucleotide deletion previously reported for the cytochrome oxidase 1 gene in several other Melibe species was further clarified as three separate deletion events. These deletions were not present in any opisthobranchs examined in our study. including the newly sequenced M. leonina or T. diomedea. suggesting that these previously reported deletions may represent more recently divergent taxa. Analysis of the secondary structures for all twenty-two tRNAs of both M. leonina and T. diomedea indicated truncated d arms for the two serine tRNAs. as seen in some other heterobranchs. In addition. the serine 1 tRNA in T. diomedea contained an anticodon not yet reported in any other gastropod.

Sentences were spoken in an emotional tone of voice (Happy. Disgusted. or Petrified). or in a Neutral tone of voice. Participants made speeded lexical decisions about the word or pseudoword in sentence-final position. Critical stimuli were emotion words that were either semantically congruent or incongruent with the tone of voice of the sentence. Experiment 1. with randomised presentation of tone of voice. showed no effect of congruence or incongruence.

Inc.,We examined the relation between self-explaining and encoding among kindergartners. For 5 days. children (n = 27) took turns solving addition problems with an adult expert who always used an advanced addition strategy. During the game. children explained the expert's answers (Explain-Expert). explained their own answers (Explain-Novice). or did not generate explanations (Control). Encoding of the expert's strategy was measured each day by asking children to describe how the expert had solved the last problem. Explain-Expert children encoded more and learned more than children in the Control group; Explain-Novice children showed neither advantage. The Explain-Expert group also acquired the expert's strategy more rapidly and used it more frequently than the other groups. These results suggest that explanations enhance learning in part by facilitating encoding.,True,VSPuA_MAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,69,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532690xci2304_4,10635486089089734271,/scholar?cites=10635486089089734271,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Calin-Jageman/publication/247502148_The_Role_of_Encoding_in_the_Self-Explanation_Effect/links/540daef30cf2d8daaaccb391/The-Role-of-Encoding-in-the-Self-Explanation-Effect.pdf,0,0,0

1159190,Neuromodulation,2017,PS Katz and Robert Calin-Jageman,,,,,Elsevier,Neuromodulation is the alteration of neuronal and synaptic properties by neurons themselves or by substances released by neurons. Neuromodulatory actions. which are generally mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. affect ion channels and other membrane proteins. thereby altering the firing. synaptic release. or synaptic response properties of neurons. Neuromodulation changes how neurons act in the context of neuronal circuits. allowing anatomically-defined circuits to produce multiple outputs and reconfiguring networks into different functional circuits. The effects of neuromodulation are not static; but produce a dynamic regulation of neuronal circuits.

Activation of the network is triggered by extrinsic excitatory input but also accompanied by intrinsic neuromodulation and the recruitment of additional excitation into the circuit. To examine how these factors influence circuit activation. a detailed simulation of the unmodulated CPG network was constructed from an extensive set of physiological measurements. In this model. extrinsic input alone is insufficient to initiate rhythmic activity. confirming that additional processes are involved in circuit activation. However. incorporating known neuromodulatory and polysynaptic effects into the model still failed to enable rhythmic activity. suggesting that additional circuit features are also required.

Therefore. understanding the operation of nervous systems ultimately requires an inventory of their constituent neurons and synaptic connectivity. which form neural circuits. The presence of uniquely identifiable neurons or classes of neurons in many invertebrates has facilitated the construction of cellular-level connectivity diagrams that can be generalized across individuals within a species. Homologous neurons can also be recognized across species. Here we describe NeuronBank.org. a web-based tool that we are developing for cataloging. searching. and analyzing neuronal circuitry within and across species. Information from a single species is represented in an individual branch of NeuronBank. Users can search within a branch or perform queries across branches to look for similarities in neuronal circuits across species. The branches allow for an extensible ontology so that additional characteristics can be added as knowledge grows. Each entry in NeuronBank generates a unique accession ID. allowing it to be easily cited. There is also an automatic link to a Wiki page allowing an encyclopedic explanation of the entry. All of the 44 previously published neurons plus one previously unpublished neuron from the mollusc.

Previous work has identified 10 transcripts which are rapidly up-regulated after long-term sensitization training in the pleural ganglia. Here we use quantitative PCR to begin examining how these transcriptional changes are expressed in different CNS loci related to defensive withdrawal reflexes at 1 and 24 hours after long-term sensitization training. Specifically. we sample from a) the sensory wedge of the pleural ganglia. which exclusively contains the VC nociceptor cell bodies that help mediate input to defensive withdrawal circuits. b) the remaining pleural ganglia. which contain withdrawal interneurons. and c) the pedal ganglia. which contain many motor neurons. Results from the VC cluster show different temporal patterns of regulation: 1) rapid but transient up-regulation of Aplysia homologs of C/EBP.

Tritonia diomedea. the serotonergic dorsal swim interneuron (DSI) produces spike timing-dependent neuromodulation (STDN) of the synaptic output of ventral swim interneuron B (VSI) resulting in a biphasic. bidirectional change of synaptic strength characterized by a rapid heterosynaptic potentiation followed by a more prolonged heterosynaptic depression. This study examined the mechanism underlying the potentiation phase of STDN. In the presence of 4-aminopyridine. which blocks the depression phase and enhances transmitter release from VSI. rapidly stimulating VSI led to a steady-state level of transmitter depletion during which potentiation by DSI or serotonin (5-HT) was eliminated. Cumulative plots of excitatory postsynaptic currents were used to estimate changes in the size and replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool (RRP) and the fraction of release. 5-HT application increased …,True,VSPuA_MAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,14,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.00702.2007,7890117496351399738,/scholar?cites=7890117496351399738,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00702.2007,0,0,0

Eskine reported that participants exposed to organic food became much more morally judgmental and much less prosocial relative to participants exposed to neutral or comfort foods. This research sparked tremendous media interest. but was based on one experiment with a small sample size. We report three attempts to replicate Eskine using samples conferring high power. preregistered analysis plans. and original materials. Across two direct replications and an online conceptual replication. we found that organic food exposure has little to no effect on moral judgments (d = 0.06. 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.14. 0.26].

We focused on 5 candidate plasticity genes which are rapidly up-regulated in the Aplysia genus by in vivo serotonin treatment. but which have not yet been tested for regulation during sensitization: CREB1. matrilin. antistasin. eIF3e. and BAT1 homolog. CREB1 was rapidly up-regulated by both treatments. but the regulation following training was transient. falling back to control levels 24 hours after training. This suggests some caution in interpreting the proposed role of CREB1 in consolidating long-term sensitization memory. Both matrilin and eIF3e were up-regulated by in vivo serotonin but not by long-term sensitization training. This suggests that in vivo serotonin may produce generalized transcriptional effects that are not specific to long-term sensitization learning. Finally. neither treatment produced regulation of antistasin or BAT1 homolog. transcripts regulated by in vivo serotonin in the closely related Aplysia kurodai.

An effect size is just a quantitative answer to a research question. Effect sizes should always be accompanied by a confidence interval or some other means of expressing uncertainty in generalizing from the sample to the population. Effect sizes are best interpreted in raw scores. but can also be expressed in standardized terms; several popular standardized effect score measures are explained and compared.

Although RLS affects 2% to 15% of the general population. the neural circuitry contributing to RLS remains speculative. and there is currently no accepted animal model to enable detailed mechanistic analyses. Traditional views suggest that RLS arises from supraspinal sources which favor facilitation of the flexor reflex and emergence of the RLS phenotype.

By using simultaneous EMG recordings from the gastric and pyloric musclesin vivo. we found that after feeding. the gastropyloric interaction disappears as the two networks express accelerated motor rhythms. The return to control levels of network activity occurs progressively over the following 1–2 d and is associated with a gradual reappearance of the gastropyloric interaction.

Dopamine receptors can be grouped into two families—the D1/5 receptor group and the D2/3/4 group. which have excitatory and inhibitory effects. respectively. Our data suggest that dopamine exerts contrasting dose-dependent modulatory effects via the two receptor families.

We have previously shown that mice lacking the functional D3 receptor (D3KO) exhibit decreased paw withdrawal latencies from painful thermal stimuli. Altering the DA system in the CNS. including D1 and D3 receptor systems. reduces the ability of opioids to provide analgesia. Here. we tested if the increased pain sensitivity in D3KO might result from a modified µ-opioid receptor (MOR) function at the spinal cord level. As D1 and D3 receptor subtypes have competing cellular effects and can form heterodimers. we tested if the changes in MOR function may be mediated in D3KO through the functionally intact D1 receptor system. We assessed thermal paw withdrawal latencies in D3KO and wild type (WT) mice before and after systemic treatment with morphine. determined MOR and phosphorylated MOR (p-MOR) protein expression levels in lumbar spinal cords. and tested the functional effects of DA and MOR receptor agonists in the isolated spinal cord. In vivo. a single morphine administration (2 mg/kg) increased withdrawal latencies in WT but not D3KO. and these differential effects were mimicked in vitro. where morphine modulated spinal reflex amplitudes (SRAs) in WT but not D3KO. Total MOR protein expression levels were similar between WT and D3KO. but the ratio of phosphorylated MOR (pMOR)/total MOR was higher in D3KO.

Brain iron deficiency (BID) is well recognized as a main initial pathophysiological mechanism of RLS.

We recently showed that BID in rodents is associated with changes in adenosinergic transmission. with downregulation of adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) as the most sensitive biochemical finding. It was hypothesized that A1R downregulation leads to hypersensitive striatal glutamatergic terminals and facilitation of striatal dopamine release.

Here the relationship between neural circuits and behavior is explored with respect to the swimming behaviors of the Nudipleura (Mollusca. Gastropoda. Opithobranchia). Nudipleura is a diverse monophyletic clade of sea slugs among which only a small percentage of species can swim. Swimming falls into a limited number of categories. the most prevalent of which are rhythmic left–right body flexions (LR) and rhythmic dorsal–ventral body flexions (DV). The phylogenetic distribution of these behaviors suggests a high degree of homoplasy. The central pattern generator (CPG) underlying DV swimming has been well characterized in Tritonia diomedea and in Pleurobranchaea californica.

However. evolutionary divergence can cause some species to not display particular behaviors. thereby making it impossible to use physiological characteristics related to those behaviors for identifying homologous neurons across species. Therefore. to understand the neural basis of species-specific behavior. it is necessary to identify homologues using characteristics that are independent of physiology. In the Nudipleura mollusc Tritonia diomedea. Cerebral Neuron 2 (C2) was first described as being a member of the swim central pattern generator (CPG). Here we demonstrate that neurochemical markers. in conjunction with previously known neuroanatomical characteristics. allow C2 to be uniquely identified without the aid of electrophysiological measures. Specifically. C2 had three characteristics that. taken together. identified the neuron: 1) a white cell on the dorsal surface of the cerebral ganglion. 2) an axon that projected to the contralateral pedal ganglion and through the pedal commissure. and 3) immunoreactivity for the peptides FMRFamide and Small Cardioactive Peptide B. These same anatomical and neurochemical characteristics also uniquely identified the C2 homologue in Pleurobranchaea californica (called A1). which was previously identified by its analogous role in the Pleurobranchaea swim CPG.

How physiological state influences food sharing and social behaviour in social insects is poorly understood. Here. we examined the social interactions and food sharing behaviour of honeybees with the aim of developing the honeybee as a model for understanding how an individual's state influences its social interactions. The state of individual honeybees was manipulated by either starving donor bees or feeding them sucrose or low doses of ethanol to examine how a change in hunger or inebriation state affected the social behaviours exhibited by two closely-related nestmates. Using a lab-based assay for measuring individual motor behaviour and social behaviour. we found that behaviours such as antennation. willingness to engage in trophallaxis. and mandible opening were affected by both hunger and ethanol intoxication. Inebriated bees were more likely to exhibit mandible opening. which may represent a form of aggression. than bees fed sucrose alone. However. intoxicated bees were as willing to engage in trophallaxis as the sucrose-fed bees. The effects of ethanol on social behaviors were dose-dependent. with higher doses of ethanol producing larger effects on behaviour. Hungry donor bees. on the other hand. were more likely to engage in begging for food and less likely to antennate and to display mandible opening.

One reason might be that neural circuits contain hidden variability that becomes relevant only when those individuals are challenged by injury. We found that in the mollusc. Tritonia diomedea. subtle differences between animals within the neural circuit underlying swimming behavior had no behavioral relevance under normal conditions but caused differential vulnerability of the behavior to a particular brain lesion. The extent of motor impairment correlated with the site of spike initiation in a specific neuron in the neural circuit. which was determined by the strength of an inhibitory synapse onto this neuron. Artificially increasing or decreasing this inhibitory synaptic conductance with dynamic clamp correspondingly altered the extent of motor impairment by the lesion without affecting normal operation.

Using single C2 neuron transcriptome sequencing and absolute quantitative PCR (qPCR). we found that 5-HT2a and 5-HT7 receptor expression was high in C2 neurons isolated from Tritonia and individual Pleurobranchaea that swam. but not Hermissenda or non-swimming Pleurobranchaea. In contrast. C2 neurons isolated from Hermissenda exhibited higher 5-HT4 and 5-HT6 expression. neither of which was expressed in Tritonia C2 neurons.

NALCN is a highly conserved gene from simple. extant multicellular organisms without nervous systems such as sponges and placozoans and mostly remains a single gene compared to the calcium and sodium channels which diversified into twenty genes in humans. The single NALCN gene has alternatively-spliced exons at exons 15 or exon 31 that splices in novel selectivity filter residues that resemble calcium channels (EEEE) or sodium channels (EKEE or EEKE). NALCN channels with alternative calcium. (EEEE) and sodium. (EKEE or EEKE) -selective pores are conserved in simple bilaterally symmetrical animals like flatworms to non-chordate deuterostomes. The single NALCN gene is limited as a sodium channel with a lysine (K)-containing pore in vertebrates. but originally NALCN was a calcium-like channel. and evolved to operate as both a calcium channel and sodium channel for different roles in many invertebrates. Expression patterns of NALCN-EKEE in pond snail.

NSCaTE is an optional. lower affinity and calcium-sensitive binding site for calmodulin (CaM) which competes for CaM binding with a more ancient. C-terminal IQ domain on L-type channels. CaM bound to N- and C- terminal tails serve as dual detectors to changing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. promoting calcium-dependent inactivation of L-type calcium channels. NSCaTE is absent in some arthropod species. and is also lacking in vertebrate L-type isoforms. Cav1.1 and Cav1.4 channels. The pervasiveness of a methionine just downstream from NSCaTE suggests that L-type channels could generate alternative N-termini lacking NSCaTE through the choice of translational start sites. Long N-terminus with an NSCaTE motif in L-type calcium channel homolog LCav1 from pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis has a faster calcium-dependent inactivation than a shortened N-termini lacking NSCaTE. NSCaTE effects are present in low concentrations of internal buffer (0.5 mM EGTA). but disappears in high buffer conditions (10 mM EGTA). Snail and mammalian NSCaTE have an alpha-helical propensity upon binding Ca2+-CaM and can saturate both CaM N-terminal and C-terminal domains in the absence of a competing IQ motif.

The snail T-type gene. LCav3 from Lymnaea stagnalis. possesses alternative. tandem donor splice sites enabling a choice of a large exon 8b (201 aa) or a short exon 25c (9 aa) in cytoplasmic linkers. similar to mammalian homologs. Inclusion of optional 25c exons in the III–IV linker of T-type channels speeds up kinetics and causes hyperpolarizing shifts in both activation and steady-state inactivation of macroscopic currents. The abundant variant lacking exon 25c is the workhorse of embryonic Cav3 channels. whose high density and right-shifted activation and availability curves are expected to increase pace-making and allow the channels to contribute more significantly to cellular excitation in prenatal tissue. Presence of brain-enriched. optional exon 8b conserved with mammalian Cav3.1 and encompassing the proximal half of the I–II linker. imparts a ∼50% reduction in total and surface-expressed LCav3 channel protein. which accounts for reduced whole-cell calcium currents of +8b variants in HEK cells.

In animals. Cav channels play crucial roles including driving muscle contraction (excitation-contraction coupling). gene expression (excitation-transcription coupling). pre-synaptic and neuroendocrine exocytosis (excitation-secretion coupling). regulation of flagellar/ciliary beating. and regulation of cellular excitability. either directly or through modulation of other Ca2+-sensitive ion channels.

Furthermore. expanded gene datasets have permitted improved inference of the species phylogeny at the base of Metazoa. providing clearer insights into the evolution of complex animal traits which involve Cav channels. including the nervous system. For the various types of metazoan Cav channels. key properties that determine their cellular contribution include: ion selectivity. pore gating. and. importantly. cytoplasmic protein-protein interactions that direct sub-cellular localization and functional complexing.

Although many important contributions have been made using Tritonia. until now. a lack of genetic information has impeded exploration at the molecular level.   Results We performed Illumina sequencing of central nervous system mRNAs from Tritonia. generating 133.1 million 100 base pair. paired-end reads. De novo reconstruction of the RNA-Seq data yielded a total of 185.546 contigs. which partitioned into 123.154 non-redundant gene clusters (unigenes). BLAST comparison with RefSeq and Swiss-Prot protein databases. as well as mRNA data from other invertebrates (gastropod molluscs: Aplysia californica. Lymnaea stagnalis and Biomphalaria glabrata; cnidarian: Nematostella vectensis) revealed that up to 76.292 unigenes in the Tritonia transcriptome have putative homologues in other databases. 18.246 of which are below a more stringent E-value cut-off of 1x10-6.

HEK-293T cells must be plated onto glass coverslips at low enough density so that they are not in contact with each other in order to allow for electrophysiological recording without confounding effects due to contact with adjacent cells. Transfected channels must also express with high efficiency at the plasma membrane for whole-cell patch clamp recording of detectable currents above noise levels. Heterologous ion channels often require long incubation periods at 28°C after transfection in order to achieve adequate membrane expression. but there are increasing losses of cell-coverslip adhesion and membrane stability at this temperature. To circumvent this problem. we developed an optimized strategy to transfect and plate HEK-293T cells. This method requires that cells be transfected at a relatively high confluency. and incubated at 28°C for varying incubation periods post-transfection to allow for adequate ion channel protein expression. Transfected cells are then plated onto glass coverslips and incubated at 37°C for several hours. which allows for rigid cell attachment to the coverslips and membrane restabilization. Cells can be recorded shortly after plating. or can be transferred to 28°C for further incubation.

Panulirus argus. has two classes of chemosensilla representing “olfaction” and “distributed chemoreception.” as is typical for decapod crustaceans. Olfactory sensilla are found exclusively on antennular lateral flagella and are innervated only by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that project into olfactory lobes organized into glomeruli in the brain. Distributed chemoreceptor sensilla are found on all body surfaces including the antennular lateral flagella (LF) and walking leg dactyls (dactyls). and are innervated by both chemoreceptor neurons (CRNs) and mechanoreceptor neurons that project into somatotopically organized neuropils. Here. we examined expression of three classes of chemosensory genes in transcriptomes of the LF (with ORNs and CRNs). dactyls (with only CRNs). and brain of P. argus: Ionotropic Receptors (IRs). which are related to ionotropic glutamate receptors and found in all protostomes including crustaceans; Gustatory Receptors (GRs). which are ionotropic receptors that are abundantly expressed in insects but more restricted in crustaceans; and Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels. a diverse set of sensor-channels that include several chemosensors in diverse animals. We identified 108 IRs. one GR. and 18 homologues representing all seven subfamilies of TRP channels. The number of IRs expressed in the LF is far greater than in dactyls. possibly reflecting the contribution of receptor proteins associated with the ORNs beyond those associated with CRNs.

Leak currents were generated by the weakening of gigaohm patch seals by artificial membrane rupture using the ZAP function on the patch clamp amplifier. Surprisingly. we found that leak currents generated from the weakened membrane/glass seal can be surprisingly stable and exhibit behavior that is consistent with a sodium leak current derived from an expressible channel. Leaky patch currents differing by 10 fold in size were similarly reduced in size when external sodium ions were replaced with the large monovalent ion NMDG+. Leaky patch currents increased when external Ca2+ (1.2 mM) was lowered to 0.1 mM and were inhibited (>40% to >90%) with 10 µM Gd3+. 100 µM La3+. 1 mM Co2+ or 1 mM Cd2+. Leaky patch currents were relatively insensitive (<30%) to 1 mM Ni2+ and exhibited a variable amount of block with 1 mM verapamil and were insensitive to 100 µM mibefradil or 100 µM nifedipine. We hypothesize that the rapid changes in leak current size in response to changing external cations or drugs relates to their influences on the membrane seal adherence and the electro-osmotic flow of mobile cations channeling in crevices of a particular pore size in the interface between the negatively charged patch electrode and the lipid membrane.

The complexity of this relationship expanded in vertebrates to include four different possible Cavβ subunits (β1. β2. β3. β4) which associate with four Cav1 channel isoforms (Cav1.1 to Cav1.4) and three Cav2 channel isoforms (Cav2.1 to Cav2.3). Here we assess the fundamentally-shared features of the Cavβ subunit in an invertebrate model (pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) that bears only three homologous genes: (LCav1. LCav2. and LCavβ). Invertebrate Cavβ subunits (in flatworms. snails. squid and honeybees) slow the inactivation kinetics of Cav2 channels. and they do so with variable N-termini and lacking the canonical palmitoylation residues of the vertebrate β2a subunit. Alternative splicing of exon 7 of the HOOK domain is a primary determinant of a slow inactivation kinetics imparted by the invertebrate LCavβ subunit. LCavβ will also slow the inactivation kinetics of LCav3 T-type channels. but this is likely not physiologically relevant in vivo. Variable N-termini have little influence on the voltage-dependent inactivation kinetics of differing invertebrate Cavβ subunits. but the expression pattern of N-terminal splice isoforms appears to be highly tissue specific. Molluscan LCavβ subunits have an N-terminal “A” isoform (coded by exons: 1a and 1b) that structurally resembles the muscle specific variant of vertebrate β1a subunit. and has a broad mRNA expression profile in brain. heart. muscle and glands.

1159291,Direct benefits of social dominance in juvenile crayfish,2007,Jens Herberholz and Catherine McCurdy and Donald H Edwards,213,The Biological Bulletin,1,21-27,Marine Biological Laboratory,Crayfish are known for their innate aggressiveness and willingness to quickly establish dominance relationships among group members. Consequently. the formation of dominance hierarchies and the analysis of behavioral patterns displayed during agonistic encounters have mostly been tested in environments that provide no immediate resources besides space. We tested the hypothesis that social hierarchy formation in crayfish serves to determine access to future resources. Individuals within groups of three juvenile crayfish were allowed to form a social hierarchy in a featureless environment before a single food resource was presented. Higher dominance indices were significantly correlated with increased access to the food. The highest ranked crayfish spent more time in contact with the food than did medium-ranked and lowest ranked crayfish. and crayfish of medium rank spent more time in contact with the …,True,1FcrZgsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,83,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/25066615,8994557442818420122,/scholar?cites=8994557442818420122,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald_Edwards/publication/6159184_Direct_Benefits_of_Social_Dominance_in_Juvenile_Crayfish/links/02e7e52651e9451d93000000/Direct-Benefits-of-Social-Dominance-in-Juvenile-Crayfish.pdf,0,0,0

A single LG spike is necessary and sufficient to produce a highly stereotyped tail flip that thrusts the animal away from the source of stimulation. Here we describe a lateral excitatory network among primary afferent axons in the last abdominal ganglion of crayfish that produces nonlinear amplification of the sensory input to the command circuitry for escape. The lateral excitation is mediated by electrical synapses between central terminals of primary mechanosensory afferents. The network enables stimulated afferents to recruit unstimulated afferents that contribute additional input to LG and to mechanosensory interneurons that also converge on LG.

We show here that extremely precise coincidence detection is a natural consequence of the normal function of rectifying electrical synapses. Such synapses open to bidirectional current flow when presynaptic cells depolarize relative to their postsynaptic targets and remain open until well after completion of presynaptic spikes. When multiple input neurons fire simultaneously. the synaptic currents sum effectively and produce a large excitatory postsynaptic potential. However. when some inputs are delayed relative to the rest. their contributions are reduced because the early excitatory postsynaptic potential retards the opening of additional voltage-sensitive synapses. and the late synaptic currents are shunted by already opened junctions.

Several neural circuits in crayfish that mediate incompatible  behaviors have been found to interact through inhibition; this accounts for increased stimulus threshold of one behavior (e.g.. escape tailflip) during performance of others (eating. walking. defense). To determine whether  mutual inhibition between command systems can provide a mechanism that  produces adaptive behavior.

Metamodulation occurs when the neuromodulatory effect is itself modulated. often in response to a change in the behavioral state of the animal. The well-studied neural circuit that mediates escape in the crayfish is modulated by serotonin. and this modulation is subject to two forms of metamodulation. First. the serotonergic modulation of the Lateral Giant (LG) command neuron for escape depends on the pattern of exposure of the cell to serotonin. High and low concentrations. and rapid and slow exposures each produce opposite modulatory effects on sensory-evoked EPSPs in LG.

The process of protein ubiquitination utilizes an enzymatic cascade that consists of a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1). ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3). There are an estimated 600 - 700 E3 ligase genes representing ~5% of the human genome. Not surprisingly. mutations in E3 ligase genes have been observed in multiple neurological conditions.

The idea behind the MiniCAVE concept is to downscale the computing hardware to fast PCs running Windows NT and to downscale the projection systems to relatively inexpensive and relatively robust LCD projection systems.Much to our surprise. when we started this project in early 1998. the performance of a 200 megahertz Pentium Pro (at $3.000) was competitive with the performance of an SGI Onyx RE2 (at $120.000) when running matrix-oriented mathematics software. This suggested that a much cheaper version of the CAVE might be assembled using Pentium II hardware. Currently. we are working with a PC that has two 466 megahertz processors. Also. both resolution and frame rates of LCD-type projectors have improved substantially during the last few years. Brightness already is substantially better than CRT systems.

1159334,Visualizing text readability,2011,Saurav Karmakar and Ying Zhu,,,,291-296,IEEE,Many readability tests have been developed to assess the reading difficulty of a text document. They are largely based on two categories of readability metrics: word complexity and sentence complexity. However. most of the readability tests assign a single readability index for the entire document. making it difficult to assess how the various readability metrics are distributed across the document.

We present a method for constructing this model for general deductive databases. which are logic programs without any function symbols. The method adopts paraconsistent relations as the semantic objects associated with the predicate symbols of the database. Paraconsistent relations are a generalization of ordinary relations in that they allow manipulation of incomplete as well as inconsistent information.

1159356,Declarative object-oriented programming: Inheritance. subtyping and prototyping,1994,S Alagić and Rajshekhar Sunderraman and Rajiv Bagai,,,,236-259,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,A design and implementation of a declarative object-oriented language is presented. The language is strongly and mostly statically typed and supports software reuse techniques such as inheritance. subtype and parametric polymorphism. It differs significantly from the existing strongly typed object-oriented languages in its declarative constraint language which is based on a suitably extended logic programming paradigm. Behavioral subtyping and advanced polymorphic facilities (such as. for example. F-bounded polymorphism) now fit naturally into this general paradigm. The underlying implementation technique produces a powerful prototyping tool for object-oriented software development and generalizes logic programming architectures by an algebraic automata based model for representing object states and state transitions.,True,pXsiqKwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,18,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0052186,11784391555197253447,/scholar?cites=11784391555197253447,,http://www.lirmm.fr/~ducour/Doc-objets/ECOOP/papers/0821/08210236.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore. understanding the operation of nervous systems ultimately requires an inventory of their constituent neurons and synaptic connectivity. which form neural circuits. The presence of uniquely identifiable neurons or classes of neurons in many invertebrates has facilitated the construction of cellular-level connectivity diagrams that can be generalized across individuals within a species. Homologous neurons can also be recognized across species. Here we describe NeuronBank.org. a web-based tool that we are developing for cataloging. searching. and analyzing neuronal circuitry within and across species. Information from a single species is represented in an individual branch of NeuronBank. Users can search within a branch or perform queries across branches to look for similarities in neuronal circuits across species. The branches allow for an extensible ontology so that additional characteristics can be added as knowledge grows. Each entry in NeuronBank generates a unique accession ID. allowing it to be easily cited. There is also an automatic link to a Wiki page allowing an encyclopedic explanation of the entry. All of the 44 previously published neurons plus one previously unpublished neuron from the mollusc. Tritonia diomedea. have been entered into a branch of NeuronBank as have 4 previously published neurons from the mollusc. Melibe leonina. The ability to organize information about neuronal circuits will make this information more accessible. ultimately aiding research on these important models.,True,pXsiqKwAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,16,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2010.00009/full,1941867775728792278,/scholar?cites=1941867775728792278,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2010.00009/full,0,0,0

We find a functional role for short-term synaptic enhancement (STE) such as facilitation. augmentation. and post-tetanic potentiation at central synapses in the sea slug Aplysia californica. Consummatory feeding in Aplysia such as rhythmic biting is controlled by command-like cerebral-buccal interneurons (CBIs) that drive rhythmic motor output in the buccal ganglia.

Upon transplantation. neural progenitors migrate toward areas of damage and inflammation in the CNS. We tested whether undifferentiated and neuralized mouse ES cells migrate toward media conditioned by glioma cell lines (C6. U87 & N1321) or Stem Cell Factor (SCF). Cell migration assays revealed selective migration by neuralized ES cells to conditioned media as well as to synthetic SCF. Migration of undifferentiated ES cells was extensive. but not significantly different from that of controls (Unconditioned Medium). RT-PCR analysis revealed that all the three tumor cell lines tested synthesized SCF and that both undifferentiated and neuralized ES cells expressed c-kit. the receptor for SCF. Our results demonstrate that undifferentiated ES cells are highly mobile and that neural progenitors derived from ES cells are selectively attracted toward factors produced by gliomas. Given that the glioma cell lines synthesize SCF. SCF may be one of several factors that contribute to the selective migration observed.,True,M5SjzboAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,39,https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2867-6-1,13261515468304419675,/scholar?cites=13261515468304419675,,https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2867-6-1,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,Central pattern generator (CPG) circuits control cyclic motor output underlying rhythmic behaviors. Although there have been extensive behavioral and cellular studies of food‐induced feeding arousal as well as satiation in Aplysia. very little is known about the neuronal circuits controlling rhythmic consummatory feeding behavior. However. recent studies have identified premotor neurons that initiate and maintain buccal motor programs underlying ingesion and egestion in Aplysia. Other newly identified neurons receive synaptic input from feeding CPGs and in turn synapse with and control the output of buccal motor neurons. Some of these neurons and their effects within the buccal system are modulated by endogenous neuropeptides.

ELH induces an inward current that persists in the presence of the peptide and that decays slowly after ELH is removed from the bath. The effect is not due to a decrease in the delayed potassium current. the calcium-activated potassium current. or the transient potassium current. Current-voltage measurements indicate that ELH produces increased inward currents from -80 mV to approximately equal to 0 mV. The effect is particularly enhanced in the region from -40 mV to -25 mV where a negative slope conductance due to voltage-dependent slow inward current is observed.

Inc.,The inhibitory neurotransmitter γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to play an important role in activity‐dependent stages of brain development. Previous studies have shown that different functional subclasses of cortical GABA‐containing neurons can be distinguished by antibodies to the calcium‐binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin. Thus insight into the development of distinct subsets of inhibitory cortical circuits can be gained by studying the development of these calcium‐binding protein‐containing neurons. Previous studies in several mammalian species have suggested that calcium‐binding proteins are upregulated in sensory cortex when thalamocortical afferents arrive. In ferrets. the ingrowth of thalamic axons into cortex occurs well into postnatal development. allowing access to early stages of cortical development and calcium‐binding protein expression.

Critical to exploiting this effort is the ability to place these data into a common frame of reference. Here we have developed a computational method for annotating gene expression patterns in the context of a digital atlas to facilitate custom user queries and comparisons of this type of data. This procedure has been applied to 200 genes in the postnatal mouse brain. As an illustration of utility. we identify candidate genes that may be related to Parkinson disease by using the expression of a dopamine transporter in the substantia nigra as a search query pattern. In addition. we discover that transcription factor Rorb is down-regulated in the barrelless mutant relative to control mice by quantitative comparison of expression patterns in layer IV somatosensory cortex.

The cross-modal plasticity paradigm provides a unique and direct way to address the controversy. and has provided important insights. This approach has shown that diverting visual afferents to auditory thalamus from birth results in an auditory cortex with reorganized circuitry. with visual responses typical of those seen in visual cortex. and with the ability to mediate visual behaviour. This work provides strong evidence that sensory afferents have the ability to organize cortical circuits for the purpose of their own optimum processing. The ability of sensory inputs to drive the organization of cortical circuitry may also facilitate recovery from perinatal brain damage. and compensation by sensory substitution in deaf or blind individuals.

In contrast. visual deprivation neither prevents nor delays refinement of RF size in the superior colliculus (SC) of Syrian hamsters. although vision is required for RF maintenance in the SC. Here. we report that. contrary to expectation. visual cortical RF refinement occurs normally in dark-reared animals. As in the SC. a brief period of visual experience is required to maintain V1 RF refinement in adulthood. Whereas in the SC. 3 days of visual experience within a sensitive period (P37–40) was sufficient to protect RFs from deprivation-induced enlargement in adulthood. 7 days (P33–40) were required for RF size maintenance in V1.

The ratio of retinal ganglion cells to their target cells in the optic tectum can be altered experimentally either by early partial tectal ablation. which results in an orderly compression of near‐normal numbers of retinal projections into a smaller tectal area. or by early monocular enucleation. which results in the expansion of a reduced number of axons in a near‐normal tectal volume.

We focus on the Min-Power Symmetric Connectivity problem. in which the bidirectional links established by the transmission ranges are required to form a connected graph. Implicit in previous work on transmission range assignment under asymmetric connectivity requirements is the proof that Min-Power Symmetric Connectivity is NP-hard and that the MST algorithm has a performance ratio of 2.

This paper studies the well-known Minimum-Latency Aggregation Schedule (MLAS) problem and proposes an energy-efficient distributed scheduling algorithm named Clu-DDAS based on a novel cluster-based aggregation tree.

Clu-DDAS has comparable latency as the previously best centralized algorithm E-PAS. while Clu-DDAS consumes 78% less energy as shown by the simulation results.

Heidelberg,We present a new set of distributed algorithms for scheduling sensors to enhance the total lifetime of a wireless sensor network. These algorithms are based on constructing minimal cover sets each consisting of one or more sensors which can collectively cover the local targets.  Some of the covers are heuristically better than others for a sensor trying to decide its own sense-sleep status.  This leads to various ways to assign priorities to the covers. The algorithms work by having each sensor transition through these possible prioritized cover sets. settling for the best cover it can negotiate with its neighbors.

The algorithms are for checking bipartiteness and for finding a spanning forest. the connected components. a fundamental cycle set. and the bridges of a graph.

In all the algorithms. low communication overhead is achieved by restricting the message-flow to only between the neighboring processors.

The network model consists of a large number of sensors with adjustable sensing ranges being deployed to monitor a set of targets. Since more than one sensor can cover a target. in order to be energy efficient. one can activate successive subsets of sensors that cover all targets. This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the total lifetime of such an activation schedule. In contrast to the approach taken by Cardei et al.

Protoc,,1-3,,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have attracted a lot of recent research interest due to their applicability in security. monitoring. disaster relief and environmental applications. WSNs consist of a number of low-cost sensors scattered in a geographical area of interest and connected by a wireless RF interface. Sensors gather information about the monitored area and send this information to gateway nodes. The radio on board these sensor nodes has limited range and allows the node to transmit over short distances. In most deployment scenarios. it is not possible for each node to communicate directly to the sink and hence. the model of communication is to transmit over short distances to other peers in the direction of the sink nodes.In order to keep their cost low. the sensors are equipped with limited energy and computational resources. The energy supply is typically in the form of a battery and once the battery is exhausted. the sensor is considered to be dead. The nodes also have limited memory and processing capabilities. Hence. harnessing the potential of these networks involves tackling a myriad of different issues from algorithms for network operation. programming models. architecture and hardware to more traditional networking issues.

Cluster-head failure can leave a cluster disconnected from the base station until the network reorganizes again. We use the density of the network to improve the lifetime of the network by about 80% while allowing for recovery from the failure of a cluster head. This comes at the cost of a slightly increased number of clusters.,True,roxYi-QAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,http://webpages.ursinus.edu/adhawan/papers/wanc11.pdf,312358676503570958,/scholar?cites=312358676503570958,,http://webpages.ursinus.edu/adhawan/papers/wanc11.pdf,0,0,0

1159459,Distributed Clone Detection in Mobile Sensor Networks.,2017,Abu Sayed Chowdhury and Akshaye Dhawan,,,,135-141,,In this paper we present a clone detection technique for mobile wireless sensor networks. Since sensor nodes can be compromised and cloned by an adversary. it is desirable to have a distributed clone detection algorithm wherein the nodes in the network themselves identify cloned nodes. Most approaches in the literature have a deterministic set of witness nodes that check for the presence of cloned nodes for a given ID based by receiving claim messages that show two or more nodes with the same ID in different locations. We present a new approach to distributed clone detection called Distributed Detection using Prefix Matching (DDPM). Our approach is designed to work in a mobile sensor network and is based on using a random number and a hash function of the claiming nodes ID to generate a key. We then match the prefix of this key to sensor node IDs in the network to determine a set of inspector nodes that will detect clones for a given round. We demonstrate a 7-10% improvement in the number of witness nodes as a measure of security while also reducing the communication overhead.,True,roxYi-QAAAAJ:z_wVstp3MssC,1,https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2017/61307/61307.pdf,4311572032500718131,/scholar?cites=4311572032500718131,,https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2017/61307/61307.pdf,0,0,0
1159460,Fault-tolerant Coverage in Dense Wireless Sensor Networks,2013,Akshaye Dhawan and Magdalena Parks,,,,,,In this paper. we present methods to detect and recover from sensor failure in dense wireless sensor networks. In order to extend the lifetime of a sensor network while maintaining coverage. a minimal subset of the deployed sensors are kept active while the other sensors can enter a low power sleep state. Several distributed algorithms for coverage have been proposed in the literature. Faults are of particular concern in coverage algorithms since sensors go into a sleep state in order to conserve battery until woken up by active sensors. If these active sensors were to fail. this could lead to lapses in coverage that are unacceptable in critical applications. Also. most algorithms in the literature rely on an active sensor that is about to run out of battery waking up its neighbors to trigger a reshuffle in the network. However. this would not work in the case of unexpected failures since a sensor cannot predict the occurrence of such an event. We present detection and recovery from sensor failure in dense networks. Our algorithms exploit the density in the recovery scheme to improve coverage by 4-12% in the event of random failures. This fault tolerance comes at a small cost to the network lifetime with observed lifetime being reduced by 6-10% in our simulation studies.,True,roxYi-QAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,1,https://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/math_comp_fac/5/,4937759136636176883,/scholar?cites=4937759136636176883,,https://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=math_comp_fac,0,0,0

This is a known NP-complete problem. due to the exponential number of possible ways to select a subset of sensors to turn on. Our earlier work had presented a unique model for this problem by introducing a lifetime dependency (LD) graph in which these possible cover sets are nodes and edges represent shared sensors between them. Using the graph properties. we presented a range of effective distributed heuristics. Even though the local subgraphs are practically tractable. their theoretically exponential growth has remained a persistent issue.

1159463,On distributed algorithms for maximizing the network lifetime in wireless sensor networks,,Akshaye Dhawan,,,,,,A key challenge in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is that of extending the lifetime of these networks while maintaining certain coverage goals. Existing work has studied scheduling sensors into a sleep-sense cycle based on simple greedy criteria or by using centralized optimization techniques. We look beyond these greedy heuristics to study the problem structure that exists between different cover sets. In this position paper. we argue that improved distributed algorithms can be designed by paying attention to the inherent dependency that exists between different cover sets since they share sensors in common. In our work on this problem [5–7. 9]. we propose a model for capturing the dependencies between different cover sets. examine localized heuristics based on this dependency model and present various improvements on the basic model. These heuristics represent a 20-30% increase in the network lifetime over the existing work [2. 3] which uses greedy criteria to make scheduling decisions.

The functional capability of the cerebellum hinges on whether individual granule cells receive mossy fiber inputs from multiple precerebellar nuclei or are instead unimodal; this distinction is unresolved. Using cell-type-specific projection mapping with synaptic resolution. we observed the convergence of separate sensory (upper body proprioceptive) and basilar pontine pathways onto individual granule cells and mapped this convergence across cerebellar cortex. These findings inform the long-standing debate about the multimodality of mammalian granule cells and substantiate their associative capacity predicted in the Marr-Albus theory of cerebellar function. We also provide evidence that the convergent basilar pontine pathways carry corollary discharges from upper body motor cortical areas. Such merging of related corollary and sensory streams is a critical component of circuit models of predictive motor control.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00400.001,True,FFAa6W8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,170,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00400,8798285626306196456,/scholar?cites=8798285626306196456,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00400.pdf,0,0,0

Accordingly. the myelin observed in neocortical gray matter is thought to mostly ensheath excitatory axons connecting to subcortical regions and distant cortical areas. Using independent analyses of light and electron microscopy data from mouse neocortex. we show that a surprisingly large fraction of cortical myelin (half the myelin in layer 2/3 and a quarter in layer 4) ensheathes axons of inhibitory neurons. specifically of parvalbumin-positive basket cells. This myelin differs significantly from that of excitatory axons in distribution and protein composition. Myelin on inhibitory axons is unlikely to meaningfully hasten the arrival of spikes at their pre-synaptic terminals. due to the patchy distribution and short path-lengths observed.

1159476,A suppression hierarchy among competing motor programs drives sequential grooming in Drosophila,2014,Andrew M Seeds and Primoz Ravbar and Phuong Chung and Stefanie Hampel and Frank M Midgley Jr and Brett D Mensh and Julie H Simpson,3,Elife,,e02951,eLife Sciences Publications Limited,Motor sequences are formed through the serial execution of different movements. but how nervous systems implement this process remains largely unknown. We determined the organizational principles governing how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets. we drove distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This enabled competition experiments revealing that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy; motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program. which relieves suppression of the next movement. allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel. but selected serially through hierarchical suppression. was successful in reproducing the grooming sequence. This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02951.001,True,FFAa6W8AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,118,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02951,17477431496165567539,/scholar?cites=17477431496165567539,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02951.pdf,0,0,0
1159477,Mindboggle: automated brain labeling with multiple atlases,2005,Arno Klein and Brett Mensh and Satrajit Ghosh and Jason Tourville and Joy Hirsch,5,BMC medical imaging,1,1-14,BioMed Central,To make inferences about brain structures or activity across multiple individuals. one first needs to determine the structural correspondences across their image data. We have recently developed Mindboggle as a fully automated. feature-matching approach to assign anatomical labels to cortical structures and activity in human brain MRI data. Label assignment is based on structural correspondences between labeled atlases and unlabeled image data. where an atlas consists of a set of labels manually assigned to a single brain image. In the present work. we study the influence of using variable numbers of individual atlases to nonlinearly label human brain image data. Each brain image voxel of each of 20 human subjects is assigned a label by each of the remaining 19 atlases using Mindboggle. The most common label is selected and is given a confidence rating based on the number of atlases that assigned that label. The automatically assigned labels for each subject brain are compared with the manual labels for that subject (its atlas). Unlike recent approaches that transform subject data to a labeled. probabilistic atlas space (constructed from a database of atlases). Mindboggle labels a subject by each atlas in a database independently. When Mindboggle labels a human subject's brain image with at least four atlases. the resulting label agreement with coregistered manual labels is significantly higher than when only a single atlas is used. Different numbers of atlases provide significantly higher label agreements for individual brain regions. Increasing the number of reference brains used to automatically label a human subject brain improves …,True,FFAa6W8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,114,https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2342-5-7,6768776169165176213,/scholar?cites=6768776169165176213,,https://bmcmedimaging.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2342-5-7,0,0,0

Several channel types can mediate dendritically initiated spikes (dSpikes). which may impact information processing and storage across multiple timescales; however. the roles of different channels in the rapid vs long-term effects of dSpikes are unknown. We show here that dSpikes mediated by Nav channels (blocked by a low concentration of TTX) are required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the distal apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Furthermore. imaging. simulations. and buffering experiments all support a model whereby fast Nav channel-mediated dSpikes (Na-dSpikes) contribute to LTP induction by promoting large. transient. localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores of NMDAR and L-type Cav channels.

Many models of persistent activity rely on some kind of positive feedback internal to the neural circuit concerned; however. too much feedback causes runaway firing (instability). and too little results in loss of persistence (leak). This parameter sensitivity leads to the hypothesis that the brain uses an error signal (external feedback) to tune the stability of persistent firing by adjusting the amount of internal feedback.

Experimental tests of model predictions,2001,Christopher A Del Negro and Sheree M Johnson and Robert J Butera and Jeffrey C Smith,86,Journal of neurophysiology,1,59-74,American Physiological Society,We used the testable predictions of mathematical models proposed by Butera et al. to evaluate cellular. synaptic. and population-level components of the hypothesis that respiratory rhythm in mammals is generated in vitro in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) by a heterogeneous population of pacemaker neurons coupled by fast excitatory synapses. We prepared thin brain stem slices from neonatal rats that capture the pre-BötC and maintain inspiratory-related motor activity in vitro. We recorded pacemaker neurons extracellularly and found: intrinsic bursting behavior that did not depend on Ca2+ currents and persisted after blocking synaptic transmission; multistate behavior with transitions from quiescence to bursting and tonic spiking states as cellular excitability was increased via extracellular K+concentration ([K+]o); a monotonic increase in burst frequency and decrease in burst duration with increasing …,True,_DT8jHD7dGYJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,154,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.2001.86.1.59,1707149583728614038,/scholar?cites=1707149583728614038,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/jn.2001.86.1.59,0,0,0

However. application of adaptive methods to neurophysiology has been limited by severe computational challenges. Since most neurons are high-dimensional systems. optimizing neurophysiology experiments requires computing high-dimensional integrations and optimizations in real time. Here we present a fast algorithm for choosing the most informative stimulus by maximizing the mutual information between the data and the unknown parameters of a generalized linear model (GLM) that we want to fit to the neuron's activity.

This circuit produced patterns that correspond to several quadrupedal gaits. including the walk. the bound. and the gallop. An analysis using the phase response curve (PRC) of an uncoupled oscillator accurately predicted  all modes exhibited by this circuit and their phasic relationships – with the caveat that in certain parameter ranges. bistability in the individual oscillators added nongait patterns that were not amenable to PRC analysis. but further enriched the pattern-generating repertoire of the circuit.

Thus. the respiratory network oscillator follows a well defined sequence of behavioral states characterized by dynamical systems theory. which includes discrete stages of periodic and quasiperiodic amplitude modulation and progresses (according to theory) to aperiodic chaos-like behavior.

(1997) used phase response curves (PRCs) of individual oscillators to characterize the possible modes of phase-locked entrainment of an N-oscillator ring network. We extend this work by developing a mathematical criterion to determine the local stability of such a mode based on the PRCs. Our method does not assume symmetry; neither the oscillators nor their connections need be identical. To use these techniques for predicting modes and determining their stability. one need only determine the PRC of each oscillator in the ring either experimentally or from a computational model. We show that network stability cannot be determined by simply testing the ability of each oscillator to entrain the next. Stability depends on the number of neurons in the ring. the type of mode. and the slope of each PRC at the point of entrainment of the respective neuron.

Although the existence of neurons with pacemaker-like bursting properties in this network is not questioned. their role in network rhythmogenesis is unresolved.

The model was sufficient to simulate a wide range of endogenous activity in the presence of various concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) or dopamine (DA). The model was also sufficient to simulate the responses of the neuron to extrinsic current pulses and the ways in which those responses were altered by 5-HT or DA. The results suggest that the actions of modulatory agents and second messengers on this neuron. and presumably other neurons. cannot be understood on the basis of their direct effects alone.

Though simulations based on the Hodgkin-Huxley unmyelinated nerve cable model have been used to understand the phenomena. the isolated response of an unmyelinated nerve to HFAC waveforms has not been experimentally investigated. To understand the effect of HFAC waveforms in homogenous nerves. experiments were conducted on purely unmyelinated nerves of the sea-slug Aplysia californica. Sinusoidal waveforms in the range of 5-50 kHz were used to block the propagation of action potentials through the nerves.

Highlights of this year’s report include:  ~Wind power capacity additions continued at a robust pace in 2018: $11 billion was invested in new wind power plants in 2018. In 2018. wind energy contributed 6.5% of the nation’s electricity supply. more than 10% of total electricity generation in fourteen states. and more than 30% in three of those states—Kansas. Iowa. and Oklahoma. 232 gigawatts of wind are seeking transmission interconnection. 2% of which represents proposed wind plants paired with storage.  ~Bigger turbines are enhancing wind project performance: Increased blade lengths have dramatically increased wind project capacity factors. one measure of project performance. and taller towers are on the horizon. The average 2018 capacity factor among projects built from 2014 through 2017 was 42%. compared to an average of 31% among projects built from 2004 to 2011 and 24% among projects built from 1998 to 2001. Low wind turbine pricing continues to push down installed project costs: Wind turbine prices have fallen to $700–$900/kW. The average installed cost of wind projects in 2018 was $1.470/kW. down 40 percent since the peak in 2009 and 2010.  ~Wind energy prices are at historical lows: After topping out at 7¢/kWh for power purchase agreements (PPAs) executed in 2009. the national average price of wind PPAs has dropped to below 2¢/kWh—though this nationwide average is dominated by projects that hail from the lowest-priced Interior region of the country.

This paper examines the value of the bill savings that customers receive under net metering. and the associated role of retail rate design. based on a sample of approximately two hundred residential customers of California's two largest electric utilities. We find that the bill savings per kWh of PV electricity generated varies by more than a factor of four across the customers in the sample. which is largely attributable to the inclining block structure of the utilities' residential retail rates. We also compare the bill savings under net metering to that received under three potential alternative compensation mechanisms. based on California's Market Price Referent (MPR).

Among those supportive policies is net metering. which in most states effectively allows customers to receive compensation for distributed PV generation at the full retail electricity price. The current design of retail electricity rates and the presence of net metering have elicited concerns that the possible under-recovery of fixed utility costs from PV system owners may lead to a feedback loop of increasing retail prices that accelerate PV adoption and further rate increases. However. a separate and opposing feedback loop could offset this effect: increased PV deployment may lead to a shift in the timing of peak-period electricity prices that could reduce the bill savings received under net metering where time …,True,IjhzoLoAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,130,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261915013562,2225810858818542895,/scholar?cites=2225810858818542895,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt93g9w5hn/qt93g9w5hn.pdf,0,0,0

Using detailed characteristics of 42.611 small-scale (<15 kW) PV systems installed in 15 U.S. states during 2013. we identify the most important factors that make a system likely to be low-priced (LP). Comparing LP and non-LP systems. we find statistically significant differences in nearly all characteristics for which we have data. Logit and probit model results robustly indicate that LP systems are associated with: markets with few active installers; experienced installers; customer ownership; large systems; retrofits; and thin-film. low-efficiency. and Chinese modules. We also find significant differences across states. with LP systems much more likely to occur in some states. such as Arizona.

Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,Customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) systems in the United States are often compensated at the customer’s underlying retail electricity rate through net metering. Calculations of the customer economics of PV. meanwhile. often assume that retail rate structures and PV compensation mechanisms will not change and that retail electricity prices will increase (or remain constant) over time. thereby also increasing (or keeping constant) the value of bill savings from PV. Given the multitude of potential changes to retail rates and PV compensation mechanisms in the future. however. understanding how such changes might impact the value of bill savings from PV is critical for policymakers. regulators. utilities. the solar industry. and potential PV owners. ie. any stakeholder interested in understanding uncertainties in and potential changes to the long-term customer economics of PV. This scoping study investigates the impact of. and interactions among. three key sources of uncertainty in the future value of bill savings from customer-sited PV. focusing in particular on residential customers. These three sources of uncertainty are: changes to electricity market conditions that would affect retail electricity prices. changes to the types of retail rate structures available to residential customers with PV. and shifts away from standard net-metering toward other compensation mechanisms more»,True,IjhzoLoAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,34,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1168592,2063428591981178591,/scholar?cites=2063428591981178591,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1168592/,0,0,0

Our approach consists of three elements:(i) ab initio calculations of DNA.(ii) Green's function approach for transport calculations. and (iii) the use of two parameters to determine the decoherence rates. We first study the role of the backbone. We find that the backbone can alter the coherent transmission significantly at some energy points by interacting with the bases. though the overall shape of the transmission stays similar for the two cases.

Gastropoda. Nudibranchia). has a simple and highly accessible nervous system. making it useful for studying neuronal and synaptic mechanisms underlying behavior. Although many important contributions have been made using Tritonia. until now. a lack of genetic information has impeded exploration at the molecular level.   Results We performed Illumina sequencing of central nervous system mRNAs from Tritonia. generating 133.1 million 100 base pair. paired-end reads. De novo reconstruction of the RNA-Seq data yielded a total of 185.546 contigs. which partitioned into 123.154 non-redundant gene clusters (unigenes). BLAST comparison with RefSeq and Swiss-Prot protein databases. as well as mRNA data from other invertebrates (gastropod molluscs: Aplysia californica. Lymnaea stagnalis and Biomphalaria glabrata; cnidarian: Nematostella vectensis) revealed that up to 76.292 unigenes in the Tritonia transcriptome have putative homologues in other databases. 18.246 of which are below a more stringent E-value cut-off of 1x10-6. In silico prediction of secreted proteins from the Tritonia transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) produced a database of 579 unique sequences of secreted proteins. which also exhibited markedly higher expression levels compared to other genes in the TSA.   Conclusions Our efforts greatly expand the availability of gene sequences available for Tritonia diomedea.

We model a channel noise by adding the Gaussian noise to inactivation of Na+ current. activation variable of potassium current and the h-current. The characteristics of the neural dynamics such as the burst duration. interburst interval and period were affected by noise. These effects are more pronounced for the noise added to the inactivation of Na+ current (hNa). For hNa variable. there is a critical noise amplitude at which the average interburst interval reaches its minimum. This minimum is well pronounced. eg. if for a neuron without noise the interburst interval is 100 s. then the minimum interburst interval. at the critical noise value. is around 20 s.

We then create a character matrix of habitat type and morphological characters. which we use to infer ancestral character states and test for correlation between habitat and morphology. Our study utilizes a taxonomically well-sampled phylogeny to show convergent evolution in all six morphological characters we analyzed. Three of these characters also correlate with habitat.

The ecological success of Cnidaria is predicated on several fascinating organismal innovations including stinging cells. symbiosis. colonial body plans and elaborate life histories. However. understanding the origins and subsequent diversification of these traits remains difficult due to persistent uncertainty surrounding the evolutionary relationships within Cnidaria. While recent phylogenomic studies have advanced our knowledge of the cnidarian tree of life. no analysis to date has included genome-scale data for each major cnidarian lineage.

Here. we show strong statistical support for convergent evolutionary origins and massively parallel evolution of the entire transcriptomes in symbiotic bioluminescent organs (bacterial photophores) from two divergent squid species. The gene expression similarities are so strong that regression models of one species’ photophore can predict organ identity of a distantly related photophore from gene expression levels alone.

Understanding the origins of opsin diversity can offer clues to how separate lineages of animals have repurposed different opsin paralogs for different light-detecting functions.

Yet a challenge for biologists is that it can be difficult to assign identities to gene sequences. especially from non-model organisms. Phylogenetic analyses are one useful method for assigning identities to these sequences. but such methods tend to be time-consuming because of the need to re-calculate trees for every gene of interest and each time a new data set is analyzed. In response. we employed existing tools for phylogenetic analysis to produce a computationally efficient. tree-based approach for annotating transcriptomes or new genomes that we term Phylogenetically-Informed Annotation (PIA). which places uncharacterized genes into pre-calculated phylogenies of gene families. We generated maximum likelihood trees for 109 genes from a Light Interaction Toolkit (LIT). a collection of genes that underlie the function or development of light-interacting structures in metazoans. To do so. we searched protein sequences predicted from 29 fully-sequenced genomes and built trees using tools for phylogenetic analysis in the Osiris package of Galaxy (an open-source workflow management system). Next. to rapidly annotate transcriptomes from organisms that lack sequenced genomes. we repurposed a maximum likelihood-based Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (implemented in RAxML) to place sequences of potential LIT genes on to our pre-calculated gene trees.

These cells historically have been difficult to locate and positively identify. but modern molecular techniques. integrated with existing behavioral. morphological. and physiological data. will make cell identification easier and allow us to address questions of mechanism and evolution. With this in mind. we propose a new classification scheme for all photoreceptor cell types based on two axes. cell distribution (aggregated vs. dispersed) and position within neural networks (first order vs. high order). All photoreceptor cells fall within one of four quadrants created by these axes: aggregated/high order. dispersed/high order. aggregated/first order. or dispersed/first order. This new method of organization will help researchers make objective comparisons between different photoreceptor cell types. Using integrative data from four major phyla (Mollusca. Cnidaria. Echinodermata. and Arthropoda). we also provide evidence for three hypotheses for dispersed photoreceptor cell function and evolution. First. aside from echinoderms. we find that animals often use dispersed photoreceptor cells for tasks that do not require spatial vision. Second. although there are both echinoderm and arthropod exceptions. we find that dispersed photoreceptor cells generally lack morphological specializations that either enhance light gathering or aid in the collection of directional information about light.

Here. we examine the history of genes and genetic networks in the context of eye evolution by using new approaches to understand patterns of gene duplication during the evolution of metazoan genomes. We hypothesize that 1) genes involved in eye development and phototransduction have duplicated and are retained at higher rates in animal clades that possess more distinct types of optical design; and 2) genes with functional relationships were duplicated and lost together. thereby preserving genetic networks. To test these hypotheses. we examine the rates and patterns of gene duplication and loss evident in 19 metazoan genomes. including that of Daphnia pulex - the first completely sequenced crustacean genome. This is of particular interest because the pancrustaceans (hexapods+crustaceans) have more optical designs than any other major clade of animals. allowing us to test specifically whether the high amount of disparity in pancrustacean eyes is correlated with a higher rate of duplication and retention of vision genes. Using protein predictions from 19 metazoan whole-genome projects. we found all members of 23 gene families known to be involved in eye development or phototransduction and deduced their phylogenetic relationships. This allowed us to estimate the number and timing of gene duplication and loss events in these gene families during animal evolution.

Understanding the phylogeny of this group improves interpretation of classical ecological work on competition. distributional changes associated with climate change. and the morphological evolution of complex cirripede phenotypes.  Methodology and Findings We use traditional and Bayesian phylogenetic and ‘deep coalescent’ approaches to identify a phylogeny that supports the monophyly of the mostly American ‘fissus group’ of Chthamalus. but that also supports a need for taxonomic revision of Chthamalus and Microeuraphia. Two deep phylogeographic breaks were also found within the range of two tropical American taxa (C. angustitergum and C. southwardorum) as well.  Conclusions Our data. which include two novel gene regions for phylogenetic analysis of cirripedes. suggest that much more evaluation of the morphological evolutionary history and taxonomy of Chthamalid barnacles is necessary.

To reveal mechanisms by which beneficial organisms adapt to circumvent host defenses. we experimentally evolved ecologically distinct bioluminescent Vibrio fischeri by colonization and growth within the light organs of the squid Euprymna scolopes. Serial squid passaging of bacteria produced eight distinct mutations in the binK sensor kinase gene. which conferred an exceptional selective advantage that could be demonstrated through both empirical and theoretical analysis. Squid-adaptive binK alleles promoted colonization and immune evasion that were mediated by cell-associated matrices including symbiotic polysaccharide (Syp) and cellulose. binK variation also altered quorum sensing. raising the threshold for luminescence induction. Preexisting coordinated regulation of symbiosis traits by BinK presented an efficient solution where altered BinK function was the key to unlock multiple colonization barriers.

We analyze phylogeographic data for intertidal barnacles (Chthamalus) to identify relevant temporal patterns that describe the origins of this biogeographic transition (the Mexican-Panamic Transition Zone). These contrasts of populations on either side of the transition zone include two pairs of closely related species (C. panamensis and C. hedgecocki; C. southwardorum and a Southern form of C. southwardorum). as well as gene flow data within one species (C. panamensis) that currently is found on both sides of the boundary between provinces.

Until recently. this narrative has focused primarily on the evolution of eye structure and far less on biochemistry or genetics. Although eye biochemistry was once likened to an unknown “black box;” the flood of discoveries in biochemistry is now allowing an increasingly detailed understanding of the processes involved in vision. As a result. evolutionary comparative (“tree-thinking”) analyses that use these data currently allow a new and still unfolding narrative. both richer in detail and more comprehensive in scope. Rather than toppling evolutionary theory by finding irreducibly complex molecular machines. eye evolution provides detailed accounts of how natural processes tinker with existing genetic components. duplicating and recombining them. to yield complex …,True,OzbMIr0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,12,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12052-008-0090-3.pdf,13823459313291079494,/scholar?cites=13823459313291079494,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12052-008-0090-3.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,Sponges are important ecological and functional components of coral reefs. Recently. a new hypothesis about the functional ecology of sponges in organic matter recycling pathways. the sponge‐loop hypothesis. in which dissolved and particulate organic matter is taken up by sponges and shunted to higher trophic levels as detritus. has been proposed and demonstrated for shallow (< 30 m) cryptic species. However. support for this hypothesis at mesophotic depths (∼ 30–150 m) is lacking. Here. we examined detritus production. a prerequisite of the sponge loop pathway. in a reciprocal transplant experiment. using Halisarca caerulea from water depths of 10 and 50 m. Detritus production was significantly lower in mesophotic sponges compared to shallow samples of H. caerulea.

1159582,Comprehensive phylogenomic analyses resolve cnidarian relationships and the origins of key organismal traits,2017,Ehsan Kayal and Bentlage Bastian and M Sabrina Pankey and Aki Ohdera and Monica Medina and David C Plachetzki and Allen Collins and Joseph F Ryan,,,e3172v1,,PeerJ Preprints,The phylogeny of Cnidaria has been a source of debate for decades. during which nearly all-possible relationships among the major lineages have been proposed. The ecological success of Cnidaria is predicated on several fascinating organismal innovations including symbiosis. colonial body plans and elaborate life histories. however. understanding the origins and subsequent diversification of these traits remains difficult due to persistent uncertainty surrounding the evolutionary relationships within Cnidaria. While recent phylogenomic studies have advanced our knowledge of the cnidarian tree of life. no analysis to date has included genome scale data for each major cnidarian lineage. Here we describe a well-supported hypothesis for cnidarian phylogeny based on phylogenomic analyses of new and existing genome scale data that includes representatives of all cnidarian classes. Our results are robust to alternative modes of phylogenetic estimation and phylogenomic dataset construction. We show that two popular phylogenomic matrix construction pipelines yield profoundly different datasets. both in the identities and the functional classes of the loci they include. but resolve the same topology. We then leverage our phylogenetic resolution of Cnidaria to understand the character histories of several critical organismal traits. Ancestral state reconstruction analyses based on our phylogeny establish several notable organismal transitions in the evolutionary history of Cnidaria and depict the ancestral cnidarian as a solitary. non-symbiotic polyp that lacked a medusa stage. In addition. Bayes factor tests of multiple origins strongly suggest that …,True,OzbMIr0AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,9,https://peerj.com/preprints/3172/,15868884627358276627,/scholar?cites=15868884627358276627,,https://peerj.com/preprints/3172.pdf,0,0,0

Although overdominant selection could represent an important mechanism for maintaining genetic variation within species. the prevalence of this mode of selection appears to be relatively low. Identification of cases of true single‐locus heterozygote advantage are thus useful reference points in our overall understanding of how various forms of balancing selection influence and maintain genetic variation in natural populations. Here we report the apparent long‐term maintenance of diversity via overdominant selection with homozygous lethality at an elongation factor locus in the sea star Pisaster ochraceus. Observing this pattern in a gene with such major effects on protein assembly indicates that overdominant selection could be a more prevalent factor in maintaining allelic …,True,OzbMIr0AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,8,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01623.x,13123560843633318243,/scholar?cites=13123560843633318243,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01623.x,0,0,0

In Neotropical forests. anthropogenic disturbance can disrupt the Janzen–Connell mechanism. but similar data are unavailable for South East Asia. We investigated the effects of conspecific density (two spatial scales) and distance from fruiting trees on seed and seedling survival of the canopy tree Parashorea malaanonan in unlogged and logged forests in Sabah. Malaysia. The production of mature seeds was higher in unlogged forest. perhaps because high adult densities facilitate pollination or satiate pre-dispersal predators.

The diversity of insects in tropical forests remains poorly known. in particular regarding the critical feeding associations of herbivores. which are thought to drive species richness in these ecosystems.2. Host records remain elusive and traditionally require labour‐intensive feeding trials. A recent approach analyses plant DNA ingested by herbivorous insects; direct PCR amplification from DNA extracts from weevils (Curculionoidea) using chloroplast (trnL intron) primers was successful in 41 of 115 cases. resulting in 40 different sequences.3. The resulting trnL intron sequences were identified against public databases to various hierarchical levels based on their position in phylogenetic trees and shown to be members of 26 plant families from different major groups of angiosperms.4.

For example. in entomology alone. there are more than 1100 specialised journals that might contain taxonomically relevant information. and many of these are extremely difficult to access. With advances in bioinformatics answering the need for the more rapid description and cataloguing of our disappearing biodiversity. the necessity for an authoritative name registry is ever greater. Zoological Record has been the resource that until now has come closest to answering that need by its annual publication of all those new animal names and taxonomic acts in zoology that come to its attention. The producers of Zoological Record are therefore the ideal collaborators with the Commission for the development and implementation of ZooBank. Zoological Record will act as the primary data collector with the Commission as the independent archiver of the database. The mechanism for doing this is described below.The Scope of ZooBank It must be emphasised that assessment or judgement of the taxonomic content of a piece of published work. ie any form of peer-review. is not part of the function of ZooBank. ZooBank will function as an archived index of zoological names and nomenclatural acts.

Thirty characters were analyzed. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance. and discriminant function analysis. al! de monstrated that each species is morphometrical!y distingllishable. The lenglhs of rostrum. scape. onychium. pronotum. and width and length of elytra have the maximum discriminatory power. Males and females are also morphometrically distinguishable. mainly due to differences in the widths of rostrllm between pterigia and at base of pronotllm. and width and length of elylra. The classification functions provided by discriminant gave the correct identificalion of every single specimen by sex and species. Mahalanobis' distances between species were calclllated and subjected lo UPGMA clllstering. to constrllct a dendrogram reflecting the morphometric relationships between species. This dendrogram did not correspond to the phylogenetic relationships depicted by a cladogram based on discrete characters (Sánchez-RlIiz & Alonso-Zarazaga. 1994).

A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects. They also assert that the lack of governance of taxonomy damages conservation efforts. harms the credibility of science. and is costly to society. Despite its fairly recent release. Garnett and Christidis’ proposition has already been rejected by a number of colleagues [2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8]. Herein. we contribute to the conversation between taxonomists and conservation biologists aiming to clarify some misunderstandings and issues in the proposition by Garnett and Christidis. Placing governance over the science of taxonomy blurs the distinction between taxonomy and nomenclature.

Endemism is measured at two nested scales: (1) those confined to the Wet Tropics. termed 'regional endemics'; and (2) the subset of those species confined to a single subregion of the Wet Tropics. termed 'subregional endemics'. Fifty per cent of the regional endemic flightless insects are also subregional endemics compared with 15% of the known regional endemic vertebrates. The four subregions with the most endemic flightless insect species are the uplands of Mt Finnigan. Carbine. Bellenden-Ker/Bartle Frere and Atherton. Multiple regression suggests that the combination of rainforest area and shape explain the most variance (R2 = 0.603) in the numbers of species of regional endemic insects.

Cretaceous environmental changes have significantly impacted the diversification dynamics of several groups of organisms. A major biome turnover that occurred during this period was the rise of angiosperms starting ca. 125 million years ago. Though there is evidence that the latter promoted the diversification of phytophagous insects. the response of other insect groups to Cretaceous environmental changes is still largely unknown. To gain novel insights on this issue. we assess the diversification dynamics of a hyperdiverse family of detritivorous beetles (Tenebrionidae) using molecular dating and diversification analyses. Age estimates reveal an origin after the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction (older than previously thought). followed by the diversification of major lineages during Pangaean and Gondwanan breakups.

1159666,ON SOME LIXINAE TYPES OF IC FABRICIUS,2006,LEVENT GÜLTEKIN,38,Fragmenta entomologica,1,111-133,,The subfamily Lixinae includes over 1200 species and comprises two tribes. Lixini and Cleonini (Alonso-Zarazaga & Lyal 1999; Colonnelli 2003). It is well represented in the Palaearctic with approximately 700 species (Capiomont 1874a. 1874b. 1874c; Petri 1905. 1907; Csiki 1934; Ter-Minassian 1967. 1988). Most of Palaearctic Lixinae are confined to the steppes and other open landscapes in the southern and southeastern parts of Europe. North Africa. eastern European countries. the Caucasus. western and central Asia. southern Siberia. and Mongolia. Many species are abundant. and some of them are of paramount importance as pests of agricultural crops. and biocontrol agents for weeds (Zwölfer et al. 1971). Taxonomic knowledge of Lixinae is still very incomplete due to their species richness particularly in the Palaearctic. and the wide intraspecific variability associated with the existence of several local forms. Therefore. a study of the types is of great importance since some confusion arose already about the earlier names. although most of subsequent authors neglected the study of types. The need to determine whether the use of the Fabrician names is correct resulted in this paper.The Fabricius collection was checked in order to find Lixinae types. and to fix their names. designating lectotypes when necessary. according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (1999). The known Lixinae types of the Fabricus collection are all (except some. see Zimsen 1964) preserved in the Zoologisk Museum. Copenhagen.

Long term intensive investigations documented vast biotic degradation of soil and vegetation (commonly referred to as desertification) by overgrazing. construction. recreation etc. Two main types of xeric landscape are under investigation: 1) natural highly specific deserts. semi-deserts. dry mountain slopes and screes; and 2) anthropogenic. newly emerged. floristically impoverished desertified areas. The presence of a multi-species insect assemblage on a xerophilous plant in certain area testifies its indigenous nature. whereas the absence of the specific consortium suggests recent plant invasion. The examples of the first case are the consortia of 3–6 species of Coleoptera. mainly Buprestidae. Chrysomelidae. and Curculionoidea. on some Apiaceae. Asteraceae. Brassicaceae. Chenopodiaceae. Ephedraceae (Ephedra spp.) and Polygonaceae (Calligonum polygonoides L.). Extreme examples of anthropogenic vegetation are overgrazed wormwood steppe and semidesert which lack usually diversified coleopterous consortia. including the most characteristic of this landscape. eg. tenebrionids. and orthopterans.

Focusing on species traits underlying invasiveness that are related to temperature provides insights into the mechanisms of insect invasions. The screening of thermal requirements thus could improve risk-assessment schemes by incorporating these traits in predictions of potentially invasive insect species. We compared 100 pairs of taxonomically-related species originating from the same continent. one invasive and the other not reported as invasive. Invasive species have higher lower developmental thresholds than those never recorded outside their native ranges. Invasive species also have a lower sum of effective temperatures. though not significantly. However. the differences between invasive and non-invasive species in the two physiological measures were significantly inversely correlated. This result suggests that many species are currently prevented from invading by low temperatures in some parts of the world. Those species that will overcome current climatic constraints in regions outside their native distribution due to climate change could become even more serious future invaders than present-day species. due to their potentially faster development.,True,TAzWjXIAAAAJ:oi2SiIJ9l4AC,30,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131072,7525027689327756691,/scholar?cites=7525027689327756691,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131072,0,0,0

While many studies considered plant defense traits at the within-species scale. much less is known from comparisons of a wide range of closely related species. The aim of this study was to identify factors responsible for the intensity of leaf damage in the Carduoideae subfamily of Asteraceae. which hosts many invasive species and thus is potential candidate plant species that could be controlled by biological control. Specifically. we wanted to see the relative importance of habitat characteristics. plant size and plants traits in determining the degree of folivory. The study identified several defense traits able to explain differences in herbivory between species after accounting for differences in the habitats in which the species occur and the plant size. Specifically. the most important traits were traits related to the quality of the leaf tissue expressed as the content of phosphorus. water and specific leaf area. which suggests that the leaf quality had a more important effect on the degree of herbivory than the presence of specific defense mechanisms such as spines and hair. Leaf quality is thus a candidate factor that drives herbivore choice when selecting which plant to feed on and should be considered when assessing the danger that a herbivore will switch hosts when introduced to a new range.,True,TAzWjXIAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064639,16540547877662161512,/scholar?cites=16540547877662161512,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064639,0,0,0

The study of the long-term variation in the composition of their communities was stimulated by recent dramatic changes in the abundance of some species. We review and evaluate possible effects of the main causes cited in the literature. Agricultural and habitat changes (particularly urbanization) affect coccinellid abundance. both negatively and positively. In the temperate zone dominant species occur most frequently associated with abundant prey populations on crops. weeds and planted stands of trees resulting from human activity. Invasive non-native species of coccinellids may endanger native species through intraguild predation or competition for resources. but their supposed serious negative effects on native species can differ considerably.

From our observations in Slovakia. we found active adults from April to September in dry sunny places within extensively used or fallow vineyards and in ruderal vegetation with host plants. The weevil is a root borer--larvae. pupae and fresh adults were collected from the root necks and roots of Common Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) and rarely from Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.).

The biology of the species was studied in Romania. Hungary and Slovakia. Common Stork’s-bill (Erodium cicutarium)(Geraniaceae) is identified as a host plant of both larvae and adults of this weevil. The weevil is very likely monophagous. and previous records of thyme (Thymus sp.. Lamiaceae) as the host plant hence appear incorrect. Coniocleonus nigrosuturatus prefers dry. sunny places in grassland habitats. with sparse vegetation. bare ground and patchily growing host plants. Overwintering beetles emerge in early spring (March). feed and mate on the host plants. The highest activity of adults was observed from mid-April to mid-May. Larvae live in the soil in a vertical tunnel near the host plant and feed externally on the base of the stem. Usually. a single larva was observed at an attacked plant. however. sometimes up to 3 larvae were found. At the beginning of July. the larvae pupate in a closed earthen cell. A reared adult emerged in the laboratory at the end of July. We suppose that part of the population overwinters in pupation cells. although some adults leave the cells at the end of summer.

Besides causing harm to crop. considerable value of weeds was recognized for preserving biodiversity in agroecosystems (M arshall et al.. 2003; S torkey. 2006; Franke et al.. 2009). Not only have many previously common species of weeds become rare and endangered as a result of intensive use of herbicides or other weed control tactics (A ndreasen et al.. 1996). Many weed species provide food source for various kinds of animals and in this way they form the basis of the trophic cascade in arable fields (Norris. K ogan. 2000; M arshall et al.. 2003; F ranke et al.. 2009). Among herbivorous or granivorous insects. a number of species are specialized on weeds (Wa rd. S palding. 1993; C ampobasso et al.. 1999; S aska. 2008b). so the weed presence ensures that these insect species may survive in intensively managed agricultural landscape. At the higher levels of the food chain. many predatory insect species feed on herbivorous species and their larvae (H on ě k. J aro š í k. 2000; B irkhofer et al.. 2008). It is also common that primarily carnivorous insects utilize plant material as a food source at some phase of their development (N orris. K ogan. 2000).

This gall formation can weaken and kill the plant. and as such. the study of insects that induce gall formation is very important to agriculture and forestry. While gall inducing insects are widely known outside the order of beetles. within beetles there are rather limited observations of this phenomenon. This book chapter summarizes records of gall forming species of beetles. These records are known only from the families of weevils. woodborers. and leaf beetles. For each of these groups of beetles. summaries of the species involved. their plant hosts. and their effects. along with all relevant literature are provided. This information will be useful to farmers. foresters. gardeners. and agricultural entomologists.Technical Abstract: A general discussion of gall formation in plants induced by development of Coleoptera (beetles) is presented. All the known taxa of beetles that induce gall formation are listed. Discussion mostly focusses on individual species (over 70). but also higher taxa where gall inducing biologies are widespread. Nearly all species are members of Phytophaga. including the superfamilies Curculionoidea (Curculionidae) and Chrysomeloidea (Cerambycidae. Chrysomelidae). but also are represented by Buprestoidea (Buprestidae).

Queens are behaviorally less varied than workers and show specialization. particularly in frequency of nudging (which is concentrated on the worker with largest ovaries) and of backing. Backing draws workers. especially those with slender ovaries. down to lower parts of the burrows where the stimuli for cell construction and provisioning probably operate.

A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects. They also assert that the lack of governance of taxonomy damages conservation efforts. harms the credibility of science. and is costly to society. Despite its fairly recent release. Garnett and Christidis’ proposition has already been rejected by a number of colleagues [2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8]. Herein. we contribute to the conversation between taxonomists and conservation biologists aiming to clarify some misunderstandings and issues in the proposition by Garnett and Christidis. Placing governance over the science of taxonomy blurs the distinction between taxonomy and nomenclature.

Relatively few mutillid species are involved despite the potential for prolific reproduction on social hosts. The problems faced by such parasitoids are greater than those encountered when using solitary hosts. Several species of mutillids parasitise social halictine bees. a few parasitise bumble bees and a few occasionally attack honey bees; a few are parasitoids of commensals or symbionts of ants.

For example. in entomology alone. there are more than 1100 specialised journals that might contain taxonomically relevant information. and many of these are extremely difficult to access. With advances in bioinformatics answering the need for the more rapid description and cataloguing of our disappearing biodiversity. the necessity for an authoritative name registry is ever greater. Zoological Record has been the resource that until now has come closest to answering that need by its annual publication of all those new animal names and taxonomic acts in zoology that come to its attention. The producers of Zoological Record are therefore the ideal collaborators with the Commission for the development and implementation of ZooBank. Zoological Record will act as the primary data collector with the Commission as the independent archiver of the database. The mechanism for doing this is described below.The Scope of ZooBank It must be emphasised that assessment or judgement of the taxonomic content of a piece of published work. ie any form of peer-review. is not part of the function of ZooBank.

Cladistic analyses of 101 genera and subgenera of Mutillidae (represented by females of 253 species and males of 260 species) and four outgroups (pepsine Pompilidae. anthoboscine Tiphiidae and both fedtschenkiine and sapygine Sapygidae) based on 230 morphological characters treated in various ways. produced most-parsimonious trees which were in broad agreement but differed in many details. Evaluation of these results led to the proposal of a compromise tree which reflected each proposed taxon as monophyletic. while trying to keep disruptions to the current classifications to a minimum. The result differs from both previous classifications. and proposes the recognition of eight subfamilies: Myrmosinae (with the tribes Kudakrumiini and Myrmosini). Pseudophotopsidinae.

Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects.

However. the practice of zoological nomenclature has changed relatively little since its start in 1758. As modern technology changes the paradigm under which modern scientists exchange information. there is increasing need to capitalize on these same technologies to fortify nomenclature. ZooBank has been proposed as the official registry of names and nomenclatural acts. in zoology. as well as associated published works and their authors. and type specimens. Having a coordinated registry of zoological names. integrated with the existing Code of Zoological Nomenclature. will allow increased efficiency of communication among biologists. and enhanced stability of names.

The Lemonpeel Angelfish (Centropyge flavissima) has Pacific and Indian Ocean forms separated by approximately 3.000 km and slight differences in coloration. These disjunct populations hybridize with Eibl’s Angelfish (Centropyge eibli) in the eastern Indian Ocean and the Pearl-Scaled Angelfish (Centropyge vrolikii) in the western Pacific.

Hawaii with observations on introduced exotic species,1997,Stephen Lee Coles and RC DeFelice and LG Eldredge and JT Carlton and RL Pyle and A Suzumoto,14,Hawaii Biological Survey (HBS),,,,Although Pearl Harbor was heavily utilized by Hawaiians for fishing. food gathering and fish cultivation in dozens of fishponds prior to twentieth century. it was relatively isolated from the open ocean before completion of the Pearl Harbor entrance channel in 1911. This marked the beginning of access to the harbor of ocean going vessels with a draft of greater than 5 m and greatly increased the opportunity for species introductions. Other dramatic environmental changes such as the increased runoff of sediment-laden water from the Pearl Harbor watershed that began in the middle of the nineteenth century. filling of fishponds and conversion of shorelines to accommodate docking of US Navy ships and disposal of wastes into the harbor greatly altered the conditions in which organisms lived. The habitat of Pearl Harbor has therefore been an environment of shifting characteristics since at least the beginning of European contact at the end of the eighteenth century.This study collected or observed a total of 434 species or higher taxa (36 algae. 1 spermatophyte. 338 invertebrate and 59 fish) from the 15 stations sampled. the highest number of taxa that have been collected for any Pearl Harbor study. Ninety six species. or about 22%. are considered to be introduced or cryptogenic. The areas of highest species richness were in the entrance channel and in Rainbow Bay at the northeast head of East Loch where number of taxa were around 150.

Suva: Institute of Pacific Studies, Honiara: Forum Fisheries Agency, and Canada: International Centre for Ocean Development",,135-176,,Over the past two decades there has been a tremendous increase in the popularity of marine fishes for aquaria. due in part to a greater understanding of their captive requirements. In the freshwater aquarium fish industry. many species are regularly bred in captivity. and a significant number of fishes in trade are supplied by such captive breeding efforts. Attempts at commercial-scale captive reproduction of marine fish species have met with only limited success. A few types of fisheswhich lay demersal eggs. such as anemonefishes (Amphiprion). have been successfully reared in fairly large numbers. and the technology and methodology have improved substantially in recent years. Several authors (Madden. 1978; Wood. 1985; Whitehead et al.. 1986; Perino. 1990; Iversen. 1991; Moe. 1992) suggest that the potential for captive-bred fishes to supple-ment wild-caught animals does exist. and they emphasise a need for continued research efforts in this field. However. captive breeding efforts on a commercial scale are presently very limited. and collecting fishes from coral reefs will undoubtedly remain the most economical method of procuring the majority of marine aquarium fish species for many years to come. Relatively few studies have investigated the volume and scope of the industry on a world-wide basis. Axelrod (1971) and Conroy (1975) reviewed the industry. particularly with respect to the collection and exportation of tropical freshwater species. The total retail value of ornamental fishes (both freshwater and marine). including all equipment and accessories relating to the care of fishes. was estimated at about US $4 billion.

The inshore fish fauna of Midway is impoverished by comparison with the 457 species of reef and shore fishes known from the main Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii to Niihau). The fewer fish species reported from Midway must be due partially to less collecting effort.

For example. in entomology alone. there are more than 1100 specialised journals that might contain taxonomically relevant information. and many of these are extremely difficult to access. With advances in bioinformatics answering the need for the more rapid description and cataloguing of our disappearing biodiversity. the necessity for an authoritative name registry is ever greater. Zoological Record has been the resource that until now has come closest to answering that need by its annual publication of all those new animal names and taxonomic acts in zoology that come to its attention. The producers of Zoological Record are therefore the ideal collaborators with the Commission for the development and implementation of ZooBank. Zoological Record will act as the primary data collector with the Commission as the independent archiver of the database. The mechanism for doing this is described below.The Scope of ZooBank It must be emphasised that assessment or judgement of the taxonomic content of a piece of published work. ie any form of peer-review. is not part of the function of ZooBank.

The information contained in this publication provides an exhaustive summary of the taxonomic literature. bringing up to date the nomenclature and classification of this large family. and presenting known geographic range for each of the 3000+ species in the family. This publication will be extremely valuable to other scientists as well as regulatory personnel charged with keeping pest insects out of the US because it is a compendium of basic data on the entire family.Technical Abstract: The world fauna of Stratiomyidae is cataloged. which includes approximately 400 valid genera and 3000 species. A phylogenetic analysis is presented which is then formalized in a classification of the family that is used to arrange the catalog. Full synonymy and geographic distribution data is presented for each species. New synonymies and new combinations are documented. and all literature has been rechecked and accurately dated.

As an often neglected but important group of pollinators. they play a significant role in agrobiodiversity and the biodiversity of plants everywhere. Flies are present in almost all habitats and biomes and for many medicinal. food and ornamental plants. pollinating flies guarantee or enhance seed and fruit production. They are important in the natural landscape. in agriculture and in greenhouses. and have recently come into use in the production of seeds for seed banks. The São Paulo Pollinator Initiative. the CBD. and Pollinator secretariats were important starting points in the international recognition of pollinator importance.

On a number of recognition tasks. the patients were found to have high levels of false positives. They also made a large number of guess responses but otherwise appeared metacognitively intact. Informal reports suggested that the episodes of déjà vecu were characterised by sensations similar to those present when the past is recollectively experienced in normal remembering.

Históricamente. más que los insectos en sí. fueron sus cecidias las que atrajeron la atención de los observadores y estudiosos. El primero en establecer la relación causa-efecto entre un cinípido y su agalla fue Marcello Malpighi en 1679. en su obra Anatomia Plantarum. cuyo segundo tomo está dedicado a las agallas de las plantas (Folliot. 1964). Después de él fueron numerosos los investigadores que comenzaron a realizar el inventario. descripción y clasificación de las agallas y de sus cinípidos inductores; se pueden destacar. entre otros. los nombres de Linnaeus (1767).

In addition to true gall formers. gall wasps also include phytophagous inquilines. which live inside the galls induced by gall wasps or other insects. Here we present the first comprehensive molecular and total-evidence analyses of higher-level gall wasp relationships. We studied more than 100 taxa representing a rich selection of outgroups and the majority of described cynipid genera outside the diverse oak gall wasps (Cynipini). which were more sparsely sampled. About 5 kb of nucleotide data from one mitochondrial (COI) and four nuclear (28S. LWRh. EF1alpha F1. and EF1alpha F2) markers were analyzed separately and in combination with morphological and life-history data. According to previous morphology-based studies. gall wasps evolved in the Northern Hemisphere and were initially herb gallers. Inquilines originated once from gall inducers that lost the ability to initiate galls. Our results. albeit not conclusive. suggest a different scenario. The first gall wasps were more likely associated with woody host plants. and there must have been multiple origins of gall inducers. inquilines or both. One possibility is that gall inducers arose independently from inquilines in several lineages. Except for these surprising results. our analyses are largely consistent with previous studies. They confirm that gall wasps are conservative in their host-plant preferences. and that herb-galling lineages have radiated repeatedly onto the same set of unrelated host plants.

We use modern information technology to overcome this problem in a comprehensive analysis of higher relationships among oak gall wasps and their closest relatives. Our morphological characters are documented by more than 2.000 images deposited in the open web image database Morphbank (http://www. morphbank. net). allowing one-click access from character and character state descriptions to the raw data. The oak gall wasps (Cynipidae: Cynipini) form one of the largest specialized radiations of galling insects with almost 1.000 described species attacking oaks or oak relatives. According to previous morphological studies. the Cynipini form a monophyletic clade. the Woody Rosid Gallers (WRG). together with three small cynipid tribes (Diplolepidini. Eschatocerini. and Pediaspidini). The WRG all attack woody representatives of the rosid clade of eudicots. Little was previously known about higher WRG relationships. We studied 54 exemplar taxa of WRG. including representatives from 34 of the 41 valid genera of oak gall wasps. and two outgroups. The study resulted in 308 characters. 283 from morphology and 25 from biology and distribution; most of these are original to the present paper.

Twenty‐five of the species belong to the Cynipidae and are gall inducers or phytophagous inquilines (guests) in galls. while five represent different insect‐parasitic lineages of the Cynipoidea. Although we find only limited variation in body shape. the head sclerites and mandibles offer many characters of potential phylogenetic value. For instance. the mandibles of the parasitoids have one large pointed tooth. with several smaller dents along the inner margin in core figitids. whereas the phytophagous gall inducers and inquilines have mandibles with two or three blunt teeth of subequal size. The mandibles of inquiline larvae are unique in being covered by vertical striations and in having a dominating. broad second tooth.

In particular. tracking natural enemy recruitment to invading hosts can reveal the relative roles of co-evolution (including local adaptation) and ecological sorting. We use molecular data to examine colonisation of northern Europe by the parasitoid Megastigmus stigmatizans following invasions of its herbivorous oak gallwasp hosts from the Balkans. Local host adaptation predicts that invading gallwasp populations will have been tracked primarily by sympatric Balkan populations of M. stigmatizans (Host Pursuit Hypothesis). Alternatively. ecological sorting allows parasitoid recruitment from geographically distinct populations with no recent experience of the invading hosts (Host Shift Hypothesis). Finally. we test for long-term persistence of parasitoids introduced via human trade of their hosts' galls (Introduction Hypothesis). Polymorphism diagnostic of different southern refugial regions was present in both mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite markers. allowing us to identify the origins of northern European invaded range M. stigmatizans populations. As with their hosts. some invaded range populations showed genetic variation diagnostic of Balkan sources. supporting the Host Pursuit Hypothesis. In contrast. other invading populations had an Iberian origin. unlike their hosts in northern Europe. supporting the Host Shift Hypothesis. Finally. both British and Italian M. stigmatizans populations show signatures compatible with the Introduction Hypothesis from eastern Mediterranean sources.

Cynipidae) associated with southern beeches (Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae)) from South America is revised. The genus Paraulax and its type species. P. perplexa. are redescribed and a neotype is designated. Two additional species of Paraulax are described as new: P. queulensis and P. ronquisti. After having been first tentatively placed in the Cynipini and later transferred to the Pediaspidini. this genus is here placed in the newly erected tribe Paraulacini. together with the herein described genus Cecinothofagus and the three species that are described as new: C. gallaecoihue. C. gallaelenga and C. ibarrai. The biology of the members of this new tribe is discussed. Contrary to a prior hypothesis that postulated Paraulax (sensu lato) to be true gall-inducers. as most cynipids. evidence here shows that the three species of the new genus Cecinothofagus are instead parasitoids or lethal inquilines inhabiting galls induced by species of Aditrochus (Pteromalidae) on Nothofagus. The biology of the Paraulax species is unknown but since they too are associated with Nothofagus forests their biology is likely associated with the pteromalid gall community. We describe host plant associations as well as the morphology and phenology of the host gall. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the Paraulacini and selected Cynipidae taxa. based on 28S and COI. is performed. Both markers indicate the Paraulacini to be monophyletic and support a sister group relationship with the Pediaspidini.

It is obviously time-saving because it avoids the burdens of taxonomy. However. evaluations of parataxonomic sorting by taxonomic resorting show many overestimations of species numbers. Hence. RTU sorting is not necessarily conservative. Sorting errors can be more than 100% (median in the present compilation: 22%). Even if the cumulative results for diverse groups like beetles have a very low overall error. the error rate in the single families is generally much higher.

A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects. They also assert that the lack of governance of taxonomy damages conservation efforts. harms the credibility of science. and is costly to society. Despite its fairly recent release.

Herein. we contribute to the conversation between taxonomists and conservation biologists aiming to clarify some misunderstandings and issues in the proposition by Garnett and Christidis.

We found clear patterns at the guild level determined by the habitat type and time of day: in the savanna parkland during the day. telecoprids (rollers) and their kleptoparasites are dominant. At night. paracoprids (tunnelers) and endocoprids (dwellers) dominate the dung beetle assemblages. In the river valley during the day and the gallery forest all day and night. the abundance of dung beetles is very low and does not reach a competitive level.

After a discussion of the different kinds of preservation of scarab fossils. including preservation of color. the richest scarab deposits are identified. From the fossil record. the minimum age of Scarabaeoidea is determined as 152 myr. To develop an idea about the appearance of the first scarab. the ground-pattern of Scarabaeoidea is reconstructed for the first time on the basis of published phylogenetic analyses. Extinct scarabaeoid family-group taxa are described and discussed. Cretocomini and Cretoglaphyrini are upgraded to subfamily rank for reasons of consistency.

Hence. authors are increasingly exercised if there is any sign that impact factors are being manipulated. Editors who ask authors to cite relevant papers from their own journal are accused of acting unethically. This is surprising because. besides publishers. authors are the primary beneficiaries of an increased impact factor of the journal in which they publish. and because the citation process is biased anyway. There is growing evidence that quality and relevance are not always the reasons for choosing references.

For example. in entomology alone. there are more than 1100 specialised journals that might contain taxonomically relevant information. and many of these are extremely difficult to access. With advances in bioinformatics answering the need for the more rapid description and cataloguing of our disappearing biodiversity. the necessity for an authoritative name registry is ever greater. Zoological Record has been the resource that until now has come closest to answering that need by its annual publication of all those new animal names and taxonomic acts in zoology that come to its attention. The producers of Zoological Record are therefore the ideal collaborators with the Commission for the development and implementation of ZooBank. Zoological Record will act as the primary data collector with the Commission as the independent archiver of the database. The mechanism for doing this is described below.The Scope of ZooBank It must be emphasised that assessment or judgement of the taxonomic content of a piece of published work. ie any form of peer-review. is not part of the function of ZooBank.

1159877,The magnitude of marine biodiversity,2006,Philippe Bouchet,,,,31-62,Fundación BBVA,TWENTY-F IV E YEA RS ago. scientists believed that the ca. 1.6 million species they had then inventoried represented maybe 50% of plant and animal species on this planet. New approaches in sampling insect diversity in rainforests and small macrobenthos in the deep sea have revised this estimate to 1.7-1.8 mil lion described species and 10-100 million species remaining to be discovered. In parallel with this changed paradigm. species inventorying has also evolved from being categorized as an outdated scientific activity to a timely cuttingedge megascience “enterprise”. The reason behind this change of attitude is probably rooted in our social anxiety over global climatic change and nonsustainable development. The crude translation of this anxiety into science strategy is that there is no time to lose if we want to document and name bio diversity before it is lost forever.The public’s attitude to species discovery is perhaps best encapsulated by how the media reacted to the recent description of Kiwa hirsuta (photo 2.2). This new galatheid crab was discovered in hydrothermal vents near Easter Island in May 2005. and described in the December 2005 issue of Zoosy sterna by Enrique Macpherson. William Jones and Michel Segonzac. as a new family. genus and species (Macpherson. Jones and Segonzac 2005).

Altogether 302 species and 11 subspecies are listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List. We reevaluated mollusk species listed as extinct through bibliographic research and consultation with experts. We found that the number of known mollusk extinctions is almost double that of the IUCN Red List. Marine habitats seem to have experienced few extinctions. which suggests that marine species may be less extinction prone than terrestrial and freshwater species.

They are typically portrayed and interpreted as variation in α diversity (the number of species recovered in individual samples) along depth transects. Here. we examine the depth ranges of deep‐sea gastropods and bivalves in the eastern and western North Atlantic. This approach shows that the abyssal molluscan fauna largely represents deeper range extensions for a subset of bathyal species. Most abyssal species have larval dispersal. and adults live at densities that appear to be too low for successful reproduction. These patterns suggest a new explanation for abyssal biodiversity. For many species. bathyal and abyssal populations may form a source‐sink system in which abyssal populations are regulated by a balance between chronic extinction arising from vulnerabilities to Allee …,True,67UfRaIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,224,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/427226,15885929991375950200,/scholar?cites=15885929991375950200,,http://craigmcclain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rex_AM-NAT_2005.pdf,0,0,0

This low figure is due to the fact that the status of very few invertebrates. which represent the bulk of biodiversity. have been evaluated. Here we show. based on extrapolation from a random sample of land snail species via two independent approaches. that we may already have lost 7% (130.000 extinctions) of the species on Earth. However. this loss is masked by the emphasis on terrestrial vertebrates. the target of most conservation actions. Projections of species extinction rates are controversial because invertebrates are essentially excluded from these scenarios.

The Gibraltar sill. 280 m deep. has historically been regarded as the physical barrier to the potential colonization of the Mediterranean from the richer Atlantic fauna. We suggest instead that the larval ecology of individual species is the single most important factor governing the composition of the deep Mediterranean benthos. A number of deep-water species have planktotrophic larvae that undergo vertical ontogenetic migrations to surface layers and are thus potential colonizers of the Mediterranean via the inflowing surface current across the Gibraltar sill.

However. the hyper-diverse families have essentially remained untouched. regional differences among island groups are high. and New Caledonia. which has been sampled best. shows several discrete areas of micro-endemism.

Much of the remaining forests are degraded. Threats to sclerophyll forests come from land clearance. grazing by cattle or deer. and fire. In sclerophyll forests. 223 endemic phanerogam species occur and 59 of these are specific to this forest type. Several of the 59 specific species are known only from a few plants at a single locality and are critically endangered. Pittosporum tanianum sp. nov. became extinct shortly after its discovery in 1988. and becomes the first documented plant extinction in New Caledonia.

The aim of this paper is to characterize regional–scale patterns of ‘tree turnover’ (the rate with which trees die and recruit into a population) by using improved datasets now available for Amazonia that span the past 25 years. Specifically. we assess whether concerted changes in turnover are occurring. and if so whether they are general throughout the Amazon or restricted to one region or environmental zone.

Physical properties were additionally examined and an index of soil physical quality developed. Bivariate relationships of soil and climatic properties with above-ground wood productivity. stand-level tree turnover rates. above-ground wood biomass and wood density were first examined with multivariate regression models then applied. Both forms of analysis were undertaken with and without considerations regarding the underlying spatial structure of the dataset. Despite the presence of autocorrelated spatial structures complicating many analyses. forest structure and dynamics were found to be strongly and quantitatively related to edaphic as well as climatic conditions. Basin-wide differences in stand-level turnover rates are mostly influenced by soil physical properties with variations in rates of coarse wood production mostly related to soil phosphorus status. Total soil P was a better predictor of wood production rates than any of the fractionated organic-or inorganic-P pools. This suggests that it is not only the immediately available P forms. but probably the entire soil phosphorus pool that is interacting with …,True,a-hYU0EAAAAJ:8xutWZnSdmoC,447,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/9/2203/2012/,15122120818225461829,/scholar?cites=15122120818225461829,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/9/2203/2012/,0,0,0

1159938,The tropical forest canopy: the heart of biotic diversity,1988,Terry L. Erwin,,,,123-129,Nattional Academy Press. Washington. DC,A few years ago in a short paper in the Coleopterists Bulletin. I hypothesized that instead of the current estimate of 1.5 million species on Earth. there were 30 million species of insects alone (Erwin. 1982). This hypothesis was based on collections of beetles from tropical forest canopy samples in Panama (Erwin and Scott. 1980). rather than on the catalog counts of taxonomic names used in all the earlier estimates. I used simple arithmetic based on actual numbers of beetle species in my samples. estimated numbers of tropical forest tree species given me by the leading botanists. and a conservative estimate of the host specificity of tropical forest canopy insects. Host specificity in this sense means that a species in some way is tied to the host tree species and cannot exist without it. This reestimation of the magnitude of life on Earth got a lot more coverage than I anticipated and began the usual controversy of right or wrong. Those engaged in the controversy. most of whom never read this obscure paper in the Coleopterists Bulletin. in a way actually missed the point of the paper. Consequently. I now want to take the opportunity to clarify the situation.Science. at least in natural history. proceeds from casual observations. usually in the field or on museum specimens. to the erecting of hypotheses and finally to the testing of those hypotheses.

The Hague,Evolution of carabid beetles seems not be a random process whereby natural selection has infinite limits. Selection agents are repetitious through time and they have worked on a basic. though diverse. genetic and phenetic groundplan. This process leads to convergence and parallelism throughout the family in structural features and geographic patterns. Taxa arise in equatorial latitudes and are driven through stages along pathways to extinction in three directions: toward the poles. up mountains. and into the forest canopy. Driving forces are many and varied. including development of more potent adversaries. climatic cycles. tectonic events. and microhabitat changes based on floral evolution. but evolutionary results are of a repetitious nature through time as evidenced by disparate groups of carabids following the same paths over and over. This is certainly not a totally new concept. but rather a new formulation or synthesis of many concepts. The realization that changes occur along ordered pathways and are repeated lineage after lineage in the history of major groups leads to the conclusion that evolution has boundaries in which it operates. and that perhaps there are some rules.,True,a-hYU0EAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,229,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/3381/TaxonPulse.pdf,10631287328752983321,/scholar?cites=10631287328752983321,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/3381/TaxonPulse.pdf,0,0,0

A rich fossil record has been uncovered on northern continents that spans the Cretaceous. when continental isolation reached its peak. In contrast. dinosaur remains on southern continents are scarce. The discovery of dinosaurian skeletons from Lower Cretaceous beds in the southern Sahara shows that several lineages of tetanuran theropods and broad-toothed sauropods had a cosmopolitan distribution across Pangaea before the onset of continental fragmentation. The distinct dinosaurian faunas of Africa. South America. and Asiamerica arose during the Cretaceous by differential survival of once widespread lineages on land masses that were becoming increasingly isolated from one another.,True,gvID-K4AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,188,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/266/5183/267.abstract,1304415785866314111,/scholar?cites=1304415785866314111,,http://www-personal.umich.edu/~wilsonja/JAW/Publications_files/Sereno%26al1994.pdf,0,0,0

Prior to the appearance of various forms specialized for feeding on plants. tetrapods could access the plentiful vegetal resources only indirectly through detritivory and consumption of invertebrates that fed on plants and/or plant detritus (Olson 1961. 1966). The oldest plant-eating tetrapods are known from the Late Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) of North America and Europe. However. herbivores did not form a major component of the known terrestrial tetrapod assemblages from the Early Permian. Only during the Late Permian. some 40 million years after their first appearance. did plant-eating tetrapods become abundant and much diversified in the fossil record. At that time. a'modern'pattern of trophic interactions was established. with a vast standing crop of herbivores sustaining a relatively small number of top carnivores.

Most prominent are the effects of exotic mammals and plants. whereas few invertebrate invasions are known to have major effects on native ecosystems. Exceptions are the well-known cases of Vespulawasps in Nothofagusforest ecosystems and Eriococcus scale insects in Leptospermum shrublands. This limited impact is surprising because over 2000 exotic invertebrates have become established in New Zealand. among them many pests of exotic crop plants. The low impact of exotic invertebrates that invaded forests and other native ecosystems in New Zealand is in contrast to the situation in other parts of the world where many invertebrates have become important pests. We provide an overview of known invasions by exotic invertebrates in New Zealand. and explore in more detail several examples of invasive species. including herbivores. predators. parasitoids. decomposers and other groups in forests. grasslands. and other terrestrial ecosystems. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the comparative scarcity of such invasions that affect New Zealand’s indigenous ecosystems. There is a common view that New Zealand’s native species and ecosystems are inherently resistant to exotic invertebrate invaders. and there is some evidence to support this view. As a result of the high level of endemism in New Zealand’s flora. many native plants are phylogenetically distant from the host plants of many plant-feeding invaders. This provides some protection.

Koch. 1871) as type species. Two other species are included in the genus: B. brounii (Urquhart. 1885) comb. nov.(here removed from synonymy with B. heroine) and B. collina (Keyserling. 1886) comb. nov.(= Araneus reversus Hogg. 1914. new synonymy). A phylogenetic analysis places Backobourkia within the ‘coxal hook clade’of the subfamily Araneinae Clerck. 1758 and close to Eriophora Simon. 1864; however. Backobourkia differs from other Australasian Araneinae by the proposed synapopomorphy of a long flange at the base of the median apophysis in males. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) supports the monophyly of Backobourkia in a limited dataset that includes exemplars of Australasian Araneidae and Eriophora ravilla (CL Koch. 1844)(type species of Eriophora Simon. 1864). Backobourkia brounii and B. heroine are sister taxa in this analysis. Backobourkia collina is unusual within the genus and amongst most Araneinae as it displays extreme sexual size dimorphism (SSD). with females on average more than four times the size of males. Comparison with the other two Backobourkia species (and other Araneinae) suggests male dwarfism rather than female gigantism for this SSD. Some morphological differences of B. collina males to its congeners are evident. possibly due to its reduced size. These include characters of putative phylogenetic signal at the genus level such as eye position. shape of male …,True,b3AErDAAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,31,https://www.senckenberg.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/68_1_framenau_79-111.pdf,13803155775768971815,/scholar?cites=13803155775768971815,,https://www.senckenberg.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/68_1_framenau_79-111.pdf,0,0,0

Destructive extractions yielded higher amounts of DNA than non-destructive methods. However. non-destructive methods yielded usable amounts of DNA while leaving delicate trichobothria intact.

1160009,Feathers to fur,2010,Eckehard G Brockerhoff and Barbara IP Barratt and Jacqueline R Beggs and Laura L Fagan and K Malcolm and Craig B Phillips and Cor J Vink,34,,1,158-174,,Biological invasions have significantly affected New Zealand’s native species and ecosystems. Most prominent are the effects of exotic mammals and plants. whereas few invertebrate invasions are known to have major effects on native ecosystems. Exceptions are the well-known cases of Vespulawasps in Nothofagusforest ecosystems and Eriococcus scale insects in Leptospermum shrublands. This limited impact is surprising because over 2000 exotic invertebrates have become established in New Zealand. among them many pests of exotic crop plants. The low impact of exotic invertebrates that invaded forests and other native ecosystems in New Zealand is in contrast to the situation in other parts of the world where many invertebrates have become important pests. We provide an overview of known invasions by exotic invertebrates in New Zealand. and explore in more detail several examples of invasive species. including herbivores. predators. parasitoids. decomposers and other groups in forests. grasslands. and other terrestrial ecosystems. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the comparative scarcity of such invasions that affect New Zealand’s indigenous ecosystems. There is a common view that New Zealand’s native species and ecosystems are inherently resistant to exotic invertebrate invaders. and there is some evidence to support this view. As a result of the high level of endemism in New Zealand’s flora. many native plants are phylogenetically distant from the host plants of many plant-feeding invaders. This provides some protection.

Dordrecht,Natural enemies such as predators and parasitoids fulfil an important ecological and economic function by helping to keep herbivore populations below the economic injury level. Thus. they contribute to sustainable integrated pest management (IPM) systems. It is well established that plant resistance factors that affect herbivores also interact with natural enemies and consequently with the biological control function they provide. Similarly. host plant resistance derived from genetic engineering will have an impact on biological control. There is evidence today that the currently available transgenic crops that express Cry proteins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have no direct effects on natural enemies due to their narrow spectrum of activity.

Many of these are pests that feed on the sown plant species. often causing plant death and deterioration in the productivity and persistence of the sward. While most research has focused on pest biology and control. studies of plant productivity show dramatic acute (short-medium term) and chronic (longterm) effects. For example. grass grub has been reported to cause 50% losses to ryegrass swards and Argentine stem weevil can cause a 20% loss of productivity. but the long term effects through loss of the sown species and changes in composition can be even more severe. Insect damage can be exacerbated by other biotic (eg weed invasion. grazing animals. plant pathogens) or abiotic factors (eg climate. soil fertility) to further reduce plant persistence. Some biotic and abiotic factors may interact with insect pests to have positive effects on pasture persistence. eg biocontrol agents that reduce pest density or addition of fertiliser to enable plants to recover from insect damage. For many pasture pests. knowledge of their ecology is based on research from over 20 years ago that. while still valid. needs to be updated to account for modern intensive pasture management practices. such as intensive grazing with a lack of reseeding. and new cultivars. To improve pasture persistence. integrated research programmes are needed that examine the relative importance of all factors contributing to plant survival and develop strategies to mitigate their effects.

Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA",,62-87,,Before revising the phylogenetic placement of Opiliones. the issue of Opiliones monophyly needs to be addressed. Since the early recognition of Opiliones. only the discovery of Ricinulei and Cyphophthalmi has challenged the monophyly of the group. Hansen and Sørensen (1904) defined the order and largely established the modern systematics of the group as we recognize it today. Before Hansen and Sørensen. Latreille (1796. 1806) established the family Phalangida for the genera Galeodes (Solifugae). Phalangium (Eupnoi). Trogulus (Dyspnoi). and Siro (Cyphophthalmi). Sundevall (1833) excluded the genus Siro from his order Opiliones and placed it together with his family Galeodides. in his order Solpugae. together with his families Phrynides (Phrynus and Thelyphonus). Scorpionides. and Obisides—an artificial clade containing members of the current orders Opiliones. Solifugae. Amblypygi. Uropygi. Scorpiones. and Pseudoscorpiones. Koch (1839) included all the harvestman families in his order Solpugae. which also comprised the family Galeodides. following Latreille. Later he excluded the family Sironidae from this order (Koch. 1850). Thorell (1876) recognized three main harvestman lineages (“sections”): Palpatores (including Cyphophthalmi). Laniatores. and the new group Ricinulei. Afterward he presented a new division of the order Opiliones into four suborders: Palpatores. Laniatores. Anepignathi (= Cyphophthalmi). and Ricinulei (Thorell. 1892).

1160034,4.4 Opiliones,2002,AB Kury and R Pinto-da-Rocha,,"Amazonian Arachnida and Myriapoda. Pensoft Publ., Moscow",,345-362,,Harvestmen or Opiliones constitute the third largest arachnid order. They are characterized by having the five first opisthosomatic somites fused with the prosoma forming a dorsal scute (Fig. 1). a pair of prosomatic scent glands which open at lateral margin of carapace. presence of penis and ovipositor and one pair of median eyes (lateral eyes absent). According to the hypothesis of phylogeny proposed by SHULTZ (1990). the order Opiliones is most closely related to the Scorpiones. Solifugae and Pseudoscorpiones. forming a monophyletic group called Dromopoda. SHULTZ’s is not the only hypothesis of arachnid relationships. Strong arguments have been given which suggest that scorpions and eurypterids (an order not taken into account by SHULTZ) are sister groups or. at least. that scorpions are basal in Arachnida (see DUNLOP & SELDEN 1997; DUNLOP 1998; DUNLOP & WEBSTER 1999). The order Opiliones was traditionally divided in three suborders: Palpatores. Laniatores and Cyphophthalmi. An alternative division was proposed by MARTENS (1980). where the Palpatores were a paraphyletic taxon. and the Trogulidae were the sister group to the remaining Palpatores plus the Cyphophthalmi. However. recent reanalyses of the problem (SHULTZ 1998; GIRIBET et al. 1999) proposed a move back to the original arrangement: Opiliones= Cyphophthalmi+ Phalangida; Phalangida= Palpatores+ Laniatores.,True,CjUbE-QAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,83,http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/mndi/Aracnologia/pdfliteratura/Amazonian%20Opiliones%202002.pdf,9125729636629789319,/scholar?cites=9125729636629789319,,http://www.museunacional.ufrj.br/mndi/Aracnologia/pdfliteratura/Amazonian%20Opiliones%202002.pdf,0,0,0
1160035,Review of terminology for the outline of dorsal scutum in Laniatores (Arachnida. Opiliones),2016,Adriano B Kury and Miguel Medrano,4097,Zootaxa,1,130-134,,In many Opiliones (notably the Laniatores) the five most anterior opisthosomal tergites are fused with the carapace forming the so called dorsal scutum (DS)(Latreille 1804; Simon 1879; Hadži 1942) with a highly variable shape arising from multiple factors. such as differential development of musculature (especially of coxa IV). internal organs and influence of appendages (Loman 1903; Winkler 1957). The different degrees of fusion of the tergites were first studied by Hadži (1942). who proposed a terminology for them. This terminology was adopted and enhanced by Kratochvíl (1958) and Martens (1978). A shield formed by the fusion of the carapace with abdominal tergites I to V is called scutum magnum (Hadži 1942). The shield formed by the fusion of carapace with abdominal tergites I to VII is called scutum complexum (Kratochvíl 1958) and occurs in the males of Heteropachylinae Kury. 1994 (Kury 1994) and Paralolidae Kratochvíl. 1958 (Kratochvíl 1958). Finally. the scutum completum (Hadži 1942) is formed by the complete fusion of the carapace and abdominal scutum. formed by tergites I to VIII. and occurs in the Sandokanidae (Martens 1978). In this paper we focus on the different forms of the scutum magnum. The plasticity of the DS outline has been ignored as a source of morphological characters by almost all authors. Ringuelet (1959) commented briefly on the differences of shapes of the DS in Gagrellinae. Triaenonychidae and Gonyleptidae. However. scutal shapes have only been abundantly illustrated for the Cryptogeobiidae by Kury (2014). who first used them as character states in a cladistic analysis.

Hence. secondary loss (secondary “absence”) of a complex feature is favoured over parallel gains of that feature as this preserves the stronger hypothesis of homology. We believe that such asymmetry in character state complexity is important information for understanding character evolution in general. However. we here point out an inappropriate link that is commonly made between this approach and the accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN) algorithm. In ACCTRAN. changes are assigned along branches of a phylogenetic tree as close to the root as possible. This has been taken to imply that ACCTRAN will minimize hypotheses of parallel origins of complex traits and thus that ACCTRAN is philosophically better justified than the alternatives. such as delayed transformation …,True,0zKibq8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,138,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00229.x,12162975459007504161,/scholar?cites=12162975459007504161,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00229.x,0,0,0

The presence of an RTA is synapomorphic for a large clade of spiders exclusive of Eresidae.

1160058,Repeated evolution of male sacrifice behavior in spiders correlated with genital mutilation,2007,Jeremy A Miller,61,Evolution,6,1301-1315,Blackwell Publishing Inc,According to sexual cannibalism theory. male complicity in terminal mating can be adaptive when the male's future reproductive value is low relative to the benefits of self sacrifice. Spiders and insects that exhibit male sacrifice behavior (either complicity in cannibalism or spontaneous death associated with copulation) often also have male genitalia that stereotypically become broken or disfigured the first time they are used for copulation. potentially lowering his future reproductive value. Theoretical work on monogamy has identified male bias in the effective sex ratio as a precursor to the evolution of monogamy (including male sacrifice) as an adaptive form of paternity protection.

Emphasis was placed on genera endemic to the Neotropics and species with dubious relationships to their nominal genera. especially species from the older literature. This work recognizes 50 genera in the Neotropics. of which 39 genera are strictly endemic to the Neotropics. three are represented outside the Neotropics by one species. and eight genera have significant representation both in and beyond the Neotropics. Three additional genera. Ceraticelus Simon. 1884.

China. Focal taxa included selected plants. vertebrates. and arthropods. The study area lies at the heart of one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots and is home to biomes ranging from subtropical forest to tundra. In this special issue. we report on the results of that survey for micro-orbweaving spiders. cryptic animals mostly less than 1 mm long that build delicate. geometric webs. All told. over 1.000 adult micro-orbweavers were collected and sorted to three dozen species. all new to science.

Eugene Odum advocated a synthetic approach if ecology were to rise above the level of explanation afforded by independent. individual studies [1]. Today. Odum's wish is being fulfilled. and important advances are being made by synthesising data derived from great numbers of studies. either by scaling up temporally or geographically [2]. However. to allow effective. creative. and reproducible integration of ecological and environmental results. the methods and data used need to be made freely accessible and combinable. Only then can integrated ecology become a field where the ideals of'open science'[3] fully come to fruition. Indeed. although great challenges remain [4. 5]. open access to ecological data. methods. and analysis is rapidly improving [6. 7]. Nonetheless. we here call attention to what we perceive as one important obstacle to open data in biodiversity studies. The'raw data'in biodiversity research consist not of tabulations of numbers of individuals of species sampled at a particular date and place. but of the properly-labelled specimens themselves; occurrence records associated with specimens are metadata. We feel it is insufficiently appreciated that each assignment of a specimen to a particular taxon (whether a formally described species or a pragmatic'morphospecies'[8]). is a researcher's interpretation. and therefore not a primary datum. Because the scholarship of biodiversity includes scrutinising earlier work. evaluating what was written before. and adding new information and insight. it should always be possible to return to those specimens.

1160078,Cyberdiversity: improving the informatic value of diverse tropical arthropod inventories,2014,Jeremy A Miller and Joshua H Miller and Dinh-Sac Pham and Kevin K Beentjes,9,PloS one,12,e115750,Public Library of Science,In an era of biodiversity crisis. arthropods have great potential to inform conservation assessment and test hypotheses about community assembly. This is because their relatively narrow geographic distributions and high diversity offer high-resolution data on landscape-scale patterns of biodiversity. However. a major impediment to the more widespread application of arthropod data to a range of scientific and policy questions is the poor state of modern arthropod taxonomy. especially in the tropics. Inventories of spiders and other megadiverse arthropods from tropical forests are dominated by undescribed species. Such studies typically organize their data using morphospecies codes. which make it difficult for data from independent inventories to be compared and combined. To combat this shortcoming. we offer cyberdiversity. an online community-based approach for reconciling results of independent inventory studies where current taxonomic knowledge is incomplete. Participating scientists can upload images and DNA barcode sequences to dedicated databases and submit occurrence data and links to a web site (www.digitalSpiders.org). Taxonomic determinations can be shared with a crowdsourcing comments feature. and researchers can discover specimens of interest available for loan and request aliquots of genomic DNA extract. To demonstrate the value of the cyberdiversity framework. we reconcile data from three rapid structured inventories of spiders conducted in Vietnam with an independent inventory (Doi Inthanon. Thailand) using online image libraries.

1160079,Evolution of the Insects,2005,David Grimaldi and Michael S Engel,,,,xv+755 pp.,Cambridge University Press,This book chronicles the complete evolutionary history of insects--their living diversity and relationships as well as 400 million years of fossils. Introductory sections cover the living species diversity of insects. methods of reconstructing evolutionary relationships. basic insect structure. and the diverse modes of insect fossilization and major fossil deposits. Major sections then explore the relationships and evolution of each order of hexapods. The volume also chronicles major episodes in the evolutionary history of insects from their modest beginnings in the Devonian and the origin of wings hundreds of millions of years before pterosaurs and birds to the impact of mass extinctions and the explosive radiation of angiosperms on insects. and how they evolved into the most complex societies in nature. Whereas other volumes focus on either living species or fossils. this is the first comprehensive synthesis of all aspects of insect evolution. Illustrated with 955 photo-and electron-micrographs. drawings. diagrams. and field photos. many in full color and virtually all of them original. this reference will appeal to anyone engaged with insect diversity--professional entomologists and students. insect and fossil collectors. and naturalists. David Grimaldi and Michael S. Engel have collectively published over 200 scientific articles and monographs on the relationships and fossil record of insects. including 10 articles in the journals Science.

This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation. recombination and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For adaptation to occur. these systems must possess “evolvability.” i.e.. the ability of random variations to sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto phenotypic variation. an issue known as the representation problem.

These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here. we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant. namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further. we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc.

These units can be considered as modular parts of the body which integrate functionally related characters into units of evolutionary transformation. These units may either emerge spontaneously by self-organization. or may be the product of natural selection. A selection scenario that could explain the origin of modular units needs to explain the differential suppression of pleiotropic effects between different modules and the augmentation of pleiotropic effects among the elements within the module.

Depending on the causes of phenotypic variation. one speaks either of genetic or environmental canalization. Genetic canalization describes insensitivity of a character to mutations. and the insensitivity to environmental factors is called environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is of interest because it influences the availability of heritable phenotypic variation to natural selection. and is thus potentially important in determining the pattern of phenotypic evolution. In this paper a number of population genetic models are considered of a quantitative character under stabilizing selection.

Recent computational work on a biophysical genotype–phenotype model based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility. the resulting space lacks a metric and is formalized by an unfamiliar structure. known as a pre-topology. Patterns of phenotypic evolution—such as punctuation. irreversibility. modularity—result naturally from the properties of this space.

A key marker gene of this decidualization process is the prolactin gene. Several transcriptional regulators have been identified that are essential for decidualization of ESCs. including the Hox genes HoxA-10 and HoxA-11. and the forkhead box gene FOXO1A. While previous studies have identified downstream target genes for HoxA-10 and FOXO1A. the role of HoxA-11 in decidualization has not been investigated. Here. we show that HoxA-11 is required for prolactin expression in decidualized ESC. While HoxA-11 alone is a repressor on the decidual prolactin promoter. it turns into an activator when combined with FOXO1A. Conversely. HoxA-10. which has been previously shown to associate with FOXO1A to upregulate decidual IGFBP-1 expression. is unable to upregulate PRL expression when co-expressed with FOXO1A. By co-immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation. we demonstrate physical association of HoxA-11 and FOXO1A. and binding of both factors to an enhancer region (−395 to −148 relative to the PRL transcriptional start site) of the decidual prolactin promoter. Because FOXO1A is induced upon decidualization. it serves to assemble a decidual-specific transcriptional complex including HoxA-11.

We initially attempted a bioinformatics analysis to identify sequence features that would predict a DNA- or protein-binding function. These efforts were complicated by several issues. including uncertainties about the full functional capabilities of the ZFs. We therefore applied an unbiased approach to directly examine the potential for ZFs to facilitate DNA or protein interactions.

Despite the fact that protein complexes regulate gene expression. the evolution of regulatory protein complexes is rarely studied. Here. we investigate the evolution of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) between Homeobox A11 (HoxA11) and Forkhead box 01A (Foxo1a). Using extant and “resurrected” ancestral proteins. we show that the physical interaction between HoxA11 and Foxo1a originated in the mammalian stem lineage. Functional divergence tests and coimmunoprecipitation with heterologous protein pairs indicate that the evolution of interaction was attributable to changes in HoxA11. and deletion studies demonstrate that the interaction interface is located in the homeodomain region of HoxA11.

However. little is known about how NR4A3 contributes to AcCC biology. Detailed RNA-sequencing of 21 archived AcCC samples revealed fusion reads arising from recurrent t (4; 9). t (9; 12). t (8; 9) or t (2; 4) chromosomal translocations. which positioned highly active enhancers adjacent to the promoter of the NR4A3 gene or the closely related NR4A2 gene. resulting in their aberrant overexpression. Transcriptome analyses revealed several distinct subgroups of AcCC tumors. including a subgroup that overexpressed both NR4A3 and MSANTD3.

The evolution of pregnancy is an excellent system in which to study the origin of novelties because mammals preserve stages in the transition from egg laying to live birth. To determine the molecular bases of this transition. we characterized the pregnant/gravid uterine transcriptome from tetrapods to trace the evolutionary history of uterine gene expression. We show that thousands of genes evolved endometrial expression during the origins of mammalian pregnancy. including genes that mediate maternal-fetal communication and immunotolerance.

Here. we present our answer to this long‐debated question. arguing that (i) menstruation occurs as a mechanistic consequence of hormone‐induced differentiation of the endometrium (referred to as spontaneous decidualization. or SD); (ii) SD evolved because of maternal–fetal conflict; and (iii) SD evolved by genetic assimilation of the decidualization reaction. which is induced by the fetus in non‐menstruating species. The idea that menstruation occurs as a consequence of SD has been proposed in the past. but here we present a novel hypothesis on how SD evolved.

Human Accelerated Regions (HARs). which include developmental enhancers that harbor a significant excess of human-specific sequence changes. are leading candidates for driving novel physical modifications in humans. Here we examine the role of the HAR HACNS1 (also known as HAR2) in human limb evolution by directly interrogating its cellular and developmental functions in a humanized mouse model. HACNS1 encodes an enhancer with human-specific activity in the developing limb in transgenic mouse reporter assays. and exhibits increased epigenetic signatures of enhancer activity in the human embryonic limb compared to its orthologs in rhesus macaque and mouse. Here we find that HACNS1 maintains its human-specific enhancer activity compared to its chimpanzee ortholog in the mouse embryonic limb. and that it alters expression of the transcription factor gene Gbx2 during limb development. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing. we demonstrate that Gbx2 is upregulated in humanized limb bud chondrogenic mesenchyme. implicating HACNS1-mediated Gbx2 expression in early skeletal patterning.

The evolution of pregnancy is an excellent system in which to study the origin of novelties because mammals preserve stages in the transition from egg laying to live birth. To determine the molecular bases of this transition. we characterized the pregnant/gravid uterine transcriptome from tetrapods to trace the evolutionary history of uterine gene expression. We show that thousands of genes evolved endometrial expression during the origins of mammalian pregnancy. including genes that mediate maternal-fetal communication and immunotolerance.

The number of cell types found within an organism differs considerably between species. and cell type diversity is a significant contributor to differences in organismal structure and function. These observations suggest that cell type origination is a significant source of evolutionary novelty. The molecular mechanisms that result in the evolution of novel cell types. however. are poorly understood. Here. we show that a novel cell type of eutherians mammals. the decidual stromal cell (DSC). evolved by rewiring an ancestral cellular stress response. We isolated the precursor cell type of DSCs. endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESFs). from the opossum Monodelphis domestica. We show that. in opossum ESFs. the majority of decidual core regulatory genes respond to decidualizing signals but do not regulate decidual effector genes. Rather. in opossum ESFs. decidual transcription factors function in apoptotic and oxidative stress response.

Early cervix shortening is a powerful clinical predictor of preterm birth. and thus understanding how CRM is regulated is important for the prevention of prematurity. Humans and other primates differ from most other mammals by the maintenance of high levels of systemic progesterone concentrations. Humans have been hypothesized to perform functional progesterone withdrawal (FPW). Guinea pigs are similar to humans in maintaining high-progesterone concentrations through parturition. thus making them a prime model for studying CRM.

Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly variable between closely related species. However. the extent and mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in mRNA sequence features. we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation.

The association of HLA-B27 and -B57 with control of viremia supports this conclusion. However. specific correlates of viral control in individuals expressing these alleles have been difficult to define. We recently reported that transient in vivo CD8+ cell depletion in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected elite controller (EC) macaques resulted in a brief period of viral recrudescence. SIV replication was rapidly controlled with the reappearance of CD8+ cells. implicating that these cells actively suppress viral replication in ECs.Methods and FindingsHere we show that three ECs in that study made at least seven robust CD8+ T cell responses directed against novel epitopes in Vif. Rev. and Nef restricted by the MHC class I molecule Mamu-B*08. Two of these Mamu-B*08-positive animals subsequently lost control of SIV replication.

In order to explore the biological consequences of copy number changes in the Drosophila genome. we resequenced the genomes of 19 tissue-culture cell lines and generated RNA-Seq profiles. Our work revealed dramatic duplications and deletions in all cell lines. We found three lines of evidence indicating that copy number changes were due to selection during tissue culture. First. we found that copy numbers correlated to maintain stoichiometric balance in protein complexes and biochemical pathways. consistent with the gene balance hypothesis. Second. while most copy number changes were cell line-specific. we identified some copy number changes shared by many of the independent cell lines. These included dramatic recurrence of increased copy number of the PDGF/VEGF receptor. which is also over-expressed in many cancer cells. and of bantam. an anti-apoptosis miRNA. Third. even when copy number changes seemed distinct between lines. there was strong evidence that they supported a common phenotypic outcome.

While progress has been made in elucidating the regulatory functions of lncRNAs. little is known about their origins and evolution. Here we explore the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the makeup and regulation of lncRNAs in human. mouse. and zebrafish. Surprisingly. TEs occur in more than two thirds of mature lncRNA transcripts and account for a substantial portion of total lncRNA sequence (∼30% in human). whereas they seldom occur in protein-coding transcripts. While TEs contribute less to lncRNA exons than expected. several TE families are strongly enriched in lncRNAs. There is also substantial interspecific variation in the coverage and types of TEs embedded in lncRNAs. partially reflecting differences in the TE landscapes of the genomes surveyed. In human. TE sequences in lncRNAs evolve under greater evolutionary constraint than their non–TE sequences. than their intronic TEs. or than random DNA. Consistent with functional constraint. we found that TEs contribute signals essential for the biogenesis of many lncRNAs. including ∼30.000 unique sites for transcription initiation. splicing. or polyadenylation in human. In addition. we identified ∼35.000 TEs marked as open chromatin located within 10 kb upstream of lncRNA genes.

However. little is known about Arc’s molecular function and evolutionary origins. Here. we show that Arc self-assembles into virus-like capsids that encapsulate RNA. Endogenous Arc protein is released from neurons in extracellular vesicles that mediate the transfer of Arc mRNA into new target cells. where it can undergo activity-dependent translation. Purified Arc capsids are endocytosed and are able to transfer Arc mRNA into the cytoplasm of neurons. These results show that Arc exhibits similar molecular properties to retroviral Gag proteins. Evolutionary analysis indicates that Arc is derived from a vertebrate lineage of Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons. which are also ancestors to retroviruses.

Here we explore the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the makeup and regulation of lncRNAs in human. mouse. and zebrafish. Surprisingly. TEs occur in more than two thirds of mature lncRNA transcripts and account for a substantial portion of total lncRNA sequence (∼30% in human). whereas they seldom occur in protein-coding transcripts. While TEs contribute less to lncRNA exons than expected. several TE families are strongly enriched in lncRNAs. There is also substantial interspecific variation in the coverage and types of TEs embedded in lncRNAs. partially reflecting differences in the TE landscapes of the genomes surveyed. In human. TE sequences in lncRNAs evolve under greater evolutionary constraint than their non–TE sequences. than their intronic TEs. or than random DNA.

In addition. we identified ∼35.000 TEs marked as open chromatin located within 10 kb upstream of lncRNA genes.

It is well established that gene expression level is a major determinant of the rate of protein evolution. but the reasons for this relationship remain highly debated. Here we demonstrate that gene expression is also a major determinant of the evolution of gene dosage: the rate of gene losses after whole genome duplications in the Paramecium lineage is negatively correlated to the level of gene expression. and this relationship is not a byproduct of other factors known to affect the fate of gene duplicates. This indicates that changes in gene dosage are generally more deleterious for highly expressed genes. This rule also holds for other taxa: in yeast. we find a clear relationship between gene expression level and the fitness impact of reduction in gene dosage. To explain these observations. we propose a model based on the fact that the optimal expression level of a gene corresponds to a trade-off between the benefit and cost of its expression. This COSTEX model predicts that selective pressure against mutations changing gene expression level or affecting the encoded protein should on average be stronger in highly expressed genes and hence that both the frequency of gene loss and the rate of protein evolution should correlate negatively with gene expression. Thus. the COSTEX model provides a simple and common explanation for the general relationship observed between the level of gene expression and the different facets of gene evolution.,True,AW7uxjIAAAAJ:UKB2i6g6GNMC,152,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000944,12506245853035412798,/scholar?cites=12506245853035412798,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000944,0,0,0

It has been reported previously that these genome rearrangements are initiated by the introduction of developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). which depend on the domesticated transposase PiggyMac. These DSBs all exhibit a characteristic geometry. with 4-base 5′ overhangs centered on the conserved TA. and may readily align and undergo ligation with minimal processing. However. the molecular steps and actors involved in the final and precise assembly of somatic genes have remained unknown. We demonstrate here that Ligase IV and Xrcc4p. core components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ). are required both for the repair of IES excision sites and for the circularization of excised IESs. The transcription of LIG4 and XRCC4 is induced early during the sexual cycle and a Lig4p-GFP fusion protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus by the time IES excision takes place. RNAi–mediated silencing of either gene results in the persistence of free broken DNA ends. apparently protected against extensive resection. At the nucleotide level. controlled removal of the 5′-terminal nucleotide occurs normally in LIG4-silenced cells. while nucleotide addition to the 3′ ends of the breaks is blocked. together with the final joining step. indicative of a coupling between NHEJ polymerase and ligase activities.

Because of their unique nuclear dimorphism. ciliates are powerful unicellular eukaryotic models to study the mechanisms involved in PGR. At each sexual cycle. the germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny. but the somatic nucleus. essential for gene expression. is destroyed and a new somatic nucleus differentiates from a copy of the germline nucleus. In Paramecium tetraurelia. the development of the somatic nucleus involves massive PGR. including the precise elimination of at least 45.000 germline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences. IES). IES excision proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism: a domesticated transposase. PiggyMac. is essential for DNA cleavage. and DSB repair at excision sites involves the Ligase IV. a specific component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. At the genome-wide level. a huge number of programmed DSBs must be repaired during this process to allow the assembly of functional somatic chromosomes. To understand how DNA cleavage and DSB repair are coordinated during PGR. we have focused on Ku. the earliest actor of NHEJ-mediated repair.

To be able to compare genomes sequenced with different technologies. we developed a coverage-based method and applied it to the D. buzzatii st-1 and j-19 genome. Between 10.85 and 11.16 % of the D. buzzatii st-1 genome is made up of TEs. between 7 and 7.5 % of D. buzzatii j-19 genome. while TEs represent 15.35 % of the D. mojavensis genome. Helitrons are the most abundant order in the three genomes. TEs in D. buzzatii are less abundant than in D. mojavensis. as expected according to the genome size and TE content positive correlation.

Here we show that while gene expression in the uterus evolves at a slow and relatively constant rate. it has been punctuated by periods of rapid change associated with the recruitment of thousands of genes into uterine expression during the evolution of pregnancy in mammals. We found that numerous genes and signaling pathways essential for the establishment of pregnancy and maternal-fetal communication evolved uterine expression in mammals. Remarkably the majority of genes recruited into endometrial expression have cis-regulatory elements derived from lineage-specific transposons. suggesting that that bursts of transposition facilitate adaptation and speciation through genomic and regulatory reorganization.,True,AW7uxjIAAAAJ:tSVUDDkujAIC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4639,15491866567433639631,/scholar?cites=15491866567433639631,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.4639,0,0,0

Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters. exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states. base pairing probabilities. as well as thermodynamic properties. The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model. the Turner 2004 parameters. the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs. and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures. additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities. or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures. and support for input in fasta format.

Frequencies of structures are highly non-uniform and follow a generalized form of Zipf’s law: we find relatively few common and many rare ones. By using an algorithm for inverse folding. we show that sequences sharing the same structure are distributed randomly over sequence space. All common structures can be accessed from an arbitrary sequence by a number of mutations much smaller than the chain length. The sequence space is percolated by extensive neutral networks connecting nearest neighbours folding into identical structures.

We explored bird macroevolution using full genomes from 48 avian species representing all major extant clades. The avian genome is principally characterized by its constrained size. which predominantly arose because of lineage-specific erosion of repetitive elements. large segmental deletions. and gene loss. Avian genomes furthermore show a remarkably high degree of evolutionary stasis at the levels of nucleotide sequence. gene synteny. and chromosomal structure. Despite this pattern of conservation. we detected many non-neutral evolutionary changes in protein-coding genes and noncoding regions.

On such networks. evolving populations split into subpopulations. which diffuse independently in sequence space. This demands a distinction between two mutation thresholds: one at which genotypic information is lost and one at which phenotypic information is lost. In between. diffusion enables the search of vast areas in genotype space while still preserving the dominant phenotype.

1160290,Fast mapping of short sequences with mismatches. insertions and deletions using index structures,2009,Steve Hoffmann and Christian Otto and Stefan Kurtz and Cynthia M Sharma and Philipp Khaitovich and Jörg Vogel and Peter F Stadler and Jörg Hackermüller,5,PLoS Comput Biol,9,e1000502,Public Library of Science,With few exceptions. current methods for short read mapping make use of simple seed heuristics to speed up the search. Most of the underlying matching models neglect the necessity to allow not only mismatches. but also insertions and deletions. Current evaluations indicate. however. that very different error models apply to the novel high-throughput sequencing methods. While the most frequent error-type in Illumina reads are mismatches. reads produced by 454's GS FLX predominantly contain insertions and deletions (indels). Even though 454 sequencers are able to produce longer reads. the method is frequently applied to small RNA (miRNA and siRNA) sequencing. Fast and accurate matching in particular of short reads with diverse errors is therefore a pressing practical problem. We introduce a matching model for short reads that can. besides mismatches. also cope with indels. It addresses different error models. For example. it can handle the problem of leading and trailing contaminations caused by primers and poly-A tails in transcriptomics or the length-dependent increase of error rates. In these contexts. it thus simplifies the tedious and error-prone trimming step. For efficient searches. our method utilizes index structures in the form of enhanced suffix arrays. In a comparison with current methods for short read mapping. the presented approach shows significantly increased performance not only for 454 reads. but also for Illumina reads.

RNAalifold. which computes the minimum energy structure that is simultaneously formed by a set of aligned sequences. is one of the oldest and most widely used tools for this task. In recent years. several alternative approaches have been advocated. pointing to several shortcomings of the original RNAalifold approach. We show that the accuracy of RNAalifold predictions can be improved substantially by introducing a different. more rational handling of alignment gaps. and by replacing the rather simplistic model of covariance scoring with more sophisticated RIBOSUM-like scoring matrices. These improvements are achieved without compromising the computational efficiency of the algorithm. We show here that the new version of RNAalifold not only outperforms the old one. but also several other tools recently developed. on different datasets. The new version of RNAalifold not only can replace the old one for almost any application but it is also competitive with other approaches including those based on SCFGs. maximum expected accuracy. or hierarchical nearest neighbor classifiers.,True,pVnGRlkAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,508,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-474,16672234855488191527,/scholar?cites=16672234855488191527,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-474,0,0,0

In some cases. such as microRNAs and box H/ACA snoRNAs. functional commonalities define classes of RNAs that are characterized by structural similarities. and typically consist of multiple RNA families. Recent advances in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics have produced very large sets of putative noncoding RNAs and regulatory RNA signals. For many of them. evidence for stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures has been derived. and at least approximate models of their structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of these hypothetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established families or classes. We present here a structure-based clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative RNA classes from genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The LocARNA (local alignment of RNA) tool implements a novel variant of the Sankoff algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust against false positive predictions. i.e.. a contamination of the input data with unstructured or nonconserved sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based clustering approach on the sequences of the RFAM-seed alignments. Furthermore. we have applied it to a previously published set of 3.332 predicted structured elements in the Ciona intestinalis genome (Missal K. Rose D.

An implementation of this algorithm is currently used in a program that assembles the UniGene database          at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.      ,True,k9T3V7EAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,4588,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10665270050081478,1831082504589366451,/scholar?cites=1831082504589366451,,http://www.alliot.org/BIO/PDF/10665270050081478.pdf,0,0,0

Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced. the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20.000-23.000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution. while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example. the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements. both non-coding and coding. Notably. many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes.

As a result of exceptional sample preservation and the use of a recently developed emulsion polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing technique. 13 million base pairs (45.4%) of the sequencing reads were identified as mammoth DNA. Sequence identity between our data and African elephant (Loxodonta africana) was 98.55%. consistent with a paleontologically based divergence date of 5 to 6 million years.

This screen finds a large number of known functional RNAs. including 195 miRNAs. 62 histone 3′UTR stem loops. and various types of known genetic recoding elements. Among the highest-scoring new predictions are 169 new miRNA candidates. as well as new candidate selenocysteine insertion sites. RNA editing hairpins. RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation. and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function.

Although the pairwise genome rearrangement problem is well-studied. algorithms for reconstructing rearrangement scenarios for multiple species are in great need. The previous approaches to multiple genome rearrangement problem were largely based on the breakpoint distance rather than on a more biologically accurate rearrangement (reversal) distance. Another shortcoming of the existing software tools is their inability to analyze rearrangements (inversions. translocations. fusions. and fissions) of multichromosomal genomes. This paper proposes a new multiple genome rearrangement algorithm that is based on the rearrangement (rather than breakpoint) distance and that is applicable to both unichromosomal and multichromosomal genomes.

We identified 1.234 high confidence binding clusters of which 94% are projected to be bona fide ERα binding regions. Only 5% of the mapped estrogen receptor binding sites are located within 5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start sites of adjacent genes. regions containing the proximal promoters. whereas vast majority of the sites are mapped to intronic or distal locations (>5 kb from 5′ and 3′ ends of adjacent transcript). suggesting transcriptional regulatory mechanisms over significant physical distances. Of all the identified sites. 71% harbored putative full estrogen response elements (EREs). 25% bore ERE half sites. and only 4% had no recognizable ERE sequences. Genes in the vicinity of ERα binding sites were enriched for regulation by estradiol in MCF-7 cells. and their expression profiles in patient samples segregate ERα-positive from ERα-negative breast tumors. The expression dynamics of the genes adjacent to ERα binding sites suggest a direct induction of gene expression through binding to ERE-like sequences. whereas transcriptional repression by ERα appears to be through indirect mechanisms. Our analysis also indicates a number of candidate transcription factor binding sites adjacent to occupied EREs at frequencies much greater than by chance. including the previously reported FOXA1 sites. and demonstrate the potential involvement of one such putative adjacent factor.

While progress has been made in elucidating the regulatory functions of lncRNAs. little is known about their origins and evolution. Here we explore the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the makeup and regulation of lncRNAs in human. mouse. and zebrafish. Surprisingly. TEs occur in more than two thirds of mature lncRNA transcripts and account for a substantial portion of total lncRNA sequence (∼30% in human). whereas they seldom occur in protein-coding transcripts. While TEs contribute less to lncRNA exons than expected. several TE families are strongly enriched in lncRNAs. There is also substantial interspecific variation in the coverage and types of TEs embedded in lncRNAs. partially reflecting differences in the TE landscapes of the genomes surveyed. In human. TE sequences in lncRNAs evolve under greater evolutionary constraint than their non–TE sequences. than their intronic TEs. or than random DNA. Consistent with functional constraint. we found that TEs contribute signals essential for the biogenesis of many lncRNAs. including ∼30.000 unique sites for transcription initiation. splicing. or polyadenylation in human. In addition. we identified ∼35.000 TEs marked as open chromatin located within 10 kb upstream of lncRNA genes. The density of these marks in one cell type correlate with elevated expression of the downstream lncRNA in the same cell type. suggesting that these TEs contribute to cis-regulation.

While progress has been made in elucidating the regulatory functions of lncRNAs. little is known about their origins and evolution. Here we explore the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the makeup and regulation of lncRNAs in human. mouse. and zebrafish. Surprisingly. TEs occur in more than two thirds of mature lncRNA transcripts and account for a substantial portion of total lncRNA sequence (∼30% in human). whereas they seldom occur in protein-coding transcripts. While TEs contribute less to lncRNA exons than expected. several TE families are strongly enriched in lncRNAs. There is also substantial interspecific variation in the coverage and types of TEs embedded in lncRNAs. partially reflecting differences in the TE landscapes of the genomes surveyed. In human. TE sequences in lncRNAs evolve under greater evolutionary constraint than their non–TE sequences. than their intronic TEs. or than random DNA. Consistent with functional constraint. we found that TEs contribute signals essential for the biogenesis of many lncRNAs. including ∼30.000 unique sites for transcription initiation. splicing. or polyadenylation in human. In addition. we identified ∼35.000 TEs marked as open chromatin located within 10 kb upstream of lncRNA genes. The density of these marks in one cell type correlate with elevated expression of the downstream lncRNA in the same cell type. suggesting that these TEs contribute to cis-regulation. These global trends are recapitulated in several lncRNAs with established functions.

The result is an explosion of new. ultracontiguous genome assemblies. To compare these genomes. we need robust methods for genome annotation. We describe the fully open source Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT). which provides a flexible way to simultaneously annotate entire clades and identify orthology relationships.

For the first time in Tetrahymena thermophila. we use comparative whole-genome sequencing to identify the mutation in the BB disorientation mutant disA-1. disA-1 abolishes the localization of the novel protein DisAp to T. thermophila striated fibers (kinetodesmal fibers; KFs). which is consistent with DisAp’s similarity to the striated fiber protein SF-assemblin.

Here. we describe the application of ProxiMeta. a Hi-C-based metagenomic deconvolution method. to deconvolve a human fecal metagenome. This method uses the intra-cellular proximity signal captured by Hi-C as a direct indicator of which sequences originated in the same cell. enabling culture-free de novo deconvolution of mixed genomes without any reliance on a priori information. We show that ProxiMeta deconvolution provides results of markedly high accuracy and sensitivity. yielding 50 near-complete microbial genomes (many of which are novel) from a single fecal sample. out of 252 total genome clusters. ProxiMeta outperforms traditional contig binning at high-quality genome reconstruction. ProxiMeta shows particularly good performance in constructing high-quality genomes for diverse but poorly-characterized members of the human gut. We further use ProxiMeta to reconstruct genome plasmid content and sharing of plasmids among genomes—tasks that traditional binning methods usually fail to accomplish.

To study how poxviruses adapt to innate immune detection pathways. we performed serial vaccinia virus infections in primary human cells. Independent courses of experimental evolution with a recombinant strain lacking E3L revealed several high-frequency point mutations in conserved poxvirus genes. suggesting important roles for essential poxvirus proteins in innate immune subversion. Two distinct mutations were identified in the viral RNA polymerase gene A24R. which seem to act through different mechanisms to increase virus replication. Specifically. a Leu18Phe substitution encoded within A24R conferred fitness trade-offs. including increased activation of the antiviral factor protein kinase R (PKR).

FALCON-Unzip. a phased diploid genome assembler. separates PacBio long-reads by haplotype during assembly. The assembler outputs contiguous primary contigs. which are pseudohaplotypes containing phased haplotype regions and collapsed haplotypes. The ability to phase depends on the density of heterozygous variants. depth of coverage. and read length. As a result. haplotype phase information is lost when phase blocks are interrupted by regions of low heterozygosity. resulting in phase switches. Here. we present FALCON-Phase. a new method that resolves phase-switches by reconstructing contig-length phase blocks using Hi-C short-reads mapped to both homozygous regions and phase blocks. Such Hi-C data contain ultra-long-range phasing information (>1Mb). The novel FALCON-Phase algorithm is highly accurate (>96%) when benchmarked against a pedigree-based truth-set. The FALCON-Phase pipeline can also be extended to scaffolds to generate chromosome-scale phase blocks.

Additionally. lactoferrin possesses cationic protein domains that directly bind and inhibit diverse microbes. The implications for these dual functions on lactoferrin evolution and genetic conflicts with microbes remain unclear. Here we show that lactoferrin has been subject to recurrent episodes of positive selection during primate divergence predominately at antimicrobial peptide surfaces consistent with long-term antagonism by bacteria. An abundant lactoferrin polymorphism in human populations and Neanderthals also exhibits signatures of positive selection across primates. linking ancient host-microbe conflicts to modern human genetic variation. Rapidly evolving sites in lactoferrin further correspond to molecular interfaces with opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing meningitis. pneumonia. and sepsis. Because microbes actively target lactoferrin to acquire iron. we propose that the emergence of antimicrobial activity provided a pivotal mechanism of adaptation sparking evolutionary conflicts via acquisition of new protein functions.,True,HVtr6AIAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,17,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006063,8145370688152725767,/scholar?cites=8145370688152725767,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006063,0,0,0

While the first generation of genome projects focused on well-studied model organisms. many of today's projects involve exotic organisms whose genomes are largely terra incognita. This complicates their annotation. because unlike first-generation projects. there are no pre-existing 'gold-standard' gene-models with which to train gene-finders. Improvements in genome assembly and the wide availability of mRNA-seq data are also creating opportunities to update and re-annotate previously published genome annotations. Today's genome projects are thus in need of new genome annotation tools that can meet the challenges and opportunities presented by second-generation sequencing technologies. We present MAKER2. a genome annotation and data management tool designed for second-generation genome projects. MAKER2 is a multi-threaded. parallelized application that can process second-generation datasets of virtually any size. We show that MAKER2 can produce accurate annotations for novel genomes where training-data are limited. of low quality or even non-existent. MAKER2 also provides an easy means to use mRNA-seq data to improve annotation quality; and it can use these data to update legacy annotations. significantly improving their quality.

While progress has been made in elucidating the regulatory functions of lncRNAs. little is known about their origins and evolution. Here we explore the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the makeup and regulation of lncRNAs in human. mouse. and zebrafish. Surprisingly. TEs occur in more than two thirds of mature lncRNA transcripts and account for a substantial portion of total lncRNA sequence (∼30% in human). whereas they seldom occur in protein-coding transcripts. While TEs contribute less to lncRNA exons than expected. several TE families are strongly enriched in lncRNAs. There is also substantial interspecific variation in the coverage and types of TEs embedded in lncRNAs. partially reflecting differences in the TE landscapes of the genomes surveyed. In human. TE sequences in lncRNAs evolve under greater evolutionary constraint than their non–TE sequences. than their intronic TEs. or than random DNA. Consistent with functional constraint. we found that TEs contribute signals essential for the biogenesis of many lncRNAs. including ∼30.000 unique sites for transcription initiation. splicing. or polyadenylation in human. In addition. we identified ∼35.000 TEs marked as open chromatin located within 10 kb upstream of lncRNA genes. The density of these marks in one cell type correlate with elevated expression of the downstream lncRNA in the same cell type. suggesting that these TEs contribute to cis-regulation.

The Medicago sequencing project began in 2003 with the goal to decipher sequences originated from the euchromatic portion of the genome. The initial sequencing approach was based on a BAC tiling path. culminating in a BAC-based assembly (Mt3.5) as well as an in-depth analysis of the genome published in 2011. Here we describe a further improved and refined version of the M. truncatula genome (Mt4.0) based on de novo whole genome shotgun assembly of a majority of Illumina and 454 reads using ALLPATHS-LG. The ALLPATHS-LG scaffolds were anchored onto the pseudomolecules on the basis of alignments to both the optical map and the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) map.

Discoveries regarding their concerted expression patterns have commanded intense interest due to their complex regulation and specification of body plan features in jawed vertebrates. For example. the posterior HoxD genes switch to an inverted collinear expression pattern in the mouse autopod where HoxD13 switches from a more restricted to a less restricted domain relative to its neighboring gene on the cluster. We refer to this program as the ‘distal phase’ (DP) expression pattern because it occurs in distal regions of paired fins and limbs. and is regulated independently by elements in the 5′ region upstream of the HoxD cluster. However. few taxa have been evaluated with respect to this pattern. and most studies have focused on pectoral fin morphogenesis. which occurs relatively early in development. Here. we demonstrate for the first time that the DP expression pattern occurs with the posterior HoxA genes. and is therefore not solely associated with the HoxD gene cluster. Further. DP Hox expression is not confined to paired fins and limbs. but occurs in a variety of body plan features. including paddlefish barbels - sensory adornments that develop from the first mandibular arch (the former ‘Hox-free zone). and the vent (a medial structure that is analogous to a urethra). We found DP expression of HoxD13 and HoxD12 in the paddlefish barbel; and we present the first evidence for DP expression of the HoxA genes in the hindgut and vent of three ray-finned fishes.

The little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). exhibits both of these unique fin morphologies. These fin modifications are not present in a typical shark body plan. and little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying their development. A recent study identified a novel apical ectodermal ridge (AER) associated with the development of the anterior pectoral fin in the little skate. but the role of the posterior HoxA genes was not featured during skate fin development. We present the first evidence for HoxA expression (HoxA11 and HoxA13) in novel AER domains associated with the development of three novel fin morphologies in a representative batoid. L. erinacea. We found HoxA13 expression associated with the recently described novel AER in the anterior pectoral fin. and HoxA11 expression in a novel AER domain in the anterior pelvic fin that we describe here.

As a unique trait with a dedicated function. cephalic lobes offer an excellent opportunity to elucidate the processes by which diverse body plans and features evolve. To shed light on the morphological development and genetic underpinnings of cephalic lobes. we examined paired fin development in cownose rays. which represent the sister taxon to manta rays in the genus Mobula. We find that cephalic lobes develop as anterior pectoral fin domains and lack independent posterior patterning by 5’ HoxD genes and Shh. indicating that cephalic lobes are not independent appendages but rather are modified pectoral fins. In addition. by leveraging interspecies comparative transcriptomics and domain-specific RNA-sequencing. we identify shared expression of anterior patterning genes. including Alx1. Alx4. Pax9. Hoxa13. Hoxa2 and Hoxd4. in the pectoral fins of cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus) and little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). providing evidence in support of a homologous relationship between the cephalic lobes of myliobatids and the anterior pectoral fins of skates. We also suggest candidate genes that may be involved in development of myliobatid-specific features. including Omd. which is likely associated with development of thick anterior pectoral fin radials of myliobatids. and Dkk1. which may inhibit tissue outgrowth at the posterior boundary of the developing cephalic lobes.

It is a highly contagious positive strand RNA virus and its clinical presentation includes severe to critical respiratory disease that appears to be fatal in ~3-5% of the cases. The viral spike (S) coat protein engages the human angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) cell surface protein to invade the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has acquired mutations that increase its affinity to human ACE2 by ~10-15-fold compared to SARS-CoV S-protein. making it highly infectious. In this study. we assessed if ACE2 polymorphisms might alter host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by affecting the ACE2 S-protein interaction. Our comprehensive analysis of several large genomic datasets that included over 290.000 samples representing >400 population groups identified multiple ACE2 protein-altering variants. some of which mapped to the S-protein-interacting ACE2 surface. Using recently reported structural data and a recent S-protein-interacting synthetic mutant map of ACE2. we have identified natural ACE2 variants that are predicted to alter the virus-host interaction and thereby potentially alter host susceptibility. In particular. human ACE2 variants S19P. I21V. E23K. K26R. T27A. N64K. T92I. Q102P and H378R are predicted to increase susceptibility.

Inc.,Accurately reconstructing the large-scale gene order in an ancestral genome is a critical step to better understand genome evolution. In this paper. we propose a heuristic algorithm. called DUPCAR. for reconstructing ancestral genomic orders with duplications. The method starts from the order of genes in modern genomes and predicts predecessor and successor relationships in the ancestor. Then a greedy algorithm is used to reconstruct the ancestral orders by connecting genes into contiguous regions based on predicted adjacencies. Computer simulation was used to validate the algorithm. We also applied the method to reconstruct the ancestral chromosome X of placental mammals and the ancestral genomes of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia.,True,6hjjIzMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,63,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cmb.2008.0069,7000072457751870777,/scholar?cites=7000072457751870777,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3205822/,0,0,0

Shorter reads and higher error rates from these new instruments necessitate the development of new algorithms and software. This dissertation describes approaches to tackle some problems related to genome assembly with these short fragments. We describe YASRA (Yet Another Short Read Assembler). that performs comparative assembly of short reads using a reference genome. which can differ substantially from the genome being sequenced. We explain the algorithm and present the results of assembling one ancient-mitochondrial and one plastid dataset. Comparing the performance of YASRA with the AMOScmp-shortReads and Newbler mapping assemblers (version 2.0. 00.17) as template genomes are varied. we &# 64257; nd that YASRA generates fewer contigs with higher coverage and fewer errors. We also analyze situations where the use of comparative assembly outperforms de novo assembly. and vice-versa. and compare the performance of YASRA with that of the Velvet (version 0.7. 53) and Newbler de novo assemblers (version 2.0. 00.17). We utilize the concept of “overlap-graphs” from YASRA to &# 64257; nd genetic differences within a target species. We describe a simple pipeline for deducing such locations of variation in the presence of a reference genome and then extend it to deduce polymorphisms in a species without the help of a reference genome.

1160448,Calling SNPs without a reference sequence,2010,Aakrosh Ratan and Yu Zhang and Vanessa M Hayes and Stephan C Schuster and Webb Miller,11,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-13,BioMed Central,The most common application for the next-generation sequencing technologies is resequencing. where short reads from the genome of an individual are aligned to a reference genome sequence for the same species. These mappings can then be used to identify genetic differences among individuals in a population. and perhaps ultimately to explain phenotypic variation. Many algorithms capable of aligning short reads to the reference. and determining differences between them have been reported. Much less has been reported on how to use these technologies to determine genetic differences among individuals of a species for which a reference sequence is not available. which drastically limits the number of species that can easily benefit from these new technologies. We describe a computational pipeline. called DIAL (De novo Identification of Alleles). for identifying single-base substitutions between two closely related genomes without the help of a reference genome. The method works even when the depth of coverage is insufficient for de novo assembly. and it can be extended to determine small insertions/deletions. We evaluate the software's effectiveness using published Roche/454 sequence data from the genome of Dr. James Watson (to detect heterozygous positions) and recent Illumina data from orangutan. in each case comparing our results to those from computational analysis that uses a reference genome assembly.

In cold-blooded vertebrates. computational CGI predictions often reside away from gene promoters. suggesting a major divergence in gene promoter architecture across vertebrates. By experimentally identifying non-methylated DNA in the genomes of seven diverse vertebrates. we instead reveal that non-methylated islands (NMIs) of DNA are a central feature of vertebrate gene promoters. Furthermore. NMIs are present at orthologous genes across vast evolutionary distances. revealing a surprising level of conservation in this epigenetic feature. By profiling NMIs in different tissues and developmental stages we uncover a unifying set of features that are central to the function of NMIs in vertebrates. Together these findings demonstrate an ancient logic for NMI usage at gene promoters and reveal an unprecedented level of epigenetic conservation across vertebrate evolution.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00348.001,True,0JUKRegAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,158,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00348,13217127094957392710,/scholar?cites=13217127094957392710,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00348.pdf,0,0,0

We prepared platypus and echidna retinal RNA and used primers of the middle-wave-sensitive (MWS). long-wave-sensitive (LWS). and short-wave sensitive (SWS1) pigments corresponding to coding sequences that are highly conserved among mammals; to PCR amplify the corresponding pigment sequences. Amplification from the retinal RNA revealed the expression of LWS pigment mRNA that is homologous in sequence and spectral properties to the primate LWS visual pigments. However. we were unable to amplify the mammalian SWS1 pigment from these two species. indicating this gene was lost prior to the echidna-platypus divergence ~21 MYA. Subsequently. when the platypus genome sequence became available. we found an LWS pigment gene in a conserved genomic arrangement that resembles the primate pigment. but. surprisingly we found an adjacent (~20 kb) SWS2 pigment gene within this conserved genomic arrangement. We obtained the same result after sequencing the echidna genes. The encoded SWS2 pigment is predicted to have a wavelength of maximal absorption of about 440 nm. and is paralogous to SWS pigments typically found in reptiles. birds. and fish but not in mammals.

Ltd,Biological gene networks appear to be dynamically robust to mutation. stochasticity. and changes in the environment and also appear to be sparsely connected. Studies with computational models. however. have suggested that denser gene networks evolve to be more dynamically robust than sparser networks. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that misassumptions about how to measure robustness in artificial networks have inadvertently discounted the costs of network complexity. We show that when the costs of complexity are taken into account. that robustness implies a parsimonious network structure that is sparsely connected and not unnecessarily complex; and that selection will favor sparse networks when network topology is free to evolve. Because a robust system of heredity is necessary for the adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes. the maintenance of frugal network complexity is likely a crucial …,True,fOgFPxMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,249,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/msb.2008.52,15529722661226777487,/scholar?cites=15529722661226777487,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/msb.2008.52,0,0,0

Although some evolutionary changes are easily reversible. it can be argued that the reappearance of complex characters would be nearly impossible. This idea is based on the assumption that. after a structure is lost. the genes related to its development will degenerate. In the present paper we test this idea with respect to digit loss in the gymnophthalmid genus Bachia. We present a molecular phylogeny of the genus Bachia and investigate the evolution of digit number in this taxon.

A hypothesis to explain this is that a homeotic frame shift of digital identity occurred in the evolution of the bird wing. such that digits 1.2 and 3 are developing from embryological positions 2. 3 and 4. Digit 1 of the mouse is the only digit that shows no late expression of HoxD-11. This is also true for the anterior digit of the bird wing. suggesting this digit is actually a digit 1. If this is the case. we can expect closer relatives of birds to show no HoxD-11 expression only in digit 1. To test this prediction we investigate HoxD-11 expression in crocodilians. the closest living relatives of birds.  Methodology/Principal Findings Using degenerate primers we cloned a 606 nucleotide fragment of exon 1 of the alligator HoxD-11 gene and used it for whole-mount in-situ detection in alligator embryos. We found that in the pentadactyl forelimbs of alligator. as in the mouse. late expression of HoxD-11 is absent only in digit 1.  Conclusions/Significance The ancestral condition for amniotes is that late-phase HoxD-11 expression is absent only in digit 1. The biphalangeal morphology and lack of HoxD-11 expression of the anterior digit of the wing is like digit 1 of alligator and mouse. but its embryological position as digit 2 is derived. HoxD-11 expression in alligator is consistent with the hypothesis that both digit morphology as well as HoxD-11 expression are shifted towards posterior in the bird wing.,True,s_GxMhMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,56,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003325,6134538358938998182,/scholar?cites=6134538358938998182,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003325,0,0,0

Several aspects might explain how the environment influences the evolution of body elongation. but climate needs to be incorporated in this scenario to evaluate how it contributes to morphological evolution. Climatic parameters include temperature and precipitation. two variables that likely influence environmental characteristics. including soil texture and substrate coverage. which may define the selective pressures acting during the evolution of morphology. Due to development of geographic information system (GIS) techniques. these variables can now be included in evolutionary biology studies and were used in the present study to test for associations between variation in body shape and climate in the tropical lizard family Gymnophthalmidae. We first investigated how the morphological traits that define body shape are correlated in these lizards and then tested for associations between a descriptor of body elongation and climate. Our analyses revealed that the evolution of body elongation in Gymnophthalmidae involved concomitant changes in different morphological traits: trunk elongation was coupled with limb shortening and a reduction in body diameter. and the gradual variation along this axis was illustrated by less-elongated morphologies exhibiting shorter trunks and longer limbs. The variation identified in Gymnophthalmidae body shape was associated with climate. with the species from more arid environments usually being more elongated.

Because morphological and behavioral traits frequently influence males' combat success. these parameters may be used by females to assess the male (and associated territory) quality. In the present study. we tested the hypothesis that organismal traits in dominant males of the lizard Tropidurus torquatus are associated with the quality of the territory owned. After characterizing the territories occupied. we used a discriminant analysis to test if morphological and behavioral traits of the dominant male predict the quality of the territory owned. High-quality territories were characterized by a larger number of refuges. shorter distances among shelters and a well-defined harem. in comparison with low-quality territories. Organismal traits predicted with 100% accuracy the type of the territory owned: high-quality territories were associated with larger males that had longer heads. while males occupying low-quality territories exhibited more head displays. traveled larger distances and ran slightly slower than those associated with high-quality territories.

Most of our understanding of tetrapod limb development comes from research on amniotes. with far less known about mechanisms of limb development in amphibians. To better understand the mechanisms of limb development in anuran amphibians. we used cyclopamine to inhibit Hedgehog signaling at various stages of development in the western clawed frog. Xenopus tropicalis. and observed resulting morphologies. We also analyzed gene expression changes resulting from similar experiments in Xenopus laevis.

We’ve since had students intern in the company’s microbiology lab. and one of our recent graduates is now employed there full time.”“We were looking to create a truly local beer in the literal sense. and set out with this wacky idea of capturing a yeast from the general area and making a beer with it” said Markowski.“Only issue is that we didn’t know how to go about capturing it and that’s when we approached Geff and Kirk”.“Both professors clearly love beer and brewing and are very down-to-earth considering their stature.

Experimental approaches studying these systems usually focus on either the soil community's taxonomic structure or its functional characteristics. Many methods target DNA as marker molecule and use PCR for amplification.Methodology/Principal FindingsHere we apply an RNA-centered meta-transcriptomic approach to simultaneously obtain information on both structure and function of a soil community. Total community RNA is random reversely transcribed into cDNA without any PCR or cloning step. Direct pyrosequencing produces large numbers of cDNA rRNA-tags; these are taxonomically profiled in a binning approach using the MEGAN software and two specifically compiled rRNA reference databases containing small and large subunit rRNA sequences. The pyrosequencing also produces mRNA-tags; these provide a sequence-based transcriptome of the community. One soil dataset of 258.411 RNA-tags of ∼98 bp length contained 193.219 rRNA-tags with valid taxonomic information. together with 21.133 mRNA-tags. Quantitative information about the relative abundance of organisms from all three domains of life and from different trophic levels was obtained in a single experiment. Less frequent taxa. such as soil Crenarchaeota. were well represented in the data set.

How nucleosomal organization is specified by the genome is less clear. Here we establish and inter-relate rules governing genomic nucleosome organization by sequencing DNA from more than one million immunopurified S. cerevisiae nucleosomes (displayed at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/). Evidence is presented that the organization of nucleosomes throughout genes is largely a consequence of statistical packing principles.

As a result of exceptional sample preservation and the use of a recently developed emulsion polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing technique. 13 million base pairs (45.4%) of the sequencing reads were identified as mammoth DNA. Sequence identity between our data and African elephant (Loxodonta africana) was 98.55%. consistent with a paleontologically based divergence date of 5 to 6 million years.
