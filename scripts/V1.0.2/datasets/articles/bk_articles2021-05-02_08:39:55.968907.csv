LASER enables the familiar logistic regression model to be applied to very large scale response prediction problems. including ones beyond advertising. Though the underlying model is well understood. we apply a whole-system approach to address model accuracy. scalability. explore-exploit. and real-time inference. To facilitate training with both large numbers of training examples and high dimensional features on commodity clustered hardware. we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Because online advertising applications are much less static than classical presentations of response prediction. LASER employs a number of techniques that allows it to adapt in real time.

Matrix factorization methods that computes a low-rank approximation of the incomplete user-item rating matrix provide state-of-the-art performance. especially for users and items with several past ratings (warm starts). However. it is a challenge to generalize such methods to users and items with few or no past ratings (cold starts). Prior work [4][32] have generalized matrix factorization to include both user and item features for performing better regularization of factors as well as provide a model for smooth transition from cold starts to warm starts.

For instance. in order to recommend relevant content to a user or optimize for revenue. many web companies use logistic regression models to predict the probability of the user's clicking on an item (eg. ad. news article. job). In scenarios where the data is abundant. having a more fine-grained model at the user or item level would potentially lead to more accurate prediction. as the user's personal preferences on items and the item's specific attraction for users can be better captured. One common approach is to introduce ID-level regression coefficients in addition to the global regression coefficients in a GLM setting. and such models are called generalized linear mixed models (GLMix) in the statistical literature.

Our algorithm pretrains a CNN using a large set of videos with tracking ground-truths to obtain a generic target representation.

The proposed algorithm employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to represent target appearances. where multiple CNNs collaborate to estimate target states and determine the desirable paths for online model updates in the tree. By maintaining multiple CNNs in diverse branches of tree structure. it is convenient to deal with multi-modality in target appearances and preserve model reliability through smooth updates along tree paths. Since multiple CNNs share all parameters in convolutional layers. it takes advantage of multiple models with little extra cost by saving memory space and avoiding redundant network evaluations. The final target state is estimated by sampling target candidates around the state in the previous frame and identifying the best sample in terms of a weighted average score from a set of active CNNs.

Extending this idea to general visual recognition problems. we present Batch-Instance Normalization (BIN) to explicitly normalize unnecessary styles from images. Considering certain style features play an essential role in discriminative tasks. BIN learns to selectively normalize only disturbing styles while preserving useful styles. The proposed normalization module is easily incorporated into existing network architectures such as Residual Networks. and surprisingly improves the recognition performance in various scenarios. Furthermore. experiments verify that BIN effectively adapts to completely different tasks like object classification and style transfer. by controlling the trade-off between preserving and removing style variations.

In this paper. we aim to fully leverage the potential of styles to improve the performance of CNNs in general vision tasks. We propose a Style-based Recalibration Module (SRM). a simple yet effective architectural unit. which adaptively recalibrates intermediate feature maps by exploiting their styles. SRM first extracts the style information from each channel of the feature maps by style pooling. then estimates per-channel recalibration weight via channel-independent style integration. By incorporating the relative importance of individual styles into feature maps. SRM effectively enhances the representational ability of a CNN. The proposed module is directly fed into existing CNN architectures with negligible overhead. We conduct comprehensive experiments on general image recognition as well as tasks related to styles. which verify the benefit of SRM over recent approaches such as Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE).

This has posed substantial obstacles to real-world applications of deep learning. Recent studies suggest that one of the main causes of this problem is CNNs' inductive bias towards image styles (ie textures). which are highly dependent on domains. rather than contents (ie shapes). Motivated by this. we propose Style-Agnostic Networks (SagNets) which mitigate the style bias to generalize better under domain shift. Our experiments demonstrate that SagNets successfully reduce the style bias as well as domain discrepancy. and clarify a strong correlation between the bias and domain gap. Finally. SagNets achieve remarkable performance improvements in a wide range of cross-domain tasks. including domain generalization. unsupervised domain adaptation. and semi-supervised domain adaptation.,True,X9BkR3MAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,6,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11645,9504799870341271790,/scholar?cites=9504799870341271790,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11645,0,0,0

The success of CNNs is attributed to their ability to learn rich mid-level image representations as opposed to hand-designed low-level features used in other image classification methods. Learning CNNs. however. amounts to estimating millions of parameters and requires a very large number of annotated image samples. This property currently prevents application of CNNs to problems with limited training data. In this work we show how image representations learned with CNNs on large-scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks with limited amount of training data. We design a method to reuse layers trained on the ImageNet dataset to compute mid-level image representation for images in the PASCAL VOC dataset. We show that despite differences in image statistics and tasks in the two datasets. the transferred representation leads to significantly improved results for object and action classification. outperforming the current state of the art on Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets.

However. it remains unclear whether and how this code could be implemented in neural circuits. Recent advances in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). which achieve near-human performance in some language tasks. provide a compelling model to address such questions. Here. we present a new framework to study recursive processing in RNNs. using subject-verb agreement as a probe into the representations of the neural network. We trained six distinct types of RNNs on a simplified probabilistic context-free grammar designed to independently manipulate the length of a sentence and the depth of its syntactic tree. All RNNs generalized to subject-verb dependencies longer than those seen during training. However. none systematically generalized to deeper tree structures. even those with a structural bias towards learning nested tree (ie. stack-RNNs). In addition. our analyses revealed primacy and recency effects in the generalization patterns of LSTM-based models. showing that these models tend to perform well on the outer-and innermost parts of a center-embedded tree structure. but poorly on its middle levels. Finally. probing the internal states of the model during the processing of sentences with nested tree structures. we found a complex encoding of grammatical agreement information (eg grammatical number). in which all the information for multiple words nouns was carried by a single unit.

Closed-form solution for the processing time is derived and the influence of overheads on the optimal processing time is analyzed. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal processing time. We then study the effect of changing the load distribution sequence on the time performance. Through rigorous analysis. an optimal sequence to distribute the load among the processors is identified. whenever it exists.

Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper. we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions. we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem.

Recently. the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model has been shown to outperform traditional optical flow based methods for precipitation nowcasting. suggesting that deep learning models have a huge potential for solving the problem. However. the convolutional recurrence structure in ConvLSTM-based models is location-invariant while natural motion and transformation (eg. rotation) are location-variant in general. Furthermore. since deep-learning-based precipitation nowcasting is a newly emerging area. clear evaluation protocols have not yet been established. To address these problems. we propose both a new model and a benchmark for precipitation nowcasting. Specifically. we go beyond ConvLSTM and propose the Trajectory GRU (TrajGRU) model that can actively learn the location-variant structure for recurrent connections.

1281099,Relational stacked denoising autoencoder for tag recommendation,2015,Hao Wang and Xingjian Shi and Dit-Yan Yeung,29,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,,,Tag recommendation has become one of the most important ways of organizing and indexing online resources like articles. movies. and music. Since tagging information is usually very sparse. effective learning of the content representation for these resources is crucial to accurate tag recommendation. Recently. models proposed for tag recommendation. such as collaborative topic regression and its variants. have demonstrated promising accuracy. However. a limitation of these models is that. by using topic models like latent Dirichlet allocation as the key component. the learned representation may not be compact and effective enough. Moreover. since relational data exist as an auxiliary data source in many applications. it is desirable to incorporate such data into tag recommendation models. In this paper. we start with a deep learning model called stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) in an attempt to learn more effective content representation. We propose a probabilistic formulation for SDAE and then extend it to a relational SDAE (RSDAE) model. RSDAE jointly performs deep representation learning and relational learning in a principled way under a probabilistic framework.

Recently. convolutional neural network (CNN) models have achieved promising results for crowd counting. However. even when dealing with video data. CNN-based methods still consider each video frame independently. ignoring the strong temporal correlation between neighboring frames. To exploit the otherwise very useful temporal information in video sequences. we propose a variant of a recent deep learning model called convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) for crowd counting. Unlike the previous CNN-based methods. our method fully captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. Furthermore. we extend the ConvLSTM model to a bidirectional ConvLSTM model which can access long-range information in both directions. Extensive experiments using four publicly available datasets demonstrate the reliability of our approach and the effectiveness of incorporating temporal information to boost the accuracy of crowd counting.

However. most of them use either handcrafted features or the bag-of-words representation as a surrogate for the content information but they are neither effective nor natural enough. To address this problem. we develop a collaborative recurrent autoencoder (CRAE) which is a denoising recurrent autoencoder (DRAE) that models the generation of content sequences in the collaborative filtering (CF) setting. The model generalizes recent advances in recurrent deep learning from iid input to non-iid (CF-based) input and provides a new denoising scheme along with a novel learnable pooling scheme for the recurrent autoencoder. To do this. we first develop a hierarchical Bayesian model for the DRAE and then generalize it to the CF setting. The synergy between denoising and CF enables CRAE to make accurate recommendations while learning to fill in the blanks in sequences. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains (CiteULike and Netflix) show that. by jointly modeling the order-aware generation of sequences for the content information and performing CF for the ratings. CRAE is able to significantly outperform the state of the art on both the recommendation task based on ratings and the sequence generation task based on content information.,True,P4G6H7oAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,86,https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00454,12054499124218516853,/scholar?cites=12054499124218516853,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00454,0,0,0

Usually link prediction methods use the link structures or node attributes as the sources of information. Recently. the relational topic model (RTM) and its variants have been proposed as hybrid methods that jointly model both sources of information and achieve very promising accuracy. However. the representations (features) learned by them are still not effective enough to represent the nodes (items). To address this problem. we generalize recent advances in deep learning from solely modeling iid sequences of attributes to jointly modeling graphs and non-iid sequences of attributes. Specifically. we follow the Bayesian deep learning framework and devise a hierarchical Bayesian model. called relational deep learning (RDL). to jointly model high-dimensional node attributes and link structures with layers of latent variables. Due to the multiple nonlinear transformations in RDL. standard variational inference is not applicable. We propose to utilize the product of Gaussians (PoG) structure in RDL to relate the inferences on different variables and derive a generalized variational inference algorithm for learning the variables and predicting the links.

1281111,An empirical evaluation of similarity measures for time series classification,2014,Joan Serrà and Josep Lluis Arcos,67,Knowledge-Based Systems,,305-314,,Time series are ubiquitous. and a measure to assess their similarity is a core part of many computational systems. In particular. the similarity measure is the most essential ingredient of time series clustering and classification systems. Because of this importance. countless approaches to estimate time series similarity have been proposed. However. there is a lack of comparative studies using empirical. rigorous. quantitative. and large-scale assessment strategies. In this article. we provide an extensive evaluation of similarity measures for time series classification following the aforementioned principles. We consider 7 different measures coming from alternative measure ‘families’. and 45 publicly-available time series data sets coming from a wide variety of scientific domains. We focus on out-of-sample classification accuracy. but in-sample accuracies and parameter choices are also discussed.

1281112,Music mood representations from social tags,2009,Cyril Laurier and Mohamed Sordo and Joan Serrà and Perfecto Herrera,,,,381-386,ISMIR,This paper presents findings about mood representations. We aim to analyze how do people tag music by mood. to create representations based on this data and to study the agreement between experts and a large community. For this purpose. we create a semantic mood space from last. fm tags using Latent Semantic Analysis. With an unsupervised clustering approach. we derive from this space an ideal categorical representation. We compare our community based semantic space with expert representations from Hevner and the clusters from the MIREX Audio Mood Classification task. Using dimensional reduction with a Self-Organizing Map. we obtain a 2D representation that we compare with the dimensional model from Russell. We present as well a tree diagram of the mood tags obtained with a hierarchical clustering approach. All these results show a consistency between the community and the experts as well as some limitations of current expert models. This study demonstrates a particular relevancy of the basic emotions model with four mood clusters that can be summarized as: happy. sad. angry and tender. This outcome can help to create better ground truth and to provide more realistic mood classification algorithms.

Given that a cover may differ from the original song in timbre. tempo. structure. key. arrangement. or language of the vocals. automatically identifying cover songs in a given music collection is a rather difficult task. The music information retrieval (MIR) community has paid much attention to this task in recent years and many approaches have been proposed. This chapter comprehensively summarizes the work done in cover song identification while encompassing the background related to this area of research. The most promising strategies are reviewed and qualitatively compared under a common framework. and their evaluation methodologies are critically assessed.

Some recent works. however. have shown that it is possible to derive useful speech representations by employing a self-supervised encoder-discriminator approach. This paper proposes an improved self-supervised method. where a single neural encoder is followed by multiple workers that jointly solve different self-supervised tasks. The needed consensus across different tasks naturally imposes meaningful constraints to the encoder. contributing to discover general representations and to minimize the risk of learning superficial ones. Experiments show that the proposed approach can learn transferable. robust. and problem-agnostic features that carry on relevant information from the speech signal. such as speaker identity. phonemes. and even higher-level features such as emotional cues. In addition. a number of design choices make the encoder easily exportable. facilitating its direct usage or adaptation to different problems.,True,sZLj96sAAAAJ:kvJssbFybhEC,88,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03416,8124572089777218359,/scholar?cites=8124572089777218359,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03416,0,0,0

Given the audio signal of a song. we compute descriptors representing its melody. bass line and harmonic progression using state-of-the-art algorithms. These descriptors are then employed to retrieve different versions of the same musical piece using a dynamic programming algorithm based on nonlinear time series analysis. First. we evaluate the accuracy obtained using individual descriptors. and then we examine whether performance can be improved by combining these music representations (i.e. descriptor fusion).

Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks. they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box. not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision.

Ensuring such robustness to variability is a challenge in modern day neural network-based ASR systems. especially when all types of variability are not seen during training. We attempt to address this problem by encouraging the neural network acoustic model to learn invariant feature representations. We use ideas from recent research on image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks and domain adaptation ideas extending adversarial gradient-based training. A recent work from Ganin et al. proposes to use adversarial training for image domain adaptation by using an intermediate representation from the main target classification network to deteriorate the domain classifier performance through a separate neural network. Our work focuses on investigating neural architectures which produce representations invariant to noise conditions for ASR. We evaluate the proposed architecture on the Aurora-4 task. a popular benchmark for noise robust ASR.

However a known weakness is a failure to perform well when evaluated on data which differ from the training distribution. even if these differences are very small. as is the case with adversarial examples. We propose Fortified Networks. a simple transformation of existing networks. which fortifies the hidden layers in a deep network by identifying when the hidden states are off of the data manifold. and maps these hidden states back to parts of the data manifold where the network performs well. Our principal contribution is to show that fortifying these hidden states improves the robustness of deep networks and our experiments (i) demonstrate improved robustness to standard adversarial attacks in both black-box and white-box threat models;(ii) suggest that our improvements are not primarily due to the gradient masking problem and (iii) show the advantage of doing this fortification in the hidden layers instead of the input space.,True,PsKlNzUAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,33,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02485,11853519139612639286,/scholar?cites=11853519139612639286,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02485,0,0,0

Examples of such loss functions include the classification error. the edit distance and the BLEU score. A common workaround for this problem is to instead optimize a emph {surrogate loss} function. such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge loss. In order for this remedy to be effective. it is important to ensure that minimization of the surrogate loss results in minimization of the task loss. a condition that we call emph {consistency with the task loss}. In this work. we propose another method for deriving differentiable surrogate losses that provably meet this requirement. We focus on the broad class of models that define a score for every input-output pair. Our idea is that this score can be interpreted as an estimate of the task loss. and that the estimation error may be used as a consistent surrogate loss. A distinct feature of such an approach is that it defines the desirable value of the score for every input-output pair. We use this property to design specialized surrogate losses for Encoder-Decoder models often used for sequence prediction tasks. In our experiment. we benchmark on the task of speech recognition. Using a new surrogate loss instead of cross-entropy to train an Encoder-Decoder speech recognizer brings a significant~ 13% relative improvement in terms of Character Error Rate (CER) in the case when no extra corpora are used for language modeling.,True,PsKlNzUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,27,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06456,14698751936798182636,/scholar?cites=14698751936798182636,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06456,0,0,0

POLinSAR,,1-9,,This paper presents a new spectral clustering algorithm. which is specially tailored for segmentation of polarimetric SAR images. This is accomplished by use of certain pairwise distance measures between pixels. The measures are derived from the complex Wishart distribution. and capture the statistical information contained in the coherency matrix. We demonstrate how the pairwise distances are transformed into an affinity matrix. whose eigendecomposition determines the optimal partitioning of pixels. We further show that the obtained clustering provides an improved initialization of the classical unsupervised Wishart classifier. and that the entire classification can also be performed in a kernel induced feature space.

In this paper. we propose a spectral clustering based mode merging method for mean shift as a theoretically well-founded approach that enables a probabilistic interpretation of affinity based clustering through kernel density estimation.

The traditional theory of altruism makes a strong prediction concerning the form that such a transfer would take: whenever possible the transfer should be given in cash rather than in kind. The logic of the prediction is simple. A tied transfer places a constraint on the affordable market baskets of the recipient which would not be present if the transfer were given in cash. Since in the traditional theory of altruism the altruist cares about the utility of the recipient and not the composition of his market basket. it would seem that the altruist is never made worse off and perhaps could be made better off by making the transfer in cash rather than tying it in some way. Despite the appeal of this argument. even casual empiricism indicates that its prediction is refuted in many cases.

Most existing methods based on an encoder-decoder architecture simply concatenate features from earlier layers to obtain higher-frequency details in the refinement stages. However. there are limits to the quality of refinement possible if ambiguous information is passed forward. In this paper we propose Gated Feedback Refinement Network (G-FRNet). an end-to-end deep learning framework for dense labeling tasks that addresses this limitation of existing methods. Initially. G-FRNet makes a coarse prediction and then it progressively refines the details by efficiently integrating local and global contextual information during the refinement stages. We introduce gate units that control the information passed forward in order to filter out ambiguity. Experiments on three challenging dense labeling datasets (CamVid.

In this paper. we argue that work to date has addressed a problem that is relatively ill-posed. Specifically. there is not universal agreement about what constitutes a salient object when multiple observers are queried. This implies that some objects are more likely to be judged salient than others. and implies a relative rank exists on salient objects. The solution presented in this paper solves this more general problem that considers relative rank. and we propose data and metrics suitable to measuring success in a relative object saliency landscape. A novel deep learning solution is proposed based on a hierarchical representation of relative saliency and stage-wise refinement. We also show that the problem of salient object subitizing can be addressed with the same network. and our approach exceeds performance of any prior work across all metrics considered (both traditional and newly proposed).,True,Gnezf-4AAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,61,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Islam_Revisiting_Salient_Object_CVPR_2018_paper.html,16495643199912345592,/scholar?cites=16495643199912345592,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Islam_Revisiting_Salient_Object_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Growing the size of the neural network typically results in improved accuracy. As model sizes grow. the memory and compute requirements for training these models also increases. We introduce a technique to train deep neural networks using half precision floating point numbers. In our technique. weights. activations and gradients are stored in IEEE half-precision format. Half-precision floating numbers have limited numerical range compared to single-precision numbers. We propose two techniques to handle this loss of information. Firstly. we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of the weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step. This single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision format during training. Secondly. we propose scaling the loss appropriately to handle the loss of information with half-precision gradients. We demonstrate that this approach works for a wide variety of models including convolution neural networks. recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. This technique works for large scale models with more than 100 million parameters trained on large datasets. Using this approach. we can reduce the memory consumption of deep learning models by nearly 2x. In future processors. we can also expect a significant computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.,True,7BRYaGcAAAAJ:uWQEDVKXjbEC,519,https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740,18172749567892275222,/scholar?cites=18172749567892275222,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03740.pdf%EF%BC%89%E3%80%82,0,0,0
1281404,Scaling SGD Batch Size to 32K for ImageNet Training,2017,Yang You and Igor Gitman and Boris Ginsburg,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.03888,,,,"The most natural way to speed-up the training of large networks is to use dataparallelism on multiple GPUs. To scale Stochastic Gradient (SG) based methods to more processors. one need to increase the batch size to make full use of the computational power of each GPU. However. keeping the accuracy of network with increase of batch size is not trivial. Currently. the state-of-the art method is to increase Learning Rate (LR) proportional to the batch size. and use special learning rate with"" warm-up"" policy to overcome initial optimization difficulty. By controlling the LR during the training process. one can efficiently use largebatch in ImageNet training. For example. Batch-1024 for AlexNet and Batch-8192 for ResNet-50 are successful applications. However. for ImageNet-1k training. state-of-the-art AlexNet only scales the batch size to 1024 and ResNet50 only scales it to 8192. The reason is that we can not scale the learning rate to a large value. To enable large-batch training to general networks or datasets. we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS). LARS LR uses different LRs for different layers based on the norm of the weights (|| w||) and the norm of the gradients (||∇ w||). By using LARS algoirithm. we can scale the batch size to 32768 for ResNet50 and 8192 for AlexNet. Large batch can make full use of the system’s computational power. For example. batch-4096 can achieve 3× speedup over batch-512 for ImageNet training by AlexNet model on a DGX-1 station (8 P100 GPUs).",True,7BRYaGcAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,368,https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/techreports/ucb/text/EECS-2017-156.pdf,14890918634391387482,/scholar?cites=14890918634391387482,,,https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/techreports/ucb/text/EECS-2017-156.pdf,0,0,0

1281422,Composable planning with attributes,2018,Amy Zhang and Sainbayar Sukhbaatar and Adam Lerer and Arthur Szlam and Rob Fergus,,,,5842-5851,PMLR,The tasks that an agent will need to solve often are not known during training. However. if the agent knows which properties of the environment are important then. after learning how its actions affect those properties. it may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifically for them. Towards this end. we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest. We propose a method that learns a policy for transitioning between “nearby” sets of attributes. and maintains a graph of possible transitions. Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes. and a current state. our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan. and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan. We show in 3D block stacking. grid-world games. and StarCraft that our model is able to generalize to longer. more complex tasks at test time by composing simpler learned policies.,True,ri1sE34AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,34,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/zhang18k.html,14836553939348389093,/scholar?cites=14836553939348389093,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/zhang18k/zhang18k.pdf,0,0,0

These models include two consecutive modules. a feed-forward layer and a self-attention layer. The latter allows the network to capture long term dependencies and are often regarded as the key ingredient in the success of Transformers. Building upon this intuition. we propose a new model that solely consists of attention layers. More precisely. we augment the self-attention layers with persistent memory vectors that play a similar role as the feed-forward layer. Thanks to these vectors. we can remove the feed-forward layer without degrading the performance of a transformer. Our evaluation shows the benefits brought by our model on standard character and word level language modeling benchmarks.,True,ri1sE34AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,26,https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01470,1889083650525996475,/scholar?cites=1889083650525996475,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01470,0,0,0

The upper layer has one conditional RBM for learning temporal constraints on transitions between those compact representations. This separation of spatial and temporal learning makes it possible to reproduce many attractive dynamical behaviors such as walking by a stable limit cycle. a gait transition by bifurcation. synchronization of limbs by phase-locking. and easy top-down control.

We justify such approaches as ways to escape modes while keeping approximately the same asymptotic distribution of the Markov chain. In that spirit. we extend FPCD using an idea borrowed from Herding in order to obtain a pure sampling algorithm. which we call the rates-FPCD sampler. Interestingly. this sampler can improve the model as we collect more samples. since it optimizes a lower bound on the log likelihood of the training data.

Based on these insights. we introduce a new graph-based intermediate representation (IR) which specifically aims to efficiently support fully-general AD for array programming. Unlike existing dataflow programming representations in ML frameworks. our IR naturally supports function calls. higher-order functions and recursion. making ML models easier to implement. The ability to represent closures allows us to perform AD using ST without a tape. making the resulting derivative (adjoint) program amenable to ahead-of-time optimization using tools from functional language compilers. and enabling higher-order derivatives. Lastly. we introduce a proof of concept compiler toolchain called Myia which uses a subset of Python as a front end.,True,yVIXGqYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,30,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11530,11874990560582038809,/scholar?cites=11874990560582038809,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11530,0,0,0

We first justify such approaches as ways to escape modes while approximately keeping the same asymptotic distribution of the Markov chain. We then extend FPCD using an idea borrowed from Herding in order to obtain a pure sampling algorithm and show empirically that this FPCD-sampler yields substantially better samples than Gibbs sampling. Because these algorithms entangle the model and the sampling algorithm and we want to evaluate both (but particularly how well the sampling schemes mix). it is not always easy to evaluate them. so we propose a “black-box” approach based on how well and how quickly the samples generated by a model “cover” the test set examples.
