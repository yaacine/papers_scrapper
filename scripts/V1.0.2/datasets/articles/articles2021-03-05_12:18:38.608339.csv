1216596,Acetylcholine receptors and myasthenia,2000,Jon M Lindstrom,23,,4,453-477,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,Much progress has been made in the 26 years since initial studies of the first purified acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) led to the discovery that an antibody‐mediated autoimmune response to AChRs causes the muscular weakness and fatigability characteristic of myasthenia gravis (MG) and its animal model. experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG). Now. the structure of muscle AChRs is much better known. Monoclonal antibodies to muscle AChRs. developed as model autoantibodies for studies of EAMG. were used for initial purifications of neuronal AChRs. and now many homologous subunits of neuronal nicotinic AChRs have been cloned. There is a basic understanding of the pathological mechanisms by which autoantibodies to AChRs impair neuromuscular transmission. Immunodiagnostic assays for MG are used routinely. Nonspecific approaches to immunosuppressive therapy have been …,True,lLLiFvgAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC,377,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(200004)23:4%3C453::AID-MUS3%3E3.0.CO;2-O,1221216776515935531,/scholar?cites=1221216776515935531,,,0,0,0

The discovery of highly calcium selective channels. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) of the TRP superfamily. has clarified the nature of the calcium entry channels. It has been proposed that this channel mediates the critical Ca2+ entry step in transcellular Ca2+ re-absorption in the kidney. The regulation of transmembrane Ca2+ flux through TRPV5 is of particular importance for whole body calcium homeostasis.In this study. we provide evidence that the TRPV5 channel is present in rat cortical collecting duct (RCCD2) cells at mRNA and protein levels.

They mediate cell-cell fusion. resulting in the formation of a syncytium (the syncytiotrophoblast) at the fetomaternal interface. These genes have been found in all placental mammals in which they have been searched for. Cell-cell fusion is also pivotal for muscle fiber formation and repair. where the myotubes are formed from the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts into large multinucleated structures. Here we show. taking advantage of mice knocked out for syncytins. that these captured genes contribute to myoblast fusion. with a >20% reduction in muscle mass. mean muscle fiber area and number of nuclei per fiber in knocked out mice for one of the two murine syncytin genes. Remarkably. this reduction is only observed in males. which subsequently show muscle quantitative traits more similar to those of females. In addition. we show that syncytins also contribute to muscle repair after cardiotoxin-induced injury. with again a male-specific effect on the rate and extent of regeneration. Finally. ex vivo experiments carried out on murine myoblasts demonstrate the direct involvement of syncytins in fusion. with a >40% reduction in fusion index upon addition of siRNA against both syncytins. Importantly. similar effects are observed with primary myoblasts from sheep. dog and human. with a 20–40% reduction upon addition of siRNA against the corresponding syncytins.

Collection of data from two affected Sphynx cats and their relatives pointed out a single disease candidate region on feline chromosome C2. identified following a genome-wide SNP-based homozygosity mapping strategy. In that region. we further identified COLQ (collagen-like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase) as a good candidate gene. since COLQ mutations were identified in affected humans and dogs with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency leading to a synaptic form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). A homozygous c.1190G>A missense variant located in exon 15 of COLQ. leading to a C397Y substitution. was identified in the two affected cats. C397 is a highly-conserved residue from the C-terminal domain of the protein; its mutation was previously shown to produce CMS in humans. and here we confirmed in an affected Sphynx cat that it induces a loss of acetylcholinesterase clustering at the neuromuscular junction.

We found progressive changes in tubuloreticular and sarcolemmal membranes and mislocalized triads and mitochondria in skeletal muscle from animals deficient in HACD1. Furthermore. comparable membranous abnormalities in cultured HACD1-deficient myotubes provide additional evidence that these defects are a primary consequence of altered HACD1 expression. Our novel findings. including T-tubule dilatation and disorganization. associated with defects in this additional CNM-associated gene provide a definitive pathophysiologic link with these disorders. confirm that dogs deficient in HACD1 are relevant models. and strengthen the evidence for a unifying pathogenesis in CNMs via defective membrane trafficking and excitation-contraction coupling in muscle. These results build on previous work by determining further functional roles of HACD1 in muscle and provide new insight into the pathology and pathogenetic mechanisms of HACD1 CNM. Consequently. alterations in membrane properties associated with HACD1 mutations should be investigated in …,True,lLLiFvgAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,0,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1457273.pdf,,,,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1457273.pdf,0,0,0

Collection of data from two affected Sphynx cats and their relatives pointed out a single disease candidate region on feline chromosome C2. identified following a genome-wide SNP-based homozygosity mapping strategy. In that region. we further identified COLQ (collagen-like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase) as a good candidate gene. since COLQ mutations were identified in affected humans and dogs with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency leading to a synaptic form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). A homozygous c. 1190G\textgreaterA missense variant located in exon 15 of COLQ. leading to a C397Y substitution. was identified in the two affected cats. C397 is a highly-conserved residue from the C-terminal domain of the protein; its mutation was previously shown to produce CMS in humans. and here we confirmed in an affected Sphynx cat that it induces a loss of acetylcholinesterase clustering at the neuromuscular junction. Segregation of the c. 1190G\textgreaterA variant was 100% consistent with the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of the disorder in our cat pedigree; in addition. an affected. unrelated Devon Rex cat recruited thereafter was also homozygous for the variant.

It was originally found in the West African rainforest belt. and was introduced to the research community in the 1990s. The major strains thus far known include the Nigerian and Ivory Coast strains. However. due to its short history as an experimental animal. the genetic relationship among the various strains has not yet been clarified. and establishment of inbred strains has not yet been achieved. Since 2003 the Institute for Amphibian Biology (IAB). Hiroshima University has maintained stocks of multiple X. tropicalis strains and conducted consecutive breeding as part of the National BioResource Project. In the present study we investigated the inbreeding ratio and genetic relationship of four inbred strains at IAB. as well as stocks from other institutions. using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and mitochondrial haplotypes. Our results show successive reduction of heterozygosity in the genome of the IAB inbred strains. The Ivory Coast strains clearly differed from the Nigerian strains genetically. and three subgroups were identified within both the Nigerian and Ivory Coast strains. It is noteworthy that the Ivory Coast strains have an evolutionary divergent genetic background.

We named such structures “Flowers“ because the pattern observed on dot plots resembles a flower. We detected a total of 291 Flowers in the human genome. They were predominantly located in euchromatic regions. Flowers are gene-rich compared to the average gene density of the genome. Genes involved in systems receiving environmental information. such as immunity and detoxification. were overrepresented in Flowers. Within a Flower. the mean number of duplication units was approximately four. The maximum and minimum identities between homologs in a Flower showed different distributions; the maximum identity was often concentrated to 100% identity. while the minimum identity was evenly distributed in the range of 78% to 100%. Using a gene conversion detection test. we found frequent and/or recent gene conversion events within the tested Flowers. Interestingly. many of those converted regions contained protein-coding genes.

This boundary is generally placed between Akusekijima and Kodakarajima Islands of the Tokara Archipelago. and has been the subject of many biogeographic debates. However. despite being widely accepted. the position of the boundary is doubtful because of a lack of clear evidence. Here. to verify the definition and existence of the biogeographic boundary. we performed a documentary search and beta diversity analysis of multiple taxa. Our documentary search suggested that the Watase line (Tokara gap) should be put between Yakushima/Tanegashima and Amamioshima Islands. but recent references to it clearly deviate from its original definition. and that the placement of the boundary line between Akusekijima and Kodakarajima Islands is based on limited and biased evidence. Our beta diversity analyses found no common biogeographic boundary dividing the Tokara Archipelago into two realms. and showed that the beta diversity pattern of this region is explained by the areas and geographic distances of the islands in agreement with the general principles of island biogeography. The widespread misunderstanding of biogeography in this region could have been perpetuated by preconception and the citation of references without verification.

Since the 1950s Xenopus laevis in particular has been used by scientists in many fields for experiments. resulting in the development of various techniques such as microsurgery on early embryos. biosynthesis of gene-encoded protein in oocytes by mRNA injection. misexpression experiments by mRNA injection into embryos. gene knockdown studies by injection of morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotide into fertilized eggs. transgenesis by the I-SceI meganuclease method. and so on. In this paper we will introduce Xenopus tropicalis as an alternative experimental animal. It has a shorter generation time and smaller diploid genome. together with whole-genome sequence data.

Although several extensive molecular analyses have attempted to elucidate their subfamilial relationships. and correlate these with Mesozoic and Cenozoic continental drifts. consensus has not been reached. Further. generic level relationships have not been well investigated in some microhylid subfamilies. and therefore subfamilial affiliations of some genera are still unclear. To elucidate the phylogenetic positions of two mysterious Asian genera. Gastrophrynoides and Phrynella. and to better understand the trans-continental distributions of microhylid taxa. we performed molecular phylogenetic and dating analyses using the largest molecular dataset applied to these taxa to date. Six nuclear and two mitochondrial genes (approx. 8 kbp) were sequenced from 22 microhylid frog species representing eight subfamilies. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses could not fully elucidate the subfamilial relationships. suggesting a rapid radiation of these taxa between 85 and 66 million years ago.

The gene content. nucleotide composition. and codon usage of B. buergeri conformed to those of typical vertebrate patterns. However. due to an accumulation of lengthy repetitive sequences in the D-loop region. this species possesses the largest mitochondrial genome among all the vertebrates examined so far. Comparison of the gene organizations among amphibian species (Rana. Xenopus. salamanders and caecilians) revealed that the positioning of four tRNA genes and the ND5 gene in the mtDNA of B. buergeri diverged from the common vertebrate gene arrangement shared by Xenopus. salamanders and caecilians. The unique positions of the tRNA genes in B. buergeri are shared by ranid frogs. indicating that the rearrangements of the tRNA genes occurred in a common ancestral lineage of ranids and rhacophorids.

The phylogenetic relationships of the three major ranoid taxa (Natatanura.

Several molecular models for mitochondrial (mt) gene rearrangements have been proposed. but observational evidence has been insufficient to evaluate them. Furthermore. evolutionary trends in rearranged mt genes have not been well understood. To gain molecular and phylogenetic insights into these issues. we analyzed the mt genomes of four afrobatrachian species (Breviceps adspersus. Hemisus marmoratus.

It is difficult to analyze the neobatrachian mitochondrial (mt) genome due to accelerated nucleotide substitution rates and occasional gene rearrangements. To overcome these problems. we designed 15 PCR primers. These primers. together with two primers from a previous study. could amplify almost the entire mt genome in all neobatrachians tested (seven species from seven different families) without optimizing PCR conditions. Among the tested taxa. Trichobatrachus robustus (Arthroleptidae) and Hyperolius viridiflavus (Hyperoliidae) showed unique amplification patterns. suggesting occurrences of gene duplication and/or rearrangements in these mt genomes.,True,NYSXudsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,34,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/hsj/28/1/28_1_1/_article/-char/ja/,2690587142546396528,/scholar?cites=2690587142546396528,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Atsushi_Kurabayashi/publication/225302742_PCR_Primers_for_the_Neobatrachian_Mitochondrial_Genome/links/0912f4fd96049601cf000000.pdf,0,0,0

Although both genomes encode the typical 37 mt genes. the following unique features are observed: 1) the ND5 genes are duplicated in H. tigerinus that have completely identical sequences. whereas duplicated ND5 genes in E. hexadactylus possessed dissimilar substitutions; 2) duplicated control region (CR) in H. tigerinus has almost identical sequences whereas single control region (CR) was found in E. hexadactylus; 3) the tRNA-Leu (CUN) gene is translocated from the LTPF tRNA cluster to downstream of ND5-1 in H. tigerinus. and the tRNA-Pro gene is translocated from the LTPF tRNA cluster to downstream of CR in E. hexadactylus; 4) pseudo tRNA-Leu (CUN) and tRNA-Pro genes are observed in E. hexadactylus; and 5) two tRNA-Met genes are encoded in both species. as observed in the previously reported dicroglossid mt genomes. Almost all observed gene rearrangements in H. tigerinus and E. hexadactylus can be explained by the tandem duplication and random loss model. except translocation of tRNA-Pro in E. hexadactylus.

Three of them are listed as endangered species. To identify mitochondrial (mt) genes suitable for future population genetic analyses for endangered species. we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the mt genomes of 3 endangered Japanese Babina frogs. B. holsti. B. okinavana. and B. subaspera and 1 ranid frog Lithobates catesbeianus. The genes of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) and the control region (CR) were found to have high sequence divergences and to be usable for population genetics studies. At present. no consensus on the phylogenetic position of genus Babina has been reached. To resolve this problem. we performed molecular phylogenetic analyses with the largest dataset used to date (11.345 bp from 2 ribosomal RNA-and 13 protein-encoding genes) in studies dealing with Babina phylogeny. These analyses revealed monophyly of Babina and Odorrana. It is well known that mt gene rearrangements of animals can provide usable phylogenetic information. Thus. we also compared the mt gene arrangements among Babina species and other related genera. Of the surveyed species. only L. catesbeianus manifested typical neobatrachian-type mt gene organization. In the B. okinavana. an additional pseudogene of tRNA-His (trnH) was observed in the CR downstream region. Furthermore. in the B. holsti and B. subaspera. the trnH/nad5 block was translocated from its typical position to the CR downstream region. and the translocated trnH became a pseudogene.

Most of these are known from small type series collected from only a few localities. and consequently. many Sumatran Rhacophorus species are poorly understood. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). we investigated relationships among a group of Rhacophorus species from southern Sumatra. Our molecular analysis was based on a fragment of the 16S ribosomal subunit gene (16S) and included data derived from type specimens of two species endemic to Sumatra: R. barisani and R. catamitus. Our analyses of these data reveal that the only known female specimen of R. catamitus possesses a divergent 16S sequence compared to male specimens (8.82%; uncorrected “p” distance). Based on phylogenetic reconstructions. we found that this female specimen belongs to an unnamed taxon related to R. margaritifer from Java. Consequently. we remove the specimen from R. catamitus and describe it as R. bengkuluensis sp. nov.. a medium-sized slender tree frog with extensive brown hand webbing.

With the rapid changes of landscape. biodiversity is also changes in response to human impact; due to each organism have the specific interaction with certain environment. In this research. the assessment of insect order in the different landscape types was conducted using several method of trapping to understand the specific pattern of insect which are inhabited the landscape. The objectives of this research were monitored the Insect diversity. its ecological importance to agro-forestry ecosystem. and compare it with other forest type in this area. Another objective was determined the insect characteristic as the indicator of environmental quality on each land-use system (forest. agroforestry. plantation and monoculture). Monoculture agriculture has the largest number of Lepidoptera and Hemiptera order (herbivore insect dominated) while in agro-forest system has the largest number of Diptera and coleoptera order. Protected forest. plantation forest and agro-forestry showed the similar index number which shows the similar ecological services for the insect as their habitat.

Nowadays. species taxonomy is confronted with the challenge to fully incorporate new theory. methods and data from disciplines that study the origin. limits and evolution of species. Integrative taxonomy has been proposed as a framework to bring together these conceptual and methodological developments. Here we review perspectives for an integrative taxonomy that directly bear on what species are. how they can be discovered. and how much diversity is on Earth. We conclude that taxonomy needs to be pluralistic to improve species discovery and description. and to develop novel protocols to produce the much-needed inventory of life in a reasonable time. To cope with the large number of candidate species revealed by molecular studies of eukaryotes. we propose a classification scheme for those units that will facilitate the subsequent assembly of data sets for the formal description of new species under the Linnaean system. and will ultimately integrate the activities of taxonomists and molecular biologists.,True,N5WBppcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1373,https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-7-16,17161067527451218020,/scholar?cites=17161067527451218020,,https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-7-16,0,0,0

A C-terminal fragment of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) has been proposed as universal marker for this purpose among animals. Herein we present experimental evidence that the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene fulfills the requirements for a universal DNA barcoding marker in amphibians. In terms of universality of priming sites and identification of major vertebrate clades the studied 16S fragment is superior to COI. Amplification success was 100% for 16S in a subset of fresh and well-preserved samples of Madagascan frogs. while various combination of COI primers had lower success rates.COI priming sites showed high variability among amphibians both at the level of groups and closely related species. whereas 16S priming sites were highly conserved among vertebrates. Interspecific pairwise 16S divergences in a test group of Madagascan frogs were at a level suitable for assignment of larval stages to species (1–17%). with low degrees of pairwise haplotype divergence within populations (0–1%). We strongly advocate the use of 16S rRNA as standard DNA barcoding marker for vertebrates to complement COI. especially if samples a priori could belong to various phylogenetically distant taxa and false negatives would constitute a major problem.,True,N5WBppcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,629,https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-2-5,10528375277606274034,/scholar?cites=10528375277606274034,,https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-2-5,0,0,0

Madagascar. like other globally recognized biodiversity hot spots. has complex spatial patterns of endemism that differ among taxonomic groups. creating challenges for the selection of within-country priorities. We show. in an analysis of wide taxonomic and geographic breadth and high spatial resolution. that multitaxonomic rather than single-taxon approaches are critical for identifying areas likely to promote the persistence of most species.

At the same time. it is most likely that the number of amphibian species is highly underestimated. Recent DNA barcoding work has attempted to define a threshold between intra- and inter-specific genetic distances to help identify candidate species. In groups with high extinction rates and poorly known species boundaries. like amphibians. such tools may provide a way to rapidly evaluate species richness.MethodologyHere we analyse published and new 16S rDNA sequences from 60 frog species of Amazonia-Guianas to obtain a minimum estimate of the number of undescribed species in this region. We combined isolation by distance. phylogenetic analyses. and comparison of molecular distances to evaluate threshold values for the identification of candidate species among these frogs.Principal FindingsIn most cases. geographically distant populations belong to genetically highly distinct lineages that could be considered as candidate new species. This was not universal among the taxa studied and thus widespread species of Neotropical frogs really do exist. contrary to previous assumptions. Moreover. the many instances of paraphyly and the wide overlap between distributions of inter- and intra-specific distances reinforce the hypothesis that many cryptic species remain to be described. In our data set. pairwise genetic distances below 0.02 are strongly correlated with geographical distances. This correlation remains statistically significant until genetic distance is 0.05. with no such relation thereafter. This suggests that for higher distances allopatric and sympatric cryptic species prevail.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1532,2435-2442,The Royal Society,Amphibians are thought to be unable to disperse over ocean barriers because they do not tolerate the osmotic stress of salt water. Their distribution patterns have therefore generally been explained by vicariance biogeography. Here. we present compelling evidence for overseas dispersal of frogs in the Indian Ocean region based on the discovery of two endemic species on Mayotte. This island belongs to the Comoro archipelago. which is entirely volcanic and surrounded by sea depths of more than 3500 m. This constitutes the first observation of endemic amphibians on oceanic islands that did not have any past physical contact to other land masses.

We here review the terminology and variation of frog calls from a perspective of integrative taxonomy. and provide hands-on protocols for recording. analyzing. comparing. interpreting and describing these sounds. Our focus is on advertisement calls. which serve as premating isolation mechanisms and. therefore. convey important taxonomic information. We provide recommendations for terminology of frog vocalizations. with call. note and pulse being the fundamental subunits to be used in descriptions and comparisons. However. due to the complexity and diversity of these signals. an unequivocal application of the terms call and note can be challenging. We therefore provide two coherent concepts that either follow a note-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units of sound as notes. and their entirety as call) or a call-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units as call whenever they are separated by long silent intervals) in terminology. Based on surveys of literature. we show that numerous call traits can be highly variable within and between individuals of one species. Despite idiosyncrasies of species and higher taxa. the duration of calls or notes. pulse rate within notes. and number of pulses per note appear to be more static within individuals and somewhat less affected by temperature. Therefore. these variables might often be preferable as taxonomic characters over call rate or note rate. which are heavily influenced by various factors …,True,N5WBppcAAAAJ:j5aT6aphRxQC,317,https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/article/view/zootaxa.4251.1.1,952518398528866594,/scholar?cites=952518398528866594,,https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/article/view/zootaxa.4251.1.1,0,0,0

Using a newly developed set of reptile-specific primers for COI we present the first comprehensive study targeting the entire reptile fauna of the fourth-largest island in the world. the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar.   Methodology/Principal Findings Representatives of the majority of Madagascan non-avian reptile species (including Squamata and Testudines) were sampled and successfully DNA barcoded. The new primer pair achieved a constantly high success rate (72.7–100%) for most squamates. More than 250 species of reptiles (out of the 393 described ones; representing around 64% of the known diversity of species) were barcoded. The average interspecific genetic distance within families ranged from a low of 13.4% in the Boidae to a high of 29.8% in the Gekkonidae. Using the average genetic divergence between sister species as a threshold. 41–48 new candidate (undescribed) species were identified. Simulations were used to evaluate the performance of DNA barcoding as a function of completeness of taxon sampling and fragment length. Compared with available multi-gene phylogenies. DNA barcoding correctly assigned most samples to species. genus and family with high confidence and the analysis of fewer taxa resulted in an increased number of well supported lineages. Shorter marker-lengths generally decreased the number of well supported nodes. but even mini-barcodes of 100 bp correctly assigned many samples to genus and family.

The observed increase in species numbers. over 25 percent in 11 years. is largely due to the intensified exploration of tropical areas and the application of more efficient techniques such as bioacoustics and molecular genetics. rather than to the elevation of subspecies to species rank or the distinction of species that were formerly considered synonymous. In the mantellid frogs of Madagascar. the many species newly described between 1992 and 2004 were as genetically divergent as those described in previous research periods. and most had not been collected previously. corroborating the lack of “taxonomic inflation” in this vertebrate class.

Where more than one interpretation is possible. it is desirable but difficult to assess the alternatives in an objective manner. The present work demonstrates a formalized method for testing molecular clock calibrations and biogeographic scenarios based on them. We assessed the plausibility of several previously published biogeographic hypotheses. using the frog genera Alytes. Discoglossus. and Bombina as model groups. Our data set comprised ca. 900 bp of partial mitochondrial 16S and 12S rRNA gene sequences (both genes evolved in a clock-like manner across genera) from nearly all the species and subspecies in the three genera.

1216782,Pooling skin swabs does not inhibit qPCR detection of amphibian chytrid infection,2019,Joana Sabino-Pinto and An Martel and Frank Pasmans and Sebastian Steinfartz and Miguel Vences,14,PloS one,4,e0214405,Public Library of Science,Immediate and reliable pathogen detection in large numbers of samples is essential in wildlife disease monitoring and is often realized by DNA-based techniques. Pooling samples increases processing efficiency and reduces processing costs. and has been suggested as a viable technique for quantitative PCR detection of fungal amphibian pathogens of the genus Batrachochytrium. For these fungi. this diagnostic method has been validated by in vitro set ups that provided controlled test conditions but did not take into account potential effects from amphibian skin compounds (e.g. skin secretions and Microbiota) on the approach. Some of these skin compounds are known to cause PCR inhibition in single sample applications and could lead to false negative reactions and thereby hamper pathogen detection. In this study we examined the effect of skin compounds on the pooled extraction method by swabbing individuals of seven amphibian species (one Anura and six Caudata) prior to the inoculation of the swabs with chytrid zoospores. For each species. swabs were extracted in pools of different sizes (from one to four swabs) with only one swab per pool being inoculated with zoospores. There were no significant differences regarding the ability to detect zoospores when comparing pool sizes for any species. with a tendency for more false negatives when the inoculated swab had been inoculated with a single zoospore. This study provides further in vivo evidence for the viability of the pooled extraction method for DNA-based detection of pathogens.,True,2NDKMF0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214405,14089476106223128492,/scholar?cites=14089476106223128492,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0214405,0,0,0

Amphibians have been globally threatened by the still expanding infectious disease. chytridiomycosis. Madagascar is an amphibian biodiversity hotspot where Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has only recently been detected. While no Bd-associated population declines have been reported. the risk of declines is high when invasive virulent lineages become involved. Cutaneous bacteria contribute to host innate immunity by providing defense against pathogens for numerous animals. including amphibians. Little is known. however. about the cutaneous bacterial residents of Malagasy amphibians and the functional capacity they have against Bd. We cultured 3179 skin bacteria from over 90 frog species across Madagascar. identified them via Sanger sequencing of approximately 700 bp of the 16S rRNA gene. and characterized their functional capacity against Bd. A subset of isolates was also tested against multiple Bd genotypes. In addition. we applied the concept of herd immunity to estimate Bd-associated risk for amphibian communities across Madagascar based on bacterial antifungal activity. We found that multiple bacterial isolates (39% of all isolates) cultured from the skin of Malagasy frogs were able to inhibit Bd. Mean inhibition was weakly correlated with bacterial phylogeny. and certain taxonomic groups appear to have a high proportion of inhibitory isolates. such as the Enterobacteriaceae.

One proven and ecologically sound best management practice in sugarcane is application of silicon to mitigate for both biotic and abiotic stresses. It has been proved that silicon can enhance resistance of sugarcane against stalk borers. Also. new hypothesis suggests that silicon may increase attraction of biological control agents to infested plants.

Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). is one of the most destructive pests attacking stored grain products all over the world. Serious problems assossiated with using synthetic chemical insecticides have strongly demonstrated the need for applying alternative safe compounds such as plant essential oils. The present experiment was conducted to evaluate fumigant toxicity of essential oils from the fresh fruit peel of two Citrus species namely. Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck and Citrus paradisi (Macfarlane) against 1 to 7-days-old adults of T. castaneum under laboratory conditions. Moreover. oviposition deterrence activity of sublethal concentrations of the oils were assessed on the female beetles. All experiments were carried out at 27±1 C and 65±5% rh in darkness. Findings indicated the high fumigant toxicity of both essential oils. According to probit analysis. there was no significant differences between C. sinensis (LC50= 7.27 µl. l-1 air) and C. paradisi (LC50= 7.70 µl. l-1 air) essential oils.

If evening primrose wants to be cultivated as an annual plant. sowing time is important. By the late sowing and depends to time most plants do not produce flower stem and stay in rosette stage until next spring. To solve this problem. the present study was performed. Seedling were transplanted to 4 kg plastic pots containing a mixture of leaf compost: local soil: perlite (1: 2: 1 ratio) and placed in outdoor conditions. Non-vernalized plants were then selected and treated with different temperature regimes (1. 2 and 3 weeks in 4-6ºC) and gibberellic acid (GA3) application in different concentrations of 0. 500. 1000. 2000 ppm. separately. The results showed that although some physiological parameters were affected by low temperature. no flower stem was produced. In contrast. plants that were treated with GA3 produced flower stem. Time of flowering and the number of flowers were significantly affected by the concentrations of applied GA3. Although yield components of GA3 induced plants were higher than that of normal growth plant. the seed yield of them was low. Surprisingly. the gamma linolenic acid (GLA) percentage of seed oil of plants treated with 2000 ppm GA3 was significantly higher than that of non-treated plants. Finally. it can be concluded that. although the application of GA3 guarantees delayed sowing evening primrose flowering and better GLA production. but low seed yield is a subject that cannot be easily ignored in production.,True,HwUEiCoAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,1,http://ijpp.iau-saveh.ac.ir/article_532386.html,9286336730821664358,/scholar?cites=9286336730821664358,,http://ijpp.iau-saveh.ac.ir/article_532386_bb5702efa9f79ee936bd01448198ccfe.pdf,0,0,0

March 2020/Available online: 30. March 2020/Printed: December 2020 Abstract. The Ichneumonidae. one of the largest insect families. includes beneficial insects parasitizing several pests. Due to the geographic and climatic varability of Iran. a great Ichneumonidae diversity may be expected. but our knowledge about fauna and biodiversity of this family in Iran is still insufficient. with only a few sporadic biodiversity studies on Iranian ichneumonids. This paper examines the alpha diversity. species evenness. species richness and beta diversity of the Ichneumonid parasitoid wasp assemblages in Golestan Province. northeastern Iran with an emphasis on the two largest Ichneumonid subfamilies: Cryptinae and Ichneumoninae. The spatial diversity of Ichneumonidae in two consecutive years was studied in three habitats: forest. rangeland and orchards. A total of 336 specimens representing 62 genera and 97 species were collected and identified. The forest sites (Shast kalate and Tuskestan) and rangeland sites (Chahar bagh and Souz javal) were found to be more diverse than orchard sites (Kordkuy and Garmabdasht). but the lowest species evenness was observed in the latter. The highest species richness was found in rangeland. the highest similarity between the two forest sites. and the lowest similarity between Kordkuy (orchard) and Chaharbagh (rangeland). Of all individuals collected. 32.7% and 67.3% were female and male. respectively.

However. the discard mortality (DM) rate of cod released in the recreational fishery remains poorly understood. thus contributing to the uncertainty in stock assessments and fishery management plans. The current study examined the capture-related factors most detrimental to cod DM in the GOM recreational rod-and-reel fishery.

The data model relies on an exponentially compound Poisson process. also called the law of leaks (LOL). It represents the process of sampling resources that are spatially distributed as Poisson distributed patches. each containing a certain quantity of biomass drawn from an exponential distribution. In an application of the LOL. two latent structures are proposed to account for spatial dependencies between zero values at different scales within a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The LOL is compared to the delta-gamma (ΔΓ) distribution using bottom-trawl survey data. Results of this case study emphasize that the LOL provides slightly better fits to learning samples with a very high proportion of zero values and small strictly positive abundance data.

Larvae were reared from hatch to metamorphosis in 3 separate temperature treatments. Temperature influenced the location and distribution of individual transition ages and lengths of larvae reared in separate aquaria. mainly due to its role in determining the mean and range of individual growth rates. Individual metamorphic ages were negatively correlated with the average growth rate of larvae. Individual metamorphic lengths generally increased as mean individual growth rates increased. but higher mean growth also resulted in a wider diversity of lengths.

One of these chemical substance groups are pesticides. Pesticides have been an essential part of agriculture to protect crops and livestock from pest infestations and yield reduction for many decades. Despite their usefulness. pesticides could pose potential risks to food safety. the environment. and all living things. Concern about the environmental impact of repeated pesticide use has prompted research into the environmental fate of these agents. which can emigrate from treated fields to air. other land. and water bodies. The importance of agricultural pesticides for developing countries is undeniable. However. the issue of human health and environmental risks has emerged as a key problem for these countries in accordance to a number of studies. In the last five decades. pesticide usages increased the quantity and improved the quality of food. However. with the increasing amounts of their usage. concern about their adverse effects on nontarget organisms. including human beings. has also grown. The purpose of this publication is to explain the nature of pesticides and their history. classification. risks. and effects on health and the environment.,True,Kgz8CtQAAAAJ:eq2jaN3J8jMC,75,https://cwww.intechopen.com/books/environmental-health-risk-hazardous-factors-to-living-species/pesticides-environmental-pollution-and-health,17110052567932482671,/scholar?cites=17110052567932482671,,https://cwww.intechopen.com/books/environmental-health-risk-hazardous-factors-to-living-species/pesticides-environmental-pollution-and-health,0,0,0

The present study aims to determine SSIs related research trends via content analyses of the articles published from 2004 to 2015 in five selected science education journals (SE. JRST. S&E. IJSE and RSE). Therefore. first. five journals with the highest impact factor were selected. Then. SSIs related papers were determined using electronic database search and thus 122 SSIs related articles were analyzed to determine trends in timeline. research types. related research topics. and research sample groups. The results show that SSIs related articles increased steadily leading to a peak in 2012 with the highest publishing rate in IJSE. Most of the SSIs related research employed qualitative methods. The highest rate of SSIs related qualitative studies was determined in IJSE (50.00%). and the lowest in S&E (3.57%). However quantitative methods were employed the least. In the relevant SSIs related research published about argumentation. decision-making. and informal reasoning were the most frequent SSIs related topics. The most studied research sample groups consisted of junior and senior high school students. Preschoolers were not among the sample groups.

The highest inhibitory activity was determined against Candida glabrata RSKK 04019 [25±1 mm. inhibition zone diameter]. On the other hand. the lowest inhibitory activity was determined against Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Bacillus subtilis RSKK 244 [10±1 and 10±0 mm. inhibition zone diameter]. DPPH radical scavenging effect was detected in the methanol extract [IC 50= 3.82±0.04 µg/mL] was higher than the ethanol extracts [IC 50= 7.03±0.07 µg/mL]. Compared to reference antioxidant. the methanol and ethanol extracts of G. lucidum provided a lower IC 50 than butylated hydoxyanisole [BHA][IC 50= 0.30±0.01 µg/mL].

Upon the initial block-wise background subtraction. k-means clustering is used to enable the segmentation of single persons in the scene. The number of people in the scene is estimated as the maximal number of clusters with acceptable inter-cluster separation. Tracking of segmented people is addressed as a problem of dynamic cluster assignment between two consecutive frames and it is solved in a greedy fashion. Systems for people counting are applied to people surveillance and management and lately within the ambient intelligence solutions.

Since bounding-box-level ground truth is not available. most of the solutions proposed so far are based on an iterative. Multiple Instance Learning framework in which the current classifier is used to select the highest-confidence boxes in each image. which are treated as pseudo-ground truth in the next training iteration. However. the errors of an immature classifier can make the process drift. usually introducing many of false positives in the training dataset. To alleviate this problem. we propose in this paper a training protocol based on the self-paced learning paradigm.

The present paper investigates the security aspects of the CHNN-based cryptosystem. and the following weaknesses are pointed out: 1) the cryptosystem is not sufficiently secure against the ciphertext-only attacks due to the weak randomness properties of the generated keystream. and 2) the cryptosystem is insecure against known/chosen-plaintext attacks and only one known plaintext-ciphertext pair is enough to completely break all ciphertexts of the same or smaller size obtained using the same encryption keys. The security of CHNN-based cryptosystem cannot be improved unless the basic model is fundamentally changed.,True,lgc4lkkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,18,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1073170.1073184,13034501483128872271,/scholar?cites=13034501483128872271,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.125.9081&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Metallic implants such as dental fillings cause severe streaking artifacts which significantly degrade the quality of CT images. In this paper. we propose a new method for metal-artifact reduction using complementary magnetic resonance (MR) images. The method exploits the possibilities which arise from the use of emergent trimodality systems. The proposed algorithm corrects reconstructed CT images. The projected data which is affected by dental fillings is detected and the missing projections are replaced with data obtained from a corresponding MR image. A simulation study was conducted in order to compare the reconstructed images with images reconstructed through linear interpolation. which is a common metal-artifact reduction technique. The results show that the proposed method is successful in reducing severe metal artifacts without introducing significant amount of secondary artifacts.,True,lgc4lkkAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,11,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/524243/abs/,7739341708213089394,/scholar?cites=7739341708213089394,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/524243/abs/,0,0,0

Balearic Islands (Illes Balears) included. By the end of 2018 a total of 30834 records were compiled. These belong to 1493 species. 282 of those endemic to the peninsula. across 56 families and 402 genera. This represents an increase of approximately 14% in the number of species in the last nine years. From all families found in the Iberian Peninsula. Araneidae represent the highest number of records (3315). Linyphiidae the highest species richness (302) and Dysderidae the highest endemic richness (58). When considering only the 2010 decade. Linyphiidae lead in both number of records (1417) and species (49). but Gnaphosidae have the highest newly described endemic richness (18).

Data on foraging strategy. prey range. vertical stratification and circadian activity was collected for 108 families. Spider guilds were defined by hierarchical clustering. We searched for inconsistencies between family guild placement and the known guild of each species. Richness and abundance per guild before and after correcting guild placement were compared. as were the proportions of each guild and family between all possible pairs of sites. Functional diversity per site was calculated based on hierarchical clustering. Eight guilds were discriminated: (1) sensing. (2) sheet. (3) space. and (4) orb web weavers; (5) specialists; (6) ambush. (7) ground. and (8) other hunters. Sixteen percent of the species richness corresponding to 11% of all captured individuals was incorrectly attributed to a guild by family surrogacy; however. the correlation of uncorrected vs. corrected guilds was invariably high. The correlation of guild richness or abundances was generally higher than the correlation of family richness or abundances.

1217299,Measuring fractions of beta diversity and their relationships to nestedness: a theoretical and empirical comparison of novel approaches,2013,José C Carvalho and Pedro Cardoso and Paulo AV Borges and Dénes Schmera and János Podani,122,Oikos,,825-834,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Beta diversity and nestedness are central concepts of ecology and biogeography and evaluation of their relationships is in the focus of contemporary ecological and conservation research. Beta diversity patterns are originated from two distinct processes: the replacement (or turnover) of species and the loss (or gain) of species leading to richness differences. Nested distributional patterns are generally thought to have a component deriving from beta diversity which is independent of replacement processes.

In the present study. we investigated whether LPAI infection incurred ecological or physiological costs to migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in terms of body mass loss and staging time. and whether such costs could influence the likelihood for long-distance dispersal of the avian influenza virus by individual ducks. During the autumn migrations of 2002–2007. we collected faecal samples (n=10 918) and biometric data from mallards captured and banded at Ottenby. a major staging site in a flyway connecting breeding and wintering …,True,ubybCYkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,220,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2008.1501,13753939651223036277,/scholar?cites=13753939651223036277,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2679067/,0,0,0

By reviewing the existing literature for Anatidae (ducks. geese. and swans). we show that little is known about their ecology in spring. although some goose species are exceptions. Another general pattern is that the ecology of Anatidae at staging sites is particularly neglected. Existing studies tend to focus on questions dealing with acquisition of nutrient reserves. whereas almost nothing has been published about stopover habitats. time use. microhabitat use. foraging behaviour. food availability. food limitation. diet selection. and interspecific relationships.

Ltd.,Sexual dimorphism in body size has received increasing scientific interest during the past decade. In most of the papers on the subject. the magnitude of sexual size dimorphism is expressed as some conversion of body size ratio. There are several possible flaws in using such ratios. however. the most serious one concers the scaling of body size and size differences between sexes. Using ratios may easily lead to wrong conclusions. In this paper we emphasize some fallacies related to ratios and present a less biased method. based on residuals of linear regression.

For the mallard duck genomic data is limited. The mallard is. besides a species of large agricultural and societal importance. also the focal species when it comes to long distance dispersal of Avian Influenza. For large scale identification of SNPs we performed Illumina sequencing of wild mallard DNA and compared our data with ongoing genome and EST sequencing of domesticated conspecifics. This is the first study of its kind for waterfowl. More than one billion base pairs of sequence information were generated resulting in a 16× coverage of a reduced representation library of the mallard genome. Sequence reads were aligned to a draft domesticated duck reference genome and allowed for the detection of over 122.000 SNPs within our mallard sequence dataset. In addition. almost 62.000 nucleotide positions on the domesticated duck reference showed a different nucleotide compared to wild mallard. Approximately 20.000 SNPs identified within our data were shared with SNPs identified in the sequenced domestic duck or in EST sequencing projects. The shared SNPs were considered to be highly reliable and were used to benchmark non-shared SNPs for quality. Genotyping of a representative sample of 364 SNPs resulted in a SNP conversion rate of 99.7%.

It has been proposed that the virus is brought from the breeding grounds and transmitted to conspecifics during subsequent staging during migration. and so a better understanding of the natal origin of staging ducks is vital to deciphering the dynamics of viral movement pathways. Ottenby is an important stopover site in southeast Sweden almost halfway downstream in the major Northwest European flyway. and is used by millions of waterfowl each year. Here. mallards were captured and sampled for influenza A virus infection. and positive samples were subtyped in order to study possible links to the natal area. which were determined by a novel approach combining banding recovery data and isotopic measurements (δ2H) of feathers grown on breeding grounds. Geographic assignments showed that the core natal areas of studied mallards were in Estonia. southern and central Finland. and northwestern Russia. This study demonstrates a clear temporal succession of latitudes of natal origin during the course of autumn migration. We also demonstrate a corresponding and concomitant shift in virus subtypes. Acknowledging that these two different patterns were based in part upon different data. a likely interpretation worth further testing is that the early arriving birds with more proximate origins have different influenza A subtypes than the more distantly originating late autumn birds.

In a field experiment we tested the hypothesis that food abundance limits reproductive output in breeding dabbling ducks. Onto 10 oligotrophic lakes in northern Sweden we introduced one wing-clipped female mallard (Anas platyrhynchos L.. 1758) and a brood of 10 newly hatched ducklings. and survival was monitored for 24 days. Food was added ad libitum at five of the lakes. but not at the other five.

For investigating many questions of migration ecology it is crucial (1) to estimate the duration of stopover phases. and (2) to test whether animals of different groups differ in their stopover behavior. Using recent advances in capture–recapture statistics. we show how total stopover duration can be estimated from capture–recapture data. The probabilities of immigration are estimated and modeled by recruitment analysis and are converted into the time the animals spent at the stopover place before capture; the probabilities of emigration are estimated and modeled by survival analysis and are converted into the time the animals spent at the stopover place after capture.

Drawing a parallel with the corresponding single–state procedures. we present their singularities and show how the overall test can be decomposed into interpretable components. All theoretical developments are illustrated with an application to the now classical study of movements of Canada geese between wintering sites. Through this application. we exemplify how the interpretable components give insight into the data. leading eventually to the choice of an appropriate general model but also sometimes to the invalidation of the multistate models as a whole. The method for computing a corrective overdispersion factor is then mentioned.

We studied habitat use. time-budgets. home-range sizes. habitat selection. and movements based on spatial data collected with GPS devices attached to wild mallards trapped at an autumn stopover site in the Northwest European flyway. Sixteen individuals (13 males. 3 females) were followed for 15–38 days in October to December 2010. Forty-nine percent (SD = 8.4%) of the ducks' total time. and 85% of the day-time (SD = 28.3%). was spent at sheltered reefs and bays on the coast. Two ducks used ponds. rather than coast. as day-roosts instead. Mallards spent most of the night (76% of total time. SD = 15.8%) on wetlands. mainly on alvar steppe. or in various flooded areas (e.g. coastal meadows). Crop fields with maize were also selectively utilized. Movements between roosting and foraging areas mainly took place at dawn and dusk. and the home-ranges observed in our study are among the largest ever documented for mallards (mean = 6.859 ha; SD = 5.872 ha).

In this reply. we correct Sedinger and Herzog's misrepresentations of our 2004 paper and argue that our interpretations of the results published at that time have not been invalidated. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.,True,Iv7hIT4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jwmg.532,12323845331439164738,/scholar?cites=12323845331439164738,,,0,0,0
1217400,Ecological and genetic consequences of introductions of native species: the mallard as a model system,2012,Pär Söderquist,,,15,,,A species pattern of distribution and abundance can be caused both by natural forces and by humans or human activities. Dispersal caused by humans can in turn both be deliberate and involuntary. Most introduced non-native species. deliberately introduced or not. have negative effects on their new ecosystem in one way or another (Mack et al. 2000). Introducing new species but also relocating native species to a new area has been practiced ever since man learned how to cultivate crops and tame and domesticate animals. It is however during the last 500 years that most of all relocations and introductions have occurred (Mack et al. 2000).There are many reasons to why man deliberately relocates animals. For purely aesthetical reasons some birds. for example Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) and some trees. for example Horsechestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) have been introduced in parks all over the world. In conservation biology it is also a common practice to relocate species to enhance non-viable or weak populations. This can be done by a so called genetic rescue. for example to outbreed a small inbred Swedish populations of adder.(Vipera berus)(Madsen et al. 1996) or simply by increasing the breeding population with the help of captive breeding and restocking the population to larger and viable size. sometimes to permit harvest (see examples in Frankham et al.. 2010).,True,Iv7hIT4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,3,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/8572/1/Soderquist_P_120127.pdf,17379414952314722309,/scholar?cites=17379414952314722309,,https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/8572/1/Soderquist_P_120127.pdf,0,0,0

Genom uppfödning i fångenskap riskerar man att de farmade gräsänderna blir annorlunda gentemot de vilda. För att studera effekterna på den vilda populationen av dessa utsättningar startades 2010 ett doktorandprojekt finansierat av Naturvårdsverket. Projektet kom fram till att farmade änder skiljer sig i beteende och utseende mot de vilda. Det går även att genetiskt skilja på farmade och vilda gräsänder. Ett nytt projekt startades 2017 för att vidare studera effekter av utsättningar. nu även på miljön och den biologiska mångfalden där änderna sätts ut.

We tested whether bill morphology of free-living birds has changed since large-scale releases of farmed Mallards started. Three groups of Mallards from Sweden. Norway and Finland were compared: historical wild (before large-scale releases started). present-day wild. and present-day farmed. Higher density of bill lamellae was observed in historical wild Mallards (only males). Farmed Mallards had wider bills than present-day and historical wild ones. Present-day wild and farmed Mallards also had higher and shorter bills than historical wild Mallards. Present-day Mallards thus tend to have more ‘‘goose-like’’bills (wider. higher. and shorter) than their ancestors. Our study suggests that surviving released Mallards affect morphological traits in wild population by introgression. We discuss how such anthropogenic impact may lead to a maladapted and genetically compromised wild Mallard population.

These interactions and their outcomes are still relatively understudied. however. in wild populations and non-mammalian taxa. Using deep pyrosequencing. we described the cloacal microbiome (CM) composition in free living barn swallows Hirundo rustica. a long-distance migratory passerine bird. Barn swallow CM was dominated by bacteria of the Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla. Bacteroidetes. which represent an important proportion of the digestive tract microbiome in many vertebrate species. was relatively rare in barn swallow CM (< 5%). CM composition did not differ between males and females. A significant correlation of CM within breeding pair members is consistent with the hypothesis that cloacal contact during within-pair copulation may promote transfer of bacterial assemblages. This effect on CM composition had a relatively low effect size. however. possibly due to the species’ high level of sexual promiscuity.,True,8qVQYp0AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,56,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137401,12330182321034018022,/scholar?cites=12330182321034018022,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137401,0,0,0

In addition. we assess the anti‐predation function of the direct presence of an incubating parent on the nest for the first time in a ground‐nesting non‐passerine bird.  2 We compared predation rates of real mallard nests with two types of artificial clutches: (i) covered with nest material and (ii) uncovered.

Recent meta‐analyses suggest that direct costs to unfaithful females outweigh indirect benefits from infidelity in socially monogamous songbirds. suggesting that in this taxa. extrapair fertilization (EPF) evolved primarily as a self‐interest male tactic. Here we present results of comparative analysis to show that standardized selection gradients acting against female infidelity (direct costs of promiscuity) explain variation in EPF rates at an interspecific level in passerines. This result confirms that costs to females resulting from reduced parental care from cheated males constrain promiscuity in this group.

From an ecological and evolutionary perspective. inter-individual variation in host-associated microbiota contributes to physiological and immune system variation. As such. host-associated microbiota may be considered an integral part of the host’s phenotype. serving as a substrate for natural selection. This assumes that host-associated microbiota exhibits high temporal stability. however. and that its composition is shaped by trans-generational transfer or heritable host-associated microbiota modulators encoded by the host genome. Although this concept is widely accepted. its crucial assumptions have rarely been tested in wild vertebrate populations. We performed 16S rRNA metabarcoding on an extensive set of faecal microbiota samples from an insectivorous. long-distance migratory bird. the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Our data revealed clear differences in faecal microbiota among juveniles and adults as regards taxonomic and functional composition. diversity and co-occurrence network complexity.

In the latter case. food availability (waste rice. weed seeds or invertebrates) seems to be strongly influenced by post-harvest agricultural practices. This project aims at testing alternative post-harvest practices to the traditional burning-mowing in the Camargue in order to assess their consequences in terms of food availability and field use by wintering ducks. Different post-harvest treatments (flooding. burning. mowing. disking and their combinations) were conducted.  The amount of seeds (rice + weeds) available through time was assessed. from harvest in Sept-Oct until March. and duck use of these fields during the day and during the night was simultaneously monitored.

However. research in this field has gradually followed different paths on the two continents. American scientists have adopted a more applied perspective. often aiming at assessing the extent to which food requirements of waterfowl can be fulfilled in different habitats. and how management of these can increase carrying capacity. As opposed to this"" energetic"" approach. European scientists have rather framed their studies in a"" behavioral"" perspective. using waterfowl as model species for more theoretical approaches to foraging ecology. Consequently. while North American research has most often been carried out at the scale of waterfowl populations. the individual bird has more frequently been the scale of study in Europe. We present three examples of such European studies: first. a detailed analysis of the trade-offs made by dabbling ducks between foraging and anti-predator vigilance. leading to divergent strategies to face gradual food depletion during the winter. Second. we do a flyway-scale analysis of duck foraging needs and behavior. from Mediterranean wintering grounds to breeding sites in the Boreal. and point out the main hurdles faced by these birds across their annual cycle. Such detailed European studies can provide useful parameter values to fuel modern agent-based models of habitat use and carrying capacity developed in North America. hence cross-fertilizing the approaches on the two continents.

Using 2 approaches. intraspecific and comparative. we test the hypothesis that the contribution of EPFs to variance in male fitness increases with migration distance in north temperate songbirds. Using data on the genetic mating system of the scarlet rosefinch Carpodacus erythrinus. a long-distance migrant. we show that the number of extrapair mates and within-pair paternity are the most important components of variance in male reproductive success.

1217472,Sperm length variation as a predictor of extrapair paternity in passerine birds,2010,Jan T Lifjeld and Terje Laskemoen and Oddmund Kleven and Tomas Albrecht and Raleigh J Robertson,5,PLoS One,10,e13456,Public Library of Science,Background The rate of extrapair paternity is a commonly used index for the risk of sperm competition in birds. but paternity data exist for only a few percent of the approximately 10400 extant species. As paternity analyses require extensive field sampling and costly lab work. species coverage in this field will probably not improve much in the foreseeable future. Recent findings from passerine birds. which constitute the largest avian order (∼5 900 species). suggest that sperm phenotypes carry a signature of sperm competition. Here we examine how well standardized measures of sperm length variation can predict the rate of extrapair paternity in passerine birds.  Methodology/Principal Findings We collected sperm samples from 55 passerine species in Canada and Europe for which extrapair paternity rates were already available from either the same (n = 24) or a different (n = 31) study population. We measured the total length of individual spermatozoa and found that both the coefficient of between-male variation (CVbm) and within-male variation (CVwm) in sperm length were strong predictors of the rate of extrapair paternity. explaining as much as 65% and 58%. respectively. of the variation in extrapair paternity among species. However. only the CVbm predictor was independent of phylogeny. which implies that it can readily be converted into a currency of extrapair paternity without the need for phylogenetic correction.  Conclusion/Significance We propose the CVbm index as an alternative measure to extrapair paternity for passerine birds.

GmbH,In cryptically coloured birds. remaining on the nest despite predator approach (risk‐taking) may decrease the likelihood that the nest will be detected and current reproductive attempt lost. By contrast. flushing may immediately reveal the nest location to the predator. Escape decisions of incubating parents should therefore be optimized based on the risk‐to‐parent/cost of escape equilibrium. Animal prey may assess predation risk depending on a variety of cues. including the camouflage that vegetation provides against the predator. We examined interactive effects of nest crypsis and the current reproductive value of a clutch on flushing distances in incubating mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) approached by a human.

One of the most prominent models of sexual selection. the “good genes” model. emphasizes the indirect benefits of female preferences for male ornaments as indicators of a potential sire’s additive genetic quality. However. there is growing interest in non-additive sources of genetic quality and mate choice models for self-referential disassortative mating based on optimal levels of genetic dissimilarity. We reviewed the empirical evidence for genetic-complementarity-based female mate choice among birds. We found the evidence for such choice is mixed but in general against the genetic complementarity hypothesis. The lack of evidence for genetic complementarity in many birds may be due to an inability to make the fine distinctions among potential mates based on genes. possibly due to the …,True,cHLEdZUAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C,75,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10709-007-9219-5.pdf,949874836425143803,/scholar?cites=949874836425143803,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herman_Mays/publication/5873526_Female_choice_for_genetic_complementarity_in_birds_A_review/links/0912f51001bff2fe2f000000/Female-choice-for-genetic-complementarity-in-birds-A-review.pdf,0,0,0

Most previous studies have focused on host-microbiota interactions in captive-bred mammalian models. These interactions and their outcomes are still relatively understudied. however. in wild populations and non-mammalian taxa. Using deep pyrosequencing. we described the cloacal microbiome (CM) composition in free living barn swallows Hirundo rustica. a long-distance migratory passerine bird. Barn swallow CM was dominated by bacteria of the Actinobacteria. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla. Bacteroidetes. which represent an important proportion of the digestive tract microbiome in many vertebrate species. was relatively rare in barn swallow CM (< 5%). CM composition did not differ between males and females. A significant correlation of CM within breeding pair members is consistent with the hypothesis that cloacal contact during within-pair copulation may promote transfer of bacterial assemblages.

From an ecological and evolutionary perspective. inter-individual variation in host-associated microbiota contributes to physiological and immune system variation. As such. host-associated microbiota may be considered an integral part of the host’s phenotype. serving as a substrate for natural selection. This assumes that host-associated microbiota exhibits high temporal stability. however. and that its composition is shaped by trans-generational transfer or heritable host-associated microbiota modulators encoded by the host genome. Although this concept is widely accepted. its crucial assumptions have rarely been tested in wild vertebrate populations. We performed 16S rRNA metabarcoding on an extensive set of faecal microbiota samples from an insectivorous. long-distance migratory bird. the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Our data revealed clear differences in faecal microbiota among juveniles and adults as regards taxonomic and functional composition. diversity and co-occurrence network complexity.

However. because these exchanges can take multiple forms. assessing their significance in the functioning of the tundra food web is difficult. In this paper. we first review some important concepts related to resource exchanges between ecosystems and examine their relevance to the study of trophic interactions in the arctic tundra. An analysis of the Bylot Island food web in the Canadian Arctic using a mass-balance trophic model suggests that predators are the dominant force controlling this food web.

Robert May showed that. contrary to intuition. complex randomly built ecosystems are less likely to be stable than simpler ones. Few attempts have been tried to test May’s prediction empirically. and we still ignore what is the actual complexity–stability relationship in natural ecosystems. Here we perform a stability analysis of 116 quantitative food webs sampled worldwide. We find that classic descriptors of complexity (species richness. connectance and interaction strength) are not associated with stability in empirical food webs. Further analysis reveals that a correlation between the effects of predators on prey and those of prey on predators. combined with a high frequency of weak interactions. stabilize food web dynamics relative to the random expectation.

Roads and traffic greatly affect animals' mortality not only through habitat structure modifications but also through direct mortality owing to collisions. Although species are known to differ in their sensitivity to the risk of collision. whether individuals can change their behaviour in response to this is still unknown. Here. we tested whether common European birds changed their flight initiation distances (FIDs) in response to vehicles according to road speed limit (a known factor affecting killing rates on roads) and vehicle speed. We found that FID increased with speed limit. although vehicle speed had no effect.

The concentration of corticosterone (CORT) in feathers is an integrated measure of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal activity during the molting period. providing information on the total baseline and stress-induced CORT secreted during the period of feather growth. Common eiders and greater snow geese replace all flight feathers once a year during the pre-basic molt. which occurs following breeding. Thus. CORT contained in feathers of pre-breeding individuals sampled in spring reflects the total CORT secreted during the previous molting event. which may provide insight into the magnitude or extent of stress experienced during this time period.

Finally. we identified the different scavenger species that could potentially be exposed to lead by installing automatic cameras targeting moose gut piles. Blood lead concentration in ravens increased over time. indicating lead accumulation over the moose-hunting season. Using a contamination threshold of 100 µg.L−1. more than 50% of individuals were lead-contaminated during the moose hunting period. Lead concentration was twice as high in one year compared to the other. matching the number of rifle-shot moose in the area. Non-contaminated birds exhibited no ammunition isotope signatures. The isotope signature of the lead detected in contaminated ravens tended towards the signature from lead ammunition. We also found that black bears (Ursus americanus). golden eagles and bald eagles (Aquila chrysaetos and Haliaeetus leucocephalus. two species of conservation concern) scavenged heavily on moose …,True,KXa7_eEAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111546,8692504665098710531,/scholar?cites=8692504665098710531,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111546,0,0,0

The major limitation is that CORT production is stimulated by the stress associated with capture and handling. Measuring fecal CORT is one way to solve this problem because elevation of fecal CORT usually does not occur before 1–12 h after a stressful event in captive animals. However. the effect of capture and handling on fecal CORT levels has seldom been investigated in the wild.

1217529,Weeds for bees? A review,2015,Vincent Bretagnolle and Sabrina Gaba,35,,3,891-909,Springer Paris,Agricultural intensification has led to the decrease of the diversity of wild and domestic pollinators. For instance. honeybees declined by 59 % in 61 years in the USA. About 35 % of major crops in the world depend on pollination services. and 3–8 % of world crop production will disappear without pollinators. Indeed. pollination provides several ecosystem services such as enabling crop and honey productions. regulating weeds and other cultural services. Agricultural intensification has also decreased weed diversity by about 50 % in 70 years because massive herbicide sprays have reduced the competition between weeds and crops. Nevertheless. weeds are at the basis of agricultural foodwebs. providing food to many living organisms. In particular. weeds provide flowers for pollinating insects including honey and wild bees.

Further. they reduce markedly their activity when the light level increases. Moonlight avoidance might be a consequence of reduction in foraging profitability. as bioluminescent prey do not come to the sea surface on bright nights. Alternatively. petrels may avoid colonies during moonlit nights because of increased predation risk. We studied predation on petrels by Brown Skuas Catharacta antarctica lönnbergi at Kerguelen. and the  influence of moonlight on behaviour of both skuas and petrels. to test  the ‘predation risk’ hypothesis. On the study area. Brown  Skuas hunt at night and prey heavily upon the Blue Petrel Halobaena  caerulea and the Thin‐billed Prion Pachyptila belcheri.

AES include the preservation of semi-natural habitats such as grasslands. fallows. woodlots. hedgerows or set-aside field margins.

At our study sites. skua predation on nocturnal petrels was heavy. and concentrated particularly on a single species. the blue petrel. Halobaena caerulea. Using playback experiments. we showed that skuas can use male petrel calls as a cue for prey location and selection.

1217546,Reconciling pesticide reduction with economic and environmental sustainability in arable farming,2014,Martin Lechenet and Vincent Bretagnolle and Christian Bockstaller and François Boissinot and Marie-Sophie Petit and Sandrine Petit and Nicolas M Munier-Jolain,9,PloS one,6,e97922,Public Library of Science,Reducing pesticide use is one of the high-priority targets in the quest for a sustainable agriculture. Until now. most studies dealing with pesticide use reduction have compared a limited number of experimental prototypes. Here we assessed the sustainability of 48 arable cropping systems from two major agricultural regions of France. including conventional. integrated and organic systems. with a wide range of pesticide use intensities and management (crop rotation. soil tillage. cultivars. fertilization. etc.). We assessed cropping system sustainability using a set of economic. environmental and social indicators. We failed to detect any positive correlation between pesticide use intensity and both productivity (when organic farms were excluded) and profitability. In addition. there was no relationship between pesticide use and workload. We found that crop rotation diversity was higher in cropping systems with low pesticide use. which would support the important role of crop rotation diversity in integrated and organic strategies. In comparison to conventional systems. integrated strategies showed a decrease in the use of both pesticides and nitrogen fertilizers. they consumed less energy and were frequently more energy efficient. Integrated systems therefore appeared as the best compromise in sustainability trade-offs. Our results could be used to re-design current cropping systems. by promoting diversified crop rotations and the combination of a wide range of available techniques contributing to pest management.,True,8TZfEwsAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC,99,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097922,14385283098713272359,/scholar?cites=14385283098713272359,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097922,0,0,0

Life‐history theory predicts that this trait should be affected by reproductive trade‐offs so that the probability of future reproduction should depend on the current reproductive investment. However. breeding propensity is one of the most difficult parameters to estimate because nonbreeders are often absent from the breeding area. thereby requiring the inclusion of unobservable states in the analysis. We developed a new methodological approach by integrating a robust design sampling scheme within the multi‐event capture–recapture framework. Our new model accounted for uncertainty in state assignation while allowing for departure of individuals between secondary sampling occasions.

1217550,Investigating rates of hunting and survival in declining european lapwing populations,2016,Guillaume Souchay and Michael Schaub,11,PloS one,9,e0163850,Public Library of Science,Understanding effects of harvest on population dynamics is of major interest. especially for declining species. European lapwing Vanellus vanellus populations increased from the 1960s until the 1980s and declined strongly thereafter. About 400.000 lapwings are harvested annually and it is thus of high conservation relevance to assess whether hunting was a main cause for the observed changes in lapwing population trends. We developed a multi-event cause-specific mortality model which we applied to a long-term ring-recovery data set (1960–2010) of > 360.000 records to estimate survival and cause-specific mortalities. We found no temporal change in survival over the last 50 years for first-year (FY) and older birds (after first-year; AFY) originating from different ringing areas. Mean survival was high. around 0.60 and 0.80 for FY and AFY individuals. respectively. The proportion of total mortality due to hunting was <0.10 over the study period and the estimated proportion of harvested individuals (kill rate) was <0.05 in each year. Our result of constant survival indicates that demographic processes other than survival were responsible for the pronounced change in lapwing population trends in the 1980s. Our findings lend support to the hypothesis that hunting was not a significant contributor to the large-scale decline of lapwing populations. To halt the ongoing decline of European lapwing populations management should focus on life history stages other than survival (e.g. productivity). Further analyses are required to investigate the contribution of other demographic rates to the decline of lapwings and to identify the most efficient conservation …,True,mFKm9kAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,9,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163850,472956659786886022,/scholar?cites=472956659786886022,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163850,0,0,0
1217551,Variations in band reporting rate and implications for kill rate in Greater Snow Geese,2014,Guillaume Souchay and Olivier Gimenez and Gilles Gauthier and Roger Pradel,9,Avian Conservation and Ecology,1,,The Resilience Alliance,We assessed spatial and temporal variation in reporting probability of banded Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) shot by hunters in eastern North America and evaluated potential residual biases in kill rate estimation. Adult Greater Snow Geese were marked with reward (value: US $10. $20. $30. $50. and $100) and standard bands ($0. control) in the Canadian Arctic from 2003 to 2005. We used a spatially explicit multinomial model based on 200 direct recoveries from 4256 banded geese to estimate reporting rate and harvest rate. We found that reporting rate for standard bands varied over time whereas harvest rate was higher in Canada than in the US The reporting probability increased from 0.40±0.11 in the first year of the study to 0.82±0.14 and 0.84±0.13 the second and third years. respectively. Overall. these reporting rates are higher than two previous estimates for this population. which leads to lower estimates of kill rate. However. the large annual differences in reporting rates found in this study lead to uncertainty in the estimation of kill rate. We suggest that the increase in reporting rate in the last two year of the study may be due to the dissemination of information among hunters regarding the presence of reward bands on birds. resulting in increased reporting rate for all bands. This raises issues about the need to adequately inform the public in such large-scale studies to avoid undesirable temporal trends over the course of the study.RÉSUMÉNous avons déterminé la variabilité spatiale et temporelle de la probabilité de retourner des bagues de Grandes Oies des neiges (Chen caerulescens atlantica) récoltées par les …,True,mFKm9kAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,8,https://www.ace-eco.org/vol9/iss1/art1/,5317373539126107718,/scholar?cites=5317373539126107718,,https://www.ace-eco.org/vol9/iss1/art1/,0,0,0

Denmark. United Kingdom. Czech Republic. Sweden. Spain. Portugal. Germany. Italy. Finland and Latvia). sometimes at a very large scale as in France. where approximately 1.4 million Mallards are released each year (Mondain-Monval & Girard 2000. Champagnon 2011). Globally. more than 3 million Mallards are estimated to be released annually in Europe compared to an estimated population of 4.5 million pairs (BirdLife International 2004. Champagnon 2011). Restocking the Mallard population aims at increasing harvest opportunities more than increasing wild population size (Fog 1971). For this purpose. captivebred juvenile Mallards aged 3 to 12 weeks are released before the onset of the hunting season that occurs at the end of summer (third week-end of August in France; Champagnon 2011). The contribution of captive-bred individuals to the recipient wild population depends on their individual ability to survive and breed (Fisher 1930). Recent studies conducted on more than 10.000 Mallards ringed in Sweden and France showed a similar pattern for both countries. with approximately 25% of released Mallards being shot at their release area (with a large variation among sites likely due to a variable reporting rate by hunters; Legagneux et al. 2009.

1217561,Aspects non-canalisés de la dynamique de population de la grande oie des neiges: probabilités de reproduction et de survie juvénile,2013,Guillaume Souchay,,,,,,In long-lived species. an inverse relationship apparently exists between variability of demographic parameters and their elasticity (i.e. the relative contribution of a given parameter to the population growth rate). The environmental canalization theory has been proposed to explain such a relationship. Demographic parameters with the highest elasticity should have evolved in a way that reduces their variability in presence of environmental variations in order to optimize individual fitness and hence to maximize the population growth rate. To test this hypothesis in a given species. demographic parameters and their elasticity need to be accurately estimated. Using advanced capture-mark-recapture models. we estimated juvenile survival and breeding probabilities in the greater snow goose and we compared their variability to adult survival. the parameter with the highest elasticity. Our study showed that both juvenile survival rate and breeding propensity were highly variable. as expected. The juvenile survival probability varied in response to environmental conditions. with a strong impact of parasitism. An anthelmintic drug treatment applied to juveniles revealed a negative effect of intestinal parasites on survival of juvenile females but not males. which could be explained by a sex-differential investment in the immune system in growing individuals.

On this basis. we predict that many of the life-history (LH) responses observed in the context of host–parasite interactions should also be relevant in the context of cancer. Parasites are thought to affect LH traits of their hosts because of strong selective pressures like direct and indirect mortality effects favouring. for example. early maturation and reproduction. Cancer can similarly also affect LH traits by imposing direct costs and/or indirectly by triggering plastic adjustments and evolutionary responses. Here. we discuss how and why a LH focus is a potentially productive but under-exploited research direction for cancer research. by focusing our attention on similarities between infectious disease and cancer with respect to their effects on LH traits and their evolution.

Although this reasoning is fundamentally correct. in our opinion. it contains a potential risk of excessive adaptationism. potentially leading to the suggestion of complex adaptations that are unlikely to evolve among cancerous cells. For example. the ability of recognizing related conspecifics and adjusting accordingly behaviors as in certain free‐living species appears unlikely in cancer.

Conversely. far less attention has been paid to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife. Here. we focus on the case of game restocking. which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year. We conducted a 2-year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99%) infection rate caused by an H10N7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled. neither during the 2008/2009 nor the 2009/2010 hunting seasons. In 2010 infection rates ranged from 0 to 24% in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H10N7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly. H10N7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H10 and N7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence. transmission to mammals. or antiviral resistance in the H10N7 strain we identified.

This is of particular interest since pigs can be infected with both human and avian viruses; upon co-infection. they can act as a mixing vessel through reassortment. a mechanism that resulted in the emergence of the pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009.

Because of the rapidly increasing incidence of pathogens that have become resistant to all or nearly all available antibiotics. there is a need for a new generation of antimicrobials with a broad therapeutic range for specific applications against infections. Aedesin is a cecropin-like anti-microbial peptide that was recently isolated from dengue virus-infected salivary glands of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In the present study. we have refined the analysis of its structural characteristics and have determined its antimicrobial effects against a large panel of multidrug resistant bacterial strains. directly isolated from infected patients. Based the results from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis. Aedesin has a helix-bend-helix structure typical for a member of the family of α-helix anti-microbial peptides. Aedesin efficiently killed Gram-negative bacterial strains that display the most worrisome resistance mechanisms encountered in the clinic. including resistance to carbapenems. aminoglycosides. cephalosporins. 4th generation fluoroquinolones. folate inhibitors and monobactams. In contrast. Gram-positive strains were insensitive to the lytic effects of the peptide.

Understanding the rules driving the occurrence of cancers in the wild is currently expected to provide crucial insights into identifying how some species may have evolved efficient cancer resistance mechanisms. Recently the absence of correlation across species between cancer prevalence and body size (coined as Peto’s paradox) has attracted a lot of attention. Indeed. the disparity between this null hypothesis. where every cell is assumed to have an identical probability to undergo malignant transformation. and empirical observations is particularly important to understand. due to the fact that it could facilitate the identification of animal species that are more resistant to carcinogenesis than expected. Moreover it would open up ways to identify the selective pressures that may be involved in cancer resistance. However. Peto’s paradox relies on several questionable assumptions. complicating the interpretation of the divergence between expected and observed cancer incidences. Here we review and challenge the different hypotheses on which this paradox relies on with the aim of identifying how this null hypothesis could be better estimated in order to provide a standard protocol to study the deviation between theoretical/theoretically predicted and observed cancer incidence. We show that due to the disproportion and restricted nature of available data on animal cancers. applying Peto’s hypotheses at species level could result in erroneous conclusions. and actually assume the existence of a paradox.

However. in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) ringing studies suggest deviations from general migratory trends and traditions in waterfowl. Furthermore. surprisingly little is known about the population genetic structure of mallards. and studying it may yield insight into the spread of diseases such as Avian Influenza. and in management and conservation of wetlands. The study of evolution of genetic diversity and subsequent partitioning thereof during the last glaciation adds to ongoing discussions on the general evolution of waterfowl populations and flyway evolution. Hypothesised mallard flyways are tested explicitly by analysing mitochondrial mallard DNA from the whole northern hemisphere. Phylogenetic analyses confirm two mitochondrial mallard clades. Genetic differentiation within Eurasia and North-America is low. on a continental scale. but large differences occur between these two land masses (FST = 0.51). Half the genetic variance lies within sampling locations. and a negligible portion between currently recognised waterfowl flyways. within Eurasia and North-America. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) at continent scale. incorporating sampling localities as smallest units. also shows the absence of population structure on the flyway level. Finally. demographic modelling by coalescence simulation proposes a split between Eurasia and North-America 43.000 to 74.000 years ago and strong population growth (~100fold) since then and little migration (not statistically different from zero).

These AIVs are diverse in their natural hosts. harboring almost all possible viral subtypes2. Human pandemics of flu originally stem from AIVs3. Many fatal human cases during the H5N1 outbreaks in recent years were reported. Lately. a new AIV related strain swept through the human population. causing the 'swine flu epidemic'4. Although human trading and transportation activity seems to be responsible for the spread of highly pathogenic strains5. dispersal can also partly be attributed to wild birds6. 7. However. the actual reservoir of all AIV strains is wild birds. In reaction to this and in face of severe commercial losses in the poultry industry. large surveillance programs have been implemented globally to collect information on the ecology of AIVs. and to install early warning systems to detect certain highly pathogenic strains8-12. Traditional virological methods require viruses to be intact and cultivated before analysis. This necessitates strict cold chains with deep freezers and heavy biosafety procedures to be in place during transport. Long-term surveillance is therefore usually restricted to a few field stations close to well equipped laboratories. Remote areas cannot be sampled unless logistically cumbersome procedures are implemented. These problems have been recognised13. 14 and the use of alternative storage and transport strategies investigated (alcohols or guanidine)15-17. Recently.

Traditionally. several subspecies are recognised by morphology and mitochondrial haplotype. each linked to a relict population. During various reintroduction programs in the 20th century. beavers from multiple source localities were released and now form viable populations. These programs differed in their reintroduction strategies. i.e.. using pure subspecies vs. mixed source populations. This inhomogeneity in management actions generated ongoing debates regarding the origin of present beaver populations and appropriate management plans for the future. By sequencing of the mitochondrial control region and microsatellite genotyping of 235 beaver individuals from five selected regions in Germany. Switzerland. Luxembourg. and Belgium we show that beavers from at least four source origins currently form admixed. genetically diverse populations that spread across the study region. While regional occurrences of invasive North American beavers (n = 20) were found. all but one C. fiber bore the mitochondrial haplotype of the autochthonous western Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU). Considering this. as well as the viability of admixed populations and the fact that the fusion of different lineages is already progressing in all studied regions. we argue that admixture between different beaver source populations should be generally accepted.,True,NlEMCkgAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097619,9515675903328020122,/scholar?cites=9515675903328020122,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097619,0,0,0

In the last decade. the toolkit for studying introgression has expanded together with the development of molecular markers. In this review. we explore how genomic data. the most recent step in this methodological progress. impacts different aspects in the study of avian introgression. First. the detection of hybrids and backcrosses has improved dramatically. The most widely used software package is STRUCTURE. Phylogenetic discordance (i.e. different loci resulting in discordant gene trees) is another means for the detection of introgression. although it should be regarded as a starting point for further analyses. not as a definitive proof of introgression. Specifically. disentangling introgression from other biological processes. such as incomplete lineage sorting. remains a challenging endeavour. although new techniques. such as the D-statistic. are being developed. In addition. phylogenetics might require a shift from trees to networks. Second. the study of hybrid zones by means of geographical or genomic cline analysis has led to important insights into the complex interplay between hybridization and speciation. However. because each hybrid zone study is just a single snapshot of a complex and continuously changing interaction. hybrid zones should be studied across different temporal and/or spatial scales.

This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast. effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes.

However. in case of bats. information on local species assemblies is frequently limited especially in regions with high biodiversity such as the Neotropics.

We used a multi-method approach based on molecular. morphometric and acoustic information collected from 962 individuals of Molossus bondae. M. coibensis. and M. molossus captured in Panama. We distinguished M. bondae based on size and pelage coloration. We identified two robust species clusters composed of M. molossus and M. coibensis based on 18 microsatellite markers but also on a more stringently determined set of four markers. Phylogenetic reconstructions using the mitochondrial gene co1 (DNA barcode) were used to diagnose these microsatellite clusters as M. molossus and M. coibensis. To differentiate species. morphological information was only reliable when forearm length and body mass were combined in a linear discriminant function (95.9% correctly identified individuals).

One approach to reduce genome complexity. i.e. investigating only parts of the genome. is reduced-representation library (RRL) sequencing. Like similar approaches. RRL sequencing reduces ascertainment bias due to simultaneous discovery and genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and does not require reference genomes. Yet. generating such datasets remains challenging due to laboratory and bioinformatical issues. In the laboratory. current protocols require improvements with regards to sequencing homologous fragments to reduce the number of missing genotypes. From the bioinformatical perspective. the reliance of most studies on a single SNP caller disregards the possibility that different algorithms may produce disparate SNP datasets. We present an improved RRL (iRRL) protocol that maximizes the generation of homologous DNA sequences. thus achieving improved genotyping-by-sequencing efficiency. Our modifications facilitate generation of single-sample libraries. enabling individual genotype assignments instead of pooled-sample analysis. We sequenced ~1% of the orangutan genome with 41-fold median coverage in 31 wild-born individuals from two populations. SNPs and genotypes were called using three different algorithms. We obtained substantially different SNP datasets depending on the SNP caller.

A high degree of connectivity requires using many genetic markers to achieve the required statistical power. and a genome wide SNP set can fit this purpose. Here we present the development of a genome wide SNP set for the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis. a model species for the study of bird migration. We used the genome of a different waterfowl species. Mallard Anas platyrhynchos. as a reference to align Barnacle Goose second generation sequence reads from an RRL library and detected 2188 SNPs genome wide. Furthermore. we used chimeric flanking sequences. merged from both Mallard and Barnacle Goose DNA sequence information. to create primers for validation by genotyping. Validation with a 384 SNP genotyping set resulted in 374 (97%) successfully typed SNPs in the assay. of which 358 (96%) were polymorphic. Additionally. we validated our SNPs on relatively old (30 years) museum samples. which resulted in a success rate of at least 80%. This shows that museum samples could be used in standard SNP genotyping assays. Our study also shows that the genome of a related species can be used as reference to detect genome wide SNPs in birds. because genomes of birds are highly conserved. This is illustrated by the use of chimeric flanking sequences. which showed that the incorporation of flanking nucleotides from Mallard into Barnacle Goose sequences lead to equal genotyping performance when compared to flanking sequences solely composed of Barnacle Goose sequence.,True,NlEMCkgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,23,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038412,6849678365904986175,/scholar?cites=6849678365904986175,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038412,0,0,0

In this paper. we argue that the balance between trees and grasses is. to a large extent. determined by the indirect interactive effects of herbivory and fire. These effects are based on the positive feedback between fuel load (grass biomass) and fire intensity. An increase in the level of grazing leads to reduced fuel load. which makes fire less intense and. thus. less damaging to trees and. consequently. results in an increase in woody vegetation. The system then switches from a state with trees and grasses to a state with solely trees. Similarly. browsers may enhance the effect of fire on trees because they reduce woody biomass. thus indirectly stimulating grass growth. This consequent increase in fuel load results in more intense fire and increased decline of biomass.

We investigate whether this positive feedback and the spatial redistribution of runoff water are sufficient to explain vegetation pattern formation. For this purpose. we analyze a spatially explicit model consisting of partial differential equations using a method for demonstrating pattern formation (Turing analysis). Our analysis reveals that pattern formation can occur in semi‐arid areas given only the positive feedback between plant density and local water infiltration coupled with the spatial redistribution of runoff water.

Often. this way of life is traced back to a (pre) historic past. although without evidence; for example. Parkipuny (1989) states that'before European hunters and indi-genous trophy hunters and meat poachers disturbed that once-natural balance in [Masai-land]. domestic and wild animals coexisted in virtually all pastoral areas in this region'. and Osemeobo (1988) wrote'before the advent of modem methods of primary production and rapid growth in human population. the rural farmers were able to manage both the animal wildlife and their habitats'.

Prevention of tree–grass interactions through root trenching led to increased soil water content indicating that trees took up more water from the topsoil than they exuded via hydraulic lift. Biomass was higher in trenched plots compared to controls probably because of reduced competition for water. Stable isotope analyses of plant and source water showed that grasses which competed with trees used a greater proportion of deep water compared with grasses in trenched plots. Grasses therefore used hydraulically lifted water provided by trees. or took up deep soil water directly by growing deeper roots when competition with trees occurred.

These results implied. however. that spatial redistribution processes cannot explain the collapse of production on coarser scales observed in these systems. We present a spatially explicit vegetation model to investigate possible mechanisms explaining irreversible vegetation collapse on coarse spatial scales. The model results indicate that the dynamics of vegetation on coarse scales are determined by the interaction of two spatial feedback processes. Loss of plant cover in a certain area results in increased availability of water in remaining vegetated patches through run‐on of surface water. promoting within‐patch plant production.

We report on a fertilization and shading experiment carried out in a Tanzanian tropical dry savanna around Acacia tortilis trees. In two years of study there was no difference in grass production under tree canopies or in open grassland.

The N:P ratios of grass gave a reliable indication of the nature of nutrient limitation. but only when assessed at the end of the wet season.

Milk ingestion. growth and mortality of 10 chinchilla‐breed captive litters were recorded between birth and age 21 d.

Differential male mortality is expected since females grow to be 27% heavier than males and should have an advantage in sibling competition in mixed-sex broods. Surprisingly. when the male hatches first. even though his sister outgrows him. he usually sustains dominance over her throughout the nestling phase. and he grows and survives normally. When the sister hatches first. despite a large. persistent sibling size disparity the male grows and survives normally.

Statistical analyses indicated that selection favored large and protandrous males in terms of a higher mating success. At the same time. evidence of correlational selection acting simultaneously on body size and time to sexual maturity was found. Thus. selection should strengthen the relationship between body size and the time of sexual maturity. Theoretical work suggests the existence of a trade‐off between reaching a large size and early sexual maturation in insects.

However. the possible advantage of the time of emergence for females on their mating success in protandrous insect species has only been explored theoretically. By studying the grasshopper Sphenarium purpurascens we evaluated the hypothesis that late emergence could be adaptive for females. If female maturation occurs when the population density is higher and the sex ratio (males/females) is biased to males. their probability of mating increases. Thus. in this study we estimated (1) the opportunity for mating in females as a function of their sexual maturation time. population density. and sex ratio at the moment they reached sexual maturity.

Although call frequency is expected to decrease with increasing body size. after controlling for phylogeny. both variables were not related. Finally. given that song frequency and spermatophore size are likely targets of sexual selection. we examined the relationship between these variables and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) which can be influenced by sexual selection on body size.

The workers. being sterile females. are not subject to selection for reproductive function and thus provide a natural control for parsing the effects of selection on reproductive function (i.e.. sexual and fecundity selection) from other natural selection. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach. we explored the allometric relationships among queens. males. and workers in 70 species of bumblebees (Bombus sp.). We found hyperallometry in thorax width for males relative to workers. indicating greater evolutionary divergence of body size in males than in sterile females. This is consistent with the hypothesis that selection for reproductive function. most probably sexual selection. has caused divergence in male size among species.

In many lizard species. males are larger than females. whereas in others. females are the larger sex. suggesting that selection on fecundity has been stronger than sexual selection on males. As placental development or egg retention requires more space within the abdominal cavity. it has been suggested that females of viviparous lizards have larger abdomens or body size than their oviparous relatives.

Short growing and reproductive seasons constrain the body size that adults can attain and their reproductive success. Little is known about the effects of altitudinal climatic variation on the diversification of Neotropical insects. In central Mexico. in addition to altitude. highly heterogeneous topography generates diverse climates that can occur even at the same latitude. Altitudinal variation and heterogeneous topography open an opportunity to test the relative impact of climatic variation on body size adaptations. In this study. we investigated the relationship between altitudinal climatic variation and body size. and the divergence rates of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in Neotropical grasshoppers of the genus Sphenarium using a phylogenetic comparative approach. In order to distinguish the relative impact of natural and sexual selection on the diversification of the group. we also tracked the altitudinal distribution of the species and trends of both body size and SSD on the phylogeny of Sphenarium.

In other species. males use pheromones to identify and attract conspecific mates. and thus. they might function as an honest indicator of a male's condition.

1217686,Is Sexual Dimorphism in the Immune Response of Gryllodes sigillatus Related to the Quality of Diet?,2014,Adolfo Galicia and Raul Cueva del Castillo and Contreras Jorge,2014,ISRN Evolutionary Biology,,6,Hindawi,Whereas some authors have proposed that sexual dimorphism in the immune response is fixed. others pose that it is dynamic and depends on diet. The aim of the present study was to explore the second hypothesis. Immunocompetence differences between females and males can be linked to resource availability. We tested this idea by providing a low or high quality diet to two groups of Gryllodes sigilatus during their developmental period. Then. at the adult phase half of each group was challenged with LPS from Serratia marcescens. The size. phenol oxidase (PO). and lytic activity were compared between groups according to diet. sex. and immune challenge. Results show that diet quality favor size in both sexes. However. the overall immune response did not seem to be significantly different based on diet. but instead on sex. Females showed greater phenol oxidase levels than males. but the opposite was found with lytic activity. Perhaps in G. sigillatus the differences in the pathogens commonly confronted by each sex in the distinct habitat of each could explain the differences on PO and lytic activity.,True,kA1LbkEAAAAJ:QyXJ3EUuO1IC,7,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2014/329736.pdf,5731798546681496746,/scholar?cites=5731798546681496746,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2014/329736.pdf,0,0,0

However. both females and males are polygamous. In this study. we assessed the potential benefits of multiple matings for females. with the same male or with different males. Furthermore. we evaluated the capacity of the male to assess the risk of sperm competition. The fecundity of females mated repeatedly with a male was not affected by the number of matings. but it increased by having prolonged matings. Moreover. polyandry did not increase fecundity of females. Females mated with one male produced more eggs and heavier clutch than females mated with two males.

Hummingbirds are an excellent model system to test functional hypotheses of SSD because they exhibit a wide range of body sizes and reproductive behaviour between the sexes. Here. using phylogenetic comparative methods. we tested whether mating system. male territoriality and agility predicted the evolution of SSD in this avian family. Our results first suggest that evolutionary increases in male-biased SSD are related to increases in lekking behaviour. Second. we found that male agility is positively related to increases in male biased-SSD albeit this is only likely to occur in males of territorial species.

Body size. which conveys maximal fitness. often differs between sexes. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) evolves because body size tends to be related to reproductive success through different pathways in males and females. In general. female insects are larger than males. suggesting that natural selection for high female fecundity could be stronger than sexual selection in males. I assessed the role of body size and fecundity in SSD in the Neotropical cricket Macroanaxipha macilenta (Saussure). This species shows a SSD bias toward males.

By measuring the departure of the ecological niche from the average available habitat. the marginality identifies the preference of the individual. population. or species for specific conditions of the environment among the whole set of possibilities. The specialization appears as a consequence of the narrowness of the niche on some environmental variables.

Since cattle are an exotic species in these ecosystems. they might have an impact on the local wild herbivore communities. notably through competition. We used point pattern statistics to characterise the spatial relationships between wild ungulate species and cattle herds within a protected area in west Africa undergoing seasonal intrusions by cattle. We predicted that the wild ungulate species that are ecologically and morphologically similar to cattle. in terms of body mass and diet. would be more sensitive to grass depletion by cattle and would be separated from cattle to a larger extent.

Extensions to the breeding range in the late 19th century were potentially aided by the rapid development of managed fish-ponds in eastern Europe. which provided suitable novel habitat at that time. Expansion into western Europe followed in subsequent decades. Wetland and waterbody eutrophication throughout Europe. which likely provided food and cover for the birds. may have accelerated the rapid expansion from the 1950s until the early 1980s. Widespread declines in the last 30 years. especially in eastern Europe. where breeding numbers are highest. are possibly linked to intensification and/or abandonment of freshwater fish farming and changes in water quality. Studies show that Pochard gain fitness benefits from nesting in Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus colonies and hence has been affected by major losses of European gull colonies in the last 30 years. The spread of alien fish species such as the Carp Cyprinus carpio. which compete with Pochard for food resources. is a problem in the Mediterranean region. Changing predation pressures (in some cases linked to invasive alien mammals) are also implicated in some areas. Relatively modest numbers breeding in the UK. France and the Netherlands have remained stable or increased over the same recent span of years. confirming that different factors currently affect Pochard breeding abundance throughout its range.

Proper statistical comparisons with earlier French surveys or with similar data from other countries were not possible because of the different (and sometimes unknown) sampling protocols. but the general trends suggest a relatively stable hunting bag compared to 15 years ago. France remains the European country reporting the greatest number of ducks harvested annually as a result of a long tradition of wildfowling. a dense human population and a central geographic position within the duck flyways. The only major change was a massive decline in the estimated harvest of Common Pochard Aythya ferina. reflecting a similar pattern in other countries and the poor conservation status of the species in Western Europe.

1217723,Dynamique des espèces exploitées: le cas du fuligule milouin (Aythya ferina) dans le Paléarctique,2018,Benjamin Folliot,,,,,,Le fuligule milouin (Aythya ferina) est une espèce de canard plongeur répandue dans l’ensemble du Paléarctique. Montrant des signes de déclin de ses effectifs nicheurs en Europe depuis les années 2000. son statut de conservation IUCN a été réévalué de «Préoccupation Mineure» à «Vulnérable». Etant une espèce chassée. la question du maintien de ces prélèvements cynégétiques est légitime. L’objectif de ce travail de thèse est donc de comprendre son fonctionnement démographique et les mécanismes sous-jacents à sa dynamique de population. pour proposer des mesures de gestion et de conservation. Pour cela. nous nous sommes attachés à estimer la tendance de ce déclin sur sa voie de migration nord-ouest européenne à partir des données de recensements de la mi-janvier. Puis. nous avons étudié la connectivité migratoire de cette voie de migration avec les autres voies préssuposées. afin de mieux comprendre l’origine de ce déclin. Enfin. nous avons estimé deux paramètres démographiques clés. la survie et le succès de nidification. pour les intégrer dans un cadre matriciel permettant d’estimer un taux de croissance asymptotique et comprendre quels sont les paramètres démographiques clés sur lesquels doivent reposer les actions de gestion. Il ressort de ce travail de thèse que le déclin du fuligule milouin est probalement dû surtout à une diminution de sa productivité en Europe de l’Est et en Russie. Le contrôle et la gestion de la productivité par l’Homme étant limités. uniquement des travaux de gestion autour des habitats liés à la nidification sont envisageables.

Both of these changes were suggested to result from decreasing survival of nesting females (i.e. survival of adult females) owing to increasing predation pressure. To test this hypothesis. we used capture–mark–recapture/recovery data of common pochard ringed during autumn–winter (October–February) in three countries of western Europe (Switzerland. United Kingdom and France). We found no evidence for decreasing survival of individuals ringed in the United Kingdom or in Switzerland over the long term (1977–2011).

1217730,The breeding population of Black Stork Ciconia nigra in the Iberian Peninsula,2006,Luis Santiago CANO ALONSO and Cláudia FRANCO and Carlos PACHECO and Susana REIS and Gonçalo ROSA and Manuel FERNÁNDEZ-GARCÍA,,,,,,The Iberian Peninsula is situated in the western extreme of Europe. and it is the limit of the Black Stork distribution of the western Palaearctic. The Black Stork in Iberia occupies the south western quadrant of the Peninsula in both Portugal and Spain. and is geographically separate from the population in Central and Eastern Europe. In the early nineties the population was estimated at 230-270 pairs (European Birds Population: estimates and trends). We compiled recent data collected between 1995 and 2002 in a national (Portugal: 1995-1997) and regional (Spain: 1996-2002) census and surveyed the population of 405-483 pairs (83 confirmed and 13 possible pairs in Portugal and 322 confirmed and 65 possible pairs in Spain). However. the census effort was unequal between all areas and we suspect that the value might be slightly underestimated. The Iberian population represents between 4% and 7% of the European and about half of European Union breeding population. The increase in the estimates since the early nineties is certainly a result of better coverage and census efforts. but there is some evidence of a small increase in the population. There is apparent stability in the number of pairs in the core area and an expansion in the edge of the distribution. Most nests are placed on rocks (69%) in both riverine and mountain cliffs and the remaining (31%) are in trees. mainly Cork Oak and pines.

The relatively poorly studied and isolated Iberian population is unusual in Europe in that the majority of known pairs are cliff-nesting. This permits the analysis of productivity differences in relation to nesting substrate in different subpopulations. comparing not only the mean number of fledged chicks/nest between cliff-nesting and tree-nesting pairs but also considering whether the nests are located in restricted- or open-access areas. The results reveal that nesting substrate does not determine differences in productivity. Only those cliff-nesting pairs that breed in open-access areas have significantly lower productivity than pairs that breed elsewhere.

Des défis sans frontière pour la conservation de l’espèce,2011,Luis Santiago Cano and José Luis Tellería,1,Nature Nièvre,19,22-32,SOBA Nature Nièvre,La Cigogne noire est une espèce inscrite à l’annexe I de la directive Oiseaux de l’Union Européenne (EEC/79/409) et enregistrée comme SPEC 2 (espèce dont l’état de conservation est défavorable en Europe) par BirdLife International (BirdLife. 2004). L’espèce a connu une importante baisse de ses effectifs dans le Centre de l’Europe depuis le XIXème s.. baisse qui a culminé avec sa disparition en tant que reproducteur dans toute cette zone au cours de la première moitié du XXème s. En Belgique. l’espèce est devenue rare au début du XIXème. le dernier couple reproducteur ayant été noté en 1892 (G. Jadoul. com. pers.). Au Grand Duché du Luxembourg. elle était déjà très peu observée avant 1920. puis a été totalement absente depuis cette date jusqu’à 1960 (JANS & LORGE. 2003) et au Dannemark elle a disparu comme reproductrice à partir de 1954 (RASMUSSEN. 1996). En France aucune donnée sur la reproduction de la Cigogne noire avant 1973 n’a pu être trouvée (Brossault. com. pers.). En conséquence. CRAMPS & SIMMONS (1977) n’a pas cartographié l’espèce comme reproductrice dans toute la partie centrale de l’Europe. Cependant l’espèce a commencé à recoloniser une grande partie du centre de l’Europe durant les trente dernières années du XX s. En 1973 a été publié le premier cas de nidification de l’espèce en France (VILLARUBIAS et al. 2003). en 1989 a été découverte sa reproduction en Belgique (G. JADOUL. 1994) et en 1993 au Luxembourg (JANS & LORGE. 2003).

1217745,Notes on the nesting site of the Wattled Ibis Bostrychia carunculata in the central uplands of Ethiopia,2020,L.S Cano Alonso,40,Scopus: Journal of East African Ornithology,2,76-79,Bird Committee of the East Africa Natural History Society,The Wattled Ibis Bostrichya carunculata is an Abyssinian highlands (Ethiopia and Eritrea) endemic bird (Rannestad 2016) that occurs only in the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot Key Biodiversity Area (KBA). Classified as a species of ‘Least Concern’by the IUCN. it is one of the least known ibis species. with very little information available on its population. ecology. habitat use. breeding biology. or behaviour (BirdLife International 2016). The Wattled Ibis breeds in the Ethiopian highlands during the ‘little’rains in March–April (the Belg season). and during the ‘big’rains in July–September (the Meher season). with occasional nesting during the dry season in December (del Hoyo et al. 1992. Ash & Atkins 2009). At lower altitudes. breeding is mostly in October (Esayas 2017). It usually nests in small to large colonies on rocky cliffs and trees (Hancock et al. 1992. Esayas 2017). but it has also been reported to nest singly. in small groups. and then the nests are more likely to be high up in trees or on ledges of building at lower elevations (1800–2000 m)(Brown et al. 1982. del Hoyo et al. 1992). In all cases the nest is a modest platform of branches and sticks. mosses. weed stems and other materials. with a diameter between 27 and 37 cm (Esayas 2017). Esayas (2017) reported 30 of 170 occupied nests of Wattled Ibis in ‘settlements’ on Acacia spp.. 3–5 m above the ground. without any further information. The observations presented here are my first findings on breeding sites of Wattled Ibis as part of an ongoing ecological study of the species. The study was done in Seru district (7 35–7 52 N. 40 11–40 42 E). 90 km northeast of Bale Mountains …,True,V3yMvZEAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,0,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/scopus/article/view/198327/187010,,,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/scopus/article/view/198327/187010,0,0,0

Dieter OSCHADLEUS and Manuel MAÑEZ and Boudjéma SAMRAOUI and Riad NEDJAH and Stefano VOLPONI and Luis Santiago CANO-ALONSO,,SIS Conservation,1,139-146,IUCN SSC Stork. Ibis & Spoonbill Specialist Group,The Glossy Ibis is among the most widespread bird species in the world. However. the Glossy Ibis erratic occurrence and distribution makes it a difficult species to study. and we know little about its dispersal and metapopulation dynamics. This study summarises previously-scattered and unpublished information by collating. in a single database. the largest number of longdistance recoveries ever reached for this species (190 individuals). Our findings suggest that (i) according to old records (about 1910 - 1995) the dispersal from the breeding grounds in East Europe was directed towards the Sahelian floodplains. North-East Africa. the Middle East and India; (ii) West and East Europe populations are probably connected; (iii) the recently (about 1995 onwards) increasing and spreading populations in West Europe do not tend to migrate south and overwinter in Sub-Saharan Africa; and. (iv) the genetic distance between geographically distant populations might be low considering the records of long-distance flights with the most impressive. and unpublished. one being that of an individual moving from Spain to the Virgin Islands (> 6.000 Km). Overall. these findings highlight the need for a research network capable of dealing with the frequent changes in the distribution and dispersal dynamics of the Glossy Ibis and its fast responses to environmental changes.,True,V3yMvZEAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02405412/,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02405412/document,0,0,0

The first is scientific: Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo are interesting birds to study because they are widespread. are at the top of many aquatic food-chains and therefore influence. and are influenced by. the structure and dynamics of fish communities. The second is political: Cormorants are perceived to damage fisheries throughout Europe. and elsewhere. In many countries. commercial and/or recreational fishermen may form alarge. vocal body capable of considerable political influence. For instance the German Government-(Bavarian State Ministries) has funded a three-year investigation into the impacts of Cormorants on fish stocks in Bavaria (see Keller et al.. 1'997).

Croatia and Serbia) between 2003 and 2015. and a satellite tagged individual. which was equipped in Italy in 2013. and later moved to the Carpathian Basin. Migration routes of these Spoonbills predominantly followed the Adriatic Flyway. however. some birds were also found to both east and west from this flyway. We identified 59 stopover sites. 55 of which were located along the Adriatic Flyway. Colourringed juveniles (1cy). on average. spent 4.0±0.9 (SE) days on the stopover sites along the Adriatic Flyway during autumn migration. while non-juveniles (> 1cy) spent 2.6±1.0 (SE) days during autumn and 2.1±0.4 (SE) days during spring migration there. These durations were not significantly different. Duration of stops of the satellite tracked individual was between 7 and 15 days during autumn and between 1 and 12 days during spring migration. Our results indicate the existence of two alternative routes of the Adriatic Flyway between the Carpathian Basin and the wintering areas in southern Italy and the central part of coastal North-Africa.

Nonetheless. the relationship between extreme climatic events and dispersal has received little attention in birds. Here we focused on climatic. demographic and individual factors affecting the dispersal propensity of a major glossy ibis population. We performed a capture-resighting analysis on individuals born and observed at Doñana (South-West Spain) over fourteen years. We applied a multiple analytical approach to show that single-site capture-resighting estimates were a reliable index of dispersal propensity from the area. We focused on the emigration of Doñana-born individuals sporadically (transients) and regularly (residents) frequenting their natal area. Droughts during two out of 14 study years caused higher apparent dispersal rates. explaining most of the annual variation in these rates. The age structure of Doñana-born individuals resighted simultaneously locally and in Morocco in one week over the 2010 autumn confirmed that the 2005 drought boosted permanent emigration. As numbers increased steadily during non-drought years since the formation of the colony in 1996 to several thousand pairs. philopatry increased gradually. while transients probability appeared to be related to average breeding success.

We applied a multi-event capture–recapture procedure on two years of data from three rabbit populations to test hypotheses about the effects on survival of. and the dynamics of host immunity to. both myxoma virus and Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (MV and RHDV). Although the populations shared the same climatic and management conditions. MV and RHDV dynamics varied greatly among them; MV and RHDV seroprevalences were positively related to density in one population. but RHDV seroprevalence was negatively related to density in another. In addition. (i) juvenile survival was most often negatively related to seropositivity. (ii) RHDV seropositives never had considerably higher survival. and (iii) seroconversion to seropositivity was more likely than the reverse. We suggest seropositivity affects survival depending on trade-offs among antibody protection. immunosuppression and virus lethality. Negative effects of seropositivity might be greater on juveniles due to their immature immune system. Also. while RHDV directly affects survival through the hemorrhagic syndrome. MV lack of direct lethal effects means that interactions influencing survival are likely to be more complex.

As an example. population indices are needed to monitor extensive breeding nuclei used for translocating wild rabbit populations. Based on counts of faecal pellets from four high density rabbit nuclei in southwest Spain: (i) we assess the accuracy of this population index in high-density populations; and (ii) present a simulation approach to evaluate how the reduction of the counting effort affects accuracy of the population estimates. Our findings suggest that this method provides a valid estimate in high-density rabbit populations. and. notably. estimates would have not substantially changed after a reduction of 45–65% in the number of counted plots depending on variation on rabbit density between nuclei.

It has been suggested that this divergence is due to variation in the conifer cones that each population specialises upon. requiring a specific beak size to efficiently separate the cone scales. If so. apparent survival should depend on beak size. To test this hypothesis. we undertook multievent capture–recapture modelling for 6844 individuals monitored during 27 years in a Pyrenean common crossbill L. curvirostra population in a forest of mountain pine Pinus uncinata. Apparent survival was indeed related to beak width. resulting in stabilizing selection around an optimum that was close to the observed mean beak width. indicating that local crossbill beak morphology is adapted to the conifer they feed upon.

The sexy son hypothesis (SSH) expands this framework from direct to indirect benefits assuming that polygynously-mated females give birth to sexy and subsequently polygynous sons. Although the SSH has generated much debate. empirical evidence is inconclusive. I argue that lack of support could be related to the SSH formulation of the polygyny threshold as a population-level mechanism making the female choice of a polygynous male either advantageous or disadvantageous regardless of any other difference between potential mates.

In this study. we investigate changes in diversity and abundance occurred between 1978 and 2016 in the community of small mammals of Doñana and their relationship with local climate changes. Capture-mark-recapture methods were carried out for a total of 16 years. unevenly distributed over four decades. Our findings show a consistent loss of diversity and abundance decline in the community of small mammals. Eliomys quercinus and Rattus rattus have almost disappeared from the area and Apodemus sylvaticus has sharply reduced its abundance parallel to the progressive increase of Mus spretus. Such a process is worrying for conservation as small mammals represent. after rabbits. the most important prey for carnivores and raptors in Doñana. The detected changes could be at least partially explained by the progressive increase in local temperature observed during the study period. In line with this. the species that have suffered a greater decline are those of Eurasian origin and northern distribution as is the case for E. quercinus and R. rattus while the current dominant species. M. spretus. proceeds from Africa and has a Mediterranean distribution. A non-exclusive alternative is that the extreme rarefaction of rabbits may have caused a trophic cascade effect enhancing predation by carnivores and raptors towards gradually smaller species.",True,JsRgr-YAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://riuma.uma.es/xmlui/handle/10630/14409,,,,,0,0,0

Overall. we found no significant relationships between rabbit serostatus and biochemistry. Our main result was that rabbits that were seropositive for both MV and RHDV had low gamma glutamyltransferase concentrations. Given the robustness of our analyses. the lack of significant relationships may indicate that the biochemical parameters measured are poor proxies for serostatus.

Phenolic compounds occur mostly as soluble conjugates and insoluble forms. covalently bound to sugar moieties or cell wall structural components. Absorption mechanisms for bound phenolic compounds in the gastrointestinal tract greatly depend on the liberation of sugar moieties. Food processes such as fermentation. malting. thermoplastic extrusion or enzymatic. alkaline and acid hydrolyses occasionally assisted with microwave or ultrasound have potential to release phenolics associated to cell walls. Different kinds of wet chemistry methodologies to release and detect bound phenolic have been developed. These include harsh heat treatments. chemical modifications or biocatalysis.

They are well adapted to grow under low soil fertility. low moisture. and hot environmental conditions. Millets are of value especially in semiarid regions because of their short growing season and higher productivity under heat and drought conditions. Often millets are produced in areas where maize and sorghum crops may fail. Some millets. such as teff or fonio. are prized for their taste and functionality in nondrought years and can bring higher prices per bushel than the more common millets [133]. The grain and forage are valuable as food and feed resources in Africa. Russia. India. and China. Pearl millet is the most widely grown millet and is a very important crop in India [72] and parts of Africa [45.133]. There are more than 15.000 pearl millet lines in the World Germplasm Collection located in India. Finger millet is popular in East Africa and India [45. 74].

It is predominantly a cross-pollinating species. a feature that has contributed to its broad morphological variability and geographical adaptability. Depending on the latitude and the climate in which it is grown. maize is classified into three distinct types. tropical. temperate. and subtropical. Maize can also be classified based on:(1) endosperm and kernel constitution;(2) kernel colour: flint. dent. floury. waxy. sweet. and pop corn;(3) maturity;(4) use. Economically. the most important types of maize are grown for grain or fodder and silage production. However. in the tropics. grain is primarily grown for human consumption. FAO predicts that an additional 60 Mt of maize grain will be needed from the annual global harvest by 2030. The demand for maize as an animal feed will continue to grow faster than the demand for its use as a human food. particularly in Asia. where a doubling of production is expected from the present level of 165 Mt to almost 400 Mt in 2030 [1]. In addition to being an economically important crop. maize is also a classical genetic model for plant research. It has a number of characteristics that are favorable for an experimental model for crop plants:(i) a multiplepurpose crop with worldwide cultivation which attracts research funding from public and private institutions.(ii)< 59 000 [2] and 42 000–56 000 genes [3] with moderate genome size (∼ 2400 Mb of DNA per haploid nucleus in the B73 inbred. which is approximately six times larger than rice and six times smaller than wheat. although a large proportion of the …,True,aW4bP8EAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,74,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2009/957602.pdf,17010021198723946480,/scholar?cites=17010021198723946480,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2009/957602.pdf,0,0,0

The mutant lacks At2g37250 transcripts and has a mild reduction in total cellular ADK activity. Green fluorescent protein-fusion based cellular localization experiments. carried out with the full-length At2g37250. suggested a plastidial localization for this isoform. In keeping with this observation. organelle isolation experiments revealed that the loss in ADK activity was confined to the inner plastid.

Previous attempts have been made to assess the predictive ability of some linear mixed models when GE components are treated as random effects and modeled by the factor analytic (FA) model. This study compares the predictive ability of linear mixed models when the GE is modeled by the FA model with that of simple linear mixed models when the GE is not modeled. A cross‐validation scheme is used that randomly deletes some genotypes from sites; the values for these genotypes are then predicted by the different models and correlated with their observed values to assess model accuracy. A total of six multienvironment trials (one potato [Solanum tuberosum L.] trial. three maize [Zea mays L.] trials. and two wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] trials) with GE of varying complexity were used in the evaluation …,True,X4mvrmAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,79,https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci2010.07.0403,17122126136864041044,/scholar?cites=17122126136864041044,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53203224/Burgueno_et_al._Prediction_Assessment.pdf,0,0,0

In the present study. 22 bi-parental tropical maize populations genotyped with low density SNPs were used to evaluate the genomic prediction accuracy (rMG) of the six trait-environment combinations under various levels of training population size (TPS) and marker density (MD). and assess the effect of trait heritability (h2). TPS and MD on rMG estimation. Our results showed that: (1) moderate rMG values obtained for different trait-environment combinations. when 50% of the total genotypes was used as training population and approximate 200 SNPs were used for prediction; (2) rMG increased as the increase of h2. TPS and MD. both correlation and variance analyses showed that h2 is the most important factor and MD is the least important factor on rMG estimation for most of the trait-environment combinations; (3) the trend observed in rMG differed with the trend observed in rMG/h. and h is the square root of heritability of the predicted trait. it indicated that both rMG and rMG/h values should be presented in GS study to show the accuracy of genomic selection and the relative accuracy of genomic selection compared with phenotypic selection. respectively.

Phyllachora maydis and Monographella maydis. is one of the major foliar diseases of maize in Central and South America. P. maydis was also detected in the United States of America in 2015 and since then the pathogen has spread in the maize growing regions of the country. Although remote sensing (RS) techniques are increasingly being used for plant phenotyping. they have not been applied to phenotyping TSC resistance in maize. In this study. several multispectral vegetation indices and thermal imaging of maize plots under disease pressure and disease-free conditions were tested using an unmanned aerial vehicle over two crop seasons. A strong relationship between grain yield. a vegetative index (MCARI2) and canopy temperature was observed under disease pressure. A strong relationship was also observed between the area under the disease progress curve of TSC and three vegetative indices (RDVI. MCARI1. and MCARI2). In addition. we demonstrated that TSC could cause up to 58% yield loss in the most susceptible maize hybrids. Our results suggest that the RS techniques tested in this study could be used for high throughput phenotyping of TSC resistance and potentially for other foliar diseases of maize. This may help reduce the cost and time required for the development of improved maize germplasm.

Since oxidative stress constitutes a unifying mechanism of injury of many types of disease processes. it should be expected that polyphenolic antioxidants account for this beneficial effect. Nevertheless. beyond the well-known antioxidant properties of these compounds. they may exert several other protective mechanisms. Indeed. the overall protective effect of polyphenols is due to their large array of biological actions. such as free radical-scavenging. metal chelation. enzyme modulation. cell signalling pathways modulation and gene expression effects. among others.

Zeiosis is prevented by agents that interfere with the contractile response to CD. such as inhibitors of energy metabolism or cyclic AMP.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether reinitiating continuous antiretroviral therapy in patients who received episodic treatment reduces excess risk for opportunistic disease or death. DESIGN: Randomized. controlled trial. SETTING: Sites in 33 countries. PATIENTS: 5472 HIV-infected individuals with CD4 (+) cell counts greater than 0.350 x 10 (9) cells/L enrolled from January 2002 to January 2006. INTERVENTION: Episodic or continuous antiretroviral therapy initially. followed by continuous therapy in participants previously assigned to episodic treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Opportunistic disease or death was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Eighteen months after the recommendation to reinitiate continuous therapy. mean CD4+ cell counts were 0.152 x 10 (9) cells/L (95% CI. 0.136 to 0.167 x 10 (9) cells/L) less in participants previously assigned to episodic treatment (P< 0.001). The proportion of follow-up time spent with CD4+ cell counts of 0.500 x 10 (9) cells/L or more and HIV RNA levels of 400 copies/mL or less was 29% for participants initially assigned to episodic therapy and 66% for those assigned to continuous therapy. Participants who reinitiated continuous therapy experienced rapid suppression of HIV RNA levels (89.7% with HIV RNA levels< or= 400 copies/mL after 6 months). but CD4+ cell counts after 6 months remained 0.140 x 10 (9) cells/L below baseline.

All patients were administered cephamandole parenterally and. if this was tolerated. a course of oral cephaloridine was administered. Only two patients responded to the cephamandole; none of the remaining patients reacted to cephaloridine. Benzylpenicilloyl RAST-inhibition studies with sera from three subjects who had not reacted to the cephalosporins demonstrated that cephamandole linked to proteins was capable of recognizing benzylpenicilloyl-specific IgE antibody.

Revista Latinoamericana,30,,Centro de Investigación Sociedad y Politicas Públicas (CISPO),Entre 1990 y 2011 se constituyó una subjetividad que toleró un incremento significativo de malestar sin mayores expresiones políticas del mismo. Una sociedad despolitizada privatizó los problemas públicos y los asumió a nivel individual. En ese marco. el disenso de los ciudadanos con el orden político al cual debían responder. no sólo no tuvo nunca representación institucional. sino que más bien fue la institucionalidad su principal obstáculo. Las instituciones funcionaron como dique de contención del malestar y protegieron así a la clase política. La latencia del malestar tuvo su final. o al menos una suspensión significativa. durante 2011. a partir de un proceso de movilización social de gran envergadura que ancló la energía del malestar en los problemas de la educación chilena. La ilegitimidad anterior de la protesta pública invirtió su signo y el acto de protesta pasó a ser parte fundamental del modo en que las demandas ciudadanas lograron. legítimamente. escalar hacia las autoridades. mientras éstas reducían su ya menguada aprobación.

However. the role of urinary pheromones in intra-sexual competition has received less attention. This is particularly relevant in lek-breeding species. such as the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). where males establish dominance hierarchies and there is the possibility for chemical communication in the modulation of aggression among males. To investigate whether males use urine during aggressive interactions. we measured urination frequency of dye-injected males during paired interactions between size-matched males. Furthermore. we assessed urinary volume stored in the bladder of males in a stable social hierarchy and the olfactory potency of their urine by recording of the electro-olfactogram.

The current taxonomy has only been partially accepted by most laboratory virologists. Confusion likely arose for several reasons: species names that consist of several words or which (should) contain diacritical marks. the current orthographic identity of species and virus names. and the similar pronunciation of several virus abbreviations in the absence of guidance for the correct use of vernacular names. To rectify this problem. we suggest (1) to retain the current species names Reston ebolavirus.

Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a frequently fatal disease of farmed Atlantic salmon. First recognized in one farm in Norway in 1999[1]. HSMI was subsequently implicated in outbreaks in other farms in Norway and the United Kingdom[2]. Although pathology and disease transmission studies indicated an infectious basis. efforts to identify an agent were unsuccessful. Here we provide evidence that HSMI is associated with infection with piscine reovirus (PRV). PRV is a novel reovirus identified by unbiased high throughput DNA sequencing and a bioinformatics program focused on nucleotide frequency as well as sequence alignment and motif analyses. Formal implication of PRV in HSMI will require isolation in cell culture and fulfillment of Koch's postulates. or prevention or modification of disease through use of specific drugs or vaccines.

We have used electron cryomicroscopy and helical reconstruction to identify its binding site on actin filaments. Cofilin binds filamentous (F)-actin cooperatively by bridging two longitudinally associated actin subunits. The binding site is centered axially at subdomain 2 of the lower actin subunit and radially at the cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 of the upper actin subunit. Our work has revealed a totally unexpected (and unique) property of cofilin. namely. its ability to change filament twist. As a consequence of this change in twist. filaments decorated with cofilin have much shorter ‘actin crossovers' (∼75% of those normally observed in F-actin structures). Although their binding sites are distinct. cofilin and phalloidin do not bind simultaneously to F-actin.

Obradovic Z. Kissinger C. Villafranca JE. Dunker AK (1997) Identifying disordered regions in proteins from amino acid sequence. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks. 1: 90–95). By now more than twenty other laboratory groups have joined the efforts to improve the prediction of protein disorder. While the various prediction methodologies used for protein intrinsic disorder resemble those methodologies used for secondary structure prediction. the two types of structures are entirely different. For example. the two structural classes have very different dynamic properties. with the irregular secondary structure class being much less mobile than the disorder class. The prediction of secondary structure has been useful. On the other hand. the prediction of intrinsic disorder has been revolutionary. leading to major modifications of the more than 100 year-old views relating protein structure and function. Experimentalists have been providing evidence over many decades that some proteins lack fixed structure or are disordered (or unfolded) under physiological conditions. In addition. experimentalists are also showing that. for many proteins. their functions depend on the unstructured rather than structured state; such results are in marked contrast to the greater than hundred year old views such as the lock and key hypothesis.

Ca 2+-dependent phospholipid binding is key for synaptotagmin function. but it is unclear how this activity cooperates with the SNARE complex involved in release or why Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 B domain is more crucial for release than Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 A domain. Here we show that Ca 2+ induces high-affinity simultaneous binding of synaptotagmin to two membranes. bringing them into close proximity. The synaptotagmin C 2 B domain is sufficient for this ability. which arises from the abundance of basic residues around its surface.

Folding in the cell must be achieved in a highly crowded macromolecular environment. in which release of nonnative polypeptides into the cytosolic solution might lead to formation of potentially toxic aggregates.

These large. cylindrical complexes contain a central cavity that binds to unfolded polypeptides and sequesters them from the cellular environment. Substrate folding then occurs in this central cavity in an ATP-dependent manner. The eukaryotic chaperonin TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC. also called CCT) is indispensable for cell survival because the folding of an essential subset of cytosolic proteins requires TRiC. and this function cannot be substituted by other chaperones. This specificity indicates that TRiC has evolved structural and mechanistic features that distinguish it from other chaperones.

An elaborate network of molecular chaperones and protein degradation factors continually monitor and maintain the integrity of the proteome. Cellular protein quality control relies on three distinct yet interconnected strategies whereby misfolded proteins can either be refolded. degraded. or delivered to distinct quality control compartments that sequester potentially harmful misfolded species.

Ltd,Molecular chaperones play a fundamental role in cellular protein folding. Using intact mammalian cells we examined the contribution of cytosolic chaperones to de novo folding. A large fraction of newly translated polypeptides associate transiently with Hsc70 and the chaperonin TRiC/CCT during their biogenesis. The substrate repertoire observed for Hsc70 and TRiC is not identical: Hsc70 interacts with a wide spectrum of polypeptides larger than 20 kDa. while TRiC associates with a diverse set of proteins between 30 and 60 kDa. Overexpression of a bacterial chaperonin ‘trap’that irreversibly captures unfolded polypeptides did not interrupt the productive folding pathway.

While it is often difficult to achieve a high-resolution model for these structures.

Alamethicin in the inserted state was prepared and undeuterated and deuterated dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) hydrated with D2O or H2O. Neutron in-plane scattering showed a strong dependence on deuteration. clearly indicating that water is a part of the high-order structure of inserted alamethicin. The data are consistent with the simple barrel-stave model originally proposed by Baumann and Mueller. The theoretical curves computed with this model at four different deuteration conditions agree with the data in all cases. Both the diameter of the water pore and the effective outside diameter of the channel are determined accurately. Alamethicin forms pores in a narrow range of size.

Ca 2+-dependent phospholipid binding is key for synaptotagmin function. but it is unclear how this activity cooperates with the SNARE complex involved in release or why Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 B domain is more crucial for release than Ca 2+ binding to the C 2 A domain. Here we show that Ca 2+ induces high-affinity simultaneous binding of synaptotagmin to two membranes. bringing them into close proximity. The synaptotagmin C 2 B domain is sufficient for this ability. which arises from the abundance of basic residues around its surface. We propose a model wherein synaptotagmin cooperates with the SNAREs in bringing the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together and accelerates membrane fusion through the highly positive electrostatic potential of its C 2 B domain.,True,iJQcLr0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,276,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb1056,8425255368838177250,/scholar?cites=8425255368838177250,,,0,0,0

However. above a critical peptide-to-lipid ratio (P/L). a fraction of the peptide molecules insert in the membrane. This critical ratio is lipid dependent. For diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine it is about 1/40. At even higher concentrations P/L > or = 1/15. all of the alamethicin inserts into the membrane and forms well-defined pores as detected by neutron in-plane scattering. A previous x-ray diffraction measurement showed that alamethicin adsorbed on the surface has the effect of thinning the bilayer in proportion to the peptide concentration. A theoretical study showed that the energy cost of membrane thinning can indeed lead to peptide insertion. This paper extends the previous studies to the high-concentration region P/L > 1/40.

Furthermore. this transition has been correlated to the peptides' cytolytic activities. X-ray lamellar diffraction of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine-alamethicin mixtures revealed the changes of the bilayer structure with alamethicin concentration. In particular. the bilayer thickness decreases with increasing peptide concentration in proportion to the peptide-lipid molar ratio from as low as 1:150 to 1:47; the latter is near the threshold of the critical concentration for insertion. From the decreases of the bilayer thickness. one can calculate the cross sectional expansions of the lipid chains.

Using a newly developed skeletonization algorithm and secondary structure element identification in combination with sequence-based secondary structure prediction. we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a de novo Cα trace directly from a cryo-EM reconstruction. The topology of our backbone trace is completely accurate. though subtle alterations illustrate significant differences from existing crystal structures. In the map with C7 symmetry. the seven monomers in each ring are identical; however. the subunits have a subtly different structure in each ring. particularly in the equatorial domain.

We have determined a structure of the apoptosome at 12.8 Å resolution by using electron cryomicroscopy and single-particle methods. We then docked appropriate crystal structures into the map to create an accurate domain model. Thus. we found that seven caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) form a central ring within the apoptosome. At a larger radius. seven copies of the nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) associate laterally to form the hub. which encircles the CARD ring. Finally. an arm-like helical domain (HD2) links each NOD to a pair of β propellers. which bind a single cytochrome c. This model provides insights into the roles of dATP and cytochrome c in assembly.

The target structure is first broken into a set of short segments. The data base is then searched for matching segments. which are fitted onto the framework of the target structure. Three criteria are used for choosing a matching data base segment: amino acid sequence similarity. conformational similarity (atomic co-ordinates). and compatibility with the target structure (van der Waals' interactions). The new method works surprisingly well: for eight test proteins ranging in size from 46 to 323 residues. the all-atom root-mean-square deviation of the modeled structures is between 0· 93 Å and 1· 73 Å (the average is 1· 26 Å).

The model is further tested by comparing calculated energetic. structural. and dynamic properties of liquid water. at several temperatures and pressures. with experiment.

1218054,Automatic identification of secondary structure in globular proteins,1977,Michael Levitt and Jonathan Greer,114,,2,181-239,Academic Press,A computer program is used to analyse automatically and objectively the atomic co-ordinates of a large number of globular proteins in order to identify the regions of α-helix. β-sheet and reverse-turn secondary structure. Several different criteria for the assignment of secondary structure are tested for accuracy. reproducibility and efficiency. The most successful criterion. which is based on patterns of peptide hydrogen bonds. inter-Cα distances and inter-Cα torsion angles. is used to find the secondary structure of all the proteins studied. The accuracy of the derived assignments is assessed by comparing them with the secondary structure reported in the literature for each protein.

1218130,Depth Aware 3-D Per-Particle CTF Correction for Cryo Electron Single Particle Tomography,,Jesús G Galaz-Montoya and Corey W Hecksel and Steven J Ludtke and Wah Chiu,,,,,,Cryo electron tomography (cryoET) is one of few techniques that can directly visualize macromolecular complexes inside cells (without stains or fluorescent tags) at nanometer resolution. Due to mechanical limitations of the electron microscope and the slab-geometry of frozen-hydrated specimens. data collection is limited to-60 to 60. The region from which images cannot be collected (“the missing wedge”) causes anisotropic resolution and smearing in tomographic reconstructions. The resolution of individual tomograms is rarely better than 5-6 nm; however. single particle tomography (SPT or “subtomogram averaging”) averages near-identical structures within tomograms to improve resolution and “fill in” the missing wedge. One factor limiting cryoET and cryoSPT has been the lack of robust correction methods for the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope. In spite of this. SPT can routinely achieve up to 2-4 nm resolutions. CTF correction requires knowledge of the defocus for every image collected. In cryoET. dose fractionation and defocus gradients make CTF correction particularly challenging. Early methods for defocus measurement [1] and correction [2] across tilted images was demonstrated with electron doses~ 10x higher than those used for cryoET. Later methods assume that the defocus setting of the microscope is accurate and the specimen stage is eucentric [3. 4. 5]. which is not always the case. Other methods that do measure the defocus for each tilt image yield no improvement [6] or require complicated data collection schemes that increase data collection time and processing overhead [7].

Group II chaperonins use their “built-in lid” to close their central folding chamber. Here we report the structure of an archaeal group II chaperonin in its prehydrolysis ATP-bound state at subnanometer resolution using single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Structural comparison of Mm-cpn in ATP-free.

Accelerated degradation of reductase. one of several strategies animal cells use to limit production of cholesterol. requires sterol-induced binding of the enzyme to ER membrane proteins called Insigs. Once formed. the reductase-Insig complex is recognized by a putative membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase (E3) that mediates the reductase ubiquitination reaction.

The metabolites of cholesterol include: steroids. oxysterols. and bile acids. all of which play important physiological functions. Cholesterol and its metabolites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple human diseases. including: atherosclerosis. cancer. neurodegenerative diseases. and diabetes. Thus. understanding how cells maintain the homeostasis of cholesterol and its metabolites is an important area of study. Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs. also abbreviated as SOATs) converts cholesterol to cholesteryl esters and play key roles in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. ACATs are most unusual enzymes because (i) they metabolize diverse substrates including both sterols and certain steroids; (ii) they contain two different binding sites for steroidal molecules.

Despite their importance in cell biology. the mechanism underlying LD biogenesis remains largely unknown. In the present study we report that conditions of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress stimulate LD formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that LDs accumulated in yeast mutants with compromised protein glycosylation or ER-associated protein degradation.

Despite their opposite phenotypes. these two conditions both cause ectopic lipid storage in non-adipose tissues. leading to lipotoxicity. which has health-threatening consequences. The exact mechanisms underlying ectopic lipid storage remain elusive. Here we report the analysis of a Drosophila model of the most severe form of human lipodystrophy.

In addition to reduced lipid storage in the fat body. dSeipin mutant flies accumulate ectopic lipid droplets in the salivary gland. a non-adipose tissue. This phenotype was suppressed by expressing dSeipin specifically within the salivary gland. dSeipin mutants display synergistic genetic interactions with lipogenic genes in the formation of ectopic lipid droplets.

Ezetimibe. a hypocholesterolemic drug. has been reported to bind NPC1L1 and block cholesterol absorption. However. the molecular mechanism of NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol uptake and how ezetimibe inhibits this process are poorly defined. Here we find that cholesterol specifically promotes the internalization of NPC1L1 and that this process requires microfilaments and the clathrin/AP2 complex. Blocking NPC1L1 endocytosis dramatically decreases cholesterol internalization. indicating that NPC1L1 mediates cholesterol uptake via its vesicular endocytosis.

Here. we reconstituted an autophagy-regulated secretion of mature IL-1β (m-IL-1β) in non-macrophage cells. We found that cytoplasmic IL-1β associates with the autophagosome and m-IL-1β enters into the lumen of a vesicle intermediate but not into the cytoplasmic interior formed by engulfment of the autophagic membrane. In advance of secretion. m-IL-1β appears to be translocated across a membrane in an event that may require m-IL-1β to be unfolded or remain conformationally flexible and is dependent on two KFERQ-like motifs essential for the association of IL-1β with HSP90. A vesicle. possibly a precursor of the phagophore. contains translocated m-IL-1β and later turns into an autophagosome in which m-IL-1β resides within the intermembrane space of the double-membrane structure.

We now report that starvation activation of autophagic phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) induces the generation of small vesicles active in LC3 lipidation. Subcellular fractionation studies identified the ERGIC as the donor membrane in the generation of small lipidation-active vesicles. COPII proteins are recruited to the ERGIC membrane in starved cells. dependent on active PI3K.

Here we report that proliferative astrocytes play a critical role in CCM pathogenesis by serving as a major source of VEGF during CCM lesion formation. An increase in astrocyte VEGF synthesis is driven by endothelial nitric oxide (NO) generated as a consequence of KLF2 and KLF4-dependent elevation of eNOS in CCM endothelium. The increased brain endothelial production of NO stabilizes HIF-1a in astrocytes. resulting in increased VEGF production and expression of a hypoxic program under normoxic conditions. We show that the upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). a direct HIF-1a target gene and a known component of the hypoxic program. contribute to the development of CCM lesions because the administration of a COX-2 inhibitor significantly prevents the progression of CCM lesions.

While the ligand-binding activity of integrins is known to be modulated by conformational changes. little is known about how the appropriate balance of integrin adhesiveness is maintained in order to optimize the migratory capacity of lymphocytes in vivo. In this study we examined the regulation of the gut homing receptor α4β7 integrin by manipulating at the germline level an integrin regulatory domain known as adjacent to metal ion-dependent adhesion site (ADMIDAS). ADMIDAS normally serves to raise the activation threshold of α4β7. thereby stabilizing it in the default nonadhesive state. Lymphocytes from knockin β7 (D146A) mice. which harbor a disrupted ADMIDAS. not only expressed an α4β7 integrin that persistently adhered to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule–1 (MAdCAM-1). but also …,True,5OXqEnQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,75,https://www.jci.org/articles/view/31570,1750382573942144837,/scholar?cites=1750382573942144837,,https://www.jci.org/articles/view/31570,0,0,0

Atomic resolution and mutagenesis studies of α I domains demonstrate a C-terminal. axial displacement of the α7-helix that allosterically regulates the shape and affinity of the ligand-binding site. Atomic resolution studies of β I-like domains have thus far demonstrated no similar α7-helix displacement; however. other studies are consistent with the idea that α I and β I-like domains undergo structurally analogous rearrangements. To test the hypothesis that C-terminal. axial displacement of the α7-helix. coupled with β6–α7 loop reshaping. activates β I-like domains. we have mimicked the effect of α7-helix displacement on the β6–α7 loop by shortening the α7-helix by two independent. four-residue deletions of about one turn of α-helix.

Adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) mutants are constitutively active but remain bent. with poor exposure of a β2 stalk region epitope.

ECM remodeling is crucial for tumor migration and invasion during the process of metastasis. ECM can be remodeled by several processes including synthesis. contraction and proteolytic degradation. In order to cross through the ECM barriers. malignant cells produce a spectrum of extracellular proteinases including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). serine proteases (mainly the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) system) and cysteine proteases to degrade ECM components.

However. the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Here. we report that fever promoted T lymphocyte trafficking through heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-induced α4 integrin activation and signaling in T cells. By inducing selective binding of Hsp90 to α4 integrins. but not β2 integrins. fever increased α4-integrin-mediated T cell adhesion and transmigration. Mechanistically. Hsp90 bound to the α4 tail and activated α4 integrins via inside-out signaling. Moreover. the N and C termini of one Hsp90 molecule simultaneously bound to two α4 tails. leading to dimerization and clustering of α4 integrins on the cell membrane and subsequent activation of the FAK-RhoA pathway. Abolishment of Hsp90-α4 interaction inhibited fever-induced T cell trafficking to draining lymph nodes and impaired the clearance of bacterial infection.

After internalization. LDL cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed to release free cholesterol. which then translocates to late endosomes (LEs)/lysosomes (LYs) and incorporates into the membranes by co‐ordinated actions of Niemann‐Pick type C (NPC) 1 and NPC2 proteins. However. how cholesterol exits LEs/LYs and moves to other organelles remain largely unclear. Growing evidence has suggested that nonvesicular transport is critically involved in the post‐endosomal cholesterol trafficking. Numerous sterol‐transfer proteins (STPs) have been identified to mediate directional cholesterol transfer at membrane contact sites (MCSs) formed between 2 closely apposed organelles.

1218306,Intracellular cholesterol transport by sterol transfer proteins at membrane contact sites,2019,Jie Luo and Lu-Yi Jiang and Hongyuan Yang and Bao-Liang Song,44,,3,273-292,Elsevier Current Trends,Cholesterol is dynamically transported among membrane-bound organelles primarily by nonvesicular mechanisms. Sterol transfer proteins (STPs) bind cholesterol in their hydrophobic pockets and facilitate its transfer across the aqueous cytosol. However. STPs alone may not account for the specific and efficient movement of cholesterol between intracellular membranes. Accumulating evidence has shown that membrane contact sites (MCSs). regions where two distinct organelles are in close apposition to one another. can facilitate STP-mediated cholesterol trafficking in a cell. At some MCSs. cholesterol can move against its concentration by using phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) metabolism as the driving force. Finally. the emergence of more MCSs and the discovery of a new STP family further highlight the crucial roles of MCSs and STPs in intracellular cholesterol transport.,True,BSsjQfsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,43,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000418302056,7033354752376287067,/scholar?cites=7033354752376287067,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bao-Liang_Song/publication/328821501_Intracellular_Cholesterol_Transport_by_Sterol_Transfer_Proteins_at_Membrane_Contact_Sites/links/5f1e9f4d299bf1720d680dc7/Intracellular-Cholesterol-Transport-by-Sterol-Transfer-Proteins-at-Membrane-Contact-Sites.pdf,0,0,0

For each chemical. the FELS test requires a minimum of 360 fish and 1 to 3 months from test initiation to termination. Although valuable for predicting fish full life-cycle toxicity. FELS tests are labor and resource intensive and. due to an emphasis on apical endpoints. provide little to no information about chemical mode of action. Therefore. the development and implementation of alternative testing strategies for screening and prioritizing chemicals has the potential to reduce the cost and number of animals required for estimating FELS toxicity and. at the same time. provides insights into mechanisms of toxicity.

A PEHA does not use an exposure distribution but rather uses a point estimate. which is useful for applications with sufficient effects data but lacking in comprehensive exposure data or when a criterion concentration is desired. The probability of finding an effect measure or potency value below a threshold can be calculated from the effects distribution. PEHA analyses using CTDs for both EC10 and EC25 Lemna gibba toxicity values indicated a <1% probability of encountering an antibiotic with toxicity below 1 μg/L.

We designed our assessment to include both the basic foundation needed by non experts and the detailed information needed by experts. Our assessment in cludes background information on acidic deposition (Chapter 1). an in-depth discussion of the nature of soil acidity and ecosystem H+ budgets (Chapter 2). and a summary of rates of deposition in the Southeastern US (Chapter 3). A discussion of the nature of forest soils in the region (Chapter 4) is followed by an overview of previous assessments of soil sensitivity to acidification (Chapter 5). The potential impacts of acidic deposition on forest nutrition are described in the context of the degree of current nutrient limitation on forest productivity (Chap ter 6). The results of simulations with the MAGIC model provided evaluations of the likely sensitivity of a variety of soils representative of forest soils in the South (Chapter 7). as well as a test of soil sensitivity criteria. Our synthesis and recommendations for research (Chapter 8) also serve as an executive summary. A complementary volume in the Springer-Verlag Ecological Studies series should be consulted for information on European forests. This volume.

The first modern attempts to understand the family were by the authors in Heywood et al.(1977) plus the paper by Cronquist (1977). which was initially intended to be in the Heywood publication. Literature prior to 1977 has been discussed in detail in other chapters (for the early literature. see Chapter 1). In Cronquist's 1977 paper he reaffirmed his agreement with Bentham's 13-tribe classification of the family and the concept that Heliantheae sl were the primitive members (Cronquist 1955; Bentham 1973a. b). Cronquist (1977) pointed out that the Heywood et al. volumes listed the tribes mostly in the order of Bentham 1873a rather than beginning with Heliantheae. which Bentham thought was most primitive (Bentham 1873b). The papers in the 1977 volumes did accept some changes such as the recognition of Liabeae and the conclusion that Helenieae were not a'good'group. both more or less accepted by Cronquist in 1977. However. most proposed changes such as the new tribe Coreopsideae. etc. were not accepted by the synantherological community. Cronquist (1977) believed that the primitive characters of the family were as follows (slightly modified): shrubby; leaves opposite; inflorescence cymose; heads few. each with many florets; involucre leafy. several-seriate; receptacle chaffy; ray florets present and fertile; disk florets perfect and fertile; lobes of the disk corollas with well developed mid-vein …,True,7giPdGwAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,67,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/11410/bot_2009_pr_Funk_etal_MetaTrees-NextGeneration.pdf,7320944907544761382,/scholar?cites=7320944907544761382,,https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/11410/bot_2009_pr_Funk_etal_MetaTrees-NextGeneration.pdf,0,0,0

1218380,Use of ISSR profiles and ITS-sequences to study the biogeography of alpine cushion plants in the genus Raoulia (Asteraceae),2003,RD Smissen and I Breitwieser and JM Ward and PA McLenachan and PJ Lockhart,239,Plant Systematics and Evolution,1,79-94,Springer-Verlag,Nuclear ITS sequences and ISSR profiles provide evidence that Raoulia rubra is endemic to the Tararua Range in the southern part of the North Island of New Zealand. Populations in the South Island previously ascribed to R. rubra are better ascribed to R. eximia. Our findings suggest that glaciation of the central mountains of the South Island during the last ice age have had a major impact on the evolution of the South Island cushion Raoulia species in New Zealand. However. simple hypotheses accounting for the effect of Pleistocene climate change are insufficient to explain patterns of endemism in the group. ,True,7giPdGwAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,29,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00606-002-0249-2,8303863705474868865,/scholar?cites=8303863705474868865,,,0,0,0

Gnaphalieae) is widely distributed in the Mediterranean basin. where it grows in continuous and widespread populations in diverse open habitats. Helichrysum italicum subsp. microphyllum has a disjunct distribution in the Balearic Islands (Majorca and Dragonera). Corsica. Sardinia. Crete and Cyprus. Numerous morphological intermediates between subsp. italicum and subsp. microphyllum are known from Corsica. where the two subspecies co‐occur. The aims of the study were to investigate if subsp. microphyllum has a common origin. constituting an independent gene pool from subsp. italicum. or if the morphological differences between subsp. microphyllum and subsp. italicum have arisen independently in different locations from a common wider gene pool.

Results indicate that on the basis of overall similarity in this suite of characters: (1) Leucogenes is a good genus; (2) an undescribed taxon of Inuleae is a distinct monotypic genus; (3) New Zealand species currently placed in Anaphalis. Cassinia. and Ewartia are generically distinct but are referred to the wrong genera; (4) similarity between species of Ewartia and Gnaphalium indicates that the boundary between these genera needs to be reassessed; (5) both Helichrysum and Raoulia are heterogeneous and need revision; (6) in New Zealand.

In this paper we evaluate the identity of putative hybrids between two species of Gnaphalieae endemic to New Zealand. Anaphalioides bellidioides and Ewartia sinclairii. The two species are occasionally sympatric in the north-east of the South Island and wild putative hybrids are rarely encountered. To test the hybridity hypothesis. specimens from nine putative hybrids were collected from one site and analysed for 76 morphological characters. The putative hybrids possessed predominantly intermediate or parental character states in comparison with A. bellidioides and E. sinclairii. Extreme traits were less common and a single novel character state was recorded in two hybrids only.

Those of Anaphalioides. Ewartia. Helichrysum. Leucogenes. Rachelia and Raoulia belong to a putatively monophyletic group which is supported by analysis of nuclear ITS DNA sequences and is virtually confined to New Zealand. All species of Craspedia. Euchiton. Ozothamnus and Pseudognaphalium are excluded from this group. A phylogenetic analysis of 42 species of Gnaphalieae. using 57 morphological. anatomical and palynological characters. was conducted to test the monophyly of this group and to seek evidence of generic relationships. The analysis does not resolve basal relationships among the Gnaphalieae studied here. The putative monophyletic New Zealand group is not retrieved. Monophyly is supported for each of Euchiton.

II. Allan Herbarium,INTRODUCTION: The scientific names of plants “provide a means of reference to facilitate communication about those organisms” (Turland 2013). Established over 300 years ago. the process of naming plants is today governed by the International Code of Nomenclature. with the names themselves anchored by a type specimen. In this electronic age the names remain a vital means of accessing and sharing information. As a result of new scientific research our understanding of plant species is constantly evolving. with old hypotheses being tested and new hypotheses of relationship being inferred as our knowledge improves. This expansion of our knowledge frequently leads to changes in the application of names and the publication of new names. A comprehensive list of names. including accepted names and their synonyms. and the relationship between names and their application. is important for anyone wanting to access and manage biological information.  At the Allan Herbarium (CHR). Manaaki Whenua — Landcare Research. the New Zealand Plant Names Database (PND) provides a contemporary account of the names of New Zealand indigenous and naturalised plants. The PND lists nearly 50.000 scientific names. primarily for hornworts. lichens. liverworts. mosses. ferns and seed plants in New Zealand. as well as some information for freshwater algae and our cultivated flora. The PND indicates which of the names are preferred for use at the Allan Herbarium. and provides information on the authorship and biostatus of the taxa. In addition to the scientific names. the PND is also used to record taxonomic concepts and associated …,True,7giPdGwAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,22,https://www.survey.unitec.ac.nz/handle/10652/4768,3616144094588237489,/scholar?cites=3616144094588237489,,https://www.survey.unitec.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10652/4768/Schoenberger_et_al._2019_Checklist_of_the_New_Zealand_Flora_Seed_Plants.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

The presence of 2187 vascular plant species. comprising 213141 georeferenced records. was mapped onto 0.12° grid cells and a genus-level phylogeny was constructed mainly from rbcL sequences used to calculate phylogenetic metrics. Previously identified centres of endemism were confirmed. and new areas of endemism were suggested. Patterns of endemism differ with taxonomic rank. Randomisations showed that the South Island mountains have greater species corrected weighted endemism (CWE) than expected. whereas the randomisations for genus CWE and genus corrected phylogenetic endemism (CPE) showed the northern half of the North Island and northern …,True,7giPdGwAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,22,http://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/sb16015,7554568302842270038,/scholar?cites=7554568302842270038,,,0,0,0
