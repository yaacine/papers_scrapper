124264,Genome-wide association study of 14.000 cases of seven common diseases and 3.000 shared controls,2007,Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium,447,,7145,661,Nature Publishing Group,There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population. which has examined∼ 2.000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of∼ 3.000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P< 5× 10-7: 1 in bipolar disorder. 1 in coronary artery disease. 9 in Crohn’s disease. 3 in rheumatoid arthritis. 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed. almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects.

Albumin is filtered into the proximal tubule in large quantities in nephrotic states. It has been proposed that this protein may have a toxic effect on tubular epithelial cells and may be responsible for the initiation of interstitial inflammation and scarring. The mitogenic effect of recombinant human albumin in wild-type opossum kidney cells and in similar cells transfected with a dominant negative p85 subunit (Δp85) of phopshatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been studied. This study demonstrates that recombinant human albumin stimulates proliferation of opossum kidney cells in culture. This effect is mediated via PI 3-kinase. and is inhibited by wortmannin and Δp85 expression.

Using the small molecule dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor PKI-166. we show that the biologic effects of EGFR/HER-2 pathway inhibition are caused by reduced AR transcriptional activity. Additional genetic and pharmacologic experiments show that this modulation of AR function is mediated by the HER2/ERBB3 pathway. not by EGFR. This HER2/ERBB3 signal stabilizes AR protein levels and optimizes binding of AR to promoter/enhancer regions of androgen-regulated genes.

Mutations in kinase-encoding genes can relieve the autoinhibitory constraints on kinase activity. can promote malignant transformation. and appear to be a major determinant of response to kinase inhibitor therapy. Missense mutations in the EGFR kinase domain. for example. have recently been identified in patients who showed clinical responses to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy.   Methods and Findings Encouraged by the promising clinical activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors in treating glioblastoma in humans. we have sequenced the complete EGFR coding sequence in glioma tumor samples and cell lines. We identified novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain of EGFR in 13.6% (18/132) of glioblastomas and 12.5% (1/8) of glioblastoma cell lines. These EGFR mutations were associated with increased EGFR gene dosage and conferred anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity to NIH-3T3 cells. Cells transformed by expression of these EGFR mutants were sensitive to small-molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors.   Conclusions Our results suggest extracellular missense mutations as a novel mechanism for oncogenic EGFR activation and may help identify patients who can benefit from EGFR kinase inhibitors for treatment of glioblastoma.,True,KzNSR6MAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,330,https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030485,3615002303286455192,/scholar?cites=3615002303286455192,,https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030485,0,0,0

The PARK2 mutations in cancer occur in the same domains. and sometimes at the same residues. as the germline mutations causing familial Parkinson's disease. Cancer-specific mutations abrogate the growth-suppressive effects of the PARK2 protein. PARK2 mutations in cancer decrease PARK2's E3 ligase activity. compromising its ability to ubiquitinate cyclin E and resulting in mitotic instability.

We have recently shown that coexpression of EGFRvIII and PTEN protein by glioblastoma cells is strongly associated with clinical response to EGFR kinase inhibitor therapy. PTEN loss. by dissociating inhibition of the EGFR from downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibition. seems to act as a resistance factor. Because 40% to 50% of glioblastomas are PTEN deficient. a critical challenge is to identify strategies that promote responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors in patients whose tumors lack PTEN.

Unlike lung cancers with EGFR kinase domain (KD) mutations. GBMs respond poorly to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Using RNAi. we show that GBM cells carrying EGFR EC mutations display EGFR addiction. In contrast to KD mutants found in lung cancer. glioma-specific EGFR EC mutants are poorly inhibited by EGFR inhibitors that target the active kinase conformation (e.g.. erlotinib). Inhibitors that bind to the inactive EGFR conformation. however. potently inhibit EGFR EC mutants and induce cell death in EGFR-mutant GBM cells.

PTEN null cells exhibit higher JNK activity. and genetic studies demonstrate that JNK functions parallel to and independently of AKT. Furthermore. PTEN deficiency sensitizes cells to JNK inhibition and negative feedback regulation of PI3K was impaired in PTEN null cells. Akt and JNK activation are highly correlated in human prostate cancer.

While many rare variants in synaptic proteins have been identified in patients with ASD. little is known about their effects at the synapse and their interactions with other genetic variations. Here. following the discovery of two de novo SHANK2 deletions by the Autism Genome Project. we identified a novel 421 kb de novo SHANK2 deletion in a patient with autism. We then sequenced SHANK2 in 455 patients with ASD and 431 controls and integrated these results with those reported by Berkel et al. 2010 (n = 396 patients and n = 659 controls). We observed a significant enrichment of variants affecting conserved amino acids in 29 of 851 (3.4%) patients and in 16 of 1.090 (1.5%) controls (P = 0.004. OR = 2.37. 95% CI = 1.23–4.70). In neuronal cell cultures. the variants identified in patients were associated with a reduced synaptic density at dendrites compared to the variants only detected in controls (P = 0.0013).

Mutations in SHANK genes have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). but their prevalence and clinical relevance remain to be determined. Here. we performed a new screen and a meta-analysis of SHANK copy-number and coding-sequence variants in ASD. Copy-number variants were analyzed in 5.657 patients and 19.163 controls. coding-sequence variants were ascertained in 760 to 2.147 patients and 492 to 1.090 controls (depending on the gene). and. individuals carrying de novo or truncating SHANK mutations underwent an extensive clinical investigation. Copy-number variants and truncating mutations in SHANK genes were present in ∼1% of patients with ASD: mutations in SHANK1 were rare (0.04%) and present in males with normal IQ and autism; mutations in SHANK2 were present in 0.17% of patients with ASD and mild intellectual disability; mutations in SHANK3 were present in 0.69% of patients with ASD and up to 2.12% of the cases with moderate to profound intellectual disability. In summary. mutations of the SHANK genes were detected in the whole spectrum of autism with a gradient of severity in cognitive impairment.

Monotonic functions such as the quadrupole mass spectrometric transmission efficiency may alter the centroid of the profile. but the shape of the ion abundance pattern appears to be controlled by the aqueous solution chemistry of the proteins.

Berman,3,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,4,281-288,,Aqueous metal salt solutions were used as models to probe the origin of the species observed in the electrospray mass spectrum. A qualitative or semiquantitative correlation among different species was observed between electrospray responses and calculated equilibrium aqueous solution concentrations. Quantitative correlations were obtained. however. when ions that were identical in charge and similar in type were selected for comparison. In these experiments the ions experienced very similar electrospray-related processes and their effects on the responses were canceled in a comparison of these ions. Consequently. the relative abundances of these ions in the electrospray mass spectrum closely matched the calculated relative abundances in aqueous solution.

Some fully developed cells contain at least two large vacuoles. with different functions. Remarkably. even a single vacuole may be subdivided and fulfil several functions. which are supported in part by the vacuolar membrane transport systems.

124341,Human microRNA targets,2004,Bino John and Anton J Enright and Alexei Aravin and Thomas Tuschl and Chris Sander and Debora S Marks,2,,11,e363,Public Library of Science,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. The specific function of most mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted target sites on the 3′ untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2.000 human genes with miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about 250 human genes conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes sequence complementarity using position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment of predicted targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include mRNAs coding for transcription factors. components of the miRNA machinery. and other proteins involved in translational regulation. as well as components of the ubiquitin machinery. representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation. Detailed information about target genes. target processes. and open-source software for target prediction (miRanda) is available at http://www.microrna.org.

These three factors also strongly influence the fatty acid composition of beef. Both the amount of marbling and the concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) increase with time on feed in grain-fed and pasture-fed cattle. but much more dramatically in grain-fed cattle. High-concentrate diets stimulate the activity of adipose tissue stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). which is responsible for the conversion of saturated fatty acids (SFA) to their 9 desaturated counterparts. Also. grain feeding causes a depression in ruminal pH. which decreases those populations of ruminal microorganisms responsible for the isomerization and hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The net result of elevated SCD activity in marbling adipose tissue and depressed ruminal isomerization/hydrogenation of dietary PUFA is a large increase in MUFA in beef over time. Conversely. pasture depresses both the accumulation of marbling and SCD activity. so that even though pasture feeding increases the relative concentration of PUFA in beef. it also increases SFA at the expense of MUFA. Wagyu and Hanwoo cattle accumulate large amounts of marbling and MUFA. and Wagyu cattle appear to be less sensitive to the effects of pastures in depressing overall rates of adipogenesis and the synthesis of MUFA in adipose tissues.

Recent genomic and molecular evolutionary analyses have provided insight into how this critical system arrived at its modern configuration. The apparent relative absence of prokaryotic antecedents for the endomembrane machinery contrasts with the situation for mitochondria. plastids and the nucleus. Overall. the evidence suggests an autogenous origin for the eukaryotic membrane-trafficking machinery. The emerging picture is that early eukaryotic ancestors had a complex endomembrane system. which implies that this cellular system evolved relatively rapidly after the proto-eukaryote diverged away from the other prokaryotic lines.

In many cases. RNAi may be phenotypically equivalent to a true knockout. but the continued presence of the gene means that the method is distinct. Following the pioneering use of RNAi as an investigative tool in Caenorhabditis elegans. the technique has been successfully applied to organisms ranging from kinetoplastida. fungi. green plants. planaria. dipterans. teleosts to most recently mammals. including humans [1–4]. Furthermore. the presence of RNAi across the plant. fungal and animal kingdoms. with relatively little variation in mechanism. suggests that the range of organisms suitable for RNAi may extend even further. RNAi is based on the delivery of a double stranded RNA molecule to the target cell that is identical. at the sequence level. to the gene of interest; this dsRNA is cleaved to short fragments which base-pair with the endogenous mRNA. hence targeting this species for destruction [5]. The delivery methods are varied. but as specificity is based only upon the target DNA sequence. the possibility of cross-or co-suppression between closely related genes is a major potential cause of artefacts; these are difficult and laborious to detect by direct monitoring of nontargetted open reading frames (ORFs).

However. considering factors from a wider diversity of eukaryotes can provide both functional information on core systems and insight into the evolutionary history of the trafficking machinery.

The large variations in the cell content of these two compounds in response to different environmental changes indicate that their metabolism is controlled by complex regulatory systems. In this review we present information on the regulation of the activity of the enzymes implicated in the pathways of synthesis and degradation of glycogen and trehalose as well as on the transcriptional control of the genes encoding them. cAMP and the protein kinases Snf1 and Pho85 appear as major actors in this regulation. From a metabolic point of view. glucose-6-phosphate seems the major effector in the net synthesis of glycogen and trehalose.

A compulsory step is the selection of good reference genes for normalization. A few genes often referred to as HouseKeeping Genes (HSK). such as ACT1. RDN18 or PDA1 are among the most commonly used. as their expression is assumed to remain unchanged over a wide range of conditions. Since this assumption is very unlikely. a geometric averaging of multiple. carefully selected internal control genes is now strongly recommended for normalization to avoid this problem of expression variation of single reference genes. The aim of this work was to search for a set of reference genes for reliable gene expression analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From public microarray datasets. we selected potential reference genes whose expression remained apparently invariable during long-term growth on glucose. Using the algorithm geNorm. ALG9. TAF10. TFC1 and UBC6 turned out to be genes whose expression remained stable. independent of the growth conditions and the strain backgrounds tested in this study. We then showed that the geometric averaging of any subset of three genes among the six most stable genes resulted in very similar normalized data. which contrasted with inconsistent results among various biological samples when the normalization was performed with ACT1. Normalization with multiple selected genes was therefore applied to transcriptional analysis of genes involved in glycogen metabolism.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). its structurally related peptide urocortin (Ucn) and their receptors are also present in the skin and their levels are increased following stress. Human mast cells synthesize and secrete both CRF and Ucn in response to immunoglobulin E receptor (FcεRI) crosslinking. Mast cells also express CRF receptors. activation of which leads to the selective release of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Thus. we propose that CRF receptor antagonists could be used …,True,gzoVZ9MAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,317,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165614704002573,466160852133762357,/scholar?cites=466160852133762357,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45772970/j.tips.2004.09.00720160519-27274-hafjha.pdf,0,0,0

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent chemoattractant of monocytes; however. its role in the pathophysiology of restenosis is still unclear. We set out to investigate the role of MCP-1 in restenosis after PTCA.

CoV-19 binds to TLRs (key molecules in triggering innate immunity) of macrophages. dendritic cells and mast cells. causing an inflammatory cytokine storm with respiratory distress syndrome. Activation of TLR in the lung due to CoV-19 can promote vascularization and hyperemia with the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that aggravate the state of the patient with COVID-19 (5). The presence of two X chromosomes in women affects the immune system even if one is inactive. The X chromosome acts on various elements of the immune system such as FOXP3. TLR7. TLR8. CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations (6). In CoV-19 infection. plasma viral load levels are lower in women than in men. while CD4+ T cells are higher. demonstrating higher response of the immune system in women. In addition. after vaccination. women generally produce in the circulation higher levels of antibodies. which have longer life than in men. The immune regulatory genes encoded by the X chromosome in the female gender cause lower viral load levels. inflammation and death after CoV-19 infection (7). Furthermore. the levels of activation of the immune cells influenced by sex hormone are higher in women than in males. and this is correlated with the activation of TLR7 and the production of IFN.

The increased expression and synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases and inflammatory factors is mediated by specific signal transduction. in particular the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated pathways. NF-kB and MAPK have been identified as the master regulators of inflammation and catabolism in several musculoskeletal disorders (e.g.. osteoarthritis). and recently growing evidence supports the importance of these signalling pathways in painful disc disease. With continuing research exploiting in vitro and in vivo model systems to elucidate the roles of these pathways in disc degeneration. it may be possible in the near future to specifically target these major inflammatory / catabolic signalling pathways to treat painful degenerative disc disease. In this perspective. we aim to summarise the current state of knowledge concerning the inflammatory and catabolic molecular pathways of intervertebral disc disease (IDD). with a detailed description of NF-kB and MAP kinase-mediated signal transduction in disc cells.

Methods and Findings We investigated the expression and function of VEGF and VEGF receptors in breast cancer cells. We observed that VEGFR1 expression was abundant. VEGFR2 expression was low. and NRP1 expression was variable. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. transfected with antisense VEGF cDNA or with siVEGF (VEGF-targeted small interfering RNA). showed a significant reduction in VEGF expression and increased apoptosis as compared to the control cells. Additionally. specifically targeted knockdown of VEGFR1 expression by siRNA (siVEGFR1) significantly decreased the survival of breast cancer cells through down-regulation of protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation. while targeted knockdown of VEGFR2 or NRP1 expression had no effect on the survival of these cancer cells. Since a VEGFR1-specific ligand. placenta growth factor (PGF). did not. as expected. inhibit the breast cancer cell apoptosis induced by siVEGF. and since VEGFR1 antibody also had no effects on the survival of these cells. we examined VEGFR1 localization.

PA]: The Association. c1990-2002.,The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by breast tumors has been previously correlated with a poor prognosis in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Furthermore. VEGF secretion is a prerequisite for tumor development. Although most of the effects of VEGF have been shown to be attributable to the stimulation of endothelial cells. we present evidence here that breast tumor cells are capable of responding to VEGF. We show that VEGF stimulation of T-47D breast cancer cells leads to changes in cellular signaling and invasion. VEGF increases the cellular invasion of T-47D breast cancer cells on Matrigel/fibronectin-coated transwell membranes by a factor of two. Northern analysis for the expression of the known VEGF receptors shows the presence of moderate levels of Flt-1 and low levels of Flk-1/KDR mRNAs in a variety of breast cancer cell lines. T-47D breast cancer cells bind 125I-labeled VEGF with a Kd of 13 10 9 M. VEGF induces the activation of the extracellular regulated kinases 1. 2 as well as activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Akt. and Forkhead receptor L1.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The interaction between 17β‐estradiol and estrogen receptor alpha (ER‐α) plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis and breast cancer treatment. ER‐α is a critical growth regulatory gene in breast cancer and its expression level is tightly linked to the prognosis and treatment outcomes of breast cancer patients. Loss of ER‐α expression in breast epithelial cells is critical for breast cancer progression. The underlying molecular mechanisms for this loss. however. are poorly defined. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are implicated in the alteration of chromatin assembly and tumorigenesis. We show that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) interacts with ER‐α in vitro and in vivo and suppresses ER‐α transcription activity.

One example is DYT1 dystonia. a neurodevelopmental disease caused by an in-frame deletion (Δgag) in the gene encoding torsinA. Here we show that neurons from both torsinA null (Tor1a−/−) and homozygous disease mutant “knockin” mice (Tor1aΔgag/Δgag) contain severely abnormal nuclear membranes. although non-neuronal cell types appear normal. These membrane abnormalities develop in postmigratory embryonic neurons and subsequently worsen with further neuronal maturation. a finding evocative of the developmental dependence of DYT1 dystonia. These observations demonstrate that neurons have a unique requirement for nuclear envelope localized torsinA function and suggest that loss of this activity is a key molecular event in the pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia.,True,hS6hfqUAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,352,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305009529,15520818882198080090,/scholar?cites=15520818882198080090,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305009529,0,0,0

Here. we have examined the role of introgressive hybridisation in transferring adaptations between mimetic Heliconius butterflies. taking advantage of the recent identification of a gene regulating red wing patterns in this genus. By sequencing regions both linked and unlinked to the red colour locus. we found a region that displays an almost perfect genotype by phenotype association across four species. H. melpomene. H. cydno. H. timareta. and H. heurippa. This particular segment is located 70 kb downstream of the red colour specification gene optix. and coalescent analysis indicates repeated introgression of adaptive alleles from H. melpomene into the H. cydno species clade.

Mimetic insects are known for their diversity of patterns as well as their remarkable evolutionary convergence. and they have played an important role in controversies over the respective roles of selection and constraints in adaptive evolution. Here we contrast three butterfly species. all classic examples of Müllerian mimicry. We used a genetic linkage map to show that a locus. Yb. which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of Heliconius melpomene. maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr. which has very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore. the same genomic location acts as a “supergene”. determining multiple sympatric morphs in a third species. H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic appearance. whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the genus Melinaea. Other unlinked colour pattern loci map to a homologous linkage group in the co-mimics H. melpomene and H. erato. but they are not involved in mimetic polymorphism in H. numata. Hence. a single region from the multilocus colour pattern architecture of H. melpomene and H. erato appears to have gained control of the entire wing-pattern variability in H. numata. presumably as a result of selection for mimetic “supergene” polymorphism without intermediates.

Further understanding requires a deeper insight into the topology of the branches of the Indian mtDNA phylogenetic tree. which should be contextualized within the phylogeography of the neighboring regional mtDNA variation. Accordingly. we have analyzed mtDNA control and coding region variation in 796 Indian (including both tribal and caste populations from different parts of India) and 436 Iranian mtDNAs. The results were integrated and analyzed together with published data from South. Southeast Asia and West Eurasia. Four new Indian-specific haplogroup M sub-clades were defined.

124580,Role of microRNAs in breast cancer,2013,Ramesh Singh and Yin-Yuan Mo,14,,3,201-212,Taylor & Francis,MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of post-transcriptional gene regulators with critical functions in normal cellular processes as well as disease processes. They are small molecules with 18~23 nucleotides in length. Since their early discovery in 1993. a large number of miRNAs have been characterized and analyzed to understand their pivotal role and their impact in a myriad of biological processes. Substantial research on miRNA highlights the involvement of these tiny RNAs in the etiopathogenesis of a variety of human diseases such as cancer. neuro-degenerative disorders. diabetes. cardiac hypertrophy and respiratory diseases. In this review. we update on recent advances of the emerging role of miRNAs in breast cancer and their clinical implications.,True,KlXevj0AAAAJ:kbDB7uaqCfAC,106,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cbt.23296,14250048940813288187,/scholar?cites=14250048940813288187,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.4161/cbt.23296,0,0,0

ABCG1 and RXR α expression and cholesterol homeostasis,2013,YK Adlakha and S Khanna and R Singh and VP Singh and A Agrawal and N Saini,4,Cell death & disease,8,e780-e780,Nature Publishing Group,Aberrant regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is associated with obesity as well as multiple types of cancer. However. the mechanism behind these is largely missing. Here. we show that microRNA (miRNA)-128-2 is not only a pro-apoptotic microRNA but it also alters the expression of genes involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol efflux via ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCA1 and ABCG1) is a mechanism for cells to eliminate excess cholesterol and prevent cellular cholesterol accumulation. The regulation of these pathways is complex with transcriptional regulation by sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (RXR) transcription factors but poorly understood at the post-transcriptional levels. MiR-128-2 increases the expression of SREBP2 and decreases the expression of SREBP1 in HepG2.

This method is capable of detecting the glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugates of pyrene as well as free 1-hydroxypyrene in a single analysis. In comparison to other analytical methods for detecting pyrene metabolites. this new method does not require an overnight enzymatic hydrolosis step and is a much more rapid method of analysis. The newly developed procedure involves solid phase extraction of pyrene metabolites followed by separation using HPLC with a phenyl modified reverse phase column and an acidic buffer and acetonitrile gradient elution system. Metabolites were detected using a fluorescence detector with wavelength conditions optimized for each metabolite.

Intermittent GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of the gonadotropins. LH and FSH. LH and FSH then stimulate sex steroid hormone synthesis and gametogenesis in the gonads to ensure reproductive competence. The pituitary requires pulsatile stimulation by GnRH to synthesize and release the gonadotropins LH and FSH. Clinically. native GnRH is used in a pump delivery system to create an episodic delivery pattern to restore hormonal defects in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Agonists of GnRH are delivered in a continuous mode to turn off reproductive function by inhibiting gonadotropin production. thus lowering sex steroid production. resulting in medical castration.

Substituting a compound diet for live prey was performed several weeks after hatching. depending on the species. Compound diets were well ingested at the early stage but larvae died with a gut full of food. suggesting that larvae were unable to digest the compound diet. The hypothesis was that younger larvae have insufficient digestive enzymes to thrive on compound diets. and that exogenous enzymes. provided from live prey. are necessary for early stages.The organogenesis of marine fish larvae is not completely achieved at hatching and histological studies have revealed that the anatomy of the digestive tract undergoes developmental changes over some weeks.

In most Bayesian approaches to such advice. relatively few of the model parameters used can be treated as uncertain. and deterministic assumptions about population dynamics are required; this can bias the degree of certainty and estimates of policy performance indices.

This can be counteracted with the use of informative Bayesian prior distributions (priors) for model parameters. We develop priors for the intrinsic rate of increase (r) in the Schaefer surplus production model using demographic methods and illustrate the utility of this with an application to large coastal sharks in the  Atlantic. In 1996. a U.S. stock assessment obtained a point estimate for r of 0.26. For such long-lived and low-fecund organisms. this could potentially be too high. Yet it was used to predict that within about 10 years. a 50% reduction in the 1995 catch level should result in >50% chance of increasing the population to the abundance required to …,True,gUQrrA8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,226,https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f01-114,6829643508657620514,/scholar?cites=6829643508657620514,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.601.3574&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

There is some support for the hypothesis that carcharhinid species that complete their life-cycle within coral reef ecosystems. hereafter referred to as “reef sharks”. are more abundant inside no-take marine reserves due to a reduction in fishing pressure (i.e.. they benefit from marine reserves). Key predictions of this hypothesis are that (a) individual reef sharks exhibit high site-fidelity to these protected areas and (b) their relative abundance will generally be higher in these areas compared to fished reefs. To test this hypothesis for the first time in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems we combined acoustic monitoring and baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to measure reef shark site-fidelity and relative abundance. respectively. We focused on the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). the most common reef shark in the Western Atlantic. at Glover's Reef Marine Reserve (GRMR). Belize. Acoustically tagged sharks (N = 34) were detected throughout the year at this location and exhibited strong site-fidelity. Shark presence or absence on 200 BRUVs deployed at GRMR and three other sites (another reserve site and two fished reefs) showed that the factor “marine reserve” had a significant positive effect on reef shark presence. We rejected environmental factors or site-environment interactions as predominant drivers of this pattern.

COSMOS. and ELAIS-S1) with redshifts from the Prism Multi-object Survey to identify 242 AGNs with L 2-10 keV= 10 42-44 erg s–1 within a parent sample of~ 25.000 galaxies at 0.2< z< 1.0 over~ 3.4 deg 2 and to i~ 23. We find that although the fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN at fixed X-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass. the distribution of X-ray luminosities is independent of mass. Furthermore. we show that the probability that a galaxy will host an AGN can be defined by a universal Eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxy stellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope–0.65.

The precise functions of the S region are controversial. although transcription of the S region targets CSR. We have tested the effects of deletion. inversion and replacement of the endogenous 12-kilobase S γ1 region on CSR in vivo. Here we show that S γ1 is required for CSR. that CSR is effected by a 1-kilobase sequence that generates a G-rich transcript. and that inversion of S γ1 or the G-rich sequence decreases CSR. We conclude that S γ1 function is dependent on orientation and lacks an absolute requirement for common S region motifs.

The sizes of the small cliques are derived using random graph theory. This clustering algorithm leads to a natural parallel implementation in which multiple processors are used to identify clusters simultaneously. We also present a cluster-based partitioning method in which our clustering algorithm is used as a preprocessing step to both the bisection algorithm by Fiduccia and Mattheyses and a ratio-cut algorithm by Wei and Cheng. Our results show that cluster-based partitioning obtains cut sizes up to 49.6% smaller than the bisection algorithm. and obtains ratio cut sizes up to 66.8% smaller than the ratio-cut algorithm.

The segmental approach necessitates defining and locating the physical demarcation between both the trunk and leg and the trunk and arm.
