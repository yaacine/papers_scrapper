These methods are used mostly (but not only) for the determination of the aromaticity and antiaromaticity of molecules and ions. both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ghost atom that serves as the NICS probe senses the induced magnetic field and reports it in the form of an NMR chemical shift. However. the source of the field cannot be determined by NICS. Thus. in a multi‐ring system that may contain more than one induced current circuit (and therefore more than one source of the induced magnetic field) the NICS value may represent the sum of many induced magnetic fields. This may lead to wrong assignments of the aromaticity (and antiaromaticity) of the systems under study.

Current-density maps for these isomeric phenylenes are typically dominated by strong paratropic ring currents in four-membered rings. The relative energies of the isomers. which differ only through the effects of differential strain and aromaticity. were computed at the B3LYP/6-311G* computational level. It was found that the three levels of CDA correlate well among themselves and with NICSπzz. The latter correlation is improved when the ring sum ∑NICSπzz for each isomer is correlated to the ring-current sum ∑J extracted from CDA. The strain-corrected relative energies of the isomers correlate linearly with ∑NICSπzz.

We now report on an expansion of the methodology to include systems of varying aromatic natures containing the heteroatoms B. N. O. and S. The additivity approach allows for rapid and resource‐efficient generation of NICS‐XY‐Scans of large. complex systems.

Herein we present a peptide–metal framework that consists of helical oligoproline ligands and Zn/K (or Zn/Rb). The crystalline network contains pleated nanosheets with the metal ions aligned in strings. This unprecedented architecture derives from under-appreciated London dispersion interactions between the oligoproline ligands that play in concert with the metal coordination to create the network. Hence. the secondary structure of the peptidic ligand represents an additional control element for the creation of new MOF architectures.

To examine the substituents' effect on the corannulene bowl depth. optimized structures for the highly-congested decakis(t-butylsulfido)corannulene were calculated.

No. 6 437 high-resolution and dynamic imaging. While existing techniques utilize steric bulk to effect rigidity. the design principle applied by Yamaguchi is based on planar. π-system structural motifs. in combination with main group atoms. including boron. sulfur. phosphorus. silicon. Specifically. the introduction of boron doping affords remarkable stability of extended π-framework carbon radicals. For near-IR (NIR). he has designed tropylium-core based systems. which have the dual advantage of small size and an extended π-system. rendering them soluble and stable. The versatile nature of this strategy enables red-shifting of the dye by changing the substituent–from 510 nm with oxygen to 582 nm with silicon to 627 nm with phosphoxide–without affecting the core. which means that the solubility is not adversely affected. Another successful structural motif is the phosphole indole. which allows selective staining of lipid droplets and affords much enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.

These tissues support the structure of the body. hold and protect the organs. and are responsible of movement. Since it is subjected to continuous strain. the musculoskeletal system is prone to injury by excessive loading forces or aging. whereas currently available treatments are usually invasive and not always effective. Most of the musculoskeletal injuries require surgical intervention facing a limited post-surgery tissue regeneration. especially for widespread lesions. Therefore. many tissue engineering approaches have been developed tackling musculoskeletal tissue regeneration. Materials are designed to meet the chemical and mechanical requirements of the native tissue three-dimensional (3D) environment. thus facilitating implant integration while providing a good reabsorption rate. With biological systems operating at the nanoscale. nanoengineered materials have been developed to support and promote regeneration at the interprotein communication level.

Tension exerted from cell membrane receptors bound to extracellular matrix ligands is transmitted by the cytoskeleton to the cell nucleus inducing gene expression. Here. we used dendrimer-based arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD) uneven nanopatterns. which allow the control of local surface adhesiveness at the nanoscale. to unveil the adhesive requirements of mesenchymal tenogenic and osteogenic commitments. Cell response was found to depend on the tension resulting from cell–substrate interactions. which affects nuclear morphology and is regulated by focal adhesion size and distribution.

During chondrogenesis. the extracellular matrix continuously evolves. adapting to the tissue adhesive requirements at each stage. Here. we take advantage of previously developed nanopatterns. in which local surface adhesiveness can be precisely tuned. to investigate its effects on prechondrogenic condensation. Fluorescence live cell imaging. immunostaining. confocal microscopy and PCR analysis are used to follow the condensation process on the nanopatterns. Cell tracking parameters. condensate morphology. cell–cell interactions. mechanotransduction and chondrogenic commitment are evaluated in response to local surface adhesiveness. Results show that only condensates on the nanopatterns of high local surface adhesiveness are stable in culture and able to enter the chondrogenic pathway. thus highlighting the importance of controlling cell–substrate adhesion in the tissue engineering strategies for cartilage repair.

The conditions necessary for good heteronuclear decoupling are derived. An analysis of a few of the decoupling schemes implemented until date is presented with regard to satisfying such decoupling conditions and efficiency of decoupling. Resonance conditions for efficient heteronuclear dipolar decoupling are derived with and without the homonuclear H1–H1 dipolar couplings and their influence on heteronuclear dipolar decoupling is pointed out. The analysis points to the superior efficiency of the newly introduced swept two-pulse phase-modulation (SWf-TPPM) sequence.

Ltd.,Recently. a sequence for heteronuclear dipolar decoupling in solid‐state NMR. namely SWf‐TPPM. was introduced by us. Under magic‐angle spinning (MAS). the decoupling efficiency of the sequence was unaffected over a range of values for various experimental parameters such as the pulse length. pulse phase. and 1H resonance offset. We here demonstrate its use in multiple‐quantum (MQ) and high‐resolution (HR) MAS experiments. This sequence further improves the MQMAS spectra compared to the earlier reported decoupling sequences with improved immunity to any missets of the pulse length. pulse phase and decoupler offset. In contrast. for HRMAS. the simple CW scheme is as efficient as any of the decoupling schemes that were studied. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons.

1210248,Design and Analysis of Heteronunlear Dipolar Decoupling Schemes in Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,2008,Rajendra Singh Thakur,,,,,,Interactions in NMR are inherently anisotropic. having different values in different directions. This can be understood from the example of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA). Chemical shift arises from shielding of magnetic field felt at nucleus by electron distribution. Anisotropic electron density around the nuclei leads to CSA. Large CSA values are associated with groups having highly anisotropic electon distribution making carbonyl groups to have larger CSA compared to aliphatic groups. The orientation dependence leads to a term of the form (3cos2 θ-1) associated with CSA. The orientation dependence is common to all NMR interactions with similar behavior. Anisotropic interaction causes line broadening in powdered sample having random orientation of crystallites. Some other interactions relevant for later sections will be introduced now. Spins are magetic dipoles and influence each other by through-space dipolar interactions. Dipolar coupling is termed homonuclear or heteronuclear when spins involved belong to same or different nuclei. The pair of coupled spins have different relative orientation with respect to external magnetic field resulting in anisotropy of the form (3cos2 θ-1) associated with dipolar coupling. Homonuclear and heteronuclear couplings behave differently as few terms are negligible under heteronuclear condition.

However. the effects of heavy metals in stormwater runoff on microbial characteristics and organics removal in bioretention systems are unclear. In this study. two lab scale bioretention columns including the control and lead (Pb) treatment with the soil and filler layer were established. The changes of organic matter and lead in the effluent water and the soil (or fillers) were monitored during 121 operation days. The soil (or fillers) microbial characteristics were also analyzed. The results showed that most of Pb was intercepted by soil. while a small amount accumulated in fillers after 121 days.

The effect of annealing on the electrical properties of the diodes has been studied by the analysis of the capacitance-voltage characteristics. This analysis shows that the Al 2 O 3  densification annealing can largely decrease the Al 2 O 3 /Si interface state density bringing it to the state of the art values. Current-Voltage analysis shows a direct tunneling mechanism of transport through 2 nm alumina barrier. This result shows that Al 2 O 3  has all the prerequisites to be used as a tunnel barrier for coherent spin injection into silicon.,True,oaDq6XcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5393832/,,,,,0,0,0

However. the direct transformation of CO2-to-C2H4 suffers from CO2 loss to carbonate. consuming up to 72% of energy input. A cascade approach—coupling a solid-oxide CO2-to-CO electrochemical cell (SOEC) with a CO-to-C2H4 membrane electrode assembly (MEA)—would eliminate CO2 loss to carbonate. However. this approach requires a CO-to-C2H4 MEA with energy efficiency well beyond demonstrations to date. Focusing on the MEA. we find that an N-tolyl substituted tetrahydro-bipyridine film improves the stabilization of key reaction intermediates. while an SSC ionomer enhances CO transport to the Cu surface. enabling a C2H4 faradaic efficiency of 65% at 150 mA cm−2 for 110 h.

Due to few and/or dysfunctional endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). it is difficult to successfully construct EPC capture TEBVs in diabetes. RNA has a potential application in cell protection and diabetes treatment. but poor specificity and low efficiency of RNA transfection in vivo limit the application of RNA. On the basis of an acellular vascular matrix. we propose an aptamer–siRNA chimera-modified TEBV that can maintain a satisfactory patency in diabetes. This TEBV consists of two parts. CD133-adenosine kinase (ADK) chimeras and a TEBV scaffold. Our results showed that CD133-ADK chimeras could selectively capture the CD133-positive cells in vivo. and then captured cells can internalize the bound chimeras to achieve RNA self-transfection.

However. the expression of PD-L1 and its prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients remain debated. Meanwhile. the molecular features of PD-1’s other ligand. namely PD-L2. as well as its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and HCC tumor microenvironment (TME). are still poorly understood. In this study. immunohistochemistry (IHC) data from 304 HCC patients were used to determine the clinicopathological features of PD-L1 and PD-L2 and their correlation with CD8+ T cells in HCC. Moreover. fresh clinical HCC samples were used to identify the immune cell subtypes expressing PD-L1 and PD-L2. By using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. we further assessed the correlation between mutation signature. copy number variation (CNV). number of neoepitopes. immune gene expression. immune/stromal cell infiltration to the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. While membrane expression of PD-L2 was observed in 19.1% of tumor samples. no obvious expression of PD-L1 was detected on tumor cell membranes. High membrane expression of PD-L2 was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). High expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in immune stroma were both associated with poorer OS. Flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence showed that macrophages were the main immune cell subtype expressing both PD-L1 and PD-L2.

Moreover. the oligomeric state of p7 remains controversial. as both hexamer and heptamer have been proposed. Here we address the above issues using p7 reconstituted in bicelles that mimic a lipid bilayer. We found. using a recently developed oligomer-labeling method. that p7 forms hexamers in the bicelles.

Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. we determine the structure of an Env segment encompassing the TMD and a large portion of the CT in bicelles.

Crude oil (liquid petroleum) was easily transportable source of energy. concentrated and flexible from of fuel. At the beginning of the 20th century the industrial revolution had progressed to the extent that the oil industry became the major supplier of the energy. largely because of the advent of automobile. The oil achieved a primary importance as an energy source on which the world economy depends. The growth in the energy production during the 20th century was unprecedented and is the major contributor to the growth. On the time scale within the human history. the utilization of oil as a major source of energy will be affair of a few centres. but it will have profound effect on world industrialization.The crude oils are mostly based on two elements carbon and hydrogen and almost all crude oil ranges from 82-87% carbon and 12-15% hydrogen. Crude oil contains three basic chemical series: paraffins. naphthenes. and aromatics.

In this paper one such model is considered where inelastic deformations are accounted for via conservation laws for elastic strain with relaxation source terms. Plastic deformations are governed by the relaxation time of tangential stresses. Compared with alternative Eulerian conservative models. the governing system consists of fewer equations overall. A numerical scheme for the inhomogeneous system is proposed based upon the temporal splitting. In this way the reduced system of non‐linear elasticity is solved explicitly. with convective fluxes evaluated using high‐order approximations of Riemann problems locally throughout the computational mesh.

India,Depth profiles of chlorinity. nutrients. pH and alkalinity in interstitial waters from high porosity. carbon rich sediment cores of Gorai creek (near Bombay) were studied in different seasons to evaluate temporal changes in relation to their concentrations in the overlying creek water. The high chlorinity creek water infiltrating in the bed after September. progressively pushed down the monsoonal low chlorinity water trapped in the sediment resulting in a well-defined chlorinity minimum at the intermediate depth which progressively mi grated downwards as the dry season advanced. In the presence of high  concentrations of NO3--N throughout the core lengths. the occurrence of high Talk was attributed to the enhanced rate of surface microbial activity and its subsequent downward transport with chlorinity. The inorganic products (NO3--N. NO2- -N. NH4+-N. PO43--P) of aerobic oxidation of organic matter accumul ated in the 0-4 cm sediment section before their transport. The nature of NO3--N profile suggested its generation in the surficial sediment followed by utilization in the intermediate level with the consumption rate decreasing in the bottom sections. An intermediate maxima of NH4+-N and PO43-P prevailed in most cores which gradually shifted downwards with chlorinity. A continuous build -up of NH4+-N in the interstitial waters unlike other nutrients was evident.

LiMn2O4. Li3V2(PO4)3. and Mg-doped Li3V2(PO4)3) using synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). For the well-known anode material Li4Ti5O12. XAS provides an explanation for the ‘‘Zero-strain’’ characteristic of the material; there is. as expected. an increase in Ti-O distance reduction but no change in Ti-Ti distance. consistent with the added lithium pulling the oxide anions closer together. allowing the Ti-O distance to expand. with negligible change in the lattice parameter. XAS showed that when the spinel LiMn2O4 cathode is annealed. there is a slight increase in the average Mn oxidation state. In-situ XAS studies of another cathode material. Li3V2(PO4)3. showed the presence of significant kinetic effects such that the measured electrochemical behavior does not represent the bulk vanadium. There are only two distinct vanadium species when the cathode is cycled between 3.0 and 4.5 V. However. when the potential exceed 4.5 V a third vanadium species is formed. consistent with the formation of V5+. The data suggest that a portion of the V5+ can migrate to empty Li sites. indicating a possible explanation for capacity loss at high potential. If a portion of the V is replaced with Mg giving Li3V(2-2/3x)Mgx(PO4)3. the electrochemical performance. cycling retention and stability increase up to X~0.30.

However. investigation of suitable solid support in enzyme immobilization is still a scientific challenge. Polyethersulfone (PES) and aminated PES (PES–NH 2) were successfully synthesized as novel materials for immobilization. Membranes with various pore sizes (from 10–600 nm) based on synthesized PES and PES–NH 2 polymers were successfully fabricated to be applied as bioreactors to increase the immobilized lipase performances. The influence of pore sizes. concentration of additives. and the functional groups that are attached on the PES backbone on enzyme loading and enzyme activity was studied. The largest enzyme loading was obtained by Mucor miehei lipase immobilized onto a PES–NH 2 membrane composed of 10% of PES–NH 2. 8% of dibutyl phthalate (DBP). and 5% of polyethylene glycol (PEG)(872.62 µg/cm 2). Hydrolytic activity of the immobilized lipases indicated that the activities of biocatalysts are not significantly decreased by immobilization. From the reusability test. the lipase immobilized onto PES–NH 2 showed a better constancy than the lipase immobilized onto PES (the percent recovery of the activity of the lipases immobilized onto PES–NH 2 and PES are 97.16% and 95.37%. respectively). which indicates that this novel material has the potential to be developed as a bioreactor for enzymatic reactions.

A halophilic bacterium of the Halomonas elongata BK-AG25 has successfully produced ectoine with high productivity. To overcome the drawbacks of high levels of salt in the production process. a nonhalophilic bacteria of Escherichia coli (E. coli) was used to express the ectoine gene cluster of the halophilic bacteria. and the production of ectoine by the recombinant cell was optimized. Methods. The ectoine gene cluster from the halophilic bacterium was isolated and inserted into an expression plasmid of pET30(a) and subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Production of ectoine from the recombinant E. coli was investigated and then maximized by optimizing the level of nutrients in the medium. as well as the bioprocess conditions using response surface methodology. The experimental designs were performed using a central composite design. Results. The recombinant E. coli successfully expressed the ectoine gene cluster of Halomonas elongata BK-AG25 under the control of the T7 promoter. The recombinant cell was able to produce ectoine. of which most were excreted into the medium. The optimization of ectoine production with the response surface methodology showed that the level of salt in the medium. the incubation temperature. the optical density of the bacteria before induction. and the final concentration of the inducer gave a significant effect on ectoine production by the recombinant E. coli. Interestingly. the level of salt in the medium and the incubation temperature showed an inverse effect on the production of intracellular and extracellular ectoine by the recombinant cell.

High wax content in crude oil will lead to high intermolecular interaction because of the increasing cohesion forces. It causes interfacial (IFT) tension between oil and brine to be high. Hence. oil recovery is relatively low.

The determination of corrosion inhibition efficiency (% eff) utilising weight loss method at the concentration of 80 ppm showed the best result of 78.70% for third isolated fraction. Further determination utilising Tafel method showed the following results: raw pure extract of curcuminoid gave 89.88% at 50 ppm; the first isolated fraction gave 46.50% at 80 ppm; the second isolated fraction gave 44.83% at 30 ppm; and the third isolated fraction gave 92.44% at 70 ppm. Based on the analysis of Tafel extrapolation curve. the raw pure extract and the third fraction of curcuminoid acted as anodic inhibitor. whereas the first and the second fraction performed as cathodic inhibitors. The evaluations of synergism parameter (Sθ) indicate that the enhancement in inhibition efficiency towards raw pure extract was caused by the presence of second and third fractions as cathodic and anodic inhibitors.

Contact conductivity has traditionally been limited by the interaction of the separation voltage with the detection electrodes because the applied field creates a voltage difference between the electrodes. leading to unwanted electrochemical reactions. To minimize the voltage drop between the conductivity electrodes and therefore improve compatibility. a novel bubble cell detection zone was designed. The bubble cell permitted higher separation field strengths (600 V/cm) and reduced background noise by minimizing unwanted electrochemical reactions.

To etch microfluidic channels. a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device was reversibly sealed on a CaF2 plate and acid was pumped through the channel network to perform anisotropic etching of the underlying CaF2 surface. To complete the CaF2 microfluidic device. another CaF2 plate was sealed over the etched channel using a 700 nm thick layer of PDMS adhesive. The impact of different acids and their concentrations on etching was studied. with HNO3 giving the best results in terms of channel roughness and etch rates.

Despite its resolving power. CZE can be insufficient for separating ions with similar mobilities. One remedy is to modify mobilities via the addition of background electrolyte complexation agents. However. this approach is not straightforward for inorganic anions. which lack complexation options. To address this shortfall. the diprotonated diamine moiety was investigated for complexation of dianions. Dicationic diamines significantly complexed dianions. and this interaction was not purely electrostatic in nature because affinities varied with dianion identity.

Due to their high number concentration. low mass concentration. unique size range. and high temporal and spatial variability. atmospheric aerosols represent a significant unknown in both environmental impact and human health.  Despite the importance of aerosols. current instrumentation for monitoring their chemical composition is often limited by poor temporal resolution. inadequate detection limits. lack of chemical speciation. and/or high cost.  To help address these shortcomings. microchip electrophoresis (MCE) has been introduced for the semi-continuous monitoring of water-soluble aerosol composition.

Our model was built using extendable atom-types. where each atom is distilled down into a 6 digit number. and each individual atom is assumed to have a small additive effect on the overall logP of the molecule.

In the current work. we augment our dataset with pK a values from a series of high performing local models derived from the Ab Initio Bond Lengths method (AIBL). We find that. in distilling the knowledge available from multiple models into one general model. the prediction error for an external test set is reduced compared to that using literature experimental data alone.

1210807,The cAMP pathway amplifies early MyD88-dependent and type I interferon-independent LPS-induced interleukin-10 expression in mouse macrophages,2019,Orna Ernst and Yifat Glucksam-Galnoy and Muhammad Athamna and Iris Ben-Dror and Hadar Ben-Arosh and Galit Levy-Rimler and Iain DC Fraser and Tsaffrir Zor,2019,Mediators of inflammation,,,Hindawi,Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine. secreted by macrophages and other immune cells to attenuate inflammation. Autocrine type I interferons (IFNs) largely mediate the delayed expression of IL-10 by LPS-stimulated macrophages. We have previously shown that IL-10 is synergistically expressed in macrophages following a costimulus of a TLR agonist and cAMP. We now show that the cAMP pathway directly upregulates IL-10 transcription and plays an important permissive and synergistic role in early. but not late. LPS-stimulated IL-10 mRNA and protein expression in mouse macrophages and in a mouse septic shock model. Our results suggest that the loss of synergism is not due to desensitization of the cAMP inducing signal. and it is not mediated by a positive crosstalk between the cAMP and type I IFN pathways. First. cAMP elevation in LPS-treated cells decreased the secretion of type I IFN. Second. autocrine/paracrine type I IFNs induce IL-10 promoter reporter activity only additively. but not synergistically. with the cAMP pathway. IL-10 promoter reporter activity was synergistically induced by cAMP elevation in macrophages stimulated by an agonist of either TLR4. TLR2/6. or TLR7. receptors which signal via MyD88. but not by an agonist of TLR3 which signals independently of MyD88. Moreover. MyD88 knockout largely reduced the synergistic IL-10 expression. indicating that MyD88 is required for the synergism displayed by LPS with cAMP.

The γ-CD derivative. with a β-naphthyl alanine residue attached in its primary face. exhibits potent binding capacity with DOX. The encapsulation efficiency was assessed under various temperatures and pHs and it was demonstrated that the carrier-DOX inclusion complex is highly stable under a wide range of acidic conditions (pH 1.0–7.0); however. the encapsulated drug is slowly released under hyperthermic conditions (up to 50 C). Cell culture studies showed that the complexation of DOX with the carrier protected the drug from being uptaken by the cells and also greatly reduced its toxicity. Thermo-triggered DOX release was validated and the increase in cellular uptake was observed in in-vitro experiments.

Our experimental and numerical studies reveal the emergence of a slight charge imbalance between crystallographically inequivalent sites. relaxor dielectric response. and hopping dc transport. In a broader perspective we conclude that the universal properties of strongly-correlated charge-transfer salts with spin liquid state are an anion-supported valence band and cyanide-induced quasidegenerate electronic configurations in the relaxed state. The generic low-energy excitations are caused by charged domain walls rather than by fluctuating electric dipoles. They give rise to glassy dynamics characteristic of dimerized Mott insulators. including the sibling compound κ−(BEDT− TTF) 2 Cu 2 (CN) 3.,True,9MRTWikAAAAJ:BzfGm06jWhQC,37,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.161105,17790956130788521760,/scholar?cites=17790956130788521760,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.07596,0,0,0

The energy loss of non-dissociated molecules is independent of the crystal azimuth at small incidence angles. while the dissociation probability is not. The kinetic energy released in the dissociation is much larger than that expected from a consideration of the momentum transfer in elastic atom-atom collisions.

Solutions of the moment equations correspond to changes in the ensemble average for any function of ion velocity. because the Boltzmann equation reflects changes to an ion distribution as a whole. The function of primary interest in this paper is the ion effective temperature and its behavior during ion storage and resonance excitation. Calculations suggest that increases in ion effective temperature during resonance excitation are due primarily to power absorption from the main RF trapping field rather than from the dipolar excitation signal. The dipolar excitation signal apparently serves mainly to move ions into regions of the ion trap where the RF electric field. and thus ion RF heating. is greater than near the trap center.

They are obtained by means of an efficient computing procedure combining the results of a Monte Carlo simulation. The computer codes TRIM are used. The 2D-target atom redistribution is obtained as a results of cascade binary collisions. Using a computer simulation. the effect of near-mask-edge targets atom depletion is revealed.

Each particle trajectory was calculated independently on the previous one up to the threshold of the motion energy E stop. Defects were estimated using cascade model. The precise computer code TRIMCASC was used. Monte Carlo simulation was integrated using the method of finite elements. The distributions were linear approximations and were measured in a concentration per-dose units.

Cundari,,Journal of American Chemical Society,,,,The use of hydride species for substrate reductions avoids strong reductants. and may enable nitrogenase to reduce multiple bonds without unreasonably low redox potentials. In this work. we explore the NN bond cleaving ability of a high-spin iron(II) hydride dimer with concomitant release of H2. Specifically. this diiron(II) complex reacts with azobenzene (PhNNPh) to perform a four-electron reduction. where two electrons come from H2 reductive elimination and the other two come from iron oxidation. The rate law of the H2 releasing reaction indicates that diazene binding occurs prior to H2 elimination. and the negative entropy of activation and inverse kinetic isotope effect indicate that H–H bond formation is the rate-limiting step. Thus. substrate binding causes reductive elimination of H2 that formally reduces the metals. and the metals use the additional two electrons to cleave the N–N multiple bond.,True,wREui-oAAAAJ:A_-8YG8SPFQC,26,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b04654,7073186380841998718,/scholar?cites=7073186380841998718,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5499983/,0,0,0

We describe an end-to-end deep learning approach that operates directly on small-molecule conformational ensembles and identifies key conformational poses of small-molecules. Our networks leverage two levels of representation learning: 1) individual conformers are first encoded as spatial graphs using a graph neural network. and 2) sampled conformational ensembles are represented as sets using an attention mechanism to aggregate over individual instances. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on a simple task based on bidentate coordination of biaryl ligands. and show how attention-based pooling can elucidate key conformational poses in tasks based on molecular geometry. This work illustrates how set-based learning approaches may be further developed for small molecule-based virtual screening.,True,HThiDv8AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12820,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12820,0,0,0

Just as a pipe rendered in an oil painting cannot be smoked. quantum mechanical coupling pathways rendered on LCDs do not convey electrons. The aim of this Account is to examine some of our recent discoveries regarding biological electron transfer (ET) and transport mechanisms that emerge when one moves beyond treacherous static views to dynamical frameworks.Studies over the last two decades introduced both atomistic detail and macromolecule dynamics to the description of biological ET. The first model to move beyond the structureless square-barrier tunneling description is the Pathway model. which predicts how protein secondary motifs and folding-induced through-bond and through-space tunneling gaps influence kinetics.

However. these ET reactions may involve multiple redox cofactors in van der Waals contact with each other and with vibronic broadenings on the same scale as the energy gaps among the species. In this regime. fluctuations of the molecular structures and of the medium can produce transient energy level matching among multiple electronic states. This transient degeneracy. or flickering electronic resonance among states. is found to support coherent (ballistic) charge transfer. Importantly. ET rates arising from a flickering resonance (FR) mechanism will decay exponentially with distance because the probability of energy matching multiple states is multiplicative.

We use theory. modeling. and simulation to explore the conformational dynamics of DNA three-way junctions (TWJs) that may control the flow of charge through these structures. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum calculations indicate that DNA TWJs undergo dynamic interconversion among “well stacked” conformations on the time scale of nanoseconds. a feature that makes the junctions very different from linear DNA duplexes.

Our method has quantitative accuracy in systems with small redox potential differences (ă kBT) and provides qualitative insights into systems with wide redox potential differences ("" kBT). Specifically. we find that the temporal correlations of site energies are critical in determining the coherent-incoherent transition. while the role of spatial correlations depends on the nature of the systems. In a system with repeated bridge units of the same chemistry. spatially correlated fluctuations enhance the charge delocalization and charge-transfer rates; however. in a system of units with different site energies. spatial correlations slow the fluctuations to bring units into degeneracy. iv",True,z46SwHsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/14395/Liu_duke_0066D_13843.pdf?sequence=1,,,,https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/14395/Liu_duke_0066D_13843.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Uganda,2010,Jolocam Mbabazi and J Kwetegyeka and M Ntale and J Wasswa,5,African Journal of Agricultural Research,24,3431-3439,Academic Journals,The population of the Ugandan capital city of Kampala has dramatically increased since the political turmoil of the 1970s and with it a considerable rise in industrialisation. Few manufacturing plants. however. have pretreatment installations in place for their polluted effluent prior to discharge into the surrounding ecosystems. Kampala’s main drainage system is the Nakivubo channel which empties directly into the neighbouring Lake Victoria. the second largest inland freshwater lake in the world. Increased urban effluent load coupled with reclamation for crop farming have considerably reduced the effectiveness of the wetland to filter out major pollutants. in particular heavy metals. Using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. this study showed that the efficiency in sieving out zinc (Zn). copper (Cu). cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) has shrunk from 89.7–98.3% in December 2006 to 79.4–92.1% in December 2008. over a period of three consecutive years. This is indicative of the growing ineffectiveness of the wetland to absorb heavy metals. Levels of the same metals in the lake water some two kilometres away from the mouth of the wetland have correspondingly increased from 23-31% to 35-47% in the same period. This poses a serious threat to the quality of the fish and to the over two million urban population that directly depend on the lake water for domestic and industrial use.

In Uganda. 440 Children die every week of waterborne diseases. High prevalence of this death is reported in the peri urban areas. It is still unclear however the causes of water pollution in the peri-urban areas. The improper use of onsite sanitation facilities such as latrines and septic systems may lead to groundwater contamination. It is true that drain field of septic system located too close to water point. and or over population of the septic systems in a small area can lead to pollution of groundwater. Our study investigated the impact of septic systems density and nearness to water points on spring water quality. Samples from 15 spring wells were analysed for pH. nitrate and faecal coliform contamination. Locations and distances of spring from septic systems were determined using global positioning system (GPS) device and ArcGIS software. respectively. Water samples from all the spring wells had pH value less than 6.5. 66.7% had faecal coliform and 53% had nitrate above 2 mg L-1. While sample from one of the springs had nitrate concentration above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) standard of 10 mg L-1. It was also noted that coliform counts and nitrate concentrations increases with increase in number of septic systems surrounding the spring well. In addition. increase in distance between spring wells and septic systems indicated decrease in both coliform counts and nitrate concentration.

This calls for the need to find alternative antioxidants from natural products. Tagetes minuta (Asteraceae) is an annual herb that belongs to the Asteraceae family. It is used in common medicine and grows in temperate regions of South America. some parts of Africa and Asia. Essential oil from T. minuta was obtained by hydrodistillation while solvent extracts were obtained using ethyl acetate and methanol. Antioxidative compounds of T. minuta were isolated both from the Ethyl acetate extract and the essential oil. It was done by determining the scavenging activity using 2. 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhaydrazyl free radical (DPPH) using thin layer chromatography (TLC). The active compounds were tested quantitatively for their radical scavenging activity using the U-1100 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer. The active fractions were isolated using TLC and High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and later detected using both Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). One pure active compound was obtained from the ethylacetate extract (neophytadene) by a combintion of GC-MS and NMR.

Portunus trituberculatus and Scylla paramamosain are important commercial culture crab species in China. Traditional factory breeding of crabs depends on Artemia nauplius. The rising price of Artemia cysts has led to the decline of the economic benefit of the crab breeding factory. Factory crab breeding has been gradually replaced by pond breeding in recent years. E. sinensis and P. trituberculatus have been bred mainly in ponds. Meanwhile. S. paramamosain is still mainly bred in factories because of the crudeness of pond breeding. The research progress on food organism utilization in the three species of commercially bred crabs was reviewed in this paper. In the workshop seeds production. rotifer and Artemia nauplii were necessary in the early stages from zoea I to zoea II in the three crab species. Adult artemia. minced fish and shellfish were fed to the larvae in the later zoea stages from zoea III to Megalopa. The rising of the price of artemia eggs made people find other feed organism to replace artemia.

CHO-K1 cells bathed in high (16.1 mS/cm; HCS) or low (1.8 mS/cm; LCS) conductivity solutions were exposed to either one unipolar (300-ns) or two opposite polarity (300 + 300-ns; bipolar) nsEP (4–40 kV/cm) with increasing interpulse intervals (0.1–50 μs). Time-lapse YO-PRO-1 (YP) uptake revealed enhanced membrane permeabilization in LCS compared to HCS at all tested voltages.

Inducers of immunogenic cell death (ICD) rely on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress for the trafficking of danger signals such as calreticulin (CRT) and ATP. We found that nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF). an emerging new modality for tumor ablation. cause the activation of the ER-resident stress sensor PERK in both CT-26 colon carcinoma and EL-4 lymphoma cells. PERK activation correlates with sustained CRT exposure on the cell plasma membrane and apoptosis induction in both nsPEF-treated cell lines. Our results show that. in CT-26 cells. the activity of caspase-3/7 was increased fourteen-fold as compared with four-fold in EL-4 cells. Moreover. while nsPEF treatments induced the release of the ICD hallmark HMGB1 in both cell lines. extracellular ATP was detected only in CT-26. Finally. in vaccination assays. CT-26 cells treated with nsPEF or doxorubicin equally impaired the growth of tumors at challenge sites eliciting a protective anticancer immune response in 78% and 80% of the animals. respectively. As compared to CT-26. both nsPEF-and mitoxantrone-treated EL-4 cells had a less pronounced effect and protected 50% and 20% of the animals. respectively.

This bipolar cancellation feature makes bipolar nsEP less efficient at biostimulation than unipolar nsEP. We propose to minimize stimulation near pulse-delivering electrodes by applying bipolar nsEP. whereas the superposition of two phase-shifted bipolar nsEP from two independent sources yields a biologically-effective unipolar pulse remotely. This is accomplished by electrical compensation of all nsEP phases except the first one. resulting in the restoration of stimulation efficiency due to cancellation of bipolar cancellation (CANCAN-ES).

1211126,13 Biofuels from Vegetable Oils as Alternative Fuels,2017,Nabel A Negm and Maram TH Abou Kana and Mona A Youssif and Mona Y Mohamed,5,"Surfactants in Tribology, Volume 5",,289,CRC Press,Biodiesel. a mixture of fatty acid monoalkyl esters. is obtained by transesterification of vegetable oils. animal fats. or used frying oils. with short-chain alcohols. such as methanol or ethanol. in the presence of a catalyst [1]. Because biodiesel properties strongly depend upon the fatty acid profiles of the feedstock. they can be tuned using raw materials containing components that will provide more favorable properties to biodiesels. Thus. prediction of the physical property for biodiesels makes it possible to optimize biodiesel production and blending processes. with the final aim of improving the fuel performance in the engine. particularly during atomization. One of the most important properties of biodiesel in the application field is atomization. Atomization is the breakup of bulk liquid jets into small droplets using an atomizer or spray [2]. Adequate atomization enhances mixing and complete combustion in a direct injection engine. and therefore it is an important factor in engine emission and efficiency. This applies to microturbines and gas turbines as witnessed in the need for an atomizer in gas turbines when diesel is being used. A correct atomization allows for proper mixing and complete combustion in an injection engine. reducing emissions and increasing the engine efficiency [3]. Surface tension property has a major impact on fuel atomization. that is. the first stage of combustion [4]. Higher surface tensions make the drop formation of biodiesel difficult. leading to an inefficient fuel atomization. Furthermore. just like most biodiesel properties. surface tension increases with long fatty acid hydrocarbon (HC) chains and a level of unsaturated bonds [5 …,True,YcsbWlMAAAAJ:pS0ncopqnHgC,7,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3jsPEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA289&dq=info:1-qLPVTy9IoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_PXq_DlHpr&sig=LwPoq9tEGTT6dgGqqPyl5jIdrRI,10012894315175209687,/scholar?cites=10012894315175209687,,https://scholar.cu.edu.eg/sites/default/files/maramaboukana/files/biofuels_from_vegetable_oils_as_alternative_fuels_advantages_and_disadvantages.pdf,0,0,0

Traditional radical cyclization. which is based on radical addition as the key step. necessitates the use of unsaturated substrates. Guided by the concept of metalloradical catalysis. a different mode of radical cyclization that can employ saturated C−H substrates is demonstrated through the development of a Co(II)-based system for catalytic activation of aliphatic diazo compounds for enantioselective radical alkylation of various C(sp3)−H bonds. It allows for efficient construction of chiral pyrrolidines and other valuable 5-membered cyclic compounds. This alternative strategy of radical cyclization provides a new retrosynthetic paradigm to prepare five-membered cyclic molecules from readily available open-chain aldehydes through the union of C−H and C=O elements for C−C bond formation.,True,mPAdUh8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,68,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.8b01662,15485260761845502077,/scholar?cites=15485260761845502077,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905427/,0,0,0

In order to minimize losses at the interface between the fullerene and the electrode. it is important to reduce the energy difference between the transport level of the two materials. A common approach to reduce such energy mismatch is to increase the charge carrier density in the semiconductor through doping. A variety of molecular dopants have been reported to reduce (n-dope) fullerenes. However. most of them are either difficult to process or extremely air sensitive. with most n-dopants leading to the formation of undesirable side products. Dimers formed by 19-electron organometallic sandwich compounds combine strong reducing ability. clean reactivity. and moderate air stability. while being processable both from solution and in vacuum.

KGaA,Hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites (from now on referred to as hybrid perovskites) have been known since the past century [1. 2]. but only recently they have emerged as a promising class of semiconducting materials. This renaissance is due to their extraordinary performances in solar cells where. in only few years of development. power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 22% have been demonstrated [3. 4]. Ideally. the highest performing solar cells will operate in the radiative limit. where the absorbed photon flux is equal to the emitted flux. under open circuit conditions. This is because the electronic transitions governing radiative recombination are also responsible for light absorption. Therefore. light emission cannot be avoided and. in efficient solar cells. one should minimize the non-radiative recombination since it involves states which are not related to absorption. While this concept might sound counterintuitive. the optical reciprocity has been demonstrated to apply in a number of photovoltaic devices [5–10]. In fact. the external quantum efficiency for electroluminescence of photovoltaic (EQE devices. EL) is and a useful it scales figure with of the merit device for comparing efficiency (Figure the performance 3.1. 1)[9].,True,Mkct7jcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5nt-DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA201&dq=info:qdhGDAgminYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Q6kFQaTnYd&sig=tBQuwwHhqcMA40S-QNCenZAWzCo,,,,,0,0,0

Up to now. thin 2D perovskite layers on the surface and/or at the grain boundaries of 3D perovskites have been deposited solely by solution processing. leading to unavoidable intermixing between the two phases. In this work. we report the fabrication of 2D/3D/2D perovskite heterostructures by dual-source vacuum deposition. with the aim of studying the interaction between the 3D and 2D phases as well as the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites in neat 2D/3D interfaces. Unlike what is normally observed in solution-processed 3D/2D systems. we found a reduced charge transport with no direct evidence of surface passivation. in spite of larger open-circuit voltage. This is likely due to a nonfavorable orientation of the 2D perovskite with respect to methylammonium lead iodide and to the formation of 2D phases with very low dimensionality (pure 2D).,True,Mkct7jcAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://mobiroderic.uv.es/handle/10550/75090,,,,https://mobiroderic.uv.es/bitstream/handle/10550/75090/135539.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

This process can give the opportunity to tune the surface-functionalities in a controlled manner and improve optoelectronic properties of SiNCs.

Potential energy surfaces for the various electronic states arising from (d6d6) (1+). (d5d6) (2+) and (d5d5) (3+) configurations are explored. Somewhat counterintuitively. the bulky groups on the phosphine ligands are found to have most effect when the Ru–Ru bonding is strongest. The origin of this trend has been traced to the nature of the steric interactions. which are largely between the bridging halides and the substituents on the phosphine. As the Ru–Ru bond contracts. a concertina-like motion displaces the halides away from the trigonal axis and towards the phosphine substituents.

Technological advances with hybrid and advanced computer-assisted technologies such as MR/PET. MR/US. multi-parametric US. and robotic biopsy systems. have resulted in improved diagnosis and staging of patients in various stages of PCa with changes in treatment that may be considered “personalized”. Whilst newer clinical trials incorporate these novel imaging modalities into study protocols and as long-term data matures. patients should be made aware of the potential benefits and harm related to these technologies. Published literature needs to report longer-term treatment efficacy. health economic outcomes. and adverse effects. False positives and negatives of these imaging modalities have the potential to cause harm and the limitations of these technologies should be appreciated. The role of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) and a shared-decision-making model are important to ensure that all aspects of the novel imaging modalities are considered.

1211439,Griffithsin: an antiviral lectin with outstanding therapeutic potential,2016,Sabrina Lusvarghi and Carole A Bewley,8,,10,296,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Griffithsin (GRFT). an algae-derived lectin. is one of the most potent viral entry inhibitors discovered to date. It is currently being developed as a microbicide with broad-spectrum activity against several enveloped viruses. GRFT can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at picomolar concentrations. surpassing the ability of most anti-HIV agents. The potential to inhibit other viruses as well as parasites has also been demonstrated. Griffithsin’s antiviral activity stems from its ability to bind terminal mannoses present in high-mannose oligosaccharides and crosslink these glycans on the surface of the viral envelope glycoproteins. Here. we review structural and biochemical studies that established mode of action and facilitated construction of GRFT analogs. mechanisms that may lead to resistance. and in vitro and pre-clinical results that support the therapeutic potential of this lectin.

In this study. we explored factors that may lead to tivantinib resistance. especially in regards to its interaction with ATP-binding cassette super-family G member 2 (ABCG2). ABCG2 is one of the most important members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. a group of membrane proteins that play a critical role in mediating multidrug resistance (MDR) in a variety of cancers. including those of the liver and lung. Tivantinib received a high score in docking analysis. indicating a strong interaction between tivantinib and ABCG2. and an ATPase assay indicated that tivantinib stimulated ABCG2 ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. An MTT assay showed that ABCG2 overexpression significantly desensitized both the cancer cells and ABCG2 transfected-HEK293 cells to tivantinib and that this drug resistance can be reversed by ABCG2 inhibitors. Furthermore. tivantinib upregulated the protein expression of ABCG2 without altering the cell surface localization of ABCG2. leading to increased resistance to substrate drugs. such as mitoxantrone. Altogether. these data demonstrate that tivantinib is a substrate of ABCG2. and. therefore. ABCG2 overexpression may decrease its therapeutic effect.

Also. an MTT assay indicated that sitravatinib at 3 μM had the ability to restore the antineoplastic effect of various ABCG2 substrates in both drug-selected and gene-transfected ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines. In further tritium-labeled mitoxantrone transportation study. sitravatinib at 3 μM blocked the efflux function mediated by ABCG2 and as a result. increased the intracellular concentration of anticancer drugs. Interestingly. sitravatinib at 3 μM altered neither protein expression nor subcellular localization of ABCG2. An ATPase assay demonstrated that ATPase activity of ABCG2 was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner with sitravatinib; thus. the energy source to pump out compounds was interfered. Collectively. the results of this study open new avenues for sitravatinib working as an ABCG2 inhibitor which restores the antineoplastic activity of anticancer drugs known to be ABCG2 substrates.,True,b2h8KuYAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,8,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.00700/full,5835318583108493927,/scholar?cites=5835318583108493927,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.00700/full,0,0,0

To understand the role of transmembrane helices (TMH) 1 and 7 in drug-binding and transport. we selected six residues from both TMH1 (V53. I59. I60. L65. M68 and F72) and TMH7 (V713. I719. I720. Q725. F728 and F732); and substituted them with alanine by gene synthesis to generate a variant termed “TMH1.7 mutant P-gp”. The expression and function of TMH1.7 mutant P-gp with twelve mutations was characterized using the BacMam baculovirus-HeLa cell expression system. The expression and conformation of TMH1.7 mutant P-gp was not altered by the introduction of the twelve mutations. as confirmed by using the human P-gp-specific antibodies UIC2. MRK16 and 4E3. We tested 25 fluorescently-labeled substrates and found that only three substrates. NBD-cyclosporine A. Rhod-2-AM and X-Rhod-1-AM were transported by the TMH1.7 mutant. The basal ATPase activity of TMH1.7 mutant P-gp was lower (40–50%) compared to wild-type (WT) P-gp. despite similar level of expression. Although most of the substrates modulate ATPase activity of P-gp. the activity of TMH1.7 mutant transporter was not significantly modulated by any of the tested substrates. Docking of selected substrates in homology models showed comparable docking scores for the TMH1.7 mutant and WT P-gp. although the binding conformations were different. Both the ATPase assay and in silico docking analyses suggest that the interactions with residues in the drug-binding pocket are …,True,b2h8KuYAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,8,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204693,6880437128939487339,/scholar?cites=6880437128939487339,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204693,0,0,0

The emergence of multidrug-resistant cancers has driven efforts from researchers to develop innovative strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. Based on the drug repurposing approach. we discovered an additional action of TMP195. a potent and selective inhibitor of class IIa histone deacetylase. We reveal that in vitro TMP195 treatment significantly enhances drug-induced apoptosis and sensitizes multidrug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing ABCB1 or ABCG2 to anticancer drugs. We demonstrate that TMP195 inhibits the drug transport function. but not the protein expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2. The interaction between TMP195 with these transporters was supported by the TMP195-stimulated ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2. and by in silico docking analysis of TMP195 binding to the substrate-binding pocket of these transporters. Furthermore. we did not find clear evidence of TMP195 resistance conferred by ABCB1 or ABCG2. suggesting that these transporters are unlikely to play a significant role in the development of resistance to TMP195 in cancer patients.

1211474,Discrete time processing of RF signals,2011,Renaldi Winoto and BORIVOJE Nikolic and G Hueber and RB Staszewski,,,,219-245,Wiley-IEEE Press,Signal processing in a radio-frequency (RF) receiver consists of three fundamental elements: frequency translation. filtering. and amplification. These three elements are necessary in order to precondition the RF signal so that efficient analog-to-digital conversion of the signal desired can follow [1]. Filtering in an RF receiver. which is the main subject of this chapter. is used to cope with the large dynamic range of the input signal. The RF signal desired is sensed at the RF receiver’s antenna. along with all other electromagnetic signals that are present in the environment. Analog filters can eliminate large unwanted signals and thereby relax the dynamic-range requirements of subsequent blocks. particularly the dynamic-range requirements of an analog-todigital converter (ADC). Alternatively. some filtering in the analog domain can be transferred to the digital domain if a suitably high-dynamic-range ADC is available. Several factors must be considered in designing analog filters for an RF receiver. First and foremost are the traditional linear circuit design metrics: noise. power consumption. and distortion. Second. it is often desirable to have a precise. and programmable. corner or stopband frequency. Having precise control over the corner frequency is important. because in many cases the most troublesome blockers are those located close to the desired frequency band. If the corner frequency is not defined precisely. there is a risk of either filtering out part of the signal of interest or not sufficiently attenuating the out-of-band blockers. The programmability of the corner frequency is becoming more important with the proliferation of a variety of wireless …,True,2t9FtVcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,11,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=kc1eCPzuMbgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA219&dq=info:ev9bs6FG2UYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=au6KxeCww-&sig=qZN6Maazrmag9vCMZ7QZljr05Ys,5105189312913997690,/scholar?cites=5105189312913997690,,,0,0,0

1211490,Peak-to-Average Power Control in OFDM Systems,2006,Renaldi Winoto,16,"EE229B Project, publication date Sep",,12,,High Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) has been recognized as one of the major practical problem involving OFDM modulation. High PAPR results from the nature of the modulation itself where multiple subcarriers/sinusoids are added together to form the signal to be transmitted. When N sinusoids add. the peak magnitude would have a value of N. where the (rms) average might be quite low due to destructive interference between the sinusoids. High PAPR signals are usually undesirable for it usually strains the analog circuitry. High PAPR signals would require a large range of dynamic linearity from the analog circuits. which usually results in expensive devices. and higher power consumption/lower efficiency (for example. power amplifier has to operate with larger backoff to maintain linearity).It’s quite straightforward to observe that in an OFDM systems. some input sequences would result in higher PAPR than others. For example. an input sequence that requires all subcarriers to transmit their maximum amplitudes would certainly result in a high output PAPR. Thus by limiting the possible input sequences to a smallest subset. it should be possible to obtain output signals with a guaranteed low output PAPR. At the same time. by limiting input sequences to a smaller subset we also provide the system with more resiliency in the presence of noise–this idea is central in the area of error-control codes. Thus the question is can we set up a framework such that we can jointly optimize the selection of codewords based on both their PAPR and minimum distance performance.,True,2t9FtVcAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,2,https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ananth/229BSpr05/Reports/RenaldiWinoto.pdf,17104509620404324237,/scholar?cites=17104509620404324237,,https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ananth/229BSpr05/Reports/RenaldiWinoto.pdf,0,0,0

The specific surface area of these catalysts changes by about 8% between the calcination temperature of 300 C and 500 C. However. it greatly decreases beyond 500 C. It has been noted that. when impregnating copper and cerium on alumina. copper has a higher effect upon the specific area compared to cerium's effect. and that the nitrates' decomposition on alumina takes place in temperature ranging between 200 C and 400 C. It has been also noted that. when reducing these catalysts at different temperatures with an atmosphere of hydrogen. the more the percentage of copper is higher in the catalysts. the more easily the copper oxide reduces. The use of CeO2 as a support. decreases the reduction temperature of copper oxide Cu+ 2 compared to Al2O3.
