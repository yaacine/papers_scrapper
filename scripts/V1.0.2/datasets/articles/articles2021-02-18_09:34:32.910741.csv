Fucus vesiculosus (FV). and Cladosiphon okamuranus (CO). two chemically modified fucoidans with a higher degree of sulfation (SL-S. CO-S). and a synthetic totally sulfated octasaccharide (OS). related to fucoidans. were assessed on anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities in different in vitro experiments. The effects were shown to depend on the structural features of the compounds tested. Native fucoidan SL with a degree of sulfation (DS) of 1.3 was found to be the most active sample. fucoidan FV (DS 0.9) demonstrated moderate activity. while the polysaccharide CO (DS 0.4) was inactive in all performed experiments. even at high concentrations. Additional introduction of sulfate groups into fucoidan SL slightly decreased the anticoagulant effect of SL-S. while sulfation of CO. giving rise to the preparation CO-S. increased the activity dramatically. The high level of anticoagulant activity of polysaccharides SL. SL-S. and CO-S was explained by their ability to form ternary complexes with ATIII-Xa and ATIII-IIa. as well as to bind directly to thrombin. Synthetic per-O-sulfated octasaccharide OS showed moderate anticoagulant effect. determined mainly by the interaction of OS with the factor Xa in the presence of ATIII. Comparable tendencies were observed in the antithrombotic properties of the compounds tested.

This study investigated the accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the liver and their role in liver inflammation. We found that the accumulation of immature myeloid cells. i.e.. CD11b+Ly6ChiLy6G− cells. in the liver of B6 mice fed a high‐fat diet contribute to liver inflammation. Adoptive transfer of CD11b+Ly6ChiLy6G− cells isolated from the liver of obese B6 mice. but not from lean B6 mice. resulted in liver damage that was evident by an increase in the activity of liver transferases in serum.

Generally conserved from mice to humans. innate lymphoid cells (ILC) have been divided primarily into 3 subpopulations based on phenotypic and functional repertoires: ILC1 bear similarities to natural killer (NK) cells; ILC2 have overlapping functions with TH2 cells; and ILC3 that share many functions with TH17/TH22 cells. ILC are specifically enriched at mucosal surfaces and are possibly one of the earliest responders during viral infections besides being involved in the homeostasis of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and maintenance of gut epithelial barrier integrity. Burgeoning evidence also suggests that there is an early and sustained abrogation of ILC function and numbers during HIV and pathogenic SIV infections. most notably ILC3 in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. which leads to disruption of the mucosal barrier and dysregulation of the local immune system. A better understanding of the direct or indirect mechanisms of loss and dysfunction will be critical to immunotherapeutics aimed at restoring these cells.

Recent studies also suggest nuances in phenotypic and functional characteristics among NK cell subsets may further permit execution of regulatory and adaptive roles. Animal models. particularly non-human primate (NHP) models. are critical for characterizing NK cell biology in disease and under homeostatic conditions. In HIV infection. NK cells mediate multiple antiviral functions via upregulation of activating receptors. inflammatory cytokine secretion. antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity through antibody Fc-FcR interaction and others. However. HIV infection can also reciprocally modulate NK cells directly or indirectly leading to impaired/ineffective NK cell responses. In this review. we will describe multiple aspects of NK cell biology in HIV/SIV infections and their association with viral control and disease progression. and how NHP models were critical in detailing each finding. Further. we will discuss the effect of NK cell depletion in SIV-infected NHP and the characteristics of newly described memory NK cells in NHP models and different mouse strains.

However. aberrant or unrestricted cytokine responses can damage host tissues. leading to organ dysfunction and even death. To understand the cytokine milieu and immune responses in infected host tissues. non-human primate (NHP) models have emerged as important tools. NHP have been used for decades to study human infections and have played significant roles in the development of vaccines. drug therapies and other immune treatment modalities. aided by an ability to control disease parameters and unrestricted tissue access. In addition to the genetic and physiological similarities with humans. NHP have conserved immunologic properties with over 90% amino acid similarity for most cytokines. For example. human-like symptomology and acute respiratory syndrome is found in cynomolgus macaques infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. antibody enhanced dengue disease is common in neotropical primates. and in NHP models of viral hepatitis cytokine-induced inflammation induces severe liver damage. fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma recapitulates human disease.

Cassia acutifolia (Senna) and Rhazya stricta (Harmal). The leaves of the three medicinal plants were extracted with 70% ethanol. Antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined by using DPPH (1.1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay. Total flavonoid and phenolic contents were determined using colorimetric assays. MTT assay was used to estimate the antiproliferative activities of the extracts against human hepatoma (HepG2) cancer cell line. In addition. the effects of R. stricta extract on cell cycle. colony formation. and wound healing of HepG2 cells and tube formation of HUVEC cells were assessed. Percentage inhibition of DPPH scavenging activity were dose-dependent and ranged between (89.9% ± 0.51) and (28.6% ± 2.07). Phenolic contents ranged between (11.5 ± 0.013) and (9.7 ± 0.008) mg GAE/g while flavonoid content ranged between (20.8 ± 0.40) and (0.12 ± 0.0.01) mg QE/g. Antiproliferative results of the extracts were found to be consistent with their antioxidant activity. Among the extracts evaluated. that of R. stricta showed the best antioxidant. antiproliferative and antimetastatic activities at low concentration. It also inhibited the colony-formation capacity of HepG2 cells and exhibited antiangiogenic activity.

Since multiple factors can affect HbA2 levels. the screening can become unreliable. In 1356 healthy Arabs enrolled into a federally funded premarital BTT screening program. the effects of iron deficiency (ID). -thalassemia trait. gender. smoking. and tribalism on HbA2 were studied. The complete blood count and hemoglobin fractions were determined on the entire cohort; serum ferritin (<15 μg/L) in 391 subjects was used to determine ID. BTT was present in 29 (2.1%) subjects (HbA2 > 3.5%). Among 77(20.3%) subjects with ID. the mean HbA2 (%) was 0.2% lower than in subjects without iron deficiency (%. ). In 65 (38%)/172 subjects with phenotypic -thalassemia trait. the mean HbA2 (%) was 0.13% lower than in subjects without -thalassemia trait. . The mean HbA2 did not differ between males and females. smokers and nonsmokers. and between the tribes. Thus. 35 (2.6%) subjects with HbA2 between 3.2 and 3.5% were at a risk of false negative diagnosis of BTT.

The currently available biochemical approaches used to detect protein-protein interactions are all time and labour intensive. Consequently there is a growing need for the development of computational tools that are capable of effectively identifying such interactions. Here we explain the development and implementation of a novel Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Engine termed PIPE. This tool is capable of predicting protein-protein interactions for any target pair of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins from their primary structure and without the need for any additional information or predictions about the proteins. PIPE showed a sensitivity of 61% for detecting any yeast protein interaction with 89% specificity and an overall accuracy of 75%. This rate of success is comparable to those associated with the most commonly used biochemical techniques. Using PIPE. we identified a novel interaction between YGL227W (vid30) and YMR135C (gid8) yeast proteins. This lead us to the identification of a novel yeast complex that here we term vid30 complex (vid30c). The observed interaction was confirmed by tandem affinity purification (TAP tag). verifying the ability of PIPE to predict novel protein-protein interactions. We then used PIPE analysis to investigate the internal architecture of vid30c. It appeared from PIPE analysis that vid30c may consist of a core and a secondary component. Generation of yeast gene deletion strains combined with TAP tagging analysis indicated that the deletion of a member of the core component interfered with …,True,RS6ETCQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,192,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-7-365,4099074349625965075,/scholar?cites=4099074349625965075,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-7-365,0,0,0

In this paper. we show how to enhance this approach through the addition of parallelism. thereby allowing even larger problem instances to be solved in practice.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The fusion of enveloped viruses to target membranes is promoted by certain viral fusion proteins. However. many other proteins and peptides stabilize bilayer membranes and inhibit membrane fusion. We have evaluated some characteristics of the interaction of peptides that are models of segments of measles and influenza fusion proteins with membranes. Our results indicate that these models of the fusogenic domains of viral fusion proteins promote conversion of model membrane bilayers to nonbilayer phases. This is opposite to the effects of peptides and proteins that inhibit viral fusion. A peptide model for the fusion segment of the HA protein of influenza increased membrane leakage as well as promoted the formation of nonbilayer phases upon acidification from pH 7–5.

In erythrocytes. cholesterol sulfate inhibits hypotonic hemolysis. while in sperm. it can decrease fertilization efficiency. We have found cholesterol sulfate to be a potent inhibitor of Sendai virus fusion to both human erythrocyte and liposomal membranes. Cholesterol sulfate also raises the bilayer to hexagonal phase transition temperature of dielaidoyl phosphatidylethanolamine as demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Although hexagonal phase structures are not readily found in biological membranes. there is a correlation between the effects of membrane additives on bilayer/non-bilayer equilibria and membrane stabilization.
