Both numerical and experimental results confirm the high energy efficiency of the HEV static mixer flow.,True,e41ykncAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/HT/proceedings-abstract/HT2012/21/245102,5526915099690634593,/scholar?cites=5526915099690634593,,,http://okina.univ-angers.fr/publications/ua8893/1/ht2012-58045.pdf,0,0,0
1304535,ENHANCEMENT OF HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH FIN-AND-TUBE HEAT EXCHANGER USING CORRUGATED FINS,1997,AG Ghanem and KM EL-SHAZL and AS EL-ASFOuru,44,JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE,2,309-324,,This work aims to investigate experimentally the effects of corrugation angle. number of fins per inch and velocity on the heat transfer and friction of fin-and-tube heat exchangers. To accomplish this study. six coils (fm-and-tube heat exchangers) with. the same geometry were constructed. four coils with 4FPI (fin per inch) but with different corrugation angles (0. 15. 30 and 45) besides two coils with corrugation angle 15 but with different nurnber of fins per inch (6 and 8 FPI). The heat transfer characteristics of the six coils were measured in a wind tunnel. The experimental results indicated that the corrugated fins have important effect on the heat transfer and friction. The present work indicated that the augmentation due to corrugated fms increases with increasing Reynolds number; when the average velocity through heat exchanger increases. both the heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop increase. If Reynolds number increases. both Colburn factor and friction factor decrease. The corrugation angle 300 has the highest ratio of heat transfer Colburn factor to the friction factor Gft) followed by angle 15 while the corrugation angle45 has the lowest value of that ratio. The number of fins per inch have an important effect on the heat transfer characteristics and friction. When the number of fins per inch increases. both the heat transfer and friction increase. Correlations between dependent and independent variables were presented. Comparison between the present and previously published results is in good agreement.,True,e41ykncAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/K_El-Shazly/publication/304019100_ENHANCEMENT_OF_HEAT_TRANSFER_THROUGH_FIN-AND-TUBE_HEAT_EXCHANGER_USING_CORRUGATED_FINS/links/57637aab08ae570d6e15c60c/ENHANCEMENT-OF-HEAT-TRANSFER-THROUGH-FIN-AND-TUBE-HEAT-EXCHANGER-USING-CORRUGATED-FINS.pdf,10963955477008388155,/scholar?cites=10963955477008388155,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/K_El-Shazly/publication/304019100_ENHANCEMENT_OF_HEAT_TRANSFER_THROUGH_FIN-AND-TUBE_HEAT_EXCHANGER_USING_CORRUGATED_FINS/links/57637aab08ae570d6e15c60c/ENHANCEMENT-OF-HEAT-TRANSFER-THROUGH-FIN-AND-TUBE-HEAT-EXCHANGER-USING-CORRUGATED-FINS.pdf,0,0,0

1304537,Thermal Performance of High-Efficiency Vortex (HEV) Variants: Reversed Arrays Configuration,2015,A Ghanem and T Lemenand and D Della Valle and H Peerhossaini,,,,,,Convective heat transfer in the Reversed Arrays configuration of the High-Efficiency Vortex (HEV) multifunctional heat exchanger is investigated. An experimental test section constituted of a tube equipped with inclined trapezoidal vortex generators with a constant-flux heating system is designed and constructed. In this configuration. the tab inclination is opposite to the flow direction. Interactions between the tabs and the flow generate coherent structures in the form of longitudinal counter-rotating streamwise vortices enhancing radial particle dispersion. mixing. and ultimately heat transport. The original configuration in which the tabs are inclined in the flow direction is also examined. Recent in-house hydrodynamic and thermal studies have been conducted showing the interest of these configurations in mixing and heat transfer applications. The experimental data are in good agreement with the numerical results. Local Nusselt numbers show an increasing tendency in the longitudinal direction with remarkable cross-sectional variations. Global analysis of convective heat transfer reveals the superiority of the Reversed Arrays. Energy expenditures are assessed through total pressure drop measurements. A comparative analysis based on the thermal enhancement factor and Colburn factor shows that the HEV is energetically less costly than other heat exchangers with similar heat transfer capacity.,True,e41ykncAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://okina.univ-angers.fr/publications/ua9059,,,,,http://okina.univ-angers.fr/publications/ua9059/1/ishmt_2013-_ghanem_et_al.pdf,0,0,0

It is closely related to a large number of different applications. such as chemical reactions. thermal transfer. liquid-liquid extraction. crystallization. and the like. In fact. mixing whether at the reactor scale. sustained by the flow structures. or at molecular scales. influences the selectivity and hence the productivity of reactions. Understanding and quantification of the micromixing mechanism is critical in industrial chemical processes. especially for fast exothermal reactions. Micromixing can be characterized by chemical probe methods based on observation of a local chemical reaction that results from a competition between turbulent mixing at microscales and the reaction kinetics.

1304558,Development of carburetor systems for the use of alcohol in spark ignition engines,1980,M Galvin and RM Kemp and FL Dryer,,,,,,To increase the rate at which an alcohol-based fuel could be introduced into New Zealand. it is necessary to consider means by which existing spark-ignition. gasoline-fuelled vehicles can be retrospectively equipped to run on the alternative fuel. The low fleet turnover rate and the complexity of make and model line-up provide an incentive to retain original equipment inlet and exhaust manifold systems. Under a contract from the New Zealand Liquid Fuels Trust Board. a carburetor system has been developed which will enable a wide variety of vehicles to operate satisfactorily on alcohol-based fuels without replacement or modification of manifolds. Details of the conversion system and its calibration for particular vehicles are discussed. together with results of dynamometer and vehicle running. Using a blend of 85% methanol with 15% gasoline. equivalent driveability and performance to gasoline fuel can be obtained with satisfactory cold starting. while fuel economy in energy terms is substantially improved without increasing compression ratio. Alternative methods of cold starting allow satisfactory performance on 100% methanol or azeotropic ethanol with minor adjustments to the system. Mixture conditioning is by recirculation of substantial quantities of exhaust gas heat at controlled temperature. with modulation of heat input according to the power level and speed of the engine. For a substantial part of the engine operating regime vaporized fuel is supplied at the inlet manifold riser with reduction in heat input at high power levels to avoid the possibility of pre-ignition.,True,SSKZkCgAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,5,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/8470859,3401702526867260590,/scholar?cites=3401702526867260590,,,,0,0,0
1304559,The impact of slow steaming on refrigerated exports from New Zealand,2015,James K Carson and RM Kemp and AR East and DJ Cleland,,,,,,The practice of slow steaming has had a significant impact on New Zealand export industries with increased transit times in some cases causing significant reductions in shelf life once the product has reached the retail stage. The longer transit times also impose the extra cost to exporters of having more inventory tied up in transit. While there is clear evidence to suggest slow steaming has reduced fuel consumption and hence fuel emissions and fuel costs. these savings have not been passed on by the liners to their customers. However. there is no indication that slow-steaming has caused a significant reduction in export earnings for New Zealand (at least up to the middle of 2014).

M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum from both sides of 9 lambs (n= 18) and one side of 64 beef (n= 64) carcasses of varying pH were used in two experiments to determine the freezing behaviour of normal (< 5.8) and high (> 6.2) pH meat. Lamb samples were cooled to-1.5 C or frozen to-10 C and beef were frozen slowly in an insulated chamber at-80 C and the cooling and freezing temperatures of the samples were recorded every 30 sec and analysed. The temperature profiles of both lamb and beef showed minimal evidence of supercooling. High pH meat from both species froze at higher temperature relative to low pH meat. The range of initial freezing temperatures measured for beef were-0.9 to-1.5 C (∆= 0.6 C) with the highest initial freezing temperature associated with high-and the lowest temperature with low pH meat. There was a significant correlation (r=+ 0.73.

In this paper the influence of particle size (relative to probe diameter) on measurement accuracy was examined by measuring the thermal conductivity of sucrose of varying grades. and coffee (both whole beans and ground) using two different methods; the thermal conductivity probe and a transient comparative method. Results showed that the measurement methods were in agreement for the small particulates; however. for the larger particulates the probe method appeared to under-predict thermal conductivity. A possible explanation for this observation is that the probe causes a local variation in the porosity of the sample due to the alteration of the packing density.

To understand this kind of decentralized refueling behavior. we surveyed 133 drivers of CNG fleet vehicles at six public stations across the Los Angeles region. Nearly one-third of CNG fleet drivers were solely reliant upon public refueling for their operations. For each driver's refueling trip. we used GIS to compare the chosen station's proximity to the driver's fleet base and their deviation from the shortest path between their previous and next stops relative to all other stations they could have chosen. This revealed-preference approach shows that fleet drivers chose the station with the smallest deviation over the station closest to base by a 6:1 ratio. though this ratio varied by the driver's availability of central refueling and …,True,UXV2EAYAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517304482,13070444729452600211,/scholar?cites=13070444729452600211,,,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10094297,0,0,0

1304613,Reclaiming suburbia: differences in local identity and public perceptions of potable water reuse,2019,Samantha Redman and Kerri Jean Ormerod and Scott Kelley,11,Sustainability,3,564,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Urban water managers are increasingly interested in incorporating reclaimed water into drinking supplies. particularly in rapidly growing arid and semi-arid urban areas. such as the western United States. Northern Nevada is one location that is considering augmenting drinking water supplies with reclaimed water. a practice that is known as planned potable water reuse. Potable water reuse can expand water supply and reduce wastewater disposal. However. past studies have shown that the introduction of potable reclaimed water can be controversial and requires an understanding of public perceptions of the resource prior to implementation. This study explores the factors that influence whether or not respondents in northern Nevada express willingness to drink reclaimed water. We pay specific attention to the degree to which self-identification as an urban. suburban. or rural resident influences how people consider using treated wastewater for both potable and non-potable purposes. To address this. we conducted a survey to assess community perceptions of reclaimed water use and applications in northern Nevada in the spring of 2018. We find that years spent living in the home and a respondent being female are negative and significant predictors of being willing to drink reclaimed water. while having heard of reclaimed water before and self-identification as a suburban resident are positive and significant predictors. As the region becomes more developed. particularly in its growing suburbs. it is essential to understand the nature of the interests and concerns regarding water resources and the expanded use of reclaimed water.

Recent studies suggest that the behavior of early adopters of AFVs is consistent with the objectives of flow-capturing station location models. One outstanding issue with the further use of these models to locate AFV stations is the relationship between the relatively coarse geographic representation of regional transportation networks used in flow-capturing models and the complexity of the sites they recommend. which are often nodes that represent freeway intersections. Since AFV refueling stations cannot be built directly at freeway intersections. a network GIS method entitled the freeway traffic capture metric (FTCM) is developed to identify locations on proximate local …,True,UXV2EAYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2016.1202416,11918489915276267528,/scholar?cites=11918489915276267528,,,,0,0,0

Little is known. though. about the refueling behavior of early AFV adopters in these locations. which can involve travel on complex and congested roadways. To address this. an intercept travel survey collected data from 158 drivers of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles who refueled at CNG stations near freeways in greater Los Angeles. California. Results show that these stations met refueling demand from across the majority of the metropolitan area. and the distribution of local and distant refueling demand was consistent except for the downtown station. Drivers also considered these stations to be safe and accessible. Nearly half of drivers did not include another local stop in conjunction with their refueling trip that required leaving and returning to the freeway. These respondents refueled on longer trips with lower fuel tank levels. while refueling at the station that minimized deviation. Refueling downtown negatively influenced refueling in this manner. These findings should be considered when recommending station sites near freeways in future AFV infrastructure plans.

Since strategies differ on how best to arrange initial stations in a region to facilitate adoption. understanding how they did so informs future station planning methods. We distributed a web-based survey to 129 FCV adopters throughout California in 2019. asking them where they lived and traveled at the time of adoption. up to five stations they planned to use. and subjective reasons for listing those stations.

1304617,The transition to alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs): An analysis of early adopters of natural gas vehicles and implications for refueling infrastructure location methods,2015,Scott Kelley,,,,,,Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) have seen increased attention as a way to reduce reliance on petroleum for transportation. but adoption rates lag behind conventional vehicles. One crucial barrier to their proliferation is the lack of a convenient refueling infrastructure. and there is not a consensus on how to locate initial stations. Some approaches recommend placing stations near where early adopters live. An alternate group of methods places stations along busy travel routes that drivers from across the metropolitan area traverse each day. To assess which theoretical approach is most appropriate. drivers of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles in Southern California were surveyed at stations while they refueled. Through GIS analysis. results demonstrate that respondents refueled on the way between their origins and destinations ten times more often than they refueled near their home. when no station satisfied both criteria. Freeway interchanges. which carry high daily passing traffic volumes in metropolitan areas. can be appropriate locations for initial stations based on these results. Stations cannot actually be built directly at these interchange sites. so suitable locations on nearby street networks must be chosen. A network GIS method is developed to assess street network locations' ability to capture all traffic passing through 72 interchanges in greater Los Angeles. using deviation from a driver's shortest path as the metric to assess a candidate site's suitability. There is variation in the ability of these locations to capture passing traffic both within and across interchanges. but only 7% of sites near interchanges can conveniently capture all …,True,UXV2EAYAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,4,https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/157985/content/Kelley_asu_0010E_15196.pdf,4656671009727803314,/scholar?cites=4656671009727803314,,,https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/157985/content/Kelley_asu_0010E_15196.pdf,0,0,0

However. it is unclear how the general public currently considers willingness to travel in driverless vehicles. and if they would be more comfortable doing so in one personally owned or one accessed as a service. To address this. we collected travel survey data by intercepting respondents on discretionary or social trips to four popular destinations in a medium-size US city in the spring of 2017. After collecting data on how the respondent reached the survey site and the trip’s origin and destination. survey administrators then asked if respondents would have been willing to make their current trip in either a personally-owned driverless vehicle or through a driverless vehicle service. Over one-third expressed willingness to use both forms. while 31% were unwilling to use either. For those that considered only one. slightly more favored the personally-owned model. Consideration of an existing mobility service was consistently a positive and significant predictor of those that expressed willingness to travel in a driverless vehicle. while traveling downtown negatively and significantly influenced consideration of at least one form of driverless vehicle.

Given the varied vehicle 4 and route types of fleets. empirical data on their use of public infrastructure refueling is 5 important to understand. because like consumers. fleet drivers face range anxiety and their 6 driving and refueling habits inform key assumptions important to station location. We surveyed 7 127 drivers of CNG fleet vehicles in Los Angeles at six stations across the metropolitan area. 8 The key survey questions concerned the stops immediately before and after refueling. habituality 9 of refueling away from base and fuel tank levels before refueling. We demonstrate that 10 regardless of fleet or vehicle type. drivers deviate up to six minutes in order to refuel. and they 11 also do not exhibit significant differences in fuel tank levels at the time of refueling. We also 12 observe that 35% of fleet drivers surveyed indicated they were solely reliant upon away-from-13 base refueling for their operations. but there is variation between vehicle types. These findings 14 demonstrate that fleet drivers do consider station locations away from their base when refueling. 15 and they also indicate that assumptions made within facility location models with respect to fuel 16 tank level and deviation thresholds do not necessarily have to consider the differences in vehicle 17 or route type when employed at a metropolitan or regional scale. 18 19,True,UXV2EAYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,3,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1061.18&rep=rep1&type=pdf,899958790588321848,/scholar?cites=899958790588321848,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1061.18&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. the lack of a convenient refuelling infrastructure remains a barrier to greater FCV diffusion. There is robust discussion regarding network deployment of initial HRSs to address this (2–8). although there is not agreement on how best to geographically arrange stations to do so (9. 10). This area of literature began before the initial market diffusion of FCVs. and relied on surveys of drivers of conventional vehicles about hypothetical station scenarios. or of analogue populations of diesel or natural gas vehicle drivers. to predict FCV adoption and refuelling behaviour (11–15). Since the roll-out of HRSs and FCVs. recent studies have surveyed initial FCV drivers about their station usage (16). but a key outstanding research area is how prospective FCV adopters. accustomed to the ubiquity of gasoline stations. evaluate the spatial arrangement of the full network of HRSs when adopting FCVs. That is the primary emphasis of our National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded research project. which employed a mixed methods research design to address a set of related questions (Table I).

One such area of research is effective use of service life of the aircraft known as total technical life (TTL). The present system of fixing the TTL for an aircraft is passive method in which. the predicted values are compared with the value which is obtained from sample aircraft especially monitored for this purpose. There is no active system of dynamic measurement on each aircraft for comparison with the tested value with safety factor in-build into the system. When the aircraft reaches the prescribed life limits. it is withdrawn from service though still useful life is available in the aircraft. Non availability of actual data is the cause for the underutilisation of aircraft.

Polish Academy of Science,Lithium ion secondary batteries have the highest energy density among the commercial batteries. and are used for energy storage in many electric devices. such as mobile phones. laptop computers and digital cameras. owing to the advantages of absence of memory effect. high operation voltage and superior volumetric/gravimetric energy density [1]. The most common anode material used in Li-ion batteries is graphite due to its low cost. availability and durability [2]. In graphitic anodes. the Li+ insertion mechanism corresponds to the reversible. progressive intercalation of Li+ ions between graphene layers. which allows to reach a theoretical capacity of 372 mAhg− 1 if LiC6. For comparison the experimetal capacity of 350 mAhg− 1 [3] was reached. Alternatively. tin. as a candidate for anode material in lithium-ion batteries. has received much attention because of its almost three times higher specific capacity (994 mA hg− 1). than that of commercially used graphite (372 mAhg− 1)[4]. However. crystallographic studies have demonstrated that when tin-based anodes were used as anode materials. the formation of Li17Sn4. with an atomic rate of 4.25 Li per Sn. resulted in the large volume change of these metals during lithium insertion/extraction. Decrepitation or fracture of particles of the electrode into smaller pieces normally happens during the intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions. Approximately 300% volume expansion of pure tin causes the internal strain of the materials [5]. The large volume variation leads to the pulverization of the electrode and the loss of electrical contact between the active Sn and conductive additives or the current …,True,-PRElWoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harun_Guel/publication/281189679_Preparation_and_Characterization_of_Copper_Powders_with_Sn_Coating_by_the_Electroless_Plating/links/5c701c0b92851c69503900b3/Preparation-and-Characterization-of-Copper-Powders-with-Sn-Coating-by-the-Electroless-Plating.pdf,1842093407946754057,/scholar?cites=1842093407946754057,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harun_Guel/publication/281189679_Preparation_and_Characterization_of_Copper_Powders_with_Sn_Coating_by_the_Electroless_Plating/links/5c701c0b92851c69503900b3/Preparation-and-Characterization-of-Copper-Powders-with-Sn-Coating-by-the-Electroless-Plating.pdf,0,0,0

Furthermore. the addition of Ce as promoter favoured the dielectric properties of the materials and gave additional sites for CO2 activation leading to much better results than the obtained for a commercial Ni/γ-Al2O3 sample and for the Ni/zeolite. especially under …,True,3mZznbkAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212982018300970,12271021724630562340,/scholar?cites=12271021724630562340,,,,0,0,0

Here. we present a simple approach to integrate metal oxide nanowires in electronic devices based on controlled dielectrophoretic positioning together with proof of concept devices that corroborate their functionality. The method is flexible enough to manipulate nanowires of different sizes and compositions exclusively using macroscopic solution-based techniques in conventional electrode designs. Our results show that fully functional devices. which display all the advantages of single-nanowire gas sensors. photodetectors. and even field-effect transistors. are thus obtained right after a direct assembly step without subsequent metallization processing.

In this work. the design of a technical catalyst based on an optimal content of Ni as active phase. CeO2 as promoter and γ-Al2O3 micro-spheres as support (dp = 400–500 μm) is evaluated. The systematic optimization of Ni.

Catalyst screening revealed that EOE could be successfully obtained over some acid catalysts. In particular the highest yield was achieved over acid ion-exchange resins (33% after 8 h).

EOE synthesis by 1-octanol (OcOH) reaction with ethanol (EtOH) or diethyl carbonate (DEC) over acidic ion-exchange resins has been studied in a 100-mL batch reactor (130–150 °C. 25 bar). The main drawback for ethylating OcOH in both reaction systems is the loss of ethyl groups by diethyl ether formation. In OcOH excess. selectivity to EOE with respect to EtOH and to DEC was found to be similar (58–59%) when the ethylating agent was entirely consumed. However. the initial reaction rate of EOE formation from DEC is lower. due to the formation of ethyl octyl carbonate as reaction intermediate. Accordingly.

1304769,Ethyl octyl ether synthesis from 1-octanol and ethanol or diethyl carbonate on acidic ion-exchange resins,2013,Jordi Guilera Sala,,,,,Universitat de Barcelona,Ethyl octyl ether is a bioethanol-derived component that has excellent properties as diesel fuel. This work proved that ethyl octyl ether can be produced successfully in liquid-phase at the temperature range of 130-190ºC by using acidic ion-exchange resins. as suitable and economic catalysts. The use of two promising reactants that can be a renewable compound source. ethanol and diethyl carbonate. have been explored. Both reactants are able to ethylate 1-octanol and form the desired product. However. an identical industrial drawback is observed on both reactants. the loss of ethyl groups to form diethyl ether. which is not suitable as diesel compound.   In order to minimize the diethyl ether formation. and in this way. to maximize the ethyl octyl ether production; several commercial acidic resins were tested. or else. prepared and subsequently tested. The best catalysts are those allowing 1-octanol to access to most sulfonic groups of the catalyst. Such desired properties can be achieved by decreasing the amount of crosslinking agent of resins. as a result. the resin has a high capacity to swell and at the same time a low gel-phase density. Another tailoring technique that lets 1-octanol to access to the vast majority of sulfonic groups is by locating them only in the least crosslinked domains of the gel-phase. Both tailoring techniques involve higher selectivity to ethyl octyl ether. which can be extrapolated to other bulky molecules. However. the former involves a reduction of the catalytic activity per volume unit of the catalyst bed. and the latter. per mass unit.

The model assumes that the life of a lithium ion (Li-ion) EV battery is extended to incorporate the re-purposing and re-use in grid storage for a utility application. Compared to using natural gas fuel for peak electrical power generation a 56% reduction in CO2 emissions is possible when an EV battery is re-purposed to store off-peak clean electricity to serve peak demand. The magnitude of CO2 mitigation associated with battery re-use is similar to that of switching from using a conventional vehicle to an electric vehicle. meaning that the greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of vehicle electrification could be doubled by extending the life of EV batteries. and better using off-peak low-cost clean electricity.,True,ulekXAoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,142,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213138814000071,18345445904518682296,/scholar?cites=18345445904518682296,,,,0,0,0

1304779,Modelling the global prospects and impacts of heavy duty liquefied natural gas vehicles in computable general equilibrium,2014,Arthur Hong Chun Yip,,,,,,Natural gas vehicles have the prospects of making substantial contributions to transportation needs. The adoption of natural gas vehicles could lead to impacts on energy and environmental systems. An analysis of the main factors and trends that affect adoption of natural gas vehicles such as vehicle costs. infrastructure costs. and fuel economics was performed. The fuel cost analysis showed that assuming production and distribution at scale. liquefied natural gas (LNG) can be competitive as a diesel fuel substitute for heavy duty vehicles in the US. and also in EU and China. A methodology of incorporating heavy duty natural gas vehicles into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic modelling was developed to investigate the potential adoption and impacts. Modelling variables such as vehicle and infrastructure costs were tested and several scenarios were applied to examine the general equilibrium impacts on natural gas vehicle adoption and the general equilibrium impacts of resulting natural gas vehicle adoption. Climate policy scenarios were also developed and tested. In the base case scenario. results showed significant adoption of LNG trucks (Class 8) in the US. with 10% penetration of heavy duty trucks by 2020 and up to 100% by 2040. In China and the EU. adoption was projected to be slower due to higher natural gas prices. In the US. introduction of LNG trucks resulted in moderately higher natural gas prices. slightly lower oil prices. and a small reduction in total GHG emissions. relative to scenarios without LNG truck availability.

The authors characterize the implications of this practice on model predictions and identify the composite vehicle attributes and correction factors needed to recover choice predictions of models using the original disaggregated elemental choice sets. The authors construct simulations based on vehicle choice models used to inform transportation and energy policy and assess the variation in choice share predictions under alternative composite vehicle definitions and scenarios. The authors find that in an uncalibrated logit model with no alternative-specific constants. the variation in predictions due to composite aggregation is substantial and can be larger than variation due to parameter uncertainty. The use of composites with appropriate correction factors can recover predictions from their corresponding elemental models while improving tractability for fleet forecasting. In a calibrated nested logit simulation of counterfactual policy scenarios. predictions of composite shares by fuel type in composite models match closely with those in corresponding elemental models except when the policies examined have heterogeneous impacts on elemental vehicle options within composite groups.,True,ulekXAoAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1494828,,,,,,0,0,0

List scheduling is a very popular heuristic method for DAG-based scheduling. However. it is more suited to homogenous distributed computing systems. This paper presents an iterative list scheduling algorithm to deal with scheduling on heterogeneous computing systems. The main idea in this iterative scheduling algorithm is to improve the quality of the schedule in an iterative manner using results from previous iterations. The algorithm first uses the heterogeneous earliest-finish-time (HEFT) algorithm to find an initial schedule and iteratively improves it. Hence the algorithm can potentially produce shorter schedule length. The simulation results show that in the majority of the cases. there is significant improvement to the initial schedule.

The kinetic model and catalyst activity were estimated by using the genetic algorithm as well as overlapping the proposed model results with the experimental data. The results of the modeling showed that the amount of the aromatics during the reactor reduced the trend due to the decrease in the amount of paraffin and naphthen.

The first cases of using catalysts were baking bread and making cheese and wine. Ancient people found that adding a little bit of cooked bread to a new bakery is mandatory. In 1835. Brazil collected and summarized the observations of former chemists. and stated that small quantities of a foreign agent could seriously affect chemical reactions [1]. This mysterious force applied to materials was called the catalytic force. In 1894. Stallard developed the theory of Brazilius. He stated that the catalysts are substances that increase the speed of chemical reactions without consuming them. Today. catalysts play a major role in the global economy [1]. Catalyst is a substance affecting the reaction however; it will remain unchanged at the end of reaction. In chemistry. catalysis changes the reaction speed by creating a different molecular pathway (mechanism) for the reaction."" Catalytic"" is the study and use of catalysts and the creation of catalytic processes. The industrial catalysts are of immense importance. About one-third of GNP in the United States has used catalysts at least in one part of the production process. Usually. when talking about a catalyst. the reaction speed increases in our minds. while the catalyst it can quickly accelerate or slow down the formation of a specific product type [2].

Adsorption equilibrium and kinetics data at high pressure were measured using a volumetric method. A theoretical model has been presented to calculate the amount of adsorbed gas on adsorbents in a cylindrical tank. In the model. gas enters the bed axial direction. The continuity and diffusion equations of adsorbent particles have been solved simultaneously. The models have been used to simulate methane adsorption on activated carbon using in adsorbed natural gas technology (ANG). Longmuir relation and Peng-Robinson equation have been used to evaluate the equilibrium amount of adsorbed gas and compressibility factor. By successful fitting of the gas-solid equilibrium data in the Longmuir relation the corresponding model parameters have been derived and effective diffusivity has been extracted with a new simple method. The storage capacity of activated carbon with high micropore volume is found to be higher but the diffusion coefficient and adsorption rate is lower than carbons with low micropore volume.

Sulfide solid electrolytes show some unique properties. such as the high ionic conductivity and low mechanical stiffness. Here we show that the electrochemical stability window of sulfide electrolytes can be improved by controlling synthesis parameters and the consequent core-shell microstructural compositions. This results in a stability window of 0.7–3.1 V and quasi-stability window of up to 5 V for Li-Si-PS sulfide electrolytes with high Si composition in the shell. a window much larger than the previously predicted one of 1.7–2.1 V.

In virtual-pipelines compressed/liquefied natural gas is transported by various modes-highway. railway. waterways and the sea.For efficient use the end users–residential users. the gas stations. and industrial usersshould be located near the pipeline; otherwise. extension branches would be costprohibitive. Even users with high potential for consumption could not be using this fuel on account of their distance from existing pipelines. This was found to be a great problem by gas distributors.

It is a wealth creation factor. an economical driver. and one major underpinning of national income in many parts of the world (Zamani. 2010). Tobacco cultivation area in Iran has declined from about 20.000 ha in 1998 to 6.000 ha in 2009 and had slight variations until 2014. Higher production costs and skilled labor unavailability in traditional cultivation system are mainly blamed for the loss of its cultivation area in Iran. The production of this industrial crop not only ensures the subsistence of tobacco growers but also is a source of income for thousands of people involved in processing. distribution. and marketing of final products. The use of tobacco transplanters cuts labor costs. reduces seedling losses. and improves the accuracy and speed of transplanting. So. it is necessary for Iranian Tobacco Company to supply tobacco-growers with appropriate tobacco transplanters in accordance with local requirements (Namvar Rezaei. 2008). Also. the manual topping and harvesting of tobacco leaves and shoots are very costly. So. the movement towards mechanized cultivation of tobacco is unavoidable if its production is intended to be sustainable and competitive with foreign products. For a successful formulation of a comprehensive plan for the development of local farming mechanization. it is necessary to recognize the driving and inhibiting factors at the first step.
