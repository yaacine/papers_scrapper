1070896,Chemical modification. characterization. and application of chicken feathers as novel biosorbent,2013,Muhammad Arshad Khosa and JP Wu and Aman Ullah,,RSC Adv.,,,The Royal Society of Chemistry,The current work exclusively pertains to preparing arsenic removing biosorbents using chicken feathers (CF) as a raw material. CF consist of keratinous proteins with many functional groups. and this paper contributes to the debate on how functional groups. especially –COOH. –NH2 and –S–S–. interact with arsenic species before and after their modification through sorption phenomena. Chemically modified CF biosorbents were investigated regarding their ability to remove As(III) from water. The modification results suggest that reactions occur mainly on the surface with noticeable changes on reactive sites in the interior of the modified chicken feathers (MCF). To prepare the modifications labelled as MCF-I and MCF-II. the feathers were treated with aqueous NaOH and sodium sulfite. respectively. to change their structure and morphology.

1070898,Microemulsions in enhanced oil recovery: a review,2011,MF Nazar and SS Shah and MA Khosa,29,,13,1353-1365,Taylor & Francis Group,Microemulsions have recently made advances in enhanced oil recovery processes in which chemicals. especially surfactants. are used to recover the oil from natural oil reservoirs. This technique relies on the knowledge of interfacial properties among oil. water. and solid rock reservoirs in the occasional presence of natural gas under extreme conditions. Surfactant-based chemical systems have been reported in many academic studies and their technological implementation is a potential candidate in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) activities. For instance. it was determined that a mobilized buffer (polymer) with viscosity either equal to or greater than the mobilized oil enhanced the recovery efficiency considerably. However. EOR based on chemicals like alkaline–surfactant–polymer (ASP) is a complex technology requiring a high level of expertise for its industrial implementation.

Co2+. Ni2+. Cu2+. Zn2+) from aqueous solution using sericin biopolymer. Sericin is a water soluble bio-macromolecule and has potential to show chemical interaction with metal ions due to protein units containing several amino acids. The functional groups of sericin such as amine (NH2). disulfide linkage (SS) and carboxylic acid (COOH) assign it role of poly dentate ligand (PDL). Provision of negatively charged surface with lone pair of electrons facilitates metal-sericin complexation owing to d-electron deficient metal ions. Sericin-chelated metal ions are retained by pores of membrane when the aqueous solution is subjected to pass through membrane on account of their enhanced size.

High spectral change by CTAB confirms the anionic nature of ARS dye and thus ARS-CTAB complex formation takes place due to electrostatic force of attraction. A little spectral change by SDS is the result of similarly charged repulsive forces that overcome weak hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction between dye and surfactant micelles. TX-100 exhibited moderate spectral effect responsive to weak hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction alone. MEUF study of ARS dye justified the spectral changes and dye rejection percentage (R) decreases in the following order: cationic > nonionic > anionic surfactant.

The behavior of the dielectric spectra and their characteristic parameters (dispersion amplitudes and relaxation times) is discussed. as well as the pair correlation functions and partial coordination numbers derived from statistical mechanics. The paper focuses on the influence of salt concentration on the features of ion hydration and association. The observed changes in the dielectric properties indicate a decrease of the effective hydration number from ∼ 15–18 at infinite dilution to ∼ 3.5 at 5 M and possibly weak association involving stable ion pairs at c ≤ 0.5 M.

In addition to the dominant bulk-water relaxation at ∼ 20 GHz. one or two further modes were detected. The process centered at ∼ 8 GHz was attributed to water molecules hydrating the anions and to the reorientation of the anions themselves. A lower-frequency process at ∼ 0.6 GHz. observed only at c ≲ 1 M. was assigned to the presence of a small amount of doubly solvent-separated ion pairs superimposed by ion‐cloud relaxation. Hydration numbers were calculated from the water relaxation amplitudes. At infinite dilution ∼ 20 water molecules were found to be weakly bound by the anion (“slow” water) whereas ∼ 1–2 water molecules were strongly bound (“frozen”) on the DR time scale.

The phenomenon of heteroaggregation is of great relevance in industrial processes and the natural environment. This review will focus on binary heteroaggregation where at least one of the particles is a stimulus-responsive smart particle. Aggregation under various conditions of pH. temperature. light and relative concentration can be induced by the careful manipulation of any one or more of these environmental conditions during the heteroaggregation of smart particles. Stimulus response provides the potential for reversibility from an aggregated to a stable system and exceptional control over inter-particle interactions.

Sci,,1373-1381,,This paper presents the impact of heat treatments on the yield and quality of the palm oil using solvent extraction techniques. Heating temperature range from 70 to 90 C and heating time range from 30 to 90 min were studied. The quality parameters measured were free fatty acids (FFA). deterioration of bleaching index (DOBI). carotene content. oxidative stability and fatty acid composition of the oil. These parameters were used to determine CPO quality which has been stored for 3 months. It was found that the yield significantly increased with the increasing of heating temperature and time. The optimum parameter was achieved with heating temperature of 90 C and heating time of 60 min via wet heating. Optimum oil yield obtained was 24% with 0.93% FFA content. 6.10 DOBI. 938.42 ppm carotene content and oxidative stability of 26.87 hours. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of oil extracted showed a reduction in unsaturated fatty acids as the heating duration increased. After 3 months of storage. 60 min of heating time via wet heating process was recorded the lowest increment of FFA (1.32%) and low reduction of DOBI value (0.41).

Soursop (Annona muricata) is easily available in Malaysia throughout the year. However. it is also highly perishable and has a short shelf-life. Therefore. in this research. soursop was used in the production of vinegar. to increase its utilisation and reduce wastage. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of fermentation time and pH on soursop vinegar using a 3 Ũ 5 factorial design and to determine its chemical compositions. It was found that pH and fermentation time showed significant (p< 0.05) effects on the reduction of sugar content and the production of acetic acid. while only fermentation time showed a significant effect on the production of ethanol. The interaction between factors did not exhibit any statistical significance (p> 0.05). It was evident that the sugar concentration reduces over time and it was inversely proportional to the ethanol and acetic acid concentrations. due to the conversion of sugar to ethanol and subsequently acetic acid. It was found that higher pH (pH5. 5) gave significantly (p< 0.05) higher acetic acid production in the vinegar. while pH has no significant (p> 0.05) effect on ethanol production. There were no significant differences (p> 0.05) in vitamin C content in all vinegar samples. Thus. it can be established that at fermentation time of 120 h and pH5. 5. more sugar was used and more ethanol and acetic acid were produced.,True,fJzp328AAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,9,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154905647.pdf,4446307679040874784,/scholar?cites=4446307679040874784,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/154905647.pdf,0,0,0

Microalgae are cheaper and sustainable source of biohydrogen production. To produce hydrogen from microalgae. a two-stage method is adopted; stage-1 for carbon fixation and stage-2 for anaerobic digestion and hydrogen production. In-efficient anaerobic digestion. low hydrogen yield. and high cost are the fundamental issues of two-stage process. All these issues are attributed to the lack of understanding in key processes of hydrogen production. such as cultivation. immobilization. sulfur deprivation. and anaerobic digestion.

Monometallic Fe (catalyst A) and Co (catalyst F) were also prepared along with mixedmetal Fe/Co catalysts (BE) by changing Fe/Co ratio. For mixed-metal catalysts (BE) SEMEDX analysis confirmed the incorporation of both Fe and Co in the catalysts. However. a spindle-shaped morphology typically known for a Fe-MIL-88B structure and confirmed by PXRD analysis was only observed for catalysts AD. To test the catalytic potential of mixedmetal MOFs. reduction of nitroarenes was selected as a benchmark reaction. Incorporation of Co enhanced the activity of the catalysts as compared to the parent NH2-BDC-Fe catalyst. These MOFs were also tested as electro-catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) with best activity exhibited by mixed-metal Fe/Co-MOF (Fe/Co batch ratio= 1) with a current density of 10 mA. cm-2 at 410 mV overpotential. which is comparable to the benchmark OER catalyst (ie RuO2). Moreover. it showed long-run stability in 1M KOH. In a third catalytic test. dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride showed high activity (TOF: 87/min) and hydrogen generation rate (67 L/min/g catalyst). This is the very first example of the synthesis of bimetallic MOFs as multifunctional catalysts particularly for catalytic reduction of nitroarenes and dehydrogenation reactions.10.1002/chem. 201901939,True,HmhNCXAAAAAJ:rHJHxKgnXwkC,20,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bushra_Iqbal6/publication/333625556_One-Pot_Synthesis_of_Heterobimetallic_Metal-Organic_Frameworks_MOFs_for_Multifunctional_Catalysis/links/5cff32b44585157d15a203e6/One-Pot-Synthesis-of-Heterobimetallic-Metal-Organic-Frameworks-MOFs-for-Multifunctional-Catalysis.pdf,1719383567258459356,/scholar?cites=1719383567258459356,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bushra_Iqbal6/publication/333625556_One-Pot_Synthesis_of_Heterobimetallic_Metal-Organic_Frameworks_MOFs_for_Multifunctional_Catalysis/links/5cff32b44585157d15a203e6/One-Pot-Synthesis-of-Heterobimetallic-Metal-Organic-Frameworks-MOFs-for-Multifunctional-Catalysis.pdf,0,0,0

In this work. a facile synthesis protocol for the development of FeCo bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) supported over multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers is presented. The CNTs. not only prevent FeCo NPs from agglomeration by encapsulating them in their hard protective shell at the tip but also provide an efficient electron pathway. Impressively. based on the synergistic effect of highly conductive and homogeneously distributed CNTs and FeCo NPs over N-doped carbon nanofiber support (FeCo@ CNT/NCNF). the material exhibited excellent performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and decent activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with exceptional durability of 48 hours even on glassy carbon electrode.

The waste cooking oil used in this study has very high acid value (> 13 mg KOH/g). therefore a simple base transesterification utilized so far proved to be unsuitable; this process resulted in soap formation. In this study the production process of fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) from WCO involved two steps. acid catalyzed followed by base catalysis reactions. In the first step. the acid value of WCO was reduced below 1 mg KOH/g by homogeneous acid catalysis and in the second step. acid catalyzed WCO was transformed to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in the presence of NaOH as homogeneous base catalyst. Five different sorts of FAMEs were identified in the waste cooking oil biodiesel by GC/MS analysis. The FAMEs recognized were methyl dodecanoate (C12: 0). methyl tetradecanoate (C14: 0). methyl hexadecanoate (C16: 0). methyl 9-octadecenoate (C18: 1) and methyl octadecanoate (C18: 0).

However. limitations of the current generation vectors often prevent broader application of AAV gene therapy. Efforts to engineer AAV vectors have been hampered by a limited understanding of the structure-function relationship of the complex multimeric icosahedral architecture of the particle. To develop additional reagents pertinent to further our insight into AAVs. we inferred evolutionary intermediates of the viral capsid using ancestral sequence reconstruction. In-silico-derived sequences were synthesized de novo and characterized for biological properties relevant to clinical applications.

Silica is synthesized through acid catalysis of a silica precursor (tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in ethanol–water). and fibers are obtained by electrospinning a mixture of the silica precursor solution and aqueous PVA. A systematic investigation on how the amount of TEOS. the silica–PVA ratio. the aging time of the silica precursor mixture. and the solution rheology influence the fiber morphology is undertaken and reveals a composition window in which defect-free hybrid nanofibers with diameters as small as 150 nm are obtained. When soaked overnight in water. the hybrid fibers remain intact. essentially maintaining their morphology. even though PVA is soluble in water.

Its reaction with different chlorobutane isomers or 1-bromobutane results in topochemical transformation of the MgO phase to MgCl2 or MgBr2 accompanied by a sharp decrease in the catalyst surface area and increase in its activity. The resulting magnesium chloride and magnesium bromide are very active catalysts for HCl and HBr elimination from halogenated hydrocarbons. The reaction mechanism changes from predominantly E2 elimination on MgO to mostly E1 elimination over MgCl2 and MgBr2. which act as Lewis acids.

As a result. catalysis of Diels–Alder reactions with biomass-derived dienes and dienophiles has seen a growth of interest in recent years; however. significant opportunities remain to (i) tailor heterogeneous catalyst materials for tandem Diels–Alder and aromatization reactions. and (ii) utilize biomass-derived dienes and dienophiles to access both conventional and novel aromatic monomers. As such. this review discusses the mechanistic aspects of Diels–Alder reactions from both an experimental and computational perspective. as …,True,r5LbaV4AAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC,99,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2017/gc/c7gc00992e,12570633940236176320,/scholar?cites=12570633940236176320,,https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1374130,0,0,0

Boronic acid based receptor designs originated when Lorand and Edwards used the pH drop observed upon the addition of saccharides to boronic acids to determine their association constants. The inherent acidity of the boronic acid is enhanced when 1.2-. 1.3-. or 1.4-diols react with boronic acids to form cyclic boronic esters (5. 6. or 7 membered rings) in aqueous media. and these interactions form the cornerstone of diol-based receptors used in the construction of sensors and separation systems.In addition. the recognition of saccharides through boronic acid complex (or boronic ester) formation often relies on an interaction between a Lewis acidic boronic acid and a Lewis base (proximal tertiary amine or anion).

In constructed wetlands. for example. open-water cells can be used to promote sunlight disinfection and remove pathogenic viruses from wastewater. To aid in the design of these systems. we developed predictive models of virus attenuation that account for endogenous and exogenous sunlight-mediated inactivation mechanisms. Inactivation rate models were developed for two viruses. MS2 and poliovirus type 3; laboratory- and field-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the models’ ability to estimate inactivation rates in a pilot-scale. open-water. unit-process wetland cell.

Ozone is a gaseous oxidant that is widely applied in drinking water treatment. Membrane contactors are an alternative to conventional gas dispersion methods for injection of ozone gas mixtures into water. Few studies have explored computational approaches for membrane based ozone transport. In this investigation. quantitative concentration profiles across a single polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) capillary membrane tube with internal gas flow and external liquid flow were obtained. including single mass transfer resistances and overall mass transfer coefficients for ozone and oxygen for varying membrane lengths. thicknesses. and laminar flow liquid side velocities. Both the influence of diffusivity and solubility of gases in the membrane were considered with the applied model. Previous studies have neglected the solubility of gases in the membranes in their analysis of ozone and oxygen gas fluxes. This work shows that the solubility has a significant impact of the overall mass transfer coefficients. in particular for oxygen. The main resistance for ozone was found in the liquid side. while for oxygen it was in the membrane. Mass transfer correlations based on heat transfer analogies revealed Sherwood (Sh) correlations for ozone and oxygen with good agreement to literature data. indicating that the applied computational model returns sensible results.

Non-porous tubular polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes of 1.0–3.2 mm inner diameter were tested at ozone gas concentrations of 110–200 g/m 3 and liquid side velocities of 0.002–0.226 m/s. The dissolved ozone concentration could be adjusted to up to 14 mg O 3/L and increased with decreasing membrane diameter and liquid side velocity. Experimental mass transfer coefficients and molar fluxes of ozone were 2.4× 10− 6 m/s and 1.1× 10− 5 mol/(m 2 s). respectively. for the smallest membrane. CFD modelling could predict the final ozone concentrations but slightly overestimated mass transfer coefficients and molar fluxes of ozone.

1071679,Rapid on-site colorimetric determination of drinking water safety in the developing world,2020,Carlos Miguel Lopez-Alled,,,,,,The purpose of this thesis is the development of sustainable colorimetric sensors for the detection of toxins in aqueous media. These sensors are based on azulene and guaiazulene. two molecules with unique optical and chemical properties. Due to natural and man-made processes. many drinking water reservoirs in developing countries have been contaminated with toxins such as mercury. lead. fluoride or arsenic. The areas affected can be very remote and difficult to access. The affected population may not have the economic means to check the safety of their water by conventional methods. There is subsequently a need for cheap and easy-to-use sensors that are highly selective and sensitive. Colorimetry is the ideal technique for this purpose as the chemosensors can be synthesised from cheap organic molecules and the signal is easy-to-read and does not require further instrumentation apart from the human eye. A selective fluoride sensor was synthesised using boronic esters as sensing element. The sensor was able to work in real samples of water contaminated with fluoride thanks to the addition of a surfactant. A family of azulene- and guaiazulene-based mercury sensors using hydrocarbon chains containing sulfur atoms as sensing element was developed. These molecules showed excellent selectivity towards mercury (with copper as the only significant interference) and gave a clear signal -a colour change from blue to orange- in mixtures of organic solvents and water. A mercury sensor was developed. based on the conversion of dithiane into aldehyde. The clear colour change. from blue to red. was observed only after the addition …,True,qS_CbGcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.801364,,,,,0,0,0

It is also assumed that the micelle’s size and shape can be explained by simple arguments involving volumetric packing parameters and electrostatic interactions. By using wide Q-range neutron diffraction measurements of H/D isotopically substituted solutions of decyltrimethylammonimum bromide (C10TAB) surfactants. we are able to determine the complete. atomistic structure of a micelle and its surroundings in solution.

Diabetes is associated with an increased formation of reactive oxygen species and the electrophilic dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal (MG). Here we show that MG stimulates heterologously expressed TRPA1 in CHO cells and natively expressed TRPA1 in MDCK cells and DRG neurons. MG evokes [Ca2+]i-responses in TRPA1 expressing DRG neurons but is without effect in neurons cultured from Trpa1−/− mice. Consistent with a direct. intracellular action. we show that methylglyoxal is significantly more potent as a TRPA1 agonist when applied to the intracellular face of excised membrane patches than to intact cells. Local intraplantar administration of MG evokes a pain response in Trpa1+/+ but not in Trpa1−/− mice. Furthermore. persistently increased MG levels achieved by two weeks pharmacological inhibition of glyoxalase-1 (GLO-1). the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for detoxification of MG. evokes a progressive and marked thermal (cold and heat) and mechanical hypersensitivity in wildtype but not in Trpa1−/− mice. Our results thus demonstrate that TRPA1 is required both for the acute pain response evoked by topical MG and for the long-lasting pronociceptive effects associated with elevated MG in vivo.

The rate of desensitization of capsaicin-induced responses is partly dependent on the extracellular calcium concentration and is slower when extracellular calcium is reduced. Desensitization is strongly inhibited by intracellular application of the calcium chelator 1.2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N.N. N′.N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA).

The distribution of α‐bungarotoxin binding sites on embryonic and neonatal rat skeletal muscle fibres was determined by autoradiography. Most of the bungarotoxin binding could be inhibited by curare. This observation. together with the spatial distribution of toxin‐binding sites. indicates that the distribution of bound toxin reflects that of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors on these developing muscle cells.2. At 15 days of embryogenesis. muscle fibres showed an essentially uniform distribution of receptors. By 16 days. many fibres showed an accumulation of receptors in their mid‐region. This accumulation was at the same location as histochemically demonstrated cholinesterase activity.3.

Owing to the presence of methyl groups on their carbon chains. they cannot be metabolized in mitochondria. and instead are processed and degraded in peroxisomes. Several different oxidative degradation pathways for these lipids are known. including α‐oxidation. β‐oxidation. and ω‐oxidation. Dietary branched‐chain lipids (especially phytanic acid) have attracted much attention in recent years. due to their link with prostate. breast. colon and other cancers as well as their role in neurological disease. A central role in all the metabolic pathways is played by α‐methylacyl‐CoA racemase (AMACR). which regulates metabolism of these lipids and drugs.

The wild-type enzyme is only able to efficiently utilize 2-oxoglutarate and 2-oxoadipate as a 2-oxoacid co-substrate. Mutation of arginine 258. the side chain of which forms an electrostatic interaction with the 5-carboxylate of the 2-oxoglutarate co-substrate. to a glutamine residue reduced activity to about 5% of the wild-type enzyme with 2-oxoglutarate.

Boronic acid based receptor designs originated when Lorand and Edwards used the pH drop observed upon the addition of saccharides to boronic acids to determine their association constants. The inherent acidity of the boronic acid is enhanced when 1.2-. 1.3-. or 1.4-diols react with boronic acids to form cyclic boronic esters (5. 6. or 7 membered rings) in aqueous media. and these interactions form the cornerstone of diol-based receptors used in the construction of sensors and separation systems.In addition. the recognition of saccharides through boronic acid complex (or boronic ester) formation often relies on an interaction between a Lewis acidic boronic acid and a Lewis base (proximal tertiary amine or anion).

The enhanced fluorescence of the probe when bound with D-fructose was switched off in the presence of peroxynitrite. In contrast. other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) led to only slight fluorescence decreases due to protection by an internal N–B interaction.

However. micelle formation. and thus the alteration of the rheology. is subject to the high Krafft temperature of saturated long-tail surfactants. Hexadecylmaltosides are sustainable surfactants that. in solution. form tailorable viscoelastic fluids.

With this in mind. the study of the fundamental behavior of proteins in deep eutectic solvents not only provides insight into a novel alternative to aqueous and molecular organic solvents. but also contributes to understanding the potential behavior of these macromolecules in non-aqueous environments. In particular. it has relevance for systems with high levels of dehydration. liquid phases for dispersions at cryogenic temperatures. or systems with high ionic strength. In this chapter. we will explore current knowledge of the physicochemical behavior of proteins in deep eutectic solvents. The local and global structure of proteins in these solvents will be presented and compared to those in aqueous solutions. organic solvents and ionic liquids. Furthermore. the characteristic behavior of proteins in deep eutectic solvents will be linked to solvation effects and the interaction of the macromolecules with the solvent. where specific electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions can affect the structure and dynamics of proteins.

1072117,Self-assembly in deep eutectic solvents,2018,Adrian Sanchez Fernandez,,,,,,Deep eutectic solvents are environmentally sustainable liquids obtained through the combination of simple. readily available precursors. Their chemical diversity comes about from the myriad possible combination of precursors. leading to the development of solvents with suitable characteristics for particular applications. Unlike traditional covalent solvents. deep eutectic solvents present an intrinsically complex molecular network. with both hydrogen bond and electrostatic contributions balancing the stability of the mixture. Thus. these solvents may be considered as a non-aqueous environment where traditional processes can be mimicked. but with a greater control over the system properties. Self-assembly of amphiphiles has become a highly relevant field for science and technology. with present and future applications in templating of nanostructured materials. drug delivery. formulations and detergency. among others. The aim of this project is to develop a suitable framework that describes amphiphile self-assembly in deep eutectic solvents. As a starting point. an investigation of surfactant aggregation was performed. combining in-house techniques. such as surface tension and calorimetry. with cutting- edge X-ray and neutron scattering techniques: small-angle scattering and reflectivity. The results show the formation of micelles for which. through electrostatic interactions between the solvent and the amphiphiles. the morphology can be tuned.

We report here the near-quantitative self-assembly of a trefoil knot from a naphthalenediimide-based aqueous disulfide dynamic combinatorial library. The formation of the knot appears to be driven by the hydrophobic effect and leads to a structure in which the aromatic components are buried while the hydrophilic carboxylate groups remain exposed to the solvent. Moreover. the building block chirality constrains the topological conformation of the knot and results in its stereoselective synthesis.

This bonding is not localized between two atoms: instead. each link has a fractional double bond character or bond order”. 1 Consequently. the difference between the energy of the delocalized system and the energy of a hypothetical structure that contains formally localized single and double bonds is normally used as a model to measure electron delocalization.

The shape of the induced magnetic field reflects the size and strength of the system of delocalized electrons and can have a large influence on neighboring molecules.In 2004. we proposed using the induced magnetic field as a means of estimating the degree of electron delocalization and aromaticity in planar as well as in nonplanar molecules.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The authors discuss the role of the σ and π contributions to the induced magnetic field for simple hydrocarbons containing a double or a triple bond. as well as for benzene and cyclobutadiene. While the magnetic field induced by the σ electrons is short‐ranged. the π system is responsible for the formation of long‐range cones. These cones influence the chemical shift of atoms by additional shielding (for aromatic) or deshielding (for antiaromatic molecules) contributions. While the hydrogen atoms of benzene are found to lie within the deshielded region of the magnetic field induced by the π electrons. they are shielded by the total induced magnetic field.

In this work we use the Random Walk Numerical Simulation (RWNS) method to model the dynamics of electrons and holes in two disordered semiconductors in contact. Miller–Abrahams hopping rates and a tunnelling distance-dependent electron–hole annihilation mechanism are used to model transport and recombination. respectively. To test the validity of the model. three numerical “experiments” have been devised: (1) in the absence of constant illumination. charge separation has been quantified by computing surface photovoltage (SPV) transients. (2) By applying a continuous generation of electron–hole pairs. the model can be used to simulate a solar cell under steady-state conditions.

SPV transients obtained from RW calculations for different values of tr0 and d2 are shown in Fig.(1) in the main text. It can be observed that. for fixed absorber thickness. the higher the recombination time prefactor in Eq.(7) is. the later the decay appears. This is explained by the fact that as tr0 increases. the probability of recombination decreases with respect to transport and consequently fewer recombination events will occur. For tr0= 1 s. very few carriers are recombined and the SPV signal is mainly controlled by diffusion and charge separation. Thus. a saturation effect related to the total thickness of the heterostructure seems to appear after charge separation process has been taken place. We can also see that variation of recombination frequencies affects the SPV maxima. making the maximum higher as the recombination frequency decreases. On the other hand. comparison of the three panels indicates that for a given value of the recombination frequency the SPV maxima appears at longer times as the absorber thickness (d2) is augmented. This is a consequence of the fact that for thicker absorbers the process of diffusion with respect to electron-hole recombination is favoured.Results of SPV maxima versus semiconductor thicknesses for various initial electron-hole densities are presented in Fig.(S1). As it can be observed. the maximum value of the SPV transients increases with respect to the width of the …,True,2TPuvBUAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d15f/26e3757d14444f4e0811297533b07b3c3f6f.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d15f/26e3757d14444f4e0811297533b07b3c3f6f.pdf,0,0,0

Analysis of incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for front and rear illumination consistently gives smaller values of L than those derived from small amplitude methods. We show that the IPCE analysis is incorrect if recombination is not first-order in free electron concentration. and we demonstrate that the intensity dependence of the apparent L derived by first-order analysis of IPCE measurements and the voltage dependence of L derived from perturbation experiments can be fitted using the same reaction order. γ ≈ 0.8.

Deposition occurs by progressive nucleation and diffusion‐limited growth of three‐dimensional hemispherical islands over a wide range of potentials and concentrations. It is shown that for a silicon/gold electrode. the applied potential is dropped over the silicon/gold interface at potentials more positive than 0 V. while at potentials more negative than 0 V. the applied potential is dropped over the Helmholtz layer at the gold/solution interface.

As for polarizable metal electrodes. the relationship between the capacitance and the frequency is closely related to the relationship between the capacitance and the specific conductivity of the electrolyte solution.

Currently the most popular technology for this is based on Siliconsolar cell technology. which is also known as first generation photovoltaics. Hybrid inorganic-organic perovskite materials based on methylammonium lead iodide are an emerging technology. In the 10 years since their discovery efficiencies have risen from 3% to 23%. and as such are on the verge of commercialisation. Yet there are still some unsolved problems. One such problem is the lack of stability. caused by a susceptibility to degradation by water. heat and even light. Using mixed-cation perovskites has been shown to improve the short-term performance and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. In this work a new and stable alternative cation to methylammonium is proposed. azetidinium. Azetidinium lead iodide exhibits a unique 2.5-Dimensional structure when used on its own. and improves efficiency and stability when used in conjunction with methylammonium. Following this the effect of cationmixing is assessed in more detail. A wide-ranging study using 8-different cationic additives was performed to analyse their effect on iodide diffusion in methylammonium lead iodide. The distortion caused. expanding perovskite lattice size. increases the barrier for iodide diffusion. and with the largest cationic additives bulk iodide diffusion is no longer observed on the timescale of the experiment. This is then extended to formamidinium-based perovskites and the record efficiency triplecation perovskite.

Compositions with a mixture of cation species on the A-site show the best performance and have higher stability. However. the underlying fundamentals of such an enhancement are not fully understood. Here. we investigate the local structures and dynamics of mixed A-cation compositions. We show that substitution of low concentrations of smaller cations on the A-site in formamidimium lead iodide (CH(NH2)2PbI3) results in a global “locking” of the PbI6 octahedra tilting. In the locked structure the octahedra tilt at a larger angle but undergo a much reduced amplitude of rocking motion.

With the aid of the simulation. the electric field distribution can be explained in terms of charge carrier accumulation at the interface between the two organic layers. due to the HOMO and LUMO band offsets. and charge injection into the device. demonstrating the influence of contact materials on device behaviour.,True,WBztAewAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,80,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566119902000502,415183268657097537,/scholar?cites=415183268657097537,,,0,0,0

The solar cell characteristics are predicted by a simulation model that shows how the morphology influences device performance through integration of all the processes occurring in organic photocells in a specified morphology. In bicontinuous phases. the surface defining the interface between the electron and hole transporting phases divides the volume into two disjoint subvolumes. Exciton loss is reduced because the interface at which charge separation occurs permeates the device so excitons have only a short distance to reach the interface. As each of the component phases is connected. charges will be able to reach the electrodes more easily. In simulations of the current–voltage characteristics of organic cells with gyroid …,True,WBztAewAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,76,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2010/cp/b916340a,108820887410683306,/scholar?cites=108820887410683306,,http://shura.shu.ac.uk/1020/1/gyroidpaper.pdf,0,0,0

The cell is based on a thin film of dye-sensitised nanocrystalline TiO2 interpenetrated by a redox electrolyte. The high surface area of the TiO2 and the spectral characteristics of the dye allow the device to harvest 46% of the solar energy flux. One of the puzzling features of dye-sensitised nanocrystalline solar cells is the slow electron transport in the titanium dioxide phase. The available experimental evidence as well as theoretical considerations suggest that the driving force for electron collection at the substrate contact arises primarily from the concentration gradient. i.e. the contribution of drift is negligible. The transport of electrons has been characterised by small amplitude pulse or intensity modulated illumination.

Hydraulic fracturing is an established technology that has been used in the oil and gas industries for many decades. The UK has 60 years’ experience of regulating onshore and offshore oil and gas industries.Concerns have been raised about the risk of fractures propagating from shale formations to reach overlying aquifers. The available evidence indicates that this risk is very low provided that shale gas extraction takes place at depths of many hundreds of metres or several kilometres. Geological mechanisms constrain the distances that fractures may propagate vertically. Even if communication with overlying aquifers were possible. suitable pressure conditions would still be necessary for contaminants to flow through fractures. More likely causes of possible environmental contamination include faulty wells. and leaks and spills associated with surface operations. Neither cause is unique to shale gas. Both are common to all oil and gas wells and extractive activities.,True,WBztAewAAAAJ:fQNAKQ3IYiAC,70,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/69554/1/PY-Shale-gas-2012-06-28-.pdf,646949530188932361,/scholar?cites=646949530188932361,,https://eprints.gla.ac.uk/69554/1/PY-Shale-gas-2012-06-28-.pdf,0,0,0

A model for coupled ion vacancy motion and charge transport is formulated and solved in a three-layer planar perovskite solar cell. Its results are used to demonstrate that the replacement of standard transport layer materials (spiro-OMeTAD and TiO2) by materials with lower permittivity and/or doping leads to a shift in the scan rates at which hysteresis is most pronounced to rates higher than those commonly used in experiment. These results provide a cogent explanation for why organic electron transport layers can yield seemingly “hysteresis-free” devices but which nevertheless exhibit hysteresis at low temperature. In these devices the decrease in ion vacancy mobility with temperature compensates for the increase in hysteresis rate with use of low permittivity/doping organic transport layers …,True,WBztAewAAAAJ:Z5m8FVwuT1cC,69,https://pubs.rsc.org/lv/content/articlehtml/2019/ee/c8ee01576g,10742031451517368823,/scholar?cites=10742031451517368823,,https://pubs.rsc.org/lv/content/articlehtml/2019/ee/c8ee01576g,0,0,0

Values of the apparent electron diffusion coefficient are many orders of magnitude smaller than those reported for bulk anatase. The slow transport of electrons has been attributed to multiple trapping (MT) at energy levels distributed exponentially in the band gap of the nanocrystalline oxide. In the MT model. release of immobile electrons from occupied traps to the conduction band is a thermally activated process. and it might therefore be expected that the apparent electron diffusion coefficient should depend strongly on temperature. In fact. rather small activation energies (0.1−0.25 eV) have been derived from time and frequency resolved measurements of the short circuit photocurrent. It is shown that the MT model can give rise to such anomalously low apparent activation energies as a consequence of …,True,WBztAewAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,68,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp0627776,1614828477368774514,/scholar?cites=1614828477368774514,,,0,0,0

Compositions with a mixture of cation species on the A-site show the best performance and have higher stability. However. the underlying fundamentals of such an enhancement are not fully understood. Here. we investigate the local structures and dynamics of mixed A-cation compositions. We show that substitution of low concentrations of smaller cations on the A-site in formamidimium lead iodide (CH(NH2)2PbI3) results in a global “locking” of the PbI6 octahedra tilting. In the locked structure the octahedra tilt at a larger angle but undergo a much reduced amplitude of rocking motion. A key impact of this feature is that the rotational or tumbling motion of the CH(NH2)2+ molecular ion in a locked cage is severely restricted.

1072711,Nanomaterials in electrochemical biosensors for food analysis-a review,2008,Subramanian Viswanathan and Jerzy Radecki,58,,2,,-,As agriculture and food technology have advanced and populations increase. the current global population is nearly 6 billion with 50% living in Asia. analytical and regulatory problems concerning food have become very complex. Food production and preservation has become very important due to the need to store food for long periods. to prevent chemical and microbiological deterioration. insect infestation and pathogenic contamination. Food quality control is essential both for consumer protection and also for the food industry. In the food industry. the quality of a product is evaluated through periodic chemical and microbiological analysis. These procedures conventionally use techniques as chromatography. spectrophotometry. electrophoresis. titration and others. These methods do not allow an easy. rapid monitoring. because they are complex analytical steps with expensive instrumentation. need well trained operators and in some cases. increasing the time of analysis. Nowadays food analysis needs rapid and affordable methods to determine compounds that have not previously been monitored and to replace existing ones [Wagner & Guilbault. 1994]. An alternative to ease the analysis in routine of industrial products is the biosensors development. Biosensors are a sub group of chemical sensors that integrate biological sensing elements with physical transducers where the interactions between biological sensing elements and target molecules are directly converted into an electronic signal.

We performed NMR analyses of Dronpa in solution at ambient temperatures to find structural flexibility of the protein in the dark state. Light-induced changes in interactions between the chromophore and β-barrel are responsible for switching between the two states. In the bright state. the apex of the chromophore tethers to the barrel by a hydrogen bond. and an imidazole ring protruding from the barrel stabilizes the plane of the chromophore. These interactions are disrupted by strong illumination with blue light. and the chromophore. together with a part of the β-barrel. becomes flexible. leading to a nonradiative decay process.,True,x70S4_QAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,150,https://www.pnas.org/content/105/27/9227.short,7956885123861996841,/scholar?cites=7956885123861996841,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/27/9227.full.pdf,0,0,0

1072766,Blocking Protein kinase C signaling pathway: mechanistic insights into the anti-leishmanial activity of prospective herbal drugs from Withania somnifera,2012,Abhinav Grover and Shashank Prakash Katiyar and Jeyaraman Jeyakanthan and Vikash Kumar Dubey and Durai Sundar,13,,7,1-11,BioMed Central,Leishmaniasis is caused by several species of leishmania protozoan and is one of the major vector-born diseases after malaria and sleeping sickness. Toxicity of available drugs and drug resistance development by protozoa in recent years has made Leishmaniasis cure difficult and challenging. This urges the need to discover new antileishmanial-drug targets and antileishmanial-drug development. Tertiary structure of leishmanial protein kinase C was predicted and found stable with a RMSD of 5.8Å during MD simulations. Natural compound withaferin A inhibited the predicted protein at its active site with -28.47 kcal/mol binding free energy. Withanone was also found to inhibit LPKC with good binding affinity of -22.57 kcal/mol. Both withaferin A and withanone were found stable within the binding pocket of predicted protein when MD simulations of ligand-bound protein complexes were carried out to examine the consistency of interactions between the two. Leishmanial protein kinase C (LPKC) has been identified as a potential target to develop drugs against Leishmaniasis. We modelled and refined the tertiary structure of LPKC using computational methods such as homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations. This structure of LPKC was used to reveal mode of inhibition of two previous experimentally reported natural compounds from Withania somnifera - withaferin A and withanone.,True,x70S4_QAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,24,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-S7-S20,10873980587333943660,/scholar?cites=10873980587333943660,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-S7-S20,0,0,0

The low energy static hazards of the order as low as 2–3 mJ need to be guarded against in case of highly sensitive compounds namely primary explosives. The hazard is normally associated with manufacturing and filling operations due to discharge of static charge accumulated on a person supplying energy up to 20 mJ. To reduce the risk associated with static initiation hazard in the processing and handling of the explosives. the electrostatic sensitivity tests can provide an important input regarding electrostatic hazards.

The performance of calcined MgAl hydrotalcites is found to be much better than MgO and the physical mixture of MgO and Al2O3. It is found that selectivity of β-methylstyrene is improved upon the substitution of Mg2+ by Ni2+ or Cu2+ as a result of the formation of stronger acid sites.

In the present study. pH-dependent P sorption on an allophanic Andisol and an alluvial soil was compared with that on hydrogen peroxide (H202)-treated. acid-oxalate (OX)-treated. and dithionite-citrate- bicarbonate (DCB)-treated soils. Removal of 80M increased or decreased P sorption depending on the equilibrium pH values and soil types. In the H2O2 OX-. and DCB-treated soils. P sorption was pH-dependent. but this trend was not conspicuous in the untreated soils. It is likely that 80M affects P sorption of soils through three factors. competitive sorption. inhibition of polymerization and crystallization of metals such as AI and Fe. and flexible structure of metal-80M complexes.

In fact. India is the leading producer of this perennial crop. It is estimated that. after harvest of fruits. huge quantity of biomass residues (60t/ha–80/t ha) is left over as waste that constitutes pseudo stem. leaves. sucker etc. There exists a vast potential of extracting fibres from the banana pseudo stem. It is estimated that annually 17.000 tonnes of fibres can be extracted from this waste valued roughly Rs. 85 crores. These enormous quantities of natural wealth can be exploited in fibre industry for the production of technical and non-technical textiles apart from its regular use in handicrafts and utility items. It involves a series of unit operations from extraction of fibre to making of final product from this natural resource. Though the manual process of extraction yields good quality of fibre but it is quite un-economical due to its labour extensive and low output (200gm/person/day) characteristics. Hence efficient extraction of banana fibre can only be possible through mechanization. However. formulation and implementation of energy conservation drives at different steps of banana fibre extraction and processing may be taken up either one at a time or all simultaneously as practicable depending upon the various parameters.

Moses,70,Journal of the Textile Association,1,9-18,The Textile Association (India),Surface modification of textile fibers is receiving increased attention. A novel concept for the modification of the fibrous polymer surface is based on the permanent fixation of supramolecular compounds such as cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins are torus-shaped cyclic oligosaccharides. They are able to form inclusion complex with a large number of organic molecule. This property of cyclodextrin enables them to impart functional properties such as hydrophilicity. complexation of sweat. release of perfume/antimicrobial/pharmaceutical characters to textile fibers by microencapsulation. which promotes the wearing comfort of clothing textiles.

Lac treated jute fabric has been used to reinforce the unsaturated polyester resin (USP). Flexural strength and inter-laminar shear strength (ILSS) of lac modified jute/USP biocomposite have been evaluated and then compared with sodium hydroxide treated jute as well as untreated jute based biocomposites. Lac treated jute fabric shows higher flexural properties of the biocomposite than that of untreated jute fabric. which infers that lac acts as a good compatibliser between jute fibre and USP.

As the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) behavior of gold nanostructures (Au NPs) on the top of a gold thin film is exquisitely sensitive to the spacer distance of the film-Au NPs. we investigate in the present work the influence of a few-layered graphene spacer on the LSPR behavior of the NPs.

We first show that the coupling to the Au film induces a strong lowering at around 507 nm and sharpening of the main LSPR of the Au NPs. Moreover. a blue shift in the main LSP resonance of about 13 nm is observed in the presence of a few-layered graphene spacer when compared to the case where gold nanostructures are directly linked to a gold thin film.

Out of nine CAB screened. the ethyl acetate extract of CAB-E2 (Bacillus firmus) and CAB-E4 (Vibrio parahemolyticus) have shown excellent antibiofilm activity against S. aureus. CAB-E2 reduced the production of EPS (57–79%) and hemolysin (43–70%). which ultimately resulted in the significant inhibition of biofilms (80–87%) formed by both MRSA and MSSA. Similarly. CAB-E4 was also found to decrease the production of EPS (43–57%). hemolysin (43–57%) and biofilms (80–85%) of test pathogens. CLSM analysis also proved the antibiofilm efficacy of CAB extracts. Furthermore. the CAB extracts strongly decreased the CSH of S. aureus. Additionally. FT-IR analysis of S. aureus treated with CAB extracts evidenced the reduction in cellular components compared to their respective controls. Thus. the present study reports for the first time.

ISP-1/myriocin,1995,Yurika Miyake and Yasunori Kozutsumi and Sachiko Nakamura and Tetsuro Fujita and Toshisuke Kawasaki,211,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2,396-403,Academic Press,ISP-1/myriocin is a new type of remarkably potent immunosuppressant. the structure of which is homologous to sphingosine. ISP-1/myriocin inhibited the proliferation of an IL-2-dependent mouse cytotoxic T cell line. CTLL-2. at nanomole concentrations. ISP-1/myriocin inhibits serine palmitoyltransferase activity at picomole concentrations. This enzyme catalyzes the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis and reduces the intracellular pool of sphingolipid intermediates. The growth inhibition induced by ISP-1/myriocin was completely abolished by the addition of sphingosines or sphingosine-1-phosphate. but not by sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids. These results suggest that sphingosines or sphingosine-1-phosphate are associated with CTLL-2 proliferation. and ISP-1/myriocin suppresses T cell proliferation by the modulation of sphingolipid metabolism.

Transplantation of human bone marrow stromal cells or skin-derived fibroblasts led to substantially less recovery of locomotor function. The human dental pulp stem cells exhibited three major neuroregenerative activities. First. they inhibited the SCI-induced apoptosis of neurons. astrocytes. and oligodendrocytes. which improved the preservation of neuronal filaments and myelin sheaths.

Given the potential for future lethal pandemics. effective drugs are needed for the treatment of severe influenza such as that caused by H5N1 viruses. Using mediator lipidomics and bioactive lipid screen. we report that the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-derived lipid mediator protectin D1 (PD1) markedly attenuated influenza virus replication via RNA export machinery. Production of PD1 was suppressed during severe influenza and PD1 levels inversely correlated with the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses. Suppression of PD1 was genetically mapped to 12/15-lipoxygenase activity. Importantly. PD1 treatment improved the survival and pathology of severe influenza in mice. even under conditions where known antiviral drugs fail to protect from death.

A number of C57BL/6 substrains have been derived from the C57BL/6 founder line and are reported to differ in several phenotypes. There are several major sources of C57BL/6 substrains for the biomedical research community. The importance of their genetic and phenotypic differences among substrains. however. has not yet been well recognized by biomedical researchers. Here. we report the result of screening of the functional deletion of the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) gene and 1.446 SNPs genotyping among seven C57BL/6 substrains from different sources. such as C57BL/6J. C57BL/6JJcl. C57BL/6JJmsSlc. C57BL/6NJcl. C57BL/6NCrlCrlj. C57BL/6NTac. and C57BL/6CrSlc. The deletion of exon 7–11 in the Nnt gene that was previously reported in C57BL/6J was also observed in other C57BL/6J substrains. indicating that this functional deletion probably occurred at an early stage in the establishment of C57BL/6J substrains. The genotyping of SNP loci clearly demonstrate genetic differences between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N substrains at 11 loci. Besides. we found another SNP differing between C57BL/6J and other C57BL/6J substrains available from commercial breeders. No genetic difference was detected among C57BL/6N substrains. The C57BL/6CrSlc mouse. originally derived from the National Cancer Institute of the NIH was found to be the same as the C57BL/6N substrains by the SNP pattern.

We applied a “next-generation” parallel sequencing platform for viral detection in nasopharyngeal and fecal samples collected during seasonal influenza virus (Flu) infections and norovirus outbreaks from 2005 to 2007 in Osaka. Japan. Random RT-PCR was performed to amplify RNA extracted from 0.1–0.25 ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates (N = 3) and fecal specimens (N = 5). and more than 10 µg of cDNA was synthesized. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing of these 8 samples yielded 15.298–32.335 (average 24.738) reads in a single 7.5 h run. In nasopharyngeal samples. although whole genome analysis was not available because the majority (>90%) of reads were host genome–derived. 20–460 Flu-reads were detected. which was sufficient for subtype identification. In fecal samples. bacteria and host cells were removed by centrifugation. resulting in gain of 484–15.260 reads of norovirus sequence (78–98% of the whole genome was covered). except for one specimen that was under-detectable by RT-PCR. These results suggest that our unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach is useful for directly detecting pathogenic viruses without advance genetic information.

The method is based on the fact that the imidazole C2-proton undergoes pH-dependent hydrogen−deuterium exchange reaction. of which the rate constant (kφ) reflects the pKa for the ionization of imidazole to imidazolium. The experimental procedure consists of the following: (1) protein incubation in D2O solvent at various pH values. (2) protein digestion by proteolytic enzyme(s). during which all the rapidly exchanging deuterons such as those in amide and hydroxyl groups are back-exchanged for protons. and (3) measurement of the mass spectrum of each histidine-containing peptide by LC/ESI-MS.

In the present study. VPTLK and KLPVM. two representative CPP5s. were used to characterize the cell-penetration and protein-transduction activities of these small molecules. Various inhibitors of endocytosis and pinocytosis (chlorpromazine. cytochalasin D. Filipin III. amiloride. methyl-b-cyclodextrin. and nocodazole) were tested. Only cytochalasin D showed suppression of CPP5 entry. though the effect was partial. In addition. CPP5s were able to enter a proteoglycan-deficient CHO cell line. These results suggest that pinocytosis and endocytosis may play only a minor role in the cell entry of CPP5s. By mass spectrometry. we determined that the intracellular concentration of VPTLK ranged from 20 nM to 6.0 mM when the cells were cultured in medium containing 1 mM–1.6 mM VPTLK. To determine the protein-transduction activity of CPP5s. the Tex-LoxP EG cell line. which has a Cre-inducible green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. was used. VPTLK and KLPVM were added to the N-terminus of Cre. and these fusion proteins were added to the culture medium of Tex-LoxP EG cells. Both VPTLK-Cre and KLPVM-Cre were able to turn on GFP expression in these cells. suggesting that CPP5s have protein-transduction activity.

For many years. the emphasis has been placed on how to both overcome the multiple minima problem and find the conformation with the global minimum potential energy. Since the new view of the protein folding mechanism (based on the free energy landscape of the protein system) arose in the past few years. however. it is now of interest to obtain a global knowledge of the phase space. including the intermediate and denatured states of proteins. Monte Carlo methods have proved especially valuable for these purposes. As well as new. powerful optimization techniques. novel algorithms that can sample much a wider phase space than conventional methods have been established.,True,oF-t5OIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,353,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X99800256,750532249212679859,/scholar?cites=750532249212679859,,,0,0,0

In an effort to gain insight into the role of Fe in these catalysts. we have performed operando Mössbauer spectroscopic studies of a 3:1 Ni:Fe layered hydroxide and a hydrous Fe oxide electrocatalyst. The catalysts were prepared by a hydrothermal precipitation method that enabled catalyst growth directly on carbon paper electrodes. Fe4+ species were detected in the NiFe hydroxide catalyst during steady-state water oxidation. accounting for up to 21% of the total Fe. In contrast. no Fe4+ was detected in the Fe oxide catalyst.

Mössbauer spectroscopy has been applied to measure recoilless absorption of x-ray photons by nuclei. Recently. synchrotron radiation sources have enabled the observation of weaker features separated from the recoilless resonance by the energy of vibrational quanta. This enables a form of vibrational spectroscopy with a unique sensitivity to the probe nucleus. Biological applications are particularly promising. because it is possible to selectively probe vibrations of a single atom at the active site of a complex biomolecule. while avoiding interference from the vibrations of thousands of other atoms.

Despite this structural similarity. HiPIPs react oxidatively at physiological potentials. whereas Fds are reduced. Sulfur K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy uncovers the substantial influence of hydration on this variation in reactivity. Fe-S covalency is much lower in natively hydrated Fd active sites than in HiPIPs but increases upon water removal; similarly. HiPIP covalency decreases when unfolding exposes an otherwise hydrophobically shielded active site to water.

The electro-catalytic reduction of oxygen is reversibly inhibited by H2S concentrations similar to those that induce hibernation.

The energy of the metal–thiolate bond is fairly insensitive to its ionic/covalent and π/σ nature as increasing MS covalency reduces the charge distribution. hence the ionic term. and these contributions can compensate. Thus. trends observed in stability constants (i.e.. the Irving–Williams series) mostly reflect the dominantly ionic contribution to bonding of the innocent ligand being replaced by the thiolate. Due to high effective nuclear charges of the CuII and FeIII ions. the cupric– and ferric–thiolate bonds are very covalent. with the former having strong π and the latter having more σ character.

These enzymes catalyze many processes including the biosynthesis of hormones. the metabolism of drugs. DNA and RNA base repair and. the biosynthesis of antibiotics. Therefore. mononuclear iron containing enzymes are important intermediates in bioprocesses and have great potential in the commercial biosynthesis of specific products since they often catalyze reactions regioselectively or stereospecifically. Understanding their mechanism and function is important and will assist in searches for commercial exploitation.

Since the spectrum represents electronic transitions from the ligand molecular orbitals to the core holes of the metal centers. the approach is more chemically sensitive to the metal–ligand bonding character compared with conventional X-ray absorption techniques. In this paper we study how linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) can be harnessed to simulate K-edge VtC X-ray emission spectra reliably. LR-TDDFT allows one to go beyond the single-particle picture that has been extensively used to simulate VtC-XES.

1073914,Experimental quantification of anion− π interactions in solution using neutral host–guest model systems,2013,Pablo Ballester,46,,4,874-884,American Chemical Society,Chemical intuition suggests that anions and π-aromatic systems would repel each other. Typically. we think of cations as being attracted to electron-rich π-systems of aromatic rings. and the cation−π interaction. a well-established noncovalent interaction. plays an important role in nature. Therefore the anion−π interaction can be considered the opposite of the cation−π interaction. Computational studies of simple models of anion−π interactions have provided estimates of the factors that govern the binding geometry and the binding energy. leading to a general consensus about the nature of these interactions. In order to attract an anion. the charge distribution of the aromatic system has to be reversed. usually through the decoration of the aromatic systems with strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

The goal of including anions in molecular capsules emerges from the idea of incorporating the traits exhibited by biological receptors into synthetic ones. At the outset of this research area the capsules were unimolecular. The scaffold of the receptor was designed to covalently link a series of functional groups that could converge into a cavity and to avoid its collapse. The initial examples involved the encapsulation of one monoatomic spherical anion. With time. the cavity size of the receptor was increased and encapsulation of polyatomic anions and co-encapsulation became a reality. Synthetic economy fueled the use of aggregates of self-complementary molecules rather than one large molecule as capsules.

The movement of a small ring around a larger one occurs through positional displacements arising from biased Brownian motion that are kinetically captured and then directionally released. The sense of rotation is governed solely by the order in which a series of orthogonal chemical transformations is performed.

Unlike traditional “passive” metal template methods to rotaxanes and catenanes. permanent recognition motifs are not required on each of the components to be interlocked (i.e.. the assembly can be traceless) and the template can often be used in sub-stoichiometric quantities.

The large asymmetric C300 fullerene structure exhibits translational motion inside the SWNT and unique corkscrew like rotation motion. Another asymmetric fullerene chain containing mixed fullerene species is prepared by fusing smaller C60 fullerenes to a larger Sc@C82 fullerene. and this also exhibits corkscrew rotational motion. Chains of Sc3C2@C80 in SWNT peapods adopt a zigzag packing structure. and the entire zigzag chain rotates inside the SWNT to induce structural modifications to the SWNT diameter and cross-sectional …,True,TVzLWv4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,66,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl801149z,11749690851770529601,/scholar?cites=11749690851770529601,,,0,0,0

For example. the development of transition-metal mediated transformations and asymmetric catalysis have expanded the range of molecules that can now be accessed. By way of contrast. the technology and many of the tools used to perform synthetic operations have remained more or less constant. Although batch-mode working is the most common manner of conducting reactions and subsequent downstream manipulations. there are many advantages in augmenting this with modern enabling technologies. Indeed. all components of a chemical process. such as reagent delivery. mixing. heating. analytical monitoring. quenching. work-up and finally purification can affect the overall success of the reaction and consequently all could benefit from improvement. Recently. machine-assisted protocols have been influencing the way that molecules are being prepared.[2] In particular our group and others are addressing some of the recurring challenges that face organic synthesis by providing simpler and more efficient processing tools. In order to achieve this. we have been evaluating the utility of flow-based chemical synthesis. Under a dynamic flow regime mixing and heat transfer can be controlled more accurately [3] and the use of solid-phase reagents and catalysts can facilitate the purification as an in-line integrated process.[4] The importance of monitoring devices for learning and understanding these processes cannot be underestimated. Advanced systems are now available for detailed studies of each component of a reaction pathway.[5 …,True,2-h-aCUAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,57,http://community.dur.ac.uk/i.r.baxendale/papers/ChemEurJ2013.19.7917.pdf,12176121966435802844,/scholar?cites=12176121966435802844,,http://community.dur.ac.uk/i.r.baxendale/papers/ChemEurJ2013.19.7917.pdf,0,0,0

Cyclic voltammetric studies of isoproturon on glassy carbon electrode in acids neutral and alkaline conditions at different sweep rates ranging from 0.025 to 1.0 v. sec-1 revealed two electron oxidation. Influence of pH. scan rate and concentration were studied on the voltammetric response. For all concentrations and sweep rates studied two anodic peaks and one cathodic peak were observed. The anodic peak around+ 1.3 V was well shaped with higher current and the remaining anodic peak around+ 0.85 V and cathodic peak around+ 0.58 V are of lesser current with little sharpness. The latter two peaks were noticed only when the initial potentials are switched from or above 1.0 V indicating the possibility of intermediate produced in the oxidation step undergoes reduction and oxidation. The main oxidation peak aroused due to irreversible oxidation and the overall reaction was diffusion controlled. Differential pulse and square wave voltammetric studies were also led to same conclusion. The diffusion coefficients at various pH media were calculated using chronocoulometry.

Food production and preservation has become very important due to the need to store food for long periods. to prevent chemical and microbiological deterioration. insect infestation and pathogenic contamination. Food quality control is essential both for consumer protection and also for the food industry. In the food industry. the quality of a product is evaluated through periodic chemical and microbiological analysis. These procedures conventionally use techniques as chromatography. spectrophotometry. electrophoresis. titration and others. These methods do not allow an easy. rapid monitoring. because they are complex analytical steps with expensive instrumentation. need well trained operators and in some cases. increasing the time of analysis. Nowadays food analysis needs rapid and affordable methods to determine compounds that have not previously been monitored and to replace existing ones [Wagner & Guilbault. 1994]. An alternative to ease the analysis in routine of industrial products is the biosensors development.

The detailed structural and microstructural studies confirm that the doped Gd ions occupy Zn sites and the peak shift can be elucidated by charge neutrality. Optical investigation shows that the Gd doping in ZnO lattice leads to a decrease in the near band edge position due to the introduction of new unoccupied states by Gd 4f electrons. The electronic structure of the Zn1−xGdxO at the O K edge shows the evolution of pre-edge spectral features similar to cuprates and manganites. and also confirms the strong hybridization of O 2p–Gd 4f/5d states. Furthermore. the Gd M5 edge provides evidence that Gd ions are in the trivalent state.

The crystalline perfection has been verified by High resolution X‐ray diffraction (HRXRD) analysis. The very low angle boundary obtained for this solution‐grown specimen may be attributed to the segregation of solvent molecules (methanol). which were entrapped within the crystal during growth. The laser damage threshold has been measured by using high intensity Q‐switched Nd:YAG laser. The observed value is greater than that of KDP and lesser than that of melt grown benzimidazole. The NLO efficiency has been determined and it is compared with the KDP crystal. The thermal behaviour has been assessed by TG/DTA analysis. (© 2006 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
