1145559,Assessment of methods for amino acid matrix selection and their use on empirical data shows that ad hoc assumptions for choice of matrix are not justified,2006,Thomas Keane and Christopher Creevey and Melissa Pentony and Thomas Naughton and James Mclnerney,6,BMC evolutionary biology,1,29,BioMed Central Ltd,In recent years. model based approaches such as maximum likelihood have become the methods of choice for constructing phylogenies. A number of authors have shown the importance of using adequate substitution models in order to produce accurate phylogenies. In the past. many empirical models of amino acid substitution have been derived using a variety of different methods and protein datasets. These matrices are normally used as surrogates. rather than deriving the maximum likelihood model from the dataset being examined. With few exceptions. selection between alternative matrices has been carried out in an ad hoc manner. We start by highlighting the potential dangers of arbitrarily choosing protein models by demonstrating an empirical example where a single alignment can produce two topologically different and strongly supported phylogenies using two different arbitrarily-chosen amino acid substitution models. We demonstrate that in simple simulations. statistical methods of model selection are indeed robust and likely to be useful for protein model selection. We have investigated patterns of amino acid substitution among homologous sequences from the three Domains of life and our results show that no single amino acid matrix is optimal for any of the datasets. Perhaps most interestingly. we demonstrate that for two large datasets derived from the proteobacteria and archaea. one of the most favored models in both datasets is a model that was originally derived from retroviral Pol proteins. This demonstrates that choosing protein models based on their source or method of construction may not be appropriate.,True,Tqgt4g0AAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,1069,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-6-29,8315975858479132864,/scholar?cites=8315975858479132864,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-6-29,0,0,0

Before the genome era. many evolutionary processes were evaluated from limited data sets and evolutionary models were constructed on the basis of small amounts of evidence. In this paper. I show that genes on the Borrelia burgdorferi genome have two separate. distinct. and significantly different codon usages. depending on whether the gene is transcribed on the leading or lagging strand of replication. Asymmetrical replication is the major source of codon usage variation. Replicational selection is responsible for the higher number of genes on the leading strands. and transcriptional selection appears to be responsible for the enrichment of highly expressed genes on these strands. Replicational–transcriptional selection. therefore. has an influence on the codon …,True,Tqgt4g0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,265,https://www.pnas.org/content/95/18/10698.short,18131429539085168781,/scholar?cites=18131429539085168781,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/95/18/10698.full.pdf,0,0,0

However. eukaryotic genomes are replete with genes of eubacterial ancestry. and more than 20 mutually incompatible hypotheses have been proposed to account for eukaryote origins.

Using our signal-stripping method. we show that there are three distinct phylogenetic signals in eukaryotic genomes.

1145568,Why prokaryotes have pangenomes,2017,James O McInerney and Alan McNally and Mary J O'Connell,2,Nature Microbiology,4,1-5,Nature Publishing Group,The existence of large amounts of within-species genome content variability is puzzling. Population genetics tells us that fitness effects of new variants—either deleterious. neutral or advantageous—combined with the long-term effective population size of the species determines the likelihood of a new variant being removed. spreading to fixation or remaining polymorphic. Consequently. we expect that selection and drift will reduce genetic variation. which makes large amounts of gene content variation in some species so puzzling. Here. we amalgamate population genetic theory with models of horizontal gene transfer and assert that pangenomes most easily arise in organisms with large long-term effective population sizes. as a consequence of acquiring advantageous genes. and that the focal species has the ability to migrate to new niches. Therefore. we suggest that pangenomes are the result of adaptive. not …,True,Tqgt4g0AAAAJ:MappHbsApxQC,180,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201740,8520052880273124018,/scholar?cites=8520052880273124018,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/113972/39/McInerney_McNally_O%27Connell_NatMicro.pdf,0,0,0

However. the majority of such analyses do not consider the potential role of accessory genes when inferring evolutionary trajectories. Moreover. the recently discovered importance of the switching of gene regulatory elements suggests that an exhaustive analysis. combining information from core and accessory genes with regulatory elements could provide unparalleled detail of the evolution of a bacterial population. Here we demonstrate this principle by applying it to a worldwide multi-host sample of the important pathogenic E. coli lineage ST131. Our approach reveals the existence of multiple circulating subtypes of the major drug–resistant clade of ST131 and provides the first ever population level evidence of core genome substitutions in gene regulatory regions associated with the acquisition and maintenance of different accessory genome elements.,True,Tqgt4g0AAAAJ:ZxXHo_Hcam8C,115,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006280,259224611960647077,/scholar?cites=259224611960647077,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006280,0,0,0

Prior to that. it was assumed that there was a phylogenetic tree uniting all prokaryotes. but no suitable data were available for its construction. For 20 years. through the 1980s and 1990s. rRNA phylogenies were the gold standard. However. beginning in the last decade. findings from genomic data have challenged this new consensus. Gene trees can conflict greatly. and strains of the same species can differ enormously in genome content. Horizontal gene transfer is now known to be a significant influence on genome evolution.

This situation was clarified [1] and their current usage is usually appropriate. Recently. we have felt a similar need for standard and indeed. new. terminology for describing relationships in unrooted phylogenetic trees in our teaching of molecular evolution. Distinct terms could help teachers to explain. and students to understand. the fundamental concept of phylogenetic relationships and the important differences between unrooted and rooted trees. Rooted trees have an explicit ancestral node that is known. whereas unrooted trees have no such node. Unrooted trees are common in molecular phylogenetics. However. much of the terminology used to describe relationships in trees was developed for rooted trees. The use of terms and phrases such as ‘clade’.‘monophyletic group’.‘more closely related to’and ‘sister taxa’to describe relationships in unrooted trees is problematic. but not uncommon [2–7].To say that some genes or taxa are more closely related to each other than they are to others is to say that they have a common ancestor that is not an ancestor of any of the others (ie that they share a more recent common ancestry)[8]. Similarly. to say that a group is monophyletic. or that it is a clade. is to say that all of its members are more closely related to each other than any of them are to any non-member. To say that two groups are sister taxa is to say that they are each others closest relatives [9. 10].

Life trait variations that may impact upon mutational rates are longevity. metabolic rate. body size. and germ line generation time.

This approach is rather flexible and can combine the advantages of global and local alignment methods. The restriction to pairwise alignments as building blocks. however. can lead to misalignments since weak homologies may be missed if only pairs of sequences are compared. Results: Herein. we propose a graph-theoretical approach to find local multiple sequence similarities. Starting with pairwise alignments produced by DIALIGN. we use a min-cut algorithm to find potential (partial) alignment columns that we use to construct a final multiple alignment.

Network-based methods are increasingly used to complement phylogenetic analysis in studies in molecular evolution. including comparative genomics. classification. and ecological studies. Using network methods. the vertical and horizontal relationships between all genes or genomes. whether they are from cellular chromosomes or mobile genetic elements. can be explored in a single expandable graph.

External sources of information. however. can give valuable hints to possible sequence homologies that may not be obvious from sequence comparison alone. Given the huge amount of sequence annotation that is being produced on a daily basis. integrating such external information into the alignment process can contribute to produce biologically more meaningful alignments. In this paper. we investigate different approaches to use existing information about protein domains for improved multiple alignments. We use the PFAM database to identify possible domains in protein sequences. and we use this information to align protein sequences with DIALIGN and with a recently developed graph-theoretical approach to multiple alignment.

We herein investigate the N-local decoding method due to Gilles Didier ([2]). in order to classify sequences according to the local similarity segments of a fixed length N that they share. The sites of our sequences are originally occupied by a nucleotide or an amino-acid. and. after the N-local decoding has been applied. these sites are occupied by new symbols (that we call GD-classes). which classify the sites according to the composition of their environment in words of length N. This method has already been successfully used to construct trees for the subtyping of HIV/SIV variants ([3]).

The human body and human genome along with gut microbes and their genomes can be seen as a dynamic holobiont system (3–5). i.e.. a superorganism amalgamating microbial and human attributes (6). In this multipartite holobiont. the host genome provides the primary genome. while microbial genes constitute the “second human genome.” which is in fact a prokaryotic pangenome (3. 7. 8). Whether the holobionts are units of selection is actively debated (9–11). yet other aspects of their biology are less controversial. and holobionts are becoming a major object of study in biology. Among these uncontroversial features lies the observation that. by definition. a holobiont is home to several different modes of genetic transmission.

Topoisomerases IA have a special place because they are conserved in all the living world and are essential for the genomes stability. They are involved in the cellular aging process and in the development of tumors. The topoisomerase IA studies are faced to several difficulties. They are divided into different functional sub-families distributed in a lot of very different organisms. The role and the mode of action of topoisomerases vary depending on the sub-family as well as the interactions in which they are involved. Despite their importance. these proteins remain largely unknown. Therefore. it is interesting to build a topoisomerases IA dedicated database. annotated and validated by topoisomerases’ experts.In order to easily visualize one or one group of topoisomerases. a database of more than 1800 IA topoisomerases has been associated with an user friendly interface. These topoisomerases were grouped into ten categories with a comparison method without alignment (VLD). The database takes into account these categories and the taxonomy.

Practically. building the Tree of Life has proven to be tedious. Too few morphological characters are useful for conducting conclusive phylogenetic analyses at the highest taxonomic level. Consequently. molecular sequences (genes. proteins. and genomes) likely constitute the only useful characters for constructing a phylogeny of all life. For this reason. tree-makers expect a lot from gene comparisons.

Hybridization is one mechanism that could facilitate this. Here we report statistical evidence that the transfer of genetic information through hybridization is a feature of species from the plant genus Pachycladon that survived the Last Glacial Maximum in geographically separated alpine refugia in New Zealand’s South Island. We show that transferred glucosinolate hydrolysis genes also exhibit evidence of intra-locus recombination. Such gene exchange and recombination has the potential to alter the chemical defence in the offspring of hybridizing species.

We apply several recently developed analytical methods to this problem. for the first time. Our heat map analyses of P values and of bootstrap bipartitions show the presence of conflicting phylogenetic signals among these core genes. Our synthesis reconstruction suggests that at least 10% of these genes have been laterally transferred during the divergence of the γ-proteobacteria. and that for most of the rest. there is too little phylogenetic signal to permit firm conclusions about the mode of inheritance.

Existing methods for identifying incongruence or heterogeneity using character data were designed for data sets that are both small and expected to be rarely incongruent. At the same time. methods that assess incongruence using comparison of trees test a null hypothesis of uncorrelated tree structures. which may be inappropriate for phylogenomic studies. As such. they are ill-suited for the growing number of available genome sequences. most of which are from prokaryotes and viruses. either for phylogenomic analysis or for studies of the evolutionary forces and events that have shaped these genomes.

The monophyly of the group was confirmed by molecular phylogenetic studies. but neither the internal phylogeny nor its position on the eukaryotic tree has been clearly resolved. Here we have introduced data for three genes (SSU rRNA. α-tubulin and HSP90) with a wide taxonomic sampling of Fornicata. including ten isolates of enteromonads. representing the genera Trimitus and Enteromonas. and a new undescribed enteromonad genus. The diplomonad sequences formed two main clades in individual gene and combined gene analyses. with Giardia (and Octomitus) on one side of the basal divergence and Spironucleus. Hexamita and Trepomonas on the other. Contrary to earlier evolutionary scenarios. none of the studied enteromonads appeared basal to diplokaryotic diplomonads. Instead. the enteromonad isolates were all robustly situated within the second of the two diplomonad clades. Furthermore. our analyses suggested that enteromonads do not constitute a monophyletic group. and enteromonad monophyly was statistically rejected in 'approximately unbiased' tests of the combined gene data. We suggest that all higher taxa intended to unite multiple enteromonad genera be abandoned. that Trimitus and Enteromonas be considered as part of Hexamitinae. and that the term 'enteromonads' be used in a strictly utilitarian sense.

1145628,Invasion and persistence of a selfish gene in the Cnidaria,2006,Matthew R Goddard and Jessica Leigh and Andrew J Roger and Andrew J Pemberton,1,PLoS One,1,e3,Public Library of Science,Background Homing endonuclease genes (HEGs) are superfluous. but are capable of invading populations that mix alleles by biasing their inheritance patterns through gene conversion. One model suggests that their long-term persistence is achieved through recurrent invasion. This circumvents evolutionary degeneration. but requires reasonable rates of transfer between species to maintain purifying selection. Although HEGs are found in a variety of microbes. we found the previous discovery of this type of selfish genetic element in the mitochondria of a sea anemone surprising.   Methods/Principal Findings We surveyed 29 species of Cnidaria for the presence of the COXI HEG. Statistical analyses provided evidence for HEG invasion. We also found that 96 individuals of Metridium senile. from five different locations in the UK. had identical HEG sequences. This lack of sequence divergence illustrates the stable nature of Anthozoan mitochondria. Our data suggests this HEG conforms to the recurrent invasion model of evolution.   Conclusions Ordinarily such low rates of HEG transfer would likely be insufficient to enable major invasion. However. the slow rate of Anthozoan mitochondrial change lengthens greatly the time to HEG degeneration: this significantly extends the periodicity of the HEG life-cycle. We suggest that a combination of very low substitution rates and rare transfers facilitated metazoan HEG invasion.,True,r3Hh6psAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,48,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000003,14425465872724190687,/scholar?cites=14425465872724190687,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000003,0,0,0

In addition. assessment methods developed in the past have been designed for reasonably small numbers of loci and scale poorly for larger data sets. However. there are currently over a thousand complete genome sequences available and of interest to evolutionary biologists. and these sequences are predominantly from microbial organisms. whose molecular evolution is much less frequently treelike than that of multicellular life forms.

A popular view in the 1980s and 1990s held that the eukaryotic cell evolved prior to the origin of mitochondria and that contemporary mitochondrion-lacking protists such as diplomonads. parabasalids. pelobionts and microsporidia were Archezoa–living descendants of organisms from this early “pre-organellar” stage of eukaryote evolution. However. over the last decade. intensive phylogenetic and cell biological studies of these and other anaerobic protists lacking classical mitochondria indicate that they all harbour organelles and/or genes derived from mitochondria.

In addition. assessment methods developed in the past have been designed for reasonably small numbers of loci and scale poorly for larger data sets. However. there are currently over a thousand complete genome sequences available and of interest to evolutionary biologists. and these sequences are predominantly from microbial organisms. whose molecular evolution is much less frequently treelike than that of multicellular life forms.

Typically. prokaryotic data generate thousands of gene trees of all sizes that are difficult. if not impossible. to root. Their topologies do not match the genealogy of lineages. as they are influenced not only by duplication. losses. and vertical descent but also by lateral gene transfer (LGT) and recombination. Because this complexity in part reflects the diversity of evolutionary processes. the study of phylogenetic forests is thus a great opportunity to improve our understanding of prokaryotic evolution.

This case study illustrates how additional analyses could offer fast heuristic alternatives to standard tree of life (TOL) approaches. We use gene networks to identify genes with atypical modes of evolution. and genome networks to characterize the evolution of genetic partnerships between E. coli and mobile genetic elements. We develop a novel polychromatic quartet method to capture patterns of recombination within E. coli. to update the clanistic toolkit. and to search for the impact of lateral gene transfer and of pathogenicity on gene evolution in two large forests of trees bearing E. coli. We unravel high rates of lateral gene transfer involving E. coli (about 40% of the trees under study). and show that both core genes and shell genes of E. coli are affected by non-tree-like evolutionary processes. We show that pathogenic lifestyle impacted the structure of 30% of the gene trees. and that pathogenic strains are more likely to transfer genes with one another than with non-pathogenic strains. In addition. we propose five groups of genes as candidate mobile modules of pathogenicity. We also present strong evidence for recent lateral gene transfer between E. coli and mobile genetic elements.

While the genetic complexity of total cfDNA is vast. the development of progressively efficient extraction. high-throughput sequencing. characterization via bioinformatics procedures. and detection have resulted in increasingly accurate partitioning and profiling of cfDNA subtypes. Not surprisingly. cfDNA analysis is emerging as a powerful clinical tool in many branches of medicine. In addition. the low invasiveness of longitudinal cfDNA sampling provides unprecedented access to study temporal genomic changes in a variety of contexts. However. the genetic diversity of cfDNA is also a great source of ambiguity and poses significant experimental and analytical challenges.

Therefore. a deeper understanding of the determining variables that impact the properties of cfDNA is crucial. however. thus far. is largely lacking.

In contrast. several other studies have recovered an alternative topology in which ctenophores are the sister group to all other animals (including sponges). The “Ctenophora-sister” hypothesis implies that eumetazoan-specific traits. such as neurons and muscle cells. either evolved once along the metazoan stem lineage and were then lost in sponges and placozoans or evolved at least twice independently in Ctenophora and in Cnidaria + Bilateria.

Comparative analyses of this supermatrix and its two non-overlapping multi-gene partitions (including ribosomal and non-ribosomal genes) revealed conflicting phylogenetic signals. We show that the levels of saturation and long branch attraction artifacts in the two partitions correlate with gene sampling.

These observations suggest that the last common ancestor (LCA) to all living animals was developmentally more sophisticated than is widely appreciated and used asymmetric cell division and morphogen gradients to establish localized populations of specified cells within the embryo.

In mollusks. the mantle is responsible for the extracellular production of the shell. directing the ordered biomineralization of CaCO3 and the deposition of architectural and color patterns. The evolutionary origins of the ability to synthesize calcified structures across various metazoan taxa remain obscure. with only a small number of protein families identified from molluskan shells. The recent sequencing of a wide range of metazoan genomes coupled with the analysis of gene expression in non-model animals has allowed us to investigate the evolution and process of biomineralization in gastropod mollusks. Here we show that over 25% of the genes expressed in the mantle of the vetigastropod Haliotis asinina encode secreted proteins. indicating that hundreds of proteins are likely to be contributing to shell fabrication and patterning. Almost 85% of the secretome encodes novel proteins; remarkably. only 19% of these have identifiable homologues in the full genome of the patellogastropod Lottia scutum. The spatial expression profiles of mantle genes that belong to the secretome is restricted to discrete mantle zones. with each zone responsible for the fabrication of one of the structural layers of the shell. Patterned expression of a subset of genes along the length of the mantle is indicative of roles in shell ornamentation. For example.

The choice of evolutionary models seems to be at the core of the problem because Porifera tends to emerge as the sister group of all other animals (“Porifera-sister”) when site-specific amino acid differences are modeled (e.g..

These ancient animals inherited components of the first multicellular skeletogenic toolkit from the last common ancestor of the Metazoa. Using a paleogenomics approach. including gene- and protein-expression techniques and phylogenetic reconstruction. we show that a molecular component of this toolkit was the precursor to the α-carbonic anhydrases (α-CAs). a gene family used by extant animals in a variety of fundamental physiological processes. We used the coralline demosponge Astrosclera willeyana. a “living fossil” that has survived from the Mesozoic. to provide insight into the evolution of the ability to biocalcify. and show that the α-CA family expanded from a single ancestral gene through several independent gene-duplication events in sponges and eumetazoans.,True,UETwl3gAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,127,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/316/5833/1893.abstract,16362310711603889533,/scholar?cites=16362310711603889533,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel_Jackson5/publication/6295192_Sponge_Paleogenomics_Reveals_an_Ancient_Role_for_Carbonic_Anhydrase_in_Skeletogenesis/links/0deec51e10fdb567d0000000.pdf,0,0,0

In the Middle Devonian the first modern forms of Dendroceratida. ‘axinellids’ (mostly halichondrids). and first haplosclerids appeared. An important boundary for the demosponges is the Late Devonian extinction event. which caused a complete overhaul of demosponge communities. The Late Permian and the Triassic. especially the Late Triassic. are the main eras for coralline demosponge radiation and dominance. in which some modern taxa occur for the first time (Ceratoporella.

However. it has long been recognized that language evolution also entails horizontal components. most commonly through lexical borrowing. For example. the English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse and Old French; eight per cent of its basic vocabulary is borrowed. Borrowing is a distinctly non-tree-like process—akin to horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution—that cannot be recovered by phylogenetic trees. Here. we infer the frequency of hidden borrowing among 2346 cognates (etymologically related words) of basic vocabulary distributed across 84 Indo-European languages.

Traditional manual methods in historical linguistics need to face the challenges brought by this influx of data. Automatic approaches to word comparison could provide invaluable help to pre-analyze data which can be later enhanced by experts. In this way. computational approaches can take care of the repetitive and schematic tasks leaving experts to concentrate on answering interesting questions. Here we test the potential of automatic methods to detect etymologically related words (cognates) in cross-linguistic data. Using a newly compiled database of expert cognate judgments across five different language families. we compare how well different automatic approaches distinguish related from unrelated words. Our results show that automatic methods can identify cognates with a very high degree of accuracy. reaching 89% for the best-performing method Infomap. We identify the specific strengths and weaknesses of these different methods and point to major challenges for future approaches.

Recently developed methods work well on language families with moderate time depths. but they are not capable of identifying cognate morphemes in words which are only partially related. Partial cognacy. however. is a frequently recurring phenomenon. especially in language families with productive derivational morphology. This paper presents a pilot approach for partial cognate detection in which networks are used to represent similarities between word parts and cognate morphemes are identified with help of state-of-theart algorithms for network partitioning.

As noted by Darwin. there are many parallels between language evolution and biological evolution. Insights into these parallels have also undergone change in the past 150 years. Just like genes. words change over time. and language evolution can be likened to genome evolution accordingly. but what kind of evolution? There are fundamental differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic evolution. In the former. natural variation entails the gradual accumulation of minor mutations in alleles. In the latter. lateral gene transfer is an integral mechanism of natural variation.

Most of the proposed analogies have been rejected. Some. however. have persisted. and some even turned out to be fruitful. inspiring the transfer of methods and models between biology and linguistics up to today. Most proposed analogies were based on a comparison of the research objects rather than the processes that shaped their evolution. Focusing on process-based analogies. however. has the advantage of minimizing the risk of overstating similarities. while at the same time reflecting the common strategy to use processes to explain the evolution of complexity in both fields. We compared important evolutionary processes in biology and linguistics and identified processes specific to only one of the two disciplines as well as processes which seem to be analogous. potentially reflecting core evolutionary processes. These new process-based analogies support novel methodological transfer. expanding the application range of biological methods to the field of historical linguistics. We illustrate this by showing (i) how methods dealing with incomplete lineage sorting offer an introgression-free framework to analyze highly mosaic word distributions across languages; (ii) how sequence similarity networks can be used to identify composite and borrowed words across different languages; (iii) how research on partial homology can inspire new methods and models in both fields; and (iv) how constructive neutral evolution provides an original framework for analyzing convergent evolution in languages resulting from …,True,-Nf88ioAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,39,https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-016-0145-2,554374154145369183,/scholar?cites=554374154145369183,,https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-016-0145-2,0,0,0
1145704,Beyond cognacy: Historical relations between words and their implication for phylogenetic reconstruction,2016,Johann-Mattis List,1,Journal of Language Evolution,2,119-136,Oxford University Press,This article investigates the terminology and the processes underlying the fundamental historical relations between words in linguistics (cognacy) and genes in biology (homology). The comparison between linguistics and biology shows that there are major inconsistencies in the analogies drawn between the two research fields and the models applied in phylogenetic reconstruction in linguistics. Cognacy between words is treated as a binary relation which is either present or not. Words. however. can exhibit different degrees of cognacy which go beyond the distinction between orthologous and paralogous genes in biology. The complex nature of cognacy has strong implications for the models used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Instead of modeling lexical evolution as a process of cognate gain and cognate loss. we need to go beyond the cognate relation and develop models which take the degrees of …,True,-Nf88ioAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC,38,https://academic.oup.com/jole/article-abstract/1/2/119/2281902,16167519923061664686,/scholar?cites=16167519923061664686,,https://academic.oup.com/jole/article/1/2/119/2281902,0,0,0

1145706,Do languages grow on trees? The tree metaphor in the history of linguistics,2013,Hans Geisler and Johann-Mattis List,,,,111–124,Steiner,Among biologist as well as linguists. it is now widely accepted that there are many striking parallels between the evolution of life forms and the history of languages. Starting from the rise of language studies as a scientific discipline in the early 19th century up to today’s recent “quantitative turn” in historical linguistics. scholars from both disciplines have repeatedly pointed to similarities between the respective research objects in biology and linguistics. Of all these parallels. the use of family trees to model the differentiation of species (genomes and languages) is surely the most striking one. Methodically speaking. genealogical relations between languages and species can both be visualized with help of bifurcating trees which indicate the splitting of ancestral into descendant taxa. Being developed independently in linguistics and biology (Hoenigswald 1963). the tree model suffered different fates in both disciplines: While the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees successively became one of the key objectives in evolutionary biology. the tree model was controversially disputed in linguistics and–although to no time completely abandoned–never became a true part of the consensus. Although linguists always had certain reservations regarding the tree model. it recently experienced a surprising revival. While earlier linguistic work on phylogenetic reconstruction was almost exclusively based on the intuitive weighting of features from very small samples of well-studied ancient languages. the integration of stochastic methods originally designed for biological applications made it possible to analyze large quantitative datasets automatically (Gray and …,True,-Nf88ioAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,36,https://www.uni-ulm.de/fileadmin/website_uni_ulm/med.inst.085/PDF_Kulturanamnesen/Band_5/KulturAnamnese_Band_5.pdf#page=113,14690400432679914531,/scholar?cites=14690400432679914531,,https://www.uni-ulm.de/fileadmin/website_uni_ulm/med.inst.085/PDF_Kulturanamnesen/Band_5/KulturAnamnese_Band_5.pdf#page=113,0,0,0

Cognate identification is so far done manually by experts. which is time consuming and as of yet only available for a small number of well-studied language families. Automatizing this step will greatly expand the empirical scope of phylogenetic methods in linguistics. as raw wordlists (in phonetic transcription) are much easier to obtain than wordlists in which cognate words have been fully identified and annotated. even for under-studied languages. A couple of different methods have been proposed in the past. but they are either disappointing regarding their performance or not applicable to larger datasets. Here we present a new approach that uses support vector machines to unify different state-of-the-art methods for phonetic alignment and cognate detection within a single framework.

Our findings suggest that phylogenies inferred from automated cognate sets come close to phylogenies inferred from expert-annotated ones. although on average. the latter are still superior. We conclude that future work on phylogenetic reconstruction can profit much from automatic cognate detection.

Some of these issues are conceptual and stem from our assumptions of how a gene evolves. others are practical. and depend on the algorithmic decisions implemented in existing software. Therefore. to make progress in the study of homology. both ontological and epistemological questions must be considered. In particular. defining homologous genes cannot be solely addressed under the classic assumptions of strong tree thinking. according to which genes evolve in a strictly tree-like fashion of vertical descent and divergence and the problems of homology detection are primarily methodological. Gene homology could also be considered under a different perspective where genes evolve as “public goods.” subjected to various introgressive processes.

It can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins. Fused genes have been identified as non-transitive patterns of similarity in triplets of genes. To be computationally tractable. this approach usually imposes an a priori distinction between a dataset in which fused genes are searched for. and a dataset that may have provided genetic material for fusion. This reduces the ‘genetic space’ in which fusion can be discovered. as only a subset of triplets of genes is investigated. Moreover. this approach may have a high–false-positive rate. and it does not identify gene families descending from a common fusion event. Results: We represent similarities between sequences as a network.

Despite these challenges. the creation of composite (or mosaic) genes by combination of genetic segments from unrelated gene families was established as an important adaptive phenomena in eukaryotic genomes. In contrast. almost no general studies have been conducted to quantify composite genes in viruses. Although viral genome mosaicism has been well-described. the extent of gene mosaicism and its rules of emergence remain largely unexplored. Applying methods from graph theory to inclusive similarity networks. and using data from more than 3.000 complete viral genomes. we provide the first demonstration that composite genes in viruses are 1) functionally biased. 2) involved in key aspects of the arm race between cells and viruses. and 3) can be classified …,True,vLBrYkIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,30,https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article-abstract/6/9/2195/2465927,2280994411610233449,/scholar?cites=2280994411610233449,,https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/6/9/2195/2465927,0,0,0

We used a mock community consisting of equal number of cells of 11 haptophyte species and compared targeting DNA and RNA/cDNA. and two different V4 SSU rDNA haptophyte-biased primer pairs. Further. we tested four different bioinformatic filtering methods to reduce errors in the resulting sequence dataset.

We argue that there are two conditions for significant progress in the identification and quantification of biodiversity. First. integrative metagenomic studies - aiming at the simultaneous examination (or even better at the integration) of observations about the elements. functions and evolutionary processes captured by the massive sequencing of multiple markers - should be preferred over DNA barcoding projects and over metagenomic projects based on a single marker. Second. such metagenomic data should be studied with novel inclusive network-based approaches. designed to draw inferences both on the many units and on the many processes present in the environments. We reached these conclusions through a comparison of the theoretical foundations of two molecular approaches seeking to assess biodiversity: metagenomics (mostly used on prokaryotes and protists) and DNA barcoding (mostly used on multicellular eukaryotes). and by pragmatic considerations of the issues caused by the 'species problem' in biodiversity studies.

For this purpose 9 large-scale in situ mesocosms were deployed in Kongsfjorden. Svalbard (78°56.2´ N. 11°53.6´ E). in 2010. The present study investigates effects on the communities of particle-attached (PA; >3 μm) and free-living (FL; < 3 μm > 0.2 μm) bacteria by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA) in 6 of the mesocosms. ranging from 185 to 1050 μatm initial pCO2. and the surrounding fjord. ARISA was able to resolve. on average. 27 bacterial band classes per sample and allowed for a detailed investigation of the explicit richness and diversity. Both. the PA and the FL bacterioplankton community exhibited a strong temporal development. which was driven mainly by temperature and phytoplankton development. In response to the breakdown of a picophytoplankton bloom. numbers of ARISA band classes in the PA community were reduced at low and medium CO2 (~ 185–685 μatm) by about 25%. while they were more or less stable at high CO2 (~ 820–1050 μatm). We hypothesise that enhanced viral lysis and enhanced availability of organic substrates at high CO2 resulted in a more diverse PA bacterial community in the post-bloom phase. Despite lower cell numbers and extracellular enzyme activities in the post-bloom phase. bacterial protein production was enhanced in high CO2 mesocosms. suggesting a positive effect of community richness on this function and on carbon cycling by bacteria.,True,bQCui0kAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,32,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/181/2013/,8424857250592054228,/scholar?cites=8424857250592054228,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/10/181/2013/bg-10-181-2013.pdf,0,0,0

One class of such properties is histone post-translational modifications (PTMs). Many histone PTMs are linked to the same diverse nuclear functions implicated in cancer development. including transcriptional activation and epigenetic regulation. which are often indirectly assayed with standard genomic technologies. Thus. there is a need for a comprehensive and quantitative profiling of cancer lines focused on their chromatin modification states. To complement genomic expression profiles of cancer lines. we report the proteomic classification of 24 different lines. the majority of which are cancer cells. by quantifying the abundances of a large panel of single and combinatorial histone H3 and H4 PTMs. and histone variants. Concurrent to the proteomic analysis. we performed transcriptomic analysis on histone modifying enzyme abundances as a proxy for quantifying their activity levels. While the transcriptomic and proteomic results were generally consistent in terms of predicting histone PTM abundance from enzyme abundances. several PTMs were regulated independently of the modifying enzyme expression.

Here. we demonstrate that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition preferentially abrogates the viability of multiple myeloma cell lines. Selective targeting of multiple myeloma cell lines through CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition is the result of direct transcriptional suppression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor IRF4. which is essential for the viability of myeloma cells. and the concomitant repression of the IRF4 target gene c-MYC. Ectopic expression of either IRF4 or MYC antagonizes the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition. highlighting the IRF4/MYC axis as a key component of its mechanism of action. These findings suggest that CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for targeting multiple myeloma and other lymphoid malignancies dependent on the IRF4 network.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10483.001,True,wYnEj_AAAAAJ:pUxgyZctzPYC,72,https://elifesciences.org/articles/10483,4247214938399584209,/scholar?cites=4247214938399584209,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/10483.pdf,0,0,0

However. analysis of ChIP-seq data is challenging when the manipulation of a chromatin-modifying enzyme significantly affects global levels of histone post-translational modifications. For example. small molecule inhibition of the methyltransferase EZH2 reduces global levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). However. standard ChIP-seq normalization and analysis methods fail to detect a decrease upon EZH2 inhibitor treatment. We overcome this challenge by employing an alternative normalization approach that is based on the addition of Drosophila melanogaster chromatin and a D. melanogaster-specific antibody into standard ChIP reactions. Specifically. the use of an antibody that exclusively recognizes the D. melanogaster histone variant H2Av enables precipitation of D. melanogaster chromatin as a minor fraction of the total ChIP DNA. The D. melanogaster ChIP-seq tags are used to normalize the human ChIP-seq data from DMSO and EZH2 inhibitor-treated samples.

I examined how a single application of five insecticides (malathion. carbaryl. chlorpyrifos. diazinon. and endosulfan) and five herbicides (glyphosate. atrazine. acetochlor. metolachlor. and 2.4-D) at low concentrations (2–16 p.p.b.) affected aquatic communities composed of zooplankton. phytoplankton. periphyton. and larval amphibians (gray tree frogs.

Decades of empirical investigations have documented hundreds of examples of phenotypic plasticity. yet most studies have focused on the presence or absence of a single environmental factor. As a result. we know little about how organisms respond to gradients of environmental factors (i.e.. threshold responses vs. continuous responses). nor do we understand how organisms respond to combinations of environmental variables. I examined how larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) altered their behavior. morphology. and growth in response to combined gradients of predation and competition. Increased predation risk induced lower activity. deeper tails. and shorter bodies. which collectively caused slower growth.

1145776,Predator cues and pesticides: a double dose of danger for amphibians,2003,Rick A Relyea,13,Ecological Applications,6,1515-1521,Ecological Society of America,Amphibians are declining globally. and biologists have struggled to identify the causes. Pesticides may play a role in these declines. but pesticide concentrations in nature often are low and considered sublethal. Past research has found that the globally common pesticide carbaryl can become more lethal under different environmental conditions including differences in temperature and competition. A recent study has found that predatory stress. a situation common for most amphibians. can make carbaryl 2–4 times more deadly to gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor). To determine whether this is a general phenomenon in amphibians. I examined how carbaryl affected the survival of six amphibian species in the presence and absence of predatory stress. Higher concentrations of carbaryl caused higher mortality.

However. studies of amphibian population declines generally do not address the complexity of the phenomenon or its implications for ecological communities. focusing instead on single factors affecting particular amphibian species. We argue that the causes for amphibian population declines are complex; may differ among species. populations. and life stages within a population; and are context dependent with multiple stressors interacting to drive declines. Because amphibians are key components of communities. we emphasize the importance of investigating amphibian declines at the community level.

However. for most pesticides. tests on amphibians are rare and conducted only for short durations (1 to 4 days) and without natural stressors.

Because no organism is infinitely or ideally plastic. theory suggests that there must be limits (for example. the lack of ability to produce an optimal trait) to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. or that plasticity may have inherent significant costs. Yet numerous experimental studies have not detected widespread costs. Explicitly differentiating plasticity costs from phenotype costs. we re-evaluate fundamental questions of the limits to the evolution of plasticity and of generalists vs specialists. We advocate for the view that relaxed selection and variable selection intensities are likely more important constraints to the evolution of plasticity than the costs of plasticity.

Therefore. we need to move to the next step and understand how organisms respond to combinations of environmental changes. Recent studies of predator‐induced plasticity have addressed how prey respond to different combinations of predators. I briefly review 22 studies of combined predator effects on prey phenotypes and identify four factors that make it difficult to interpret the results of these studies: (1) uncontrolled prey consumption.

For aquatic prey. defences are induced by chemical cues from predators (kairomones) and injured prey (alarm cues). Rarely has anyone determined the separate and combined effects of these cues. particularly across phylogenetically diverse prey types. We examined how tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) altered their defences when 10 different prey were either crushed by hand or consumed by predators. Across all prey types. crushing induced only a subset of the defences induced by consumption. Consuming vs. crushing produced additive responses for behaviour but synergistic responses for morphology and growth. Moreover. we discovered the first extensive evidence that prey responses to different alarm cues depends on prey phylogeny.

1145783,Selection for phenotypic plasticity in Rana sylvatica tadpoles,1998,Josh Buskirk and Rick A Relyea,65,Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,3,301-328,Oxford University Press,The hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity is an adaptation to environmental variation rests on the two assumptions that plasticity improves the performance of individuals that possess it. and that it evolved in response to selection imposed in heterogeneous environments. The first assumption has been upheld by studies showing the beneficial nature of plasticity. The second assumption is difficult to test since it requires knowing about selection acting in the past. However. it can be tested in its general form by asking whether natural selection currently acts to maintain phenotypic plasticity. We adopted this approach in a study of plastic morphological traits in larvae of the wood frog. Rana sybatica. First we reared tadpoles in artificial ponds for 18 days. in either the presence or absence of Anax dragonfly larvae (confined within cages to prevent them from killing the tadpoles).

Hydrologic alterations and biological invasions represent two of the greatest threats to freshwater biota. yet the importance of linkages between these drivers of environmental change remains uncertain.

However. the role that infectious disease plays within ecological communities is complex. The complex effects of infectious disease at the scale of communities and ecosystems are driven by the interaction between host and pathogen. Whether or not a given host–pathogen interaction results in progression from infection to disease is largely dependent on the physiological characteristics of the host within the context of the external environment. Here. we highlight the importance of understanding the outcome of infection and disease in the context of host ecophysiology using amphibians as a model system.

Concepts developed in parasite–host ecology. such as threshold host densities and phylodynamics. might provide new ideas for predator–prey ecology. Topics such as trait-mediated indirect effects and enemy-mediated facilitation provide opportunities for the two fields to work together.

Rana aurora. to examine responses of allotopic and syntopic tadpoles to the bullfrog. Rana catesbeiana. an introduced predator of R. aurora. We also assessed predation rates by R. catesbeiana on syntopic and allotopic populations of R. aurora. Syntopic R. aurora tadpoles significantly reduced their activity and increased their refuge use when presented with the chemical cues of both tadpoles and adult R. catesbeiana. In contrast. allotopic tadpoles did not significantly alter their behavior in the presence of either R. catesbeiana adults or larvae. Predation by R. catesbeiana was lower in syntopic than in allotopic populations of R. aurora tadpoles. Our results show differential responses of syntopic and allotopic R. aurora tadpoles to larval and adult R. catesbeiana.

Effects on breeding activities could eventually lead to significant changes in population structure that may be reflected in population declines of species that are especially sensitive. such as some amphibians. Thus. climate changes may have affected the timing of breeding in some European amphibian species. To further test whether amphibian reproductive cycles in temperate countries are responding to climate changes. we conducted an analysis of the breeding phenology of four species of North American anurans for which we have long‐term data sets.

However. studies of amphibian population declines generally do not address the complexity of the phenomenon or its implications for ecological communities. focusing instead on single factors affecting particular amphibian species. We argue that the causes for amphibian population declines are complex; may differ among species. populations. and life stages within a population; and are context dependent with multiple stressors interacting to drive declines. Because amphibians are key components of communities. we emphasize the importance of investigating amphibian declines at the community level.

This includes many populations and species of amphibians. Although numerous factors are affecting amphibian populations. we show potential direct and indirect effects of climate change on amphibians at the individual. population and community level. Shifts in amphibian ranges are predicted. Changes in climate may affect survival. growth. reproduction and dispersal capabilities. Moreover. climate change can alter amphibian habitats including vegetation. soil. and hydrology. Climate change can influence food availability. predator-prey relationships and competitive interactions which can alter community structure. Climate change can also alter pathogen-host dynamics and greatly influence how diseases are manifested. Changes in climate can interact with other stressors such as UV-B radiation and contaminants.

In such cases z values should lie within the range 0.15-0.39. As often noted. the species-area relation is an empirical description.

While research has largely focused on terrestrial systems. the low soil binding and high water solubility of neonicotinoids. paired with their extensive use on the landscape. puts aquatic environments at high risk for contamination via runoff events. We assessed the potential threat of these compounds to wetland communities using a combination of field surveys and experimental exposures including concentrations that are representative of what invertebrates experience in the field. In laboratory toxicity experiments. LC50 values ranged from 0.002 ppm to 1.2 ppm for aquatic invertebrates exposed to clothianidin. However. freshwater snails and amphibian larvae showed high tolerance to the chemical with no mortality observed at the highest dissolvable concentration of the insecticide. We also observed behavioral effects of clothianidin. Water bugs. Belostoma flumineum. displayed a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate following exposure to clothianidin. Similarly. crayfish. Orconectes propinquus. exhibited reduced responsiveness to stimulus with increasing clothianidin concentration. Using a semi-natural mesocosm experiment. we manipulated clothianidin concentration (0.6. 5. and 352 ppb) and the presence of predatory invertebrates to explore community-level effects.

In particular. the salinization of amphibian habitats is a global issue that has received relatively little attention. Of the recent studies that have emerged. the majority focus on single-species responses. and because these studies often vary in methodology. assessing tolerances across species can be challenging.

The fungal pathogen. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been detected in almost 700 different amphibian species and is implicated in numerous global amphibian population declines. Identifying key hosts in the amphibian-Bd system–those who are at greatest risk or who pose the greatest risk for others–is challenging due in part to many extrinsic environmental factors driving spatiotemporal Bd distribution and context-dependent host responses to Bd in the wild. One way to improve predictive risk models and generate testable mechanistic hypotheses about vulnerability is to complement what we know about the spatial epidemiology of Bd with data collected through comparative experimental studies. We used standardized pathogen challenges to quantify amphibian survival and infection trajectories across 20 post-metamorphic North American species raised from eggs. We then incorporated trait-based models to investigate the predictive power of phylogenetic history. habitat use. and ecological and life history traits in explaining responses to Bd. True frogs (Ranidae) displayed the lowest infection intensities. whereas toads (Bufonidae) generally displayed the greatest levels of mortality after Bd exposure.

While there are likely several factors at play. human-mediated environmental alterations may play a significant role. Of growing interest is the effect that microcystin-LR (MC-LR). a cyanotoxin. may have on disease outcomes.

1145895,The effect of a common pyrethroid insecticide on wetland communities,2019,Jessica Hua and Rick Relyea,1,Environmental Research Communications,1,015003,IOP Publishing,Within the past decade. the use of pyrethroid insecticides has drastically increased. While they are known to be directly toxic to aquatic organisms. based primarily on lab experiments. they are not expected to commonly contaminate aquatic ecosystems given their high binding affinities to organic material. However. increasing evidence suggest that pyrethroids do enter aquatic ecosystems via direct application. drift. and run-off. Despite the risks of these highly toxic chemicals. the full suite of direct and indirect effects of pyrethroid insecticides in wetland communities are not well understood. To address this gap. we examined the direct and indirect consequences of a common pyrethroid. permethrin. in complex aquatic mesocosms consisting of three trophic levels and 13 animal species.

While research has largely focused on terrestrial systems. the low soil binding and high water solubility of neonicotinoids. paired with their extensive use on the landscape. puts aquatic environments at high risk for contamination via runoff events. We assessed the potential threat of these compounds to wetland communities using a combination of field surveys and experimental exposures including concentrations that are representative of what invertebrates experience in the field. In laboratory toxicity experiments. LC50 values ranged from 0.002 ppm to 1.2 ppm for aquatic invertebrates exposed to clothianidin. However. freshwater snails and amphibian larvae showed high tolerance to the chemical with no mortality observed at the highest dissolvable concentration of the insecticide. We also observed behavioral effects of clothianidin. Water bugs. Belostoma flumineum. displayed a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate following exposure to clothianidin. Similarly. crayfish. Orconectes propinquus. exhibited reduced responsiveness to stimulus with increasing clothianidin concentration. Using a semi-natural mesocosm experiment. we manipulated clothianidin concentration (0.6. 5. and 352 ppb) and the presence of predatory invertebrates to explore community-level effects. We observed high invertebrate predator mortality with increases in clothianidin concentration.

1145935,Ecological consequences of parasitism,2010,D Preston and P Johnson,,Nature,,,,The ecological interactions of parasites (defined here to include both macroparasites and microparasites) are often challenging to observe. Many live their lives secretively. in intimate contact with their host. but invisible to the outside world. With some notable exceptions (eg. tapeworms). parasites also tend to be very small. It may be easy to assume then. that since parasites are generally inconspicuous. they play less important roles in community ecology than free-living organisms. Yet advances in the field of disease ecology have revealed that parasites are not only ecologically important. but can sometimes exert influences that equal or surpass those of free-living species in shaping community structure. In fact parasitism is more common than traditional predation as a consumer lifestyle (De Meeûs & Renaud 2002). and arguably represents the most widespread life-history strategy in nature (Price 1980). Parasites also influence host behavior and fitness. and can regulate host population sizes. sometimes with profound effects on trophic interactions. food webs. competition. biodiversity and keystone species.

Occupancy models have emerged as a popular approach for inferring species occurrence because they account for problems associated with imperfect detection in field surveys.

Here. we combined structural equation and occupancy models to investigate complex influences on species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection.

In parallel with predation. parasite infection – and even the threat of infection – can alter host traits and indirectly affect community interactions. Nonetheless. few studies have considered multiple mechanisms of natural enemy‐induced behavioural alteration in parallel (e.g. effects before and after enemy contact) or the factors that drive variation in behavioural responses. We first evaluated how the threat of infection by a virulent trematode (Ribeiroia ondatrae) compared to the well studied risk of predation in triggering inducible defences in amphibian hosts. prior to direct contact with either enemy.

Increased prevalence. infection intensity. and spread of human schistosomiasis to non-endemic areas has been consistently linked with water resource management related to agricultural expansion. such as dam construction. which has resulted in increased snail habitat1.4–6. However. the role of agrochemical pollution in human schistosome transmission remains unexplored. despite strong evidence of agrochemicals increasing snail-borne diseases of wildlife7–9 and a projected 2- to 5-fold increase in global agrochemical use by 205010 that will disproportionately occur in schistosome-endemic regions. Using a field mesocosm experiment. we show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fertilizer. the common herbicide atrazine. and the common insecticide chlorpyrifos. individually and as mixtures. increase densities of schistosome-infected snails by increasing the algae snails eat (fertilizer and atrazine) and decreasing densities of snail predators (chlorpyrifos). Epidemiological models indicate that these agrochemical effects can increase transmission of schistosomiasis. Hence. the rapid agricultural changes occurring in schistosome-endemic regions11.12 that are driving increased agrochemical use and pollution could potentially increase the burden of schistosomiasis in these areas.

1145971,Agrochemicals increase risk of human schistosomiasis,2011,N Halstead and Steve A Johnson and Taegan A McMahon and JR Rohr,,,,,,Schistosomiasis (bilharzia). a disease caused by trematode helminths. is considered to be the second most economically debilitating disease in developing tropical and subtropical countries by the World Health Organization. Many people in schistosomiasis-endemic countries are stricken by poverty and malnourishment that also affects their health. To reduce poverty and improve human health. these countries are expected to enhance their agriculture. an approach supported by the Millenium Development Goals. This will almost certainly entail an increase in the use of agrochemicals. such as fertilizer and pesticides. However. agrochemical pollution has been associated with increased trematode burdens in amphibians by indirectly increasing populations of intermediate hosts (snails). We hypothesized that agrochemicals would have a similar effect on the risk of schistosomiasis. We used freshwater mesocosms to determine the community-level effects of atrazine (herbicide). chlorpyrifos (insecticide). and fertilizer additions. alone and in all combinations. on wetland communities including the intermediate hosts for two schistosome species.

Evidence suggests that agrochemical pollution could increase snails that transmit the disease schistosomiasis to 250 million people. but most agrochemicals remain unexamined. Here we quantify the relative effects of fertilizer. six insecticides. and six herbicides on snail genera responsible for 90% of global schistosomiasis cases. We identified fertilizers and 4 of 6 insecticides as high risk for increasing snail biomass by increasing snail resources (vegetative habitat and periphytic food) and reducing snail predators. respectively. Herbicides generally had negative effects on snails by reducing vegetative habitat. with two herbicides increasing snails in the absence of aquatic vegetation. Parasite production. which reflects human infection risk. scaled positively to snail biomass. Our findings suggest that fertilizers and insecticides are more likely to increase human schistosomiasis than herbicides and revealed several low risk agrochemicals that might increase crop production without increasing schistosomiasis.,True,JMFZCz0AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.05.425422v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/06/2021.01.05.425422.full.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,The molecular complexity of imazaquin and presence of ionizable functional groups limits the ability to predict sorption behavior from single soil parameters such as organic carbon content. Partition coefficients (Kp) for both neutral and anionic forms of imazaquin as well as the effects of solution ionic strength and composition were investigated to more adequately describe sorption of imazaquin in soil. Soils representing a range of characteristics were evaluated. including soils with permanent negative or variable surface charge. Imazaquin retention resulted from combined sorption for the neutral (Kocn. 1.110 ± 80 L/kg) and anionic (Koc.a. 38 ± 20 L/kg) forms. Imazaquin sorption was best correlated to soil organic carbon content and soil‐solution pH.

In addition. parasites might affect food‐web stability. interaction strength and energy flow. Food‐web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live.

When used by parasites and pathogens. these strategies may influence patterns of disease in changing climates. The chytrid fungus. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. is linked to global declines of amphibian populations. Short‐term growth in culture is maximal at 17°–25°C. This has been used in an argument that global warming. which increases the time that amphibians spend at these temperatures in cloud‐covered montane environments. has led to extinctions. Here we show that the amphibian chytrid responds to decreasing temperatures with trade‐offs that increase fecundity as maturation rate slows and increase infectivity as growth decreases.

Dispersal on its own is not stabilizing and can destabilize a stable local equilibrium. We identify three mechanisms whereby limited dispersal of hosts and parasitoids combined with other features. such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity. can promote increased persistence and stability. The first mechanism. “statistical stabilization”. is simply the statistical effect that summing a number of out-of-phase population trajectories results in a relatively constant total population density. The second mechanism involves decoupling of immigration from local density. such that limited dispersal between asynchronous patches results in an effect that mimics density-dependence at the local patch level. The third mechanism involves altering spatially averaged parameter values resulting from spatial heterogeneity in density combined with non-linear …,True,q0xdxtsAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,263,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004058090400005X,13599366346472906023,/scholar?cites=13599366346472906023,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.5438&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Heightened condition dependency of sexually selected traits is a prerequisite of this model. Condition dependency is empirically inferred by the sensitivity of traits to stressors. The magnitude of ecological stress (e.g.. competition and predation) experienced by populations varies considerably. Thus. condition dependence should manifest more in populations experiencing higher levels of stress. We experimentally assessed the sensitivity of a sexually selected trait (posterior gnathopod) to food resource stress in an amphipod species. We found that gnathopod size variation was 59% higher under food stress. with no corresponding effect on nonsexually selected traits. In addition. we assessed levels of gnathopod variation and the allometry of gnathopods for males sampled from natural populations for two amphipod species that experience …,True,yD6ZdkoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,44,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00998.x,13030597665063626789,/scholar?cites=13030597665063626789,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00998.x,0,0,0

Life‐history variation often results from trade‐offs that arise because individuals have a limited pool of resources to allocate among traits. However. human activities are increasing the availability of many once‐limited resources. such as nitrogen and phosphorus. with potentially major implications for the expression and evolution of life‐history trade‐offs. In this review. we synthesize contemporary life history and sexual selection literature with current research on ecosystem nutrient cycling to highlight novel opportunities presented by anthropogenic environmental change for investigating life‐history trait development and evolution.

This observation is especially perplexing when the co‐occurring species are cryptic (i.e. only distinguishable via molecular markers). because phenotypic similarity is expected to correspond with strong niche overlap. One way that phenotypically similar species can coexist is if fine‐scale phenotypic differences affect how species interact with other members of the community that ultimately results in performance tradeoffs. An alternative explanation for co‐occurrence is that phenotypic similarity leads to ecological equivalence allowing species to co‐occur for long periods. We tested whether three phenotypically similar amphipod species that co‐occur exhibit performance tradeoffs that may allow them to stably coexist in lakes.

In this study. I assessed the fitness consequences of female mate choice in a freshwater crustacean. In Hyalella amphipods. males attempt to form precopulatory pairs with females. Large males. bearing large posterior gnathopods. tend to be over‐represented in precopulatory pairs. I show that females receive both direct (reduced risk of predation while paired) and indirect (sexy sons) benefits from mating with these males. Furthermore. the behavioral mechanisms used to filter male phenotypes carry no detectable energetic cost for females.

I manipulated female resistance to examine its effects on pairing dynamics in two ecologically different freshwater amphipods. I found evidence for female behavior playing a role in both the outcome of pre-pairing interactions and the initiation of pairing in both species. In these species. the male optimum pairing duration is greater than the value preferred by females or compromised pairing durations observed under natural conditions. thus indicating sexual conflict. Furthermore. the proportion of male–female encounters producing male grasping was greater and the duration of such interactions was longer when female resistance was reduced.

Other environmental parameters (e.g.. predation) should also affect sexual trait expression by favoring investment in viability traits rather than sexual traits. We know surprisingly little about how predators alter investment in sexual traits. or how predator and resource environments interact to affect sexual trait investment.

Thus. the expression of body size within a population is often the result of the interaction between natural selection and sexual selection. Here. I examine the mechanistic basis for a large male mating advantage in two freshwater amphipod species that differ ecologically. Traditionally. size‐biased mating patterns in amphipods have been attributed to the advantage of large size in male–male competition for females. In this study. when direct male–male interactions were eliminated (via tethering). large males had a mating advantage similar to that observed under control conditions (males free to interact) and in previous field and laboratory studies.

While both mechanisms can allow organisms to persist in contaminated environments. they might result in different performance trade‐offs including population susceptibility to parasites.

Ltd,Urea nitrate (UN) and ammonium nitrate (AN) are fertilizer‐based explosives that are commonly used in improvised munitions and can have highly destructive effects. Because they are in the form of salts. their relatively low volatility makes them difficult to detect at trace levels. In addition. these salts readily undergo metathetic reactions in water to form urea. ammonium and nitrate. which are ubiquitous in the environment. Thus. selective methods are needed for their detection. In this study. a procedure was developed to detect UN and AN in non‐aqueous environments by positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry through the addition of 18‐crown‐6. The method is sensitive. with detection limits under 2 μM. and selective. The procedure is capable of differentiating urea from uronium ions (protonated urea) and a mixture of urea and AN did not interfere with the UN signal.

We explored if alternate reductants could overcome this limitation with a primary focus on nanoscale zerovalent zinc (nZn0).

Only branched (br-) isomers were transformed generating F– (no SO42–) and polyfluoroalkyl intermediates/products. The absence of L-PFOS transformation by VB12 appears to be due to the inability of L-perfluoroalkyl sulfonates to complex with VB12 and not an activation energy issue that can be overcome by stronger reductants/catalysts.

Recent modeling work suggests that the oxidation of polyolefinic γ-terpinene can be the dominant source of nighttime ON in a mixed forest environment. However. the ON yields. aerosol partitioning behavior. and SOA yields from γ-terpinene oxidation by the nitrate radical (NO3). an important nighttime oxidant. have not been determined experimentally. In this work. we present a comprehensive experimental investigation of the total (gas + particle) ON. hydroxy nitrate. and SOA yields following γ-terpinene oxidation by NO3. Under dry conditions. the hydroxy nitrate yield  =  4(+1/−3) %. total ON yield  =  14(+3/−2) %. and SOA yield  ≤  10 % under atmospherically relevant particle mass loadings. similar to those for α-pinene + NO3. Using a chemical box model. we show that the measured concentrations of NO2 and γ-terpinene hydroxy nitrates can be reliably simulated from α-pinene + NO3 chemistry. This suggests that NO3 addition to either of the two internal double bonds of γ-terpinene primarily decomposes forming a relatively volatile keto-aldehyde. reconciling the small SOA yield observed here and for other internal olefinic terpenes. Based on aerosol partitioning analysis and identification of speciated particle-phase ON applying high-resolution liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. we estimate that a significant fraction of the particle-phase ON has the hydroxy nitrate moiety.

Determining whether these factors influence toxicity is critical for understanding the effects of PFAS on aquatic life. including amphibians. Our goal was to assess the impact of PFAS on an amphibian under semirealistic conditions.

We examined effects of dermal PFAS exposure (30 d) on survival and growth of juvenile American toads (Anaxyrus americanus). eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) and northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). Exposures included perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) and 6: 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6: 2 FTS) at 0. 80. 800. or 8000 ppb on a moss dry weight basis. Exposure to PFAS influenced final snout-vent length (SVL) and scaled mass index (SMI). a measure of relative body condition. Observed effects depended on species and chemical. but not concentration. Anurans exposed to PFOS. PFHxS (frogs only). and 6: 2 FTS reduced SVL versus controls. while salamanders exposed to 6: 2 FTS increased SVL. Frogs exposed to PFHxS and 6: 2 FTS. and toads exposed to PFOS had increased SMI compared to controls. salamanders did not demonstrate effects. Concentrations of 6: 2 FTS in substrate decreased substantially by 30 d. likely driven by microbial action. PFOS had notable biota-sediment accumulation factors. but still< 1. While a no-observable-effect concentration could not generally be determined. the lowest observable effect concentration was 50-120 ppb. Survival was not affected.

Inc.,The widespread use of pesticides raises the possibility that non‐target organisms might also be affected. To assess this. the traditional approach has been to conduct short‐term laboratory experiments spanning a range of lethal concentrations and some longer‐duration experiments at sublethal concentrations.

We investigated if evolutionary responses to salinization exhibit life-history trade-offs or if they can mitigate ecological impacts such as cascading effects through mechanisms of tolerance and cross-tolerance. We conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment using populations of Daphnia pulex—a ubiquitous algal grazer—that were either naive or had previously experienced selection to become more tolerant to sodium chloride (NaCl). During the initial phase of population growth. we discovered that evolved tolerance comes at the cost of slower population growth in the absence of salt. We found evolved Daphnia populations maintained a tolerance to NaCl approximately 30 generations after the initial discovery.

As lotic habitats become fragmented. the need to assess gene flow for species of conservation management becomes a priority. The eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis) is a large. fully aquatic paedamorphic salamander. Many populations are experiencing declines throughout their geographic range. yet the genetic ramifications of these declines are currently unknown. To this end. we examined levels of genetic variation and genetic structure at both range-wide and drainage (hierarchical) scales. We collected 1.203 individuals from 77 rivers throughout nine states from June 2007 to August 2011. Levels of genetic diversity were relatively high among all sampling locations. We detected significant genetic structure across populations (Fst values ranged from 0.001 between rivers within a single watershed to 0.218 between states). We identified two genetically differentiated groups at the range-wide scale: 1) the Ohio River drainage and 2) the Tennessee River drainage. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based on landscape-scale sampling of basins within the Tennessee River drainage revealed the majority of genetic variation (∼94–98%) occurs within rivers.

Herein. we present a rangewide population genetic assessment of the eastern box turtle Terrapene c. carolina. a species that is in steep decline across its range. To inform conservation planning for this species. we address the hypothesis that disruptions to demographic and movement parameters associated with the decline of the eastern box turtle has resulted in distinctive genetic signatures in the form of low genetic diversity. high population structuring. and decreased gene flow. We used microsatellite genotype data from (n = 799) individuals from across the species range to perform two Bayesian population assignment approaches. two methods for comparing historical and contemporary migration among populations. an evaluation of isolation by distance. and a method for detecting barriers to gene flow. Both Bayesian methods of population assignment indicated that there are two populations rangewide. both of which have maintained high levels of genetic diversity (HO = 0.756). Evidence of isolation by distance was detected in this species at a spatial scale of 300 – 500 km. and the Appalachian Mountains were identified as the primary barrier to gene flow across the species range. We also found evidence for historical but not contemporary migration between populations. Our prediction of many. highly structured populations across the range was not supported.

While microbial communities often serve important functional roles for their hosts. our understanding of the local and regional processes that structure these communities remains limited. Metacommunity analyses provide a promising tool for investigating mechanisms shaping microbiome heterogeneity. which is essential for predicting functional variation between hosts. Using a metacommunity framework. we examined heterogeneity in the skin microbiome of the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis). Hellbenders are broadly distributed throughout river systems in the eastern United States. but are present in specific environment locations throughout their range. The large range of the species and history of population fragmentation suggest that local and regional processes contribute to the distribution of cutaneous symbiont diversity. Therefore. we characterized the skin and environmental bacterial communities at eight rivers throughout the range of the species. We observed variation among hellbender populations in skin microbial community diversity and proportion of shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between animal and river water communities.

Despite the relative sensitivity of aquatic species to pesticides. growing evidence suggests that populations can respond to pesticides by evolving higher baseline tolerance or inducing a higher tolerance via phenotypic plasticity. While both mechanisms can allow organisms to persist when faced with pesticides. resource allocation theory suggests that tolerance may be related to resource acquisition by the organism. Using Daphnia pulex. we investigated how algal resource availability influenced the baseline and inducible tolerance of D. pulex to a carbamate insecticide. carbaryl.

Moreover. existing coinfection studies typically focus on infection outcomes associated with exposure to distinct sets of parasite species. despite that functionally and morphologically similar parasite species commonly coexist in nature. Therefore. it is important to understand how interactions between similar parasites influence infection outcomes. Surveys at seven ponds in northwest Pennsylvania found that multiple species of echinostomes commonly co-occur. Using a larval anuran host (Rana pipiens) and the two most commonly identified echinostome species from our field surveys (Echinostoma trivolvis and Echinoparyphium lineage 3). we examined how species composition and timing of exposure affect patterns of infection.

Historically. epidemiological research has focused on singular hosts and singular pathogens. However. growing evidence suggests that many pathogens co-occur in wild populations. increasing the likelihood of coinfection within hosts. Pathogen interactions within hosts are likely to change disease dynamics. which has important implications for host pathology and pathogen transmission within communities. Incorporating principles from community ecology are important for understanding the consequences of coinfection on disease outcomes within natural systems. Amphibians are a useful study system for exploring the influence of coinfection on both within-and between-host interactions.

1146177,Interaction between insecticide exposure and trematode infection across four wood frog populations,2014,Michael J Hiatt and Vanessa Wuerthner,,,,,,Amphibian populations are declining worldwide due to a number of stressors including pesticides and parasites. Conservation of these animals can be complicated because populations can differ dramatically in response to the same stressor. When consistently exposed to pesticides. some populations evolve tolerance through the process of natural selection acting across multiple generations. Alternatively. populations that are intermittently exposed to pesticides induce tolerance within a single generation. To date. however. there have been few studies examining the costs associated with these different stress tolerance mechanisms. In this study. we examined how difference in stress tolerance influence susceptibility to parasitic infections. We collected wood frog tadpoles from four different populations: two with evolved tolerance to pesticides and two with the ability to induce pesticide tolerance. We exposed tadpoles from each population to sublethal doses of carbaryl (0 and 5 ppm) for 5 days. Tadpoles were allowed to acclimate in pesticide-free water for 2 days. After this acclimation period. we then exposed tadpoles to 0 or 50 trematode parasites (Echinostoma trivolvis) for 2 days and counted the number of parasites encysted within the body. Exposure to sublethal carbaryl decreased susceptibility to trematodes for tadpole populations with evolved pesticide tolerance. In contrast. exposure to sublethal carbaryl increased susceptibility to trematodes for tadpole populations with induced pesticide tolerance. This suggests that populations with the ability to induce pesticide tolerance incur the cost of increased disease risk.

A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes. including agricultural pesticides.

However. the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees. pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring. extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled. including unplanted fields.

Despite this widespread use. the amount of compound translocated into plant tissue from the initial seed treatment to provide protection has not been reported. Our two year field study compared concentrations of clothianidin seed treatments in maize to that of maize without neonicotinoid seed treatments and found neonicotinoids present in root tissues up to 34 days post planting. Plant-bound clothianidin concentrations followed an exponential decay pattern with initially high values followed by a rapid decrease within the first ~20 days post planting. A maximum of 1.34% of the initial seed treatment was successfully recovered from plant tissues in both study years and a maximum of 0.26% was recovered from root tissue. Our findings show neonicotinoid seed treatments may provide protection from some early season secondary maize pests. However. the proportion of the neonicotinoid seed treatment clothianidin translocated into plant tissues throughout the growing season is low overall and this observation may provide a mechanism to explain reports of inconsistent efficacy of this pest management approach and increasing detections of environmental neonicotinoids.,True,2RXqXfEAAAAJ:dTyEYWd-f8wC,78,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173836,631078269869012869,/scholar?cites=631078269869012869,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173836,0,0,0

While research has largely focused on terrestrial systems. the low soil binding and high water solubility of neonicotinoids. paired with their extensive use on the landscape. puts aquatic environments at high risk for contamination via runoff events. We assessed the potential threat of these compounds to wetland communities using a combination of field surveys and experimental exposures including concentrations that are representative of what invertebrates experience in the field. In laboratory toxicity experiments. LC50 values ranged from 0.002 ppm to 1.2 ppm for aquatic invertebrates exposed to clothianidin. However. freshwater snails and amphibian larvae showed high tolerance to the chemical with no mortality observed at the highest dissolvable concentration of the insecticide. We also observed behavioral effects of clothianidin. Water bugs. Belostoma flumineum. displayed a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate following exposure to clothianidin. Similarly. crayfish. Orconectes propinquus. exhibited reduced responsiveness to stimulus with increasing clothianidin concentration. Using a semi-natural mesocosm experiment. we manipulated clothianidin concentration (0.6. 5. and 352 ppb) and the presence of predatory invertebrates to explore community-level effects. We observed high invertebrate predator mortality with increases in clothianidin concentration. With increased predator mortality. prey survival increased by 50% at the highest clothianidin concentration.

This aggregation behavior of fifth-instar larvae prior to pupation and arrestment of eclosed adult males by mature female pupae seems to allow mating as soon as an adult female ecloses. This synchronous timing is realized because foraging fifth-instar are attracted by cocoon-spinning larvae and prepupae. but not by pupae. and because male pupae develop faster than female pupae. Eclosed males are arrested by sex pheromone that disseminates from female pupae even before adult females eclose.

Two of 30 pools tested positive for ranavirus. Additionally. an individual Aedes sp. mosquito observed engorging on a box turtle also tested positive for ranavirus.

Herein. we present a rangewide population genetic assessment of the eastern box turtle Terrapene c. carolina. a species that is in steep decline across its range. To inform conservation planning for this species. we address the hypothesis that disruptions to demographic and movement parameters associated with the decline of the eastern box turtle has resulted in distinctive genetic signatures in the form of low genetic diversity. high population structuring. and decreased gene flow. We used microsatellite genotype data from (n = 799) individuals from across the species range to perform two Bayesian population assignment approaches. two methods for comparing historical and contemporary migration among populations. an evaluation of isolation by distance. and a method for detecting barriers to gene flow. Both Bayesian methods of population assignment indicated that there are two populations rangewide. both of which have maintained high levels of genetic diversity (HO = 0.756). Evidence of isolation by distance was detected in this species at a spatial scale of 300 – 500 km. and the Appalachian Mountains were identified as the primary barrier to gene flow across the species range. We also found evidence for historical but not contemporary migration between populations. Our prediction of many. highly structured populations across the range was not supported. This may point to cryptic contemporary gene flow. which might in turn be explained by the presence of rare transients in populations.

The primary approaches are either phenomenological. which typically assume that climate alone limits current and future distributions. or mechanistic. asking which tick-demographic parameters are affected by specific abiotic conditions. Both approaches have promise but are severely limited when applied separately.

We hypothesize that. in hosts with complex life histories. one stage may act as an intraspecific reservoir for another. In amphibians. for example. larvae often occur at high densities. but these densities are ephemeral and fixed in space. whereas metamorphs are long‐lived and vagile but may be very sparse. Parasite persistence is unlikely in either stage alone. but transmission between stages could maintain virulent parasites in seasonally fluctuating amphibian populations.We examined this hypothesis with a lethal ranavirus.

Co-infection with two or more of these pathogens can increase the severity of health impacts. The risk of co-infection is intensified by the ecology of these three diseases because all three pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi. Anaplasma phagocytophilum. and Babesia microti) are transmitted by the same vector. blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). and are carried by many of the same reservoir hosts. The risk of exposure to multiple pathogens from a single tick bite and the sources of co-infected ticks are not well understood. In this study. we quantify the risk of co-infection by measuring infection prevalence in 4.368 questing nymphs throughout an endemic region for all three diseases (Dutchess County. NY) to determine if co-infections occur at frequencies other than predicted by independent assortment of pathogens. Further. we identify sources of co-infection by quantifying rates of co-infection on 3.275 larval ticks fed on known hosts. We find significant deviations of levels of co-infection in questing nymphs. most notably 83% more co-infection with Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi than predicted by chance alone.

This propensity is often called realized reservoir competence. Realized reservoir competence is the product of 1) the probability the individual host is infected. i.e.. infection prevalence. and 2) the probability that if the host is infected. it will transmit the infection to a feeding vector. or infectivity. Prevalence varies in space and time. whereas infectivity may be a property of the host species.

When the parasites are vectors of infectious disease. a key consequence of this aggregation can be increased disease transmission rates. The cause of this aggregation. however. is much less clear. especially for parasites such as arthropod vectors. which generally spend only a short time on their hosts. Regression-based analyses of ticks on various hosts have focused almost exclusively on identifying the intrinsic host characteristics associated with large burdens. but these efforts have had mixed results; most host traits examined have some small influence. but none are key. An alternative approach. the Poisson-gamma mixture distribution. has often been used to describe aggregated parasite distributions in a range of host/macroparasite systems. but lacks a clear mechanistic basis. Here. we extend this framework by linking it to a general model of parasite accumulation. Then. focusing on blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) on mice (Peromyscus leucopus). we fit the extended model to the best currently available larval tick burden datasets via hierarchical Bayesian methods. and use it to explore the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on observed tick burdens.

We reviewed patterns of host range and virulence of ranaviruses in the context of virus genotype and postulate that patterns reflect significant variation in the historical and current host range of three groups of Ranavirus: FV3-like.

It has three blood-feeding stages. as follows: larva. nymph. and adult. Owing to inefficient transovarial transmission. at least for the Lyme disease agent (Borrelia burgdorferi). larval ticks rarely hatch infected. but they can acquire infection during their larval blood meal. Nymphal ticks are primarily responsible for transmitting pathogens to hosts. including humans. The transition from uninfected host-seeking larva to infectious host-seeking nymph is therefore a key aspect of human risk of infection. It can be divided into a series of steps. as follows: finding a host. taking a blood meal. becoming infected. molting. and overwintering. The chance of succeeding in each of these steps may depend on the species identity of the blood meal host.

Ltd.,Background: Parasite replication is essential for transmission. but is thought to have inevitable virulent effects. The trade-off theory of parasite virulence asserts that parasites balance virulence (the increased death rate of infected hosts). which shortens the infectious period and thus reduces transmission opportunities. against transmissibility (the probability of transmission given a contact) to maximize overall transmission.Questions: To what extent are virulence and transmissibility parasite traits? Are these traits correlated such that more virulent infections are more transmissible?Methods: We infected tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) larvae with nine isolates of the Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV) and then exposed naive larvae to these infected larvae. measuring mortality rates in both to test the heritability of virulence.

Here. we report analyses of 12.030 gap characters from an alignment of avian nuclear genes using maximum parsimony (MP) and a simple maximum likelihood (ML) framework. Both trees were similar. and they exhibited almost all of the strongly supported relationships in the nucleotide tree. although neither gap tree supported many relationships that have proven difficult to recover in previous studies. Moreover. independent lines of evidence typically corroborated the nucleotide topology instead of the gap topology when they disagreed. although the number of conflicting nodes with high bootstrap support was limited. Filtering to remove short indels did not substantially reduce homoplasy or reduce conflict.

Using molecular techniques. we tested this hypothesis for parasites from three haemosporidian genera (Plasmodium. Haemoproteus. and Leucocytozoon) collected from a diverse sampling of birds in northern Malawi. We found that host life history traits were significantly associated with parasitism rates by all three parasite genera. Nest type and nest location predicted infection probability for all three parasite genera. whereas flocking behavior is an important predictor of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infection and habitat is an important predictor of Leucocytozoon infection. Parasite prevalence was 79.1% across all individuals sampled. higher than that reported for comparable studies from any other region of the world. Parasite diversity was also exceptionally high. with 248 parasite cytochrome b lineages identified from 152 host species. A large proportion of Plasmodium.

However. forest fragmentation does not occur alone. but is always associated with other human-induced threats to trees. such as logging. forest burning and hunting of key vertebrate seed dispersers within forest remnants. This association occurs because forest resources are. at least during a certain period. the main income source for local human populations. It is now possible to establish how these threats act in concert causing tree species impoverishment.

CABS and Island Press, Washington",,43-59,,The Atlantic Forest. one of the largest tropical forests on the planet. was the first biome to be exploited following the European colonization of Brazil (Chapter 4. this volume). Successive economic cycles and the steady expansion of the region's human population over the last five centuries have seriously compromised the ecological integrity of the Atlantic Forest's singular ecosystems. The origins of this grave environmental crisis can be traced to the history of the colonization of the region (Dean 1995; Coimbra-Filho and Camara 1996). Despite centuries of scientific investigation. the Atlantic Forest is still poorly known. New vertebrate species continue to be described there (Lorini and Persson 1990; Kobayashi and Langguth 1999). and many are even being found on the outskirts of some of the largest cities (Willis 1992). The fact that. despite the enormous reduction in forest cover. few known species in the region have become extinct (Chapters 8 and 30. this volume). indicates that a chance still exists for well-planned actions to conserve the biota of the Atlantic Forest. However. such actions must be based on an assessment of the current state of the biodiversity of the region and include a cleatly defined set of indicators for monitoring progress.In this chapter we offer an overview of the biodiversity of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. emphasizing its unique biogeographic position among the tropical forests of South America. and propose a division of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest into biogeographic subregions based on the distribution of forest butterflies. mammals. and birds. the most well-known biological groups in the region.

In both categories. the number of species decreases with increasing distance from their source areas. However. more Atlantic elements extend their ranges considerably deeper into the Cerrado Region than do Amazonian elements. There is an altitudinal separation between Amazonian and Atlantic elements. with Amazonian taxa occurring. on average. at lower altitudes than Atlantic ones. Amazonian elements are mainly restricted to the peripheral depressions and low-altitude plateaus within the Cerrado Region. whereas Atlantic ones are found primarily at high plateaus. Both historical (effects of the cyclic climatic changes during the Quaternary on the structure and composition of gallery forests) and ecological (tolerance to abrupt changes in temperature during the winter) factors are suggested to have caused range differences between Amazonian and Atlantic elements within the Cerrado Region.

Their high level of species richness is caused by the aggregation of many small-ranged species. which has been difficult to explain from purely macroecological models focusing on contemporary ecological processes. Because the individual mountain tracts harbor species that represent different evolutionary trajectories. it seems plausible to relate these species assemblages to high persistence (or absence of extinction) in addition to high levels of speciation. The distribution of small-ranged species is concentrated near tropical coasts. where moderation of the climate in topographically complex areas creates cloud forests and stable local conditions.

Both trees were similar. and they exhibited almost all of the strongly supported relationships in the nucleotide tree. although neither gap tree supported many relationships that have proven difficult to recover in previous studies. Moreover. independent lines of evidence typically corroborated the nucleotide topology instead of the gap topology when they disagreed. although the number of conflicting nodes with high bootstrap support was limited. Filtering to remove short indels did not substantially reduce homoplasy or reduce conflict.

Ltd.,We describe a general framework for understanding the ecological processes that operate at landscape scales. The composition of habitat types in a landscape and the physiognomic or spatial arrangement of those habitats are the two essential features that are required to describe any landscape. As such. these two features affect four basic ecological processes that can influence population dynamics or community structure. The first two of these processes. landscape complementation and landscape supplementation. occur when individuals move between patches in the landscape to make use of non-substitutable and substitutable resources. respectively. The third process. source-sink dynamics. describes the consequences of having different individuals in the same population occupy habitat patches of different qualities.

However. that world came to an end following massive late-Quaternary megafauna extinctions on land and widespread population reductions in great whale populations over the past few centuries. These losses are likely to have had important consequences for broad-scale nutrient cycling. because recent literature suggests that large animals disproportionately drive nutrient movement. We estimate that the capacity of animals to move nutrients away from concentration patches has decreased to about 8% of the preextinction value on land and about 5% of historic values in oceans.

Effects from the surrounding landscape also have to be considered. The need for a landscape perspective in conservation and management has been explicitly recognized in the ecosystem management approach being developed by the USDA Forest Service (Kessler et al. 1992 and related papers in the same issue) and is currently being evaluated in the Pacific Northwest (Franklin 1989. Hansen et al. 1991. Bormann et al. 1994). Landscape ecology represents a renewed interest in the development and dynamics of landscape mosaics. the effects of landscape patterns on species. biotic interactions and ecological processes. and how landscape heterogeneity can be managed to benefit society (Risser et al. 1984. Naveh and Lieberman 1984. Allen and Hoekstra 1992). An emphasis on spatial heterogeneity. human influences. and spatio-temporal dynamics distinguishes landscape ecology from other types of ecological investigation. Landscape ecology arose initially in Europe from traditions of regional geography and vegetation science (Naveh and Lieberman 1984. Turner and Gardner 1991). In North America. it evolved primarily from the theory of island biogeography (MacArthur and Wilson 1963. 1967). which used spatial pattern to explain species distributions (Burgess and Sharpe 1981.

These experimental results support the hypothesis. based on previous nonexperimental observations. that sparrow populations in this habitat are locally food limited only during infrequent years of very low seed productions.,True,zytPUl8AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,57,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1938372,2198681803180552042,/scholar?cites=2198681803180552042,,,0,0,0

Yet. despite hundreds of papers. a compelling explanation of ratite evolution has still not been achieved. The reasons for continuing controversy resolve into two main issues: first. nearly all workers have failed to interpret morphological data within a consistent framework of phylogenetic reasoning; second. these same workers have failed to keep zoogeographical considerations from influencing phylogenetic conclusions. Thus. it has been geographical distribution and certain (incorrect) presuppositions about earth history. rather than comparative morphological analysis of the organisms themselves. that have determined many current ideas of ratite evolution.

Many intercontinental connections. especially in the Southern Hemisphere. persisted until the late Cretaceous and/or early Tertiary. Moreover. climates at these times were warmer and more equable than in the late Tertiary. and birds could breed in and disperse through high latitudes. It is concluded that a number of avian orders and families had their origin in Gondwanaland and predrift configurations of the continents were major determinants of their biogeography.

Neornithes) and their interrelationships are the legacy of systematic work undertaken in the 19th century. Before the introduction of an evolutionary worldview by Charles Darwin in 1859. taxonomists clustered taxa into groups using similarities that reflected a vision of how God might have organized the world at the time of Creation. Such was the case with the Quinerian system of avian classification devised by Macleay (1819–1821) in which groups and subgroups of five were recognized. or of Strickland (1841) or Wallace (1856) in which affinities were graphed as unrooted networks (see O’Hara 1988). After Darwin. this worldview changed. For those comparative biologists struggling to make sense of Earth’s biotic diversity in naturalistic terms. Darwinism provided a framework for organizing similarities and differences hierarchically. as a pattern of ancestry and descent. The search for the Tree of Life was launched. and it did not take long for the structure of avian relationships to be addressed. The first to do so was no less a figure than Thomas Henry Huxley (1867). who produced an important and influential paper on avian classification that was explicitly evolutionary. It was also Huxley who provided the first strong argument that birds were related to dinosaurs (Huxley 1868). Huxley was particularly influential in England and was read widely across Europe. but the “father of phylogenetics” and phylogenetic “tree-thinking” was clearly Ernst Haeckel.

Present evidence suggests continental biotas have had a long. complex history asjudged by patterns of relationship among areas of endemism. Thus. an analysis of speciescladograms.in which component taxa share areas of endemism. reveals. first. that more thanone general area-cladogram typically exists for the areas of a continental biota. and second. thatthere is often incongruence among these general area-cladograms.

1146401,Species concepts and the ontology of evolution,1987,Joel Cracraft,2,Biology and philosophy,3,329-346,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Biologists and philosophers have long recognized the importance of species. yet species concepts serve two masters. evolutionary theory on the one hand and taxonomy on the other. Much of present-day evolutionary and systematic biology has confounded these two roles primarily through use of the biological species concept. Theories require entities that are real. discrete. irreducible. and comparable. Within the neo-Darwinian synthesis. however. biological species have been treated as real or subjectively delimited entities. discrete or nondiscrete. and they are often capable of being decomposed into other. smaller units. Because of this. biological species are generally not comparable across different groups of organisms. which implies that the ontological structure of evolutionary theory requires modification.

Phylogenetic relationships within seven lineages of birds were analyzed by numerical cladistic techniques applied to data sets of morphological characters. These relationships revealed extensive congruence among the spatial and temporal histories of lineages whose species are endemic to common areas of endemism. A general hypothesis is constructed to explain this congruence in which widespread biotas are postulated to have been partitioned into areas of endemism by the origin of geomorphological and/or ecological‐climatic barriers.Congruence in these phylogenetic patterns of differentiation suggests the following historical pattern of interrelationships for areas of endemism along the northern and eastern coasts of Australia: (Kimberley Plateau …,True,doUOYYQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,178,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1986.tb00566.x,13820308231774562516,/scholar?cites=13820308231774562516,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1986.tb00566.x,0,0,0

Assuming niche conservatism. assemblages should shift from phylogenetic clustering to evenness with decreasing geographic scale because the relative importance of mechanisms that shape assemblages is hypothesized to be scale‐dependent. Whereas habitat filtering is more likely to act at regional scales because of increased habitat heterogeneity that allows sorting of ecologically similar species in contrasting environments. competition is more likely to act at local scales because low habitat heterogeneity provides few opportunities for niche partitioning. 2. We used species lists to assess assemblage composition. data on ecologically‐relevant traits. and a molecular phylogeny. to examine the phylogenetic structure of …,True,HC_mHmUAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,152,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01725.x,1095419938102667045,/scholar?cites=1095419938102667045,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01725.x,0,0,0

Because elevation affects organisms indirectly. testing whether competition influences elevational ranges relies on the heretofore untested assumption that the relationship between elevation and factors influencing organisms directly is similar across geography.

For example. the more frequent appearance of migratory behaviour in temperate-breeding species than in species originally breeding in the tropics is believed to have resulted partly from tropical climatic stability and niche conservatism constraining tropical species from shifting their ranges. However. little is known about the patterns and processes underlying climatic niche evolution in migrant and resident animals. We evaluated the evolution of overlap in climatic niches between seasons and its relationship to migratory behaviour in the Parulidae. a family of New World passerine birds.

The rain and cloud forests of the extremely wet Pacific slope are relatively intact in most areas but the drier. rain-shadow vegetation of the eastern (Cauca Valley) slope has been subject to much greater human disturbance. Ornithological studies in the Western Andes. subsequent to initial collecting expeditions (see Chapman 1917). concentrated largely on the southern sector of this cordillera. in the departments of Nariño. Cauca and Valle (eg. Hilty 1997. Miller 1963. Negret 1994. Orejuela 1987. Orejuela et al. 1979. Salaman 1994). In contrast. the northern sector. roughly that portion included within the departments of Risaralda. Chocó and Antioquia. received little study during most of the latter half of the twentieth century. The only reasonably detailed study published during this period is that of Echeverri (1986) for Parque Nacional Natural “Las Orquídeas”. During the last decade. however. the pace of ornithological work in the region has increased.

Bret Whitney tape-recorded a Scytalopus at Finca Merenberg he too was unable to identify. He sent a copy of the recording to NK. who was unaware of any Scytalopus with a similar song. Yet. S. atratus confusus. a taxon that ranges at similar elevations in Colombia was a possibility. as its vocalisations were then unknown. Due to mounting political instability it became dangerous to work in the region. thus very few ornithologists visited Finca Merenberg in the 1990s. In 2002. however. Andrés Cuervo finally obtained recordings of confusus in dpto. Antioquia and sent copies to NK. who found the vocalisations very different from those of the Finca Merenberg birds. making it highly probable that the latter represented an undescribed taxon. By then. political tension had lessened. enabling us to visit Finca Merenberg in February 2003. with the purpose of obtaining specimens and tape-recordings of the tapaculo. Three specimens were taken. all males. whose vocalisations were also tape-recorded. Additional recordings of 5–6 individuals were obtained at Finca Merenberg and a nearby site.

The basic evolutionary model underlying the use of phenotypic data to delimit species assumes random mating and quantitative polygenic traits. so that phenotypic distributions within a species should be approximately normal for individuals of the same sex and age. Accordingly. two or more distinct normal distributions of phenotypic traits suggest the existence of multiple species.

The early development of an oxygen-containing atmosphere approximately 2.45 - 2.22 billion years ago is attributed to the photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria. Furthermore. they are one of the few prokaryotic phyla where multicellularity has evolved. Understanding when and how multicellularity evolved in these ancient organisms would provide fundamental information on the early history of life and further our knowledge of complex life forms. We conducted and compared phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA sequences from a large sample of taxa representing the morphological and genetic diversity of cyanobacteria.

It is increasingly clear that an approach focusing on individual major biomes rather than a single aggregate view is useful because of evidence for differing diversification histories among biomes. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that Neotropical-scale diversification patterns are structured more ecologically than geographically. with a key role for phylogenetic niche or biome conservatism. Lower geographical structure reflects the fact that long-distance dispersal. inferred from dated phylogenetic trees. has overcome many supposed dispersal barriers. Overall. high rates of species turnover as inferred from palaeontological and molecular data have been the hallmark of plant evolutionary dynamics in the Neotropics throughout the Cenozoic. with most …,True,KYbhJxMAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,216,https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article-abstract/171/1/1/2557401,15141773460886077653,/scholar?cites=15141773460886077653,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandre_Antonelli/publication/263104897_Neotropical_Plant_Evolution_Assembling_the_Big_Picture/links/5a96363745851535bcdcc564/Neotropical-Plant-Evolution-Assembling-the-Big-Picture.pdf,0,0,0

A plethora of mechanisms for promoting diversification has been proposed. generally invoking ecological and vicariance processes associated with major geological. hydrological and climatic events in the history of the Amazon drainage basin. Here. we review recent advances on this topic in the light of a rich new source of information: molecular phylogenetics and especially phylogeography. We present a comparison of phylogeographical studies covering over 50 clades of amphibians. birds. non-avian reptiles and mammals. focusing on studies where estimates of divergence times were explicitly calculated. We then discuss the congruence of the speciation patterns found in these studies with previous hypotheses of diversification. Based on the estimates of crown group ages. we conclude that a high proportion of present-day diversity is a result of Neogene diversification. The origin of most clades clearly predates the Pleistocene by a considerable margin. refuting the long-held hypothesis that repeated expansion and contraction of lowland forests during Pleistocene climatic changes would be responsible for most of the Amazonian biodiversity. However. some evidence from phylogenetic and distributional patterns suggests that climate cycles did trigger speciation.

The description of the first reliable fossil in 2007 enabled a direct calibration of the orchid phylogeny. but little attention has been paid to the potential influence of dating methodology in obtaining reliable age estimates. Moreover. two new orchid fossils described in 2009 have not yet been incorporated in a molecular dating analysis. Here we compare the ages of major orchid clades estimated under two widely used methods. a Bayesian relaxed clock implemented in BEAST and Penalized Likelihood implemented in r8s. We then perform a new family-level analysis by integrating all 3 available fossils and using BEAST. To evaluate how the newly estimated ages may influence the evolutionary interpretation of a species-level phylogeny. we assess divergence times for the South American genus Hoffmannseggella (subfam.

Our results provide additional support that all extant orchids shared a most recent common ancestor in the Late Cretaceous (~77 million years ago. Ma).

These drainage systems constantly changed shape and size. During the entire Cenozoic. the Brazilian and Guiana Shields were stable mountainous areas. Andean-derived river systems increased in importance especially in the Neogene. A remarkable feature in western Amazonian history is the waxing and waning of large lake systems and embayments. By the Late Miocene (about 11 Ma). the Andes were connected with the Atlantic through an incipient Amazon River. and from c. 7 Ma Andean-derived river systems became fully established in central and eastern Amazonia and the modern landscape configuration had developed. Rainforests already existed in northern South America during the Paleogene. but the modern rainforests-with resemblance to the Present forest-only developed during the Miocene. The western Amazonian Miocene record contains very diverse aquatic faunas (molluscs. ostracods. turtles. crocodiles. fishes) as well as terrestrial mammals.

A phylogenetically controlled study of wing shape in relation to migratory distance and flight display suggests that migration has a larger impact on wing morphology than does flight display. despite the fact that flight display is generally the more heavily used flight-type. Correlations between single measures of morphology and migration were found only in males. although principal components analysis suggests that overall wing shape is correlated with migratory distance in both sexes.

In Southern Mexico. several lineages of the freshwater fish species of the genus Poecilia have independently colonized toxic. hydrogen sulfide-rich springs. Even though ecological speciation processes are increasingly well understood in this system. aligning the taxonomy of these fish with evolutionary processes has lagged behind. While some sulfide spring populations are classified as ecotypes of Poecilia mexicana. others. like P. sulphuraria. have been described as highly endemic species. Our study particularly focused on elucidating the taxonomy of the long described sulfide spring endemic. Poecilia thermalis Steindachner 1863. and investigates if similar evolutionary patterns of phenotypic trait divergence and reproductive isolation are present as observed in other sulfidic species of Poecilia. We applied a geometric morphometric approach to assess body shape similarity to other sulfidic and non-sulfidic fish of the genus Poecilia. We also conducted phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to establish the phylogenetic relationships of P. thermalis and used a population genetic approach to determine levels of gene flow among Poecilia from sulfidic and non-sulfidic sites.

Furthermore. while most microbes resident in mammalian guts are present in only a restricted taxonomic range of hosts. most microbes recovered from birds show little evidence of host specificity.

The skin and fur of mammals can host a wide variety of ectoparasites. many of which are phylogenetically diverse. specialized. and specifically adapted to their hosts. Among hematophagous dipteran parasites. volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to serve as important attractants. leading parasites to compatible sources of blood meals. VOCs have been hypothesized to be mediated by host-associated bacteria. which may thereby indirectly influence parasitism. Host-associated bacteria may also influence parasitism directly. as has been observed in interactions between animal gut microbiota and malarial parasites. Hypotheses relating bacterial symbionts and eukaryotic parasitism have rarely been tested among humans and domestic animals. and have to our knowledge never been tested in wild vertebrates. In this study. we use Afrotropical bats. hematophagous ectoparasitic bat flies. and haemosporidian (malarial) parasites vectored by bat flies as a model to test the hypothesis that the vertebrate host microbiome is linked to parasitism in a wild system. We identify significant correlations between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages. as well as striking differences in skin microbial network characteristics between ectoparasitized and non-ectoparasitized bats.

Here we present a comprehensive survey of dipteran and haemosporidian parasites. and characterization of the gut. oral. and skin microbiota of Afrotropical bats. We found significant correlation between bacterial community composition of the skin and dipteran ectoparasite prevalence across four major bat lineages. as well as links between the oral microbiome and malarial parasitism. suggesting a potential mechanism for host selection and vector-borne disease transmission in bats. Mirroring recent studies of host-microbiome co-speciation in mammals. we find a weak correlation between chiropteran phylogenetic distances and bacterial community dissimilarity across the three anatomical sites. suggesting that host environment is more important than shared ancestry in shaping the composition of associated bacterial communities.Animals rely on bacterial symbionts for numerous biological functions. such as digestion and immune system development; but there is increasing evidence that host-associated microbes may play a role in mediating parasite burden.

1146509,Mitochondrial DNA under siege in avian phylogeography,2008,Robert M Zink and George F Barrowclough,17,,9,2107-2121,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been the workhorse of research in phylogeography for almost two decades. However. concerns with basing evolutionary interpretations on mtDNA results alone have been voiced since the inception of such studies. Recently. some authors have suggested that the potential problems with mtDNA are so great that inferences about population structure and species limits are unwarranted unless corroborated by other evidence. usually in the form of nuclear gene data.

Molecular comparisons of recently diverged sister species now permit a test of this assertion. The Late Pleistocene Origins model predicts a mitochondrial DNA divergence value of less than 0.5 percent for avian sister species of Late Pleistocene origin. Instead. the average mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence for 35 such songbird species pairs is 5.1 percent. which exceeds the predicted value by a factor of 10.

Mitochondrial DNA sequence data reveal that 97% of continentally distributed avian subspecies lack the population genetic structure indicative of a distinct evolutionary unit. Subspecies considered threatened or endangered. some of which have been targets of expensive restoration efforts. also generally lack genetic distinctiveness. Although sequence data show that species include 1.9 historically significant units on average. these units are not reflected by current subspecies nomenclature.

The concept has been considered useful both from evolutionary and taxonomic viewpoints. Criticisms of the BSC. largely by nonornithologists. have not led to substantial modification of the concept in ornithology. We discuss the concepts of grouping individuals into taxa and ranking these taxa as biological species. defined as reproductively isolated groups. The dimensionality of species is discussed. and we suggest that the problems in extending the BSC from nondimensional (sympatric) to multidimensional (polytypic species) situations are too serious to ignore.

Three principal flaws in the BSC are reviewed: (1) the occurrence of paraphyletic or nonhistorical groups; (2) the misrepresention of the significance of hybridization among differentiated taxa; and (3) the logical difficulty in handling allopatric populations. Simple cline theory shows that likely times to fusion for hybridizing taxa exceed the average duration of most species in the fossil record. We address criticisms of PSCs (of which there are several). including the application of phylogenetic methods to populations. and whether species can be monophyletic.

Evolution of size and plumage coloration has probably proceeded faster than mtDNA evolution. leading to the well‐structured continental pattern of morphological variation. We suggest that the nonordered geographic distribution of haplotypes reflects the recency of population establishment following completion of range expansion.

Avian paleontological studies suggest that most extant species evolved in the Pleistocene Epoch and that species9 durations decreased through the Pleistocene because of heightened speciation rates. Molecular systematic studies provide another data base for testing these predictions. In particular. rates of diversification can be determined from molecular phylogenetic trees. For example. an increasing rate of speciation (but constant extinction) requires shorter intervals between successive speciation events on a phylogenetic tree.

Within vertebrates. current diversity metrics for fishes. amphibians. and reptiles are known to be poor estimators. whereas those for birds and mammals are often assumed to be relatively well established. We show that avian evolutionary diversity is significantly underestimated due to a taxonomic tradition not found in most other taxonomic groups. Using a sample of 200 species taken from a list of 9159 biological species determined primarily by morphological criteria. we applied a diagnostic. evolutionary species concept to a morphological and distributional data set that resulted in an estimate of 18.043 species of birds worldwide. with a 95% confidence interval of 15.845 to 20.470. In a second. independent analysis. we examined intraspecific genetic data from 437 traditional avian species. finding an average of 2.4 evolutionary units per species. which can be considered proxies for phylogenetic species. Comparing recent lists of species to that used in this study (based primarily on morphology) revealed that taxonomic changes in the past 25 years have led to an increase of only 9%. well below what our results predict. Therefore. our molecular and morphological results suggest that the current taxonomy of birds understimates avian species diversity by at least a factor of two. We suggest that a revised taxonomy that better captures avian species diversity will enhance the quantification and analysis of global patterns of diversity and distribution. as well as provide …,True,7Ajir6EAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC,129,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166307,397154204328383403,/scholar?cites=397154204328383403,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166307,0,0,0

1146532,Collision mortality has no discernible effect on population trends of North American birds,2011,Todd W Arnold and Robert M Zink,6,PloS one,9,e24708,Public Library of Science,Avian biodiversity is threatened by numerous anthropogenic factors and migratory species are especially at risk. Migrating birds frequently collide with manmade structures and such losses are believed to represent the majority of anthropogenic mortality for North American birds. However. estimates of total collision mortality range across several orders of magnitude and effects on population dynamics remain unknown. Herein. we develop a novel method to assess relative vulnerability to anthropogenic threats. which we demonstrate using 243.103 collision records from 188 species of eastern North American landbirds. After correcting mortality estimates for variation attributable to population size and geographic overlap with potential collision structures. we found that per capita vulnerability to collision with buildings and towers varied over more than four orders of magnitude among species. Species that migrate long distances or at night were much more likely to be killed by collisions than year-round residents or diurnal migrants. However. there was no correlation between relative collision mortality and long-term population trends for these same species. Thus. although millions of North American birds are killed annually by collisions with manmade structures. this source of mortality has no discernible effect on populations.,True,7Ajir6EAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,111,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024708,15818208154213922865,/scholar?cites=15818208154213922865,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024708,0,0,0

The passenger pigeon was once the most abundant bird in the world. with a population size estimated at 3–5 billion in the 1800s; its abrupt extinction in 1914 raises the question of how such an abundant bird could have been driven to extinction in mere decades. Although human exploitation is often blamed. the role of natural population dynamics in the passenger pigeon’s extinction remains unexplored. Applying high-throughput sequencing technologies to obtain sequences from most of the genome. we calculated that the passenger pigeon’s effective population size throughout the last million years was persistently about 1/10.000 of the 1800’s estimated number of individuals. a ratio 1.000-times lower than typically found.

Numerous operational techniques based on molecular or phenotypic data have been designed to overcome this problem. yet existing procedures remain subjective or inconsistent. particularly when applying the biological species concept.

Some studies suggest that it promotes the evolution of reproductive isolation. while others find no relationship between sexual selection and species richness.

In this study. we use phylogenetic analyses to test this idea in 739 Amazonian bird species. We show that patterns of species and subspecies richness are best predicted by a suite of avian specialisms common in tropical avifaunas but rare in the temperate zone. However. this only applied to niche traits associated with dispersal limitation rather than vagility. These findings are consistent with the view that diversity is promoted by more finely partitioned niches. although not simply by coevolutionary adaptation and niche packing as is often assumed.

Divergence in sympatry strengthens reproductive isolation. and divergence in allopatry can reduce or eliminate gene flow between populations on secondary contact. In birds. the first of these processes has empirical support. but the second remains largely hypothetical. This is perhaps because most studies have focused on oscine passerines. whose song learning ability may reduce the influence of vocalizations in reproductive isolation. In suboscine passerines. the role of learning in song development is thought to be minimal. and the resultant signals are relatively fixed. To investigate the role of song in the early stages of peripatric speciation. we therefore studied a suboscine. the chestnut-tailed antbird Myrmeciza hemimelaena.

They face the twin challenges of discriminating between species to identify conspecific mates. and between individuals to recognize collaborators and competitors. It is therefore often assumed that long-distance signals are under strong selection for species-specificity and individual distinctiveness. and that this will drive character displacement when closely related species meet. particularly in noisy environments. However. the occurrence of signal stereotypy and convergence in rainforest species seems to contradict these ideas. and raises the question of whether receivers in these systems can recognize species or individuals by long-distance signals alone.

We then propose a simple mechanical model that explains the observed egg-shape diversity based on geometric and material properties of the egg membrane.

A plethora of mechanisms for promoting diversification has been proposed. generally invoking ecological and vicariance processes associated with major geological. hydrological and climatic events in the history of the Amazon drainage basin. Here. we review recent advances on this topic in the light of a rich new source of information: molecular phylogenetics and especially phylogeography.

We then discuss the congruence of the speciation patterns found in these studies with previous hypotheses of diversification. Based on the estimates of crown group ages. we conclude that a high proportion of present-day diversity is a result of Neogene diversification. The origin of most clades clearly predates the Pleistocene by a considerable margin. refuting the long-held hypothesis that repeated expansion and contraction of lowland forests during Pleistocene climatic changes would be responsible for most of the Amazonian biodiversity. However. some evidence from phylogenetic and distributional patterns suggests that climate cycles did trigger speciation.

Peru,2012,Christine L Hice and Paúl M Velazco,60,"Special Publications, Museum of Texas Tech University",,1-135,,South American mammals have received increasing attention in recent years. in part due to their high species diversity. functional complexity at the level of communities. and endangerment as a result of anthropogenic activities. Human impacts include deforestation and habitat alteration. the two major threats to biodiversity in the neotropics. Indeed. many habitats are being lost before basic inventories of plant and animal communities can be compiled. in addition. basic natural history information is lacking for many. if not most. Neotropical species. especially in the Amazon Basin. Such basic information is essential for natural resource management and conservation to be successful. To obtain such information at one site. the small mammal community at the Reserva Nacional Allpahuayo-Mishana (RNAM) in northeastern Peru was monitored for 18 months. Data were collected to describe and quantify small mammal communities in pristine habitats and to document the impacts of disturbance on these communities. These data represent one of the most comprehensive data sets on nonvolant mammals ever collected from one site in Amazonia. A total of 37 small mammal species. 13 marsupials and 24 rodents. were documented at the site. which represents one of the most species-rich communities reported from the Neotropics.

A plethora of mechanisms for promoting diversification has been proposed. generally invoking ecological and vicariance processes associated with major geological. hydrological and climatic events in the history of the Amazon drainage basin. Here. we review recent advances on this topic in the light of a rich new source of information: molecular phylogenetics and especially phylogeography. We present a comparison of phylogeographical studies covering over 50 clades of amphibians. birds. non-avian reptiles and mammals. focusing on studies where estimates of divergence times were explicitly calculated. We then discuss the congruence of the speciation patterns found in these studies with previous hypotheses of diversification. Based on the estimates of crown group ages. we conclude that a high proportion of present-day diversity is a result of Neogene diversification. The origin of most clades clearly predates the Pleistocene by a considerable margin. refuting the long-held hypothesis that repeated expansion and contraction of lowland forests during Pleistocene climatic changes would be responsible for most of the Amazonian biodiversity. However. some evidence from phylogenetic and distributional patterns suggests that climate cycles did trigger speciation.

The tree frog Dendropsophus minutus (Anura: Hylidae) is a nominal species. continentally distributed in South America. that may represent a complex of multiple species. each with a more limited distribution. To understand the spatial pattern of molecular diversity throughout the range of this species complex. we obtained DNA sequence data from two mitochondrial genes. cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and the 16S rhibosomal gene (16S) for 407 samples of D. minutus and closely related species distributed across eleven countries. effectively comprising the entire range of the group. We performed phylogenetic and spatially explicit phylogeographic analyses to assess the genetic structure of lineages and infer ancestral areas.

We present the results of the first wide-scale DNA barcoding survey of anurans of Colombia. focusing on a transect across the Eastern Cordillera. We surveyed 10 sites between the Magdalena Valley to the west and the eastern foothills of the Eastern Cordillera. sequencing portions of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) genes for 235 individuals from 52 nominal species. We applied two barcode algorithms. Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and Refined Single Linkage Analysis. to estimate the number of clusters or “unconfirmed candidate species” supported by DNA barcode data. Our survey included ~7% of the anuran species known from Colombia. While barcoding algorithms differed slightly in the number of clusters identified. between three and ten nominal species may be obscuring candidate species (in some cases. more than one cryptic species per nominal species).

A plethora of mechanisms for promoting diversification has been proposed. generally invoking ecological and vicariance processes associated with major geological. hydrological and climatic events in the history of the Amazon drainage basin. Here. we review recent advances on this topic in the light of a rich new source of information: molecular phylogenetics and especially phylogeography. We present a comparison of phylogeographical studies covering over 50 clades of amphibians. birds. non-avian reptiles and mammals. focusing on studies where estimates of divergence times were explicitly calculated. We then discuss the congruence of the speciation patterns found in these studies with previous hypotheses of diversification. Based on the estimates of crown group ages. we conclude that a high proportion of present-day diversity is a result of Neogene diversification. The origin of most clades clearly predates the Pleistocene by a considerable margin. refuting the long-held hypothesis that repeated expansion and contraction of lowland forests during Pleistocene climatic changes would be responsible for most of the Amazonian biodiversity. However. some evidence from phylogenetic and distributional patterns suggests that climate cycles did trigger speciation. Speciose lineages of tetrapods tend to be older than groups containing one to a few species. with a few notable exceptions. Considering each tetrapod group alone. amphibians and non-avian reptiles are generally older than birds. while mammals contain …,True,4g6gf-sAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,176,http://dna.ac/PDFs/Antonelli&l_10_Amazonia_tetrapod_phylogeography_Ch24.pdf,12067998991738915935,/scholar?cites=12067998991738915935,,http://dna.ac/PDFs/Antonelli&l_10_Amazonia_tetrapod_phylogeography_Ch24.pdf,0,0,0

South America was invaded by at least four independent lineages of pitvipers: Bothriechis schlegelii. Crotalus durissus. Porthidium. and the ancestor of Bothrops. Bothrops diversified in South America. but the continent’s remaining genera of pitvipers are more recent colonizers. The origin of Lachesis remains unresolved. Bothrops shows the greatest amount of diversity with respect to species numbers. morphology. and natural history. Sequence divergence within Bothrops. however. is no greater than in other clades or genera of New World pitvipers. The diversity of morphological and natural history traits in Bothrops compared with clades of similar age may have resulted from colonization of a continent devoid of viperids. followed by rapid adaptive radiation. More recent lineages that colonized South America are highly restricted in distribution and typically lack morphological and/or natural history traits present in Bothrops.

Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects.

Here. we investigated how the shape of a bush interacts with two key processes-coalescence and mutation-that can lead to errors in phylogenetic inference under specific conditions. For this study. we focused on the tradeoff between sampling more individuals per species and sampling more loci as well as the utility of a species tree method based upon gene tree reconciliation and the concatenation of multiple loci for resolving bushes. We examined different bush shapes. varying both the speciation rate during the radiation and the depth of the radiation. to encompass a broad range of situations. Using simulations based upon parameters derived from empirical studies. we investigated the performance of phylogenetic analyses under different conditions to identify approaches with the greatest potential to resolve difficult phylogenies. Sampling a single individual for more loci outperformed sampling multiple individuals for one locus in all cases except the most recent radiations. We found that error due to homoplastic mutations increased with depth. while error due to the coalescent process remained unchanged. These simulations also revealed that. for certain ancient bushes. analyses of concatenated data matrices surprisingly resulted in more accurate phylogenies than gene tree reconciliation.

Consequently. predicting trait evolution in natural communities may require understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics involving a number of species. In August 2016. the American Society of Naturalists sponsored a symposium to explore evolution in a community context. focusing on microevolutionary processes. Here we provide an introduction to our perspectives on this topic by defining the context and describing some examples of when and how microevolutionary responses to multiple species may differ from evolution in isolation or in two-species communities. We find that indirect ecological and evolutionary effects can result in nonadditive selection and evolution that cannot be predicted from pairwise interactions.

Motivated by this. we use a quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra framework to understand the impact of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on an intraguild predation community in which the intraguild predator evolves between a phenotype specialized for attacking its competitor (the intraguild prey) and a phenotype specialized for attacking a common resource. We show that evolution can drive both sudden and gradual shifts in community structure.

We do this by analyzing a general eco-evolutionary predator–prey model using four methods: Method 1 identifies how eco-evolutionary feedbacks alter system stability in the fast and slow evolution limits; Method 2 identifies how the amount of standing predator genetic variation alters system stability; Method 3 identifies how the phase lags in predator–prey cycles depend on the amount of genetic variation; and Method 4 determines conditions for different cycle shapes in the fast and slow evolution limits using geometric singular perturbation theory.

By altering the interactions within a community. eco-evolutionary feedbacks may play a role in community stability. Indeed. recent empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate that these feedbacks can stabilize or destabilize communities and. moreover. that this sometimes depends on the relative rate of ecological to evolutionary processes. So far. theory on how eco-evolutionary feedbacks impact stability exists only for a few special cases. In our work. we develop a general theory for determining the effects of eco-evolutionary feedbacks on stability in communities with an arbitrary number of interacting species and evolving traits for when evolution is slow and fast.

We examine whether evolution of the shared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer depends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models of exploitative and apparent competition. the shared species evolves its defense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single locus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack rates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g.. nutritional prey are harder to capture). eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable states supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or synergistic. assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically displaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species.

Lists of species restricted to these habitats are presented; for many of these species. this is the first published information on habitat preferences. As many as 169 bird species in the lowland neotropics may have evolved in Amazonian river-created habitats. with 99 of these spreading secondarily to man-made second-growth or to regions outside the Amazon Basin. Neither the Congo or Mississippi basin avifaunas show such a high percent of species restricted to river-created habitats; this difference is almost certainly due to the greater amplitude of seasonal water level fluctuations of the Amazon River and its tributaries and consequent greater …,True,gCx3jBgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,279,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2387833,2710057620690556589,/scholar?cites=2710057620690556589,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Remsen/publication/271953917_Contribution_of_River-Created_Habitats_to_Bird_Species_Richness_in_Amazonia/links/5a32d17b0f7e9b2a283e3198/Contribution-of-River-Created-Habitats-to-Bird-Species-Richness-in-Amazonia.pdf,0,0,0
1146665,On the use of tape recorders in avifaunal surveys,1991,Theodore A PARKER III,108,Auk,,443-444,,"The utility of tape recorders and tape playbacks for censusing birds is widely recognized (Johnson et al. 1981). but little emphasis has been placed on their importance in faunal surveys. Tape recorders are indispensable for finding rare. secretive. or patchily distributed species. and for documenting the composition of mixed-species flocks in forest canopy. Awareness of vocal differences in the field and taping has led to the discovery of several taxa new to science (Parker and O'Neill 1985. Parker and Schulenberg MS). and to the recognition of numerous species previously considered subspecies (Lanyon 1967. 1978; Pierpont and Fitzpatrick 1983). One person equipped with a tape recorder and directional microphone can document a surprisingly high percentage of a tropical forest avifauna within 4-7 days during the proper season. Without tape re-corders. several weeks (or even months) are required to locate most of the resident bird species in any lowland Amazonian locality. and such an effort would involve a large number of experienced observers using the best optical equipment and many mist nets. On a recent Louisiana State University Museum of Zoology (LSUMZ) expedition to the Department of Pando in Amazonian Bolivia (Parker and Remsen 1987). I tape-recorded 243 species found within an area ca. 2 km 2 of upland rain forest in only seven days.

1146671,An annotated checklist of Peruvian birds,1982,Theodore A Parker and Susan Allen Parker and Manuel A Plenge,,,,,Buteo books,INTRODUCTION Peru has an amazingly diverse avifauna. with new species discovered nearly every year in its Andean cloud forests and Amazonian lowlands. The geography of the country is spectacular. encompassing an astonishing variety of habitats. ranging from coastal deserts to vast expanses of tropical rainforest. Between these extremes are dry forests. high-elevation grasslands. and cloud forests of indescribable beauty. In this publication we list 1678 species of birds recorded in Peru as of 31 December 1980. and give some indication of their elevational distribution. relative abundance. and habitat preference. We also briefly describe and illustrate the life zones and major habitats of the country. A section on bird-finding is included as an introduction to some of the better and more accessible areas for birdwatching in the country. At the end we provide a useful list of references and indexes to both the common names and the genera of species included in the list. Until recently the lack of good field guides discouraged many birdwatchers from travelling to most South American countries. Though there is still no comprehensive book on Peruvian birds. several excellent guides for other countries are very helpful in Peru. The best of these is A Guide to the Birds of Venezuela (Meyer de Schauensee and Phelps 1978). which is especially useful for identifying humid montane and lowland forest birds in Peru. The Birds of the Department of Lima (Koepcke 1970) and The Birds of Chile and Adjacent Regions of Argentina.

Accurate diagnosis depends on low intraspecific variation compared with that between species. such that a short DNA sequence will allow precise allocation of an individual to a described taxon. The extensive literature on mtDNA phylogeography (Avise 2000) indicates that this condition often holds. although there are exceptions. Furthermore. within many species there is sufficient structure that it will be possible to allocate an individual to a particular geographic population. Such identifications should be accompanied by a statement of confidence—eg. node support in a phylogenetic analysis and caveats in relation to the breath of sampling in the reference database (eg. whale forensics; Palumbi and Cipriano 1998).DNA-led species discovery is more contentious. but again is not new. In animals. inclusion of mtDNA evidence in biogeographic and systematic analyses often reveals unexpected diversity or discordance with morphology. which then prompts re-evaluation of morphological and ecological characteristics and. if warranted. taxonomic revision. But. despite recent proposals (Wiens and Penkrot 2002; Hebert et al. 2004). it does not follow that mtDNA divergence should be a primary criterion for recognizing species boundaries (see also Sites and Marshall 2003). Potential limitations of using mtDNA to infer species boundaries include retention of ancestral polymorphism. male-biased gene flow. selection on any mtDNA nucleotide (as the whole genome is one linkage group). introgression following hybridization. and paralogy resulting from transfer of …,True,VAsQSJYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1137,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020354,3055287014525202414,/scholar?cites=3055287014525202414,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020354,0,0,0

Recently. Klicka and Zink (1997) and Avise and Walker (1998) enlivened this debate by using calibrated molecular distance values to estimate timing of speciations. Here we use new molecular studies to test their conclusions. Molecular distance values for 39 pairs of proven sister species. 27 of which are based on new data. alter the currently perceived pattern that avian species splits occurred mainly in the Pliocene and early‐mid‐Pleistocene. Mitochondrial DNA divergence values for this set of taxa showed a skewed distribution pointing toward relatively young speciation times. in contrast to the pattern presented by Klicka and Zink (1997) for 35 sister plus non‐sister species pairs.

No existing theory has explained the evolutionary background that led to these differences. Here we propose that great phenotypic similarity among some groups of sibling species limits their coexistence and that clues to their radiation can be seen in patterns of geographical occurrence. To illustrate our thesis we focused on the New World flycatcher genus Empidonax. a group of 15 species notorious for their great phenotypic similarity. Using 3069 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA from four genes. we produced a complete molecular phylogeny that identified four clades. three of which represent close relatives.

Therefore. understanding processes that limit sympatry between species in such areas provides an important framework for testing biogeographic and evolutionary hypotheses. Theoretical and empirical work has shown that the evolution of species borders is influenced by a complexity of factors. including gene flow from central to peripheral populations and the ability of species to adapt locally to environmental conditions. However. few studies have used bioclimatic models. combined with molecular and morphological data. to predict geographic range limits in the context of gene flow across a secondary contact zone.

1146700,On the origin of species through heteropatric differentiation: a review and a model of speciation in migratory animals,2010,Kevin Winker,,,69,,Univ of California Press,"Differentiation and speciation without extended isolation appear to be common among migratory animals. Historical oversight of this is probably due to temporal distortion in distribution maps and a tendency to consider that lineages had different historical traits. such as being sedentary or much less mobile. Mobility among cyclic migrants makes population isolation difficult. and diminished levels of intraspecific differentiation occur in avian migrants (I term this"" Montgomery's rule""). Nevertheless. many lineages have differentiated despite increased mobility and a high propensity for gene flow. conditions that speciation theory has not addressed adequately. Populations of seasonal migrants usually occur in allopatry and sympatry during a migratory cycle. and this distributional pattern (heteropatry) is the focus of a model empirically developed to explain differentiation in migratory lineages. Divergence arises through disruptive selection from resource competition and heterogeneously distributed cyclic resources. Heteropatric speciation is a type of ecological speciation in which reproductive isolation increases between populations as a byproduct of adaptation to different environments that enhances breeding allopatry and allochrony despite degrees of sympatry that occur during the nonbreeding period in migration cycles. Mating or pair bonding in nonbreeding areas is rare. Patterns such as leapfrog migration and limited morphological divergence suggest that differentiation is driven by these ecological factors rather than by sexual selection or nontemporal changes in the resource base itself. although the additional presence of either of the latter …",True,VAsQSJYAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC,70,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=naswDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:BuCxpf7EBqkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=GAD8pT0Oo3&sig=AUoAVcNJLZQq8p-y-ubrVFPNswc,12179638840250720262,/scholar?cites=12179638840250720262,,,0,0,0

Here. we combine modelling of palaeo‐distributions and mitochondrial‐DNA phylogeographies to compare spatial patterns of population persistence and isolation across three species of rainforest skinks (Saproscincus spp.) with varying climatic preferences. Using Akaike Information Criterion model‐averaged projections. all three species are predicted to have maintained one or more small populations in the northern Wet Tropics. multiple or larger populations in the central region. and few if any in the south.

However. as biodiversity continues to decline. the effectiveness of PAs in reducing the extinction risk of species remains largely untested. We analyzed PA coverage and trends in species' extinction risk at globally significant sites for conserving birds (10.993 Important Bird Areas. IBAs) and highly threatened vertebrates and conifers (588 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites. AZEs) (referred to collectively hereafter as ‘important sites’). Species occurring in important sites with greater PA coverage experienced smaller increases in extinction risk over recent decades: the increase was half as large for bird species with>50% of the IBAs at which they occur completely covered by PAs. and a third lower for birds. mammals and amphibians restricted to protected AZEs (compared with unprotected or partially protected sites). Globally. half of the important sites for biodiversity conservation remain unprotected (49% of IBAs. 51% of AZEs). While PA coverage of important sites has increased over time. the proportion of PA area covering important sites. as opposed to less important land. has declined (by 0.45–1.14% annually since 1950 for IBAs and 0.79–1.49% annually for AZEs).

To determine whether similar cues reveal group quality in more complex social systems. we examined the relationship between territory size. song structure and heterozygosity in the subdesert mesite (Monias benschi). a group–living bird endemic to Madagascar. Using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. we found that heterozygosity predicted both the size of territories and the structure of songs used to defend them: more heterozygous groups had larger territories. and more heterozygous males used longer. lower–pitched trills in their songs. Heterozygosity was linked to territory size and song structure in males. but not in females. implying that these traits are sexually selected by female choice and/or male–male competition.

We show that patterns of species and subspecies richness are best predicted by a suite of avian specialisms common in tropical avifaunas but rare in the temperate zone. However. this only applied to niche traits associated with dispersal limitation rather than vagility. These findings are consistent with the view that diversity is promoted by more finely partitioned niches. although not simply by coevolutionary adaptation and niche packing as is often assumed.

Divergence in sympatry strengthens reproductive isolation. and divergence in allopatry can reduce or eliminate gene flow between populations on secondary contact. In birds. the first of these processes has empirical support. but the second remains largely hypothetical. This is perhaps because most studies have focused on oscine passerines. whose song learning ability may reduce the influence of vocalizations in reproductive isolation. In suboscine passerines. the role of learning in song development is thought to be minimal. and the resultant signals are relatively fixed. To investigate the role of song in the early stages of peripatric speciation. we therefore studied a suboscine. the chestnut-tailed antbird Myrmeciza hemimelaena.

They face the twin challenges of discriminating between species to identify conspecific mates. and between individuals to recognize collaborators and competitors. It is therefore often assumed that long-distance signals are under strong selection for species-specificity and individual distinctiveness. and that this will drive character displacement when closely related species meet. particularly in noisy environments. However. the occurrence of signal stereotypy and convergence in rainforest species seems to contradict these ideas. and raises the question of whether receivers in these systems can recognize species or individuals by long-distance signals alone.

The popular consensus is that female ornaments are subject to the same modes of sexual selection as males: intrasexual competition and mate choice. However. it remains unclear how these forces interact within and between sexes. or whether they fully capture selection on female traits. One possibility is that the ‘armament–ornament’ model – which proposes that traits used primarily in male‐male contests are also co‐opted by females as indicators of male quality – can be extended to explain signal evolution in both sexes. We examine this idea by testing the function of acoustic signals in two species of duetting antbirds.

The consensus is that we now need an agriculture that can “multi-functionally” increase food production while simultaneously enhancing social and environmental goals. as committed to in the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Farming also needs to become more resilient to multiple insecurities including climate change. soil degradation. and market unpredictability. all of which reduce sustainability and are likely to exacerbate hunger.

The two main explanations for this temporal precision are: (1) it evolves as a cooperative signal of coalition quality [5] or (2) it minimizes signal jamming (i.e.. interference of one signal by another) [6]. However. support for the first hypothesis is inconclusive. and the role of jamming in communal signaling strategies remains unknown. Here. we use playback experiments to examine how social context influences the structure of duets in a pair-living antbird (Hypocnemis peruviana). The results show that. although resident pairs produced coordinated duets when responding to rival pairs. conflicts of interest caused duet coordination to break down.

Wood white butterflies of the genus Leptidea are excellent models to study the role of chromosome rearrangements in speciation because they show karyotype variability not only among but also within species. In this work. we investigated genome architecture of three cryptic Leptidea species (L. juvernica. L. sinapis and L. reali) by standard and molecular cytogenetic techniques in order to reveal causes of the karyotype variability. Chromosome numbers ranged from 2n = 85 to 91 in L. juvernica and 2n = 69 to 73 in L. sinapis (both from Czech populations) to 2n = 51 to 55 in L. reali (Spanish population). We observed significant differences in chromosome numbers and localization of cytogenetic markers (rDNA and H3 histone genes) within the offspring of individual females. Using FISH with the (TTAGG)                     n                    telomeric probe we also documented the presence of multiple chromosome fusions and/or fissions and other complex rearrangements.

The use of turnover indices. such as the Simpson index (βsimp). may lead to the loss of important information represented by the nestedness component (βnest).

These continua quantify and summarize life‐history variation at the inter‐specific level in multi‐specific assemblages. Here we examine whether trait continua can provide a useful framework to link life‐history variation with demographic and evolutionary processes in species richness gradients. Taking an altitudinal species richness gradient for Mediterranean butterflies as a study case. we examined a suite of traits (larval diet breadth. adult phenology. dispersal capacity and wing length) and species‐specific habitat measures (temperature and aridity breadth). We tested whether traits and species‐specific habitat measures tend to co‐vary. whether they are phylogenetically conserved. and whether they are able to explain species distributions and spatial genetic variation in a large number of butterfly …,True,8OvQCSkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,42,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2012.00762.x,16383411835290696955,/scholar?cites=16383411835290696955,,http://biologiaevolutiva.org/rvila/Lab/Publications_files/2013_Carnicer%20et%20al_Adaptive%20trait%20continuum_1.pdf,0,0,0

The reconciliation between mitochondrial and nuclear data in the Insecta class phylogeny,2011,Gerard Talavera and Roger Vila,11,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,1-15,BioMed Central,Efforts to solve higher-level evolutionary relationships within the class Insecta by using mitochondrial genomic data are hindered due to fast sequence evolution of several groups. most notably Hymenoptera. Strepsiptera. Phthiraptera. Hemiptera and Thysanoptera. Accelerated rates of substitution on their sequences have been shown to have negative consequences in phylogenetic inference. In this study. we tested several methodological approaches to recover phylogenetic signal from whole mitochondrial genomes. As a model. we used two classical problems in insect phylogenetics: The relationships within Paraneoptera and within Holometabola. Moreover. we assessed the mitochondrial phylogenetic signal limits in the deeper Eumetabola dataset. and we studied the contribution of individual genes. Long-branch attraction (LBA) artefacts were detected in all the datasets. Methods using Bayesian inference outperformed maximum likelihood approaches. and LBA was avoided in Paraneoptera and Holometabola when using protein sequences and the site-heterogeneous mixture model CAT. The better performance of this method was evidenced by resulting topologies matching generally accepted hypotheses based on nuclear and/or morphological data. and was confirmed by cross-validation and simulation analyses. Using the CAT model. the order Strepsiptera was recovered as sister to Coleoptera for the first time using mitochondrial sequences. in agreement with recent results based on large nuclear and morphological datasets.

These differences could have evolved through multiple speciation events. each involving the fixation of a single chromosomal rearrangement. Alternatively. marked changes in the karyotype may be the consequence of within-species accumulation of multiple chromosomal fissions/fusions. resulting in highly polymorphic systems with the subsequent extinction of intermediate karyomorphs. Although this mechanism of chromosome number evolution is possible in theory. it has not been well documented.

Here we reconstruct the phylogeny of the group using multi-locus coalescent-based methods on seven independent genetic markers. While the genus is ca. 4.9 Mya old. the diversification of the extant lineages was extremely recent (ca. 1.5 Mya) and involved multiple chromosomal rearrangements. We find that relationships are uncertain due to both incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization.

The majority of lycaenids have associations with ants that can be facultative or obligate and range from mutualism to parasitism. Lycaenid larvae and pupae employ complex chemical and acoustical signals to manipulate ants. Cost/benefit analyses have demonstrated multiple trade-offs involved in myrmecophily. Both demographic and phylogenetic evidence indicate that ant association has shaped the evolution of obligately associated groups. Parasitism typically arises from mutualism with ants. and entomophagous species are disproportionately common in the Lycaenidae compared with other Lepidoptera.

However. empirical data illustrating local people’s awareness of the importance of nature’s services is limited; hence possibly impeding effective ecosystem (environmental)-services based conservation efforts. Using data from five protected forests in four developing Southeast Asian countries. we provide evidence that local people living near parks value a wide range of environmental services. including cultural. provisioning. and regulating services. provided by the forests. Local people with longer residency valued environmental services more. Educated as well as poor people valued forest ecosystem services more.

But despite their significance. we lack an understanding of their evolutionary histories. To describe the evolution of symbioses between Wolbachia and their hosts. we surveyed global collections of two diverse families of insects. the ants and lycaenid butterflies. In total. 54 Wolbachia isolates were typed using a Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) approach. in which five unlinked loci were sequenced and analyzed to decipher evolutionary patterns. AMOVA and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that related Wolbachia commonly infect related hosts. revealing a pattern of host association that was strongest among strains from the ants. A review of the literature indicated that horizontal transfer is most successful when Wolbachia move between related hosts. suggesting that patterns of host association are driven by …,True,njG9diQAAAAJ:BqipwSGYUEgC,146,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00579.x,10496409913070568771,/scholar?cites=10496409913070568771,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00579.x,0,0,0

(1) The theory of games with asymmetrical information shows that the right incentives allow hosts to screen‐out parasites and screen‐in mutualists. explaining successful partner choice in the absence of signalling. Applications range from ant‐plants to microbiomes. (2) Contract theory distinguishes two longstanding but weakly differentiated explanations of host response to defectors: host sanctions and partner fidelity feedback. Host traits that selectively punish misbehaving symbionts are parsimoniously interpreted as pre‐adaptations.

However. the evolutionary processes that gave rise to these associations remain poorly understood. We reconstructed the times of divergence. diversification patterns. and interaction networks of a diverse group of specialized orchids and their bee pollinators. In contrast to a scenario of coevolution by race formation. we show that fragrance-producing orchids originated at least three times independently after their fragrance-collecting bee mutualists. Whereas orchid diversification has apparently tracked the diversification of orchids’ bee pollinators. bees appear to have depended on the diverse chemical environment of neotropical forests. We corroborated this apparent asymmetrical dependency by simulating co-extinction cascades in real interaction networks that lacked reciprocal specialization.

We suggest that the ways in which these homeostatic fortress environments affect the evolution of social insect symbionts are relevant for epidemiology. evolutionary biology and macroecology. We contend that specialized parasites will tend to become less virulent and mutualists less cooperative. compared to those associated with solitary or small-colony hosts. These processes are expected to contribute to the very high symbiont diversity observed in these nests. We hypothesize that biodiversity gradients in these hotspots might be less affected by abiotic latitudinal clines than gradients in neighboring ‘control’ habitats.

Workers of the ant Formica altipetens Wheeler harvest these secretions and in return protect the larvae against attacks by small larval parasitoids. We now demonstrate that attendant ants protect larvae of G. lygdamus against different kinds of parasitoids. including those that emerge from the pupae. (2) Larvae whose ants have been experimentally excluded are far more likely to disappear from host plants than larvae with ants. simply because larvae drop off plants without ants. (3) Taking into account parasitism. predation and drop-off. a cohort of ant tended larvae is four to twelve times more likely to survive to pupation than a similar group of untended larvae. Most of this difference in survivorship occurs during the final two larval instars.

However. little evidence exists on the role of karyotypic change in speciation itself—in the establishment of reproductive barriers between previously interbreeding populations. The large genus Agrodiaetus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) provides a model system to study this question. Agrodiaetus butterflies exhibit unusual interspecific diversity in chromosome number. from n= 10 to n= 134; in contrast. the majority of lycaenid butterflies have n= 23/24. We analyzed the evolution of karyotypic diversity by mapping chromosome numbers on a thoroughly sampled mitochondrial phylogeny of the genus. Karyotypic differences accumulate gradually between allopatric sister taxa. but more rapidly between sympatric sister taxa.

Advances in methods of data generation and analysis have led to the accumulation of large amounts of DNA sequence data from most major insect groups. In addition to reviewing theoretical and methodological advances. we have compiled information on the taxa and regions sequenced from all available phylogenetic studies of insects. It is evident that investigators have not usually coordinated their efforts. The genes and regions that have been sequenced differ substantially among studies and the whole of our efforts is thus little greater than the sum of its parts. The cytochrome oxidase I. 16S. 18S. and elongation factor-1α genes have been widely used and are informative across a broad range of divergences in insects. We advocate their use as standards for insect phylogenetics.

Here. we describe a molecular method for rapid identification of these insects. Specific insect DNA fragments were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). followed by direct DNA sequencing of the amplification products. We sequenced 2300 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA from each of three blowfly species: Phormia regina. Phaenicia sericata and Lucilia illustris. All three species are important in forensic entomology. We found 118 nucleotide differences between the L. illustris and P. sericata sequences. 186 between L. illustris and P. regina. and 192 between P. sericata and P. regina. Based on these abundant DNA sequence differences. we can unambiguously identify the immature larval stages of these insects.

Such lack of resolution is a substantial impediment to using the otherwise well studied butterflies as a model group in biology. Here we report the results of a combined analysis of DNA sequences from three genes and a morphological data matrix for 57 taxa (3258 characters. 1290 parsimony informative) representing all major lineages from the three putative butterfly super-families (Hedyloidea. Hesperioidea and Papilionoidea). plus out-groups representing other ditrysian Lepidoptera families. Recently. the utility of morphological data as a source of phylogenetic evidence has been debated.

However. phylogenetic work on relationships among major lineages in the genus has been limited and inconclusive.

DNA barcoding has generated a substantial proportion of this debate. with its proposition that a single mitochondrial sequence will consistently identify and delimit species. replacing more evidence‐rich and time‐intensive methods. Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has since been the focus of voluminous discussion and case studies. little effort has been made to comprehensively evaluate its success in delimiting closely related species. We have conducted the first broadly comparative literature review addressing the efficacy of molecular markers for delimiting such species over a broad taxonomic range. By considering only closely related species. we sought to avoid confusion of success rates with those due to deeply divergent taxa.

1147268,Sex-linked genes and species differences in Lepidoptera,1994,Felix AH Sperling,,,,,,I review reports on the genetic basis for species differences in the Lepidoptera. In the six best-studied species complexes. more than half of all ecological. behavioral. or physiological differences among species are controlled by X-linked genes. Because Lepidoptera have about 30 pairs of chromosomes. this finding clearly indicates strong bias toward X-linkage of genes for species differences. The proportion of X-linked species differences ranges from complete X-linkage in Colias butterflies. to almost none in Yponomeuta moths. Four other complexes all have at least one X-linked gene that is crucial to species differences. including the Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens. Papilio glaucus L.. and Papilio machaon L. species groups. and Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner pheromone strains. The mechanisms that account for this phenomenon are open to speculation. Nonetheless. an interesting implication of disproportionate X-linkage is that reproductive isolation may frequently arise by selection on linkage complexes. rather than as a random byproduct of evolution in geographically isolated populations. If confirmed. the bias toward X-linked species differences may also help efforts to find characters that distinguish host races and sibling species. as well as provide an avenue by which genes crucial to speciation can be more easily mapped and characterized at the molecular level.,True,W5FvZ84AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,138,https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/30067c34-3180-427d-83d0-c381a799a8fe,5735662999659869106,/scholar?cites=5735662999659869106,,https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/30067c34-3180-427d-83d0-c381a799a8fe/view/63daa423-8e06-4fec-8cb9-04e4f4143924/CE_126_1994_807.pdf,0,0,0

IL. USA,Butterfly systematics is experiencing a renaissance. Its renewed vigor is due to the widespread realization that robust phylogenies and objective species delimitations are crucial for comparative investigations in biology and conservation. as well as to the recent development of easily applied techniques for assaying DNA sequences and other molecular variation (Hillis et al. 1996). Molecular techniques have allowed a surge in systematic investigations ranging in scope from surveys of gene flow among intraspecific populations to examinations of deep phylogenetic divergences (eg Brower 1994b; Sperling and Harrison 1994; Weller et al. 1995).However. the advantages of molecular investigations may also be a source of fundamental problems. A student can usually produce reliable molecular datasets in a matter of months. whereas it often takes years to train a researcher who is proficient at morphological character analysis. On the other hand. the ease of producing sequence data has produced an ever-growing patchwork that is difficult to compare meaningfully among studies. Furthermore. proper sampling and analysis of molecular data is not straightforward. and neglect of these issues can seriously limit the value of studies. The purpose of this chapter is to evaluate the use of genetic markers in butterfly systematics. both with respect to species level problems and higher level relationships. Specifically. I ask two questions: 1) Are some kinds of genetic markers particularly effective in delineating butterfly species boundaries?. and 2) What DNA sequence regions are most useful for higher level phylogenies in butterflies?

The phylogeny was reconstructed using equally weighted and weighted parsimony. In both analyses. peripheral clades were well supported while internal clades were poorly supported. Phylogenetic analysis of translated amino acids produced a poorly resolved tree that was discordant with trees reconstructed with nucleotide sequence data. Two main conclusions are drawn about the monophyly of Ips and traditional systematic groups within Ips. First. Ips is monophyletic only when I. mannsfeldi. I. nobilis. and the concinnus and latidens species groups are excluded. The latidens group.

Inc.,Nest and offspring defence by birds can be treated as an optimization problem wherein fitness benefits are determined by the survival of the current brood and fitness costs depend upon the probability that the parent will survive to breed again. At the optimal intensity of defence. net fitness benefits are maximized. Unlike many other aspects of animal behavior. the reproductive consequences of nest defence can often be measured directly. Within this optimality framework. we review the current adaptive hypotheses to explain both interspecific and intraspecific variation in nest defence behavior. and we present some new ideas of our own.

However. a growing body of evidence suggests that selection tends to operate in different ways in males and females. with female traits more often mediating competition for ecological resources. rather than mate acquisition. Two main solutions have been proposed to accommodate this disparity. One is to expand the concept of sexual selection to include all mechanisms related to fecundity; another is to adopt an alternative conceptual framework—the theory of social selection—in which sexual selection is one component of a more general form of selection resulting from all social interactions.

In this analysis of mortality patterns across 28 North American passerine bird species. we show that sex-biased mortality (log10 male mortality – log10 female mortality) is positively correlated with both sexual size dimorphism and male plumage brightness. Male (but not female) mortality is positively correlated with sexual size dimorphism. suggesting a cost to male–male competition. Female (but not male) mortality is negatively correlated with male brightness. and we argue from this that the evolution of male brightness has been constrained by mortality costs.

Unlike other integumentary pigments. carotenoids cannot be synthesized; they must be ingested.

A controversial hypothesis is that the expression of carotenoid–based coloration in wild vertebrates is also affected by the amount and types of carotenoid pigments that are ingested.

Instead. we found a positive correlation between sperm length and the length of female sperm storage tubules (SSTS) and a negative correlation between sperm length and the number of SSTS. Both of these correlations suggest that the more than fivefold variation in sperm size we found among species can be explained by sperm competition for access to storage sites (SSTS) in females.

Thus. social interactions in both sexual and non-sexual contexts can have a powerful influence on the evolution of traits that would otherwise appear to be detrimental to survival. Although clearly outlined by West-Eberhard in the early 1980s. the idea that social selection is a comprehensive framework for the study of ornaments and weapons has largely been ignored. In West-Eberhard's view. sexual selection is a form of social selection—a concept supported by several lines of evidence.

Since it has been suggested that swimming velocity increases with sperm length. earlier studies proposed longer (and therefore faster) sperm are advantageous under conditions of intense sperm competition. Nonetheless. previous work has been equivocal. perhaps because the intensity of sperm competition was measured indirectly. DNA profiling now provides a more direct measure of the number of offspring sired by extrapair males. and thus a more direct method of assessing the potential for sperm competition. Using a sample of 21 species of passerine birds for which DNA profiling data were available. we found a positive relation between sperm length and the degree of extrapair paternity.

Theoretical models predict that. in external fertilizers. increased risk of sperm competition should result in selection for increased sperm swimming speed. To test this prediction. we studied the behavior of sperm from parental and sneaker male bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). a fish species characterized by high levels of cuckoldry due to alternative reproductive tactics of males (parentals and cuckolders).

1147296,Nestling American robins compete with siblings by begging,1991,Henrik G Smith and Robert Montgomerie,29,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,4,307-312,Springer-Verlag,The evolution of intense begging by dependent nestling birds has recently been the subject of several theoretical papers. The interesting problem here is that nestlings should be able to communicate their nutritional status to parents in ways that are less costly energetically and less likely to attract predators. Thus. conspicuous begging behaviour is thought to have evolved as a result of either competition among nestmates or the manipulation of their parents to provide more food than would otherwise be favoured by selection. We studied sibling competition for parental feedings in the American robin (Turdus migratorius). We demonstrate that the probability that an individual nestling received food was related to several indices of begging. When we experimentally prevented parents from feeding part of their brood. both the intensity of begging and the number of feedings subsequently received by food …,True,k_iWCZgAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,197,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00163989,15883984171717170330,/scholar?cites=15883984171717170330,,,0,0,0

1147298,American robin nestlings compete by jockeying for position,1993,Susan B McRae and Patrick J Weatherhead and Robert Montgomerie,33,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,2,101-106,Springer-Verlag,We investigated whether nestling American robins (Turdus migratorius) were capable of influencing food distribution in their nests by perceiving that certain sectors of the nest received a relatively high proportion of feedings and positioning themselves accordingly. Feeding observations were obtained from videotape recordings taken at different stages of the nestling period. Parents generally arrived at a predictable location on the nest rim and allocated proportionally more food to nestlings in the central position. The degree of nestling movement was significantly positively correlated with variation in the predictability of parental arrival locations on the nest rim. Furthermore. nestlings moved more in broods suffering brood reduction. This suggests that when competition for food is intense and the location of parental arrival is predictable. nestlings respond by jockeying for access to the most favorable (i.e …,True,k_iWCZgAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C,155,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00171661,14791719155939546813,/scholar?cites=14791719155939546813,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susan_Mcrae2/publication/226158355_American_robin_nestlings_compete_by_jockeying_for_position/links/02e7e5345fc499f6cf000000/American-robin-nestlings-compete-by-jockeying-for-position.pdf,0,0,0

We removed males from 7 females at the start of incubation (Early Widows) and from 7 others when the eggs hatched (Late Widows) to experimentally assess the effects of incubation feeding on the behaviour of females and the reproductive success of both parents. Early Widows spent significantly more time off their nests than Late Widows and Controls. As a consequence. Early Widows had significantly longer incubation periods and a significantly higher proportion of them lost two or more eggs during development.

Development. and the removal of large. mature timber and snags (dead trees) for commercial purposes. exacerbate these shortages. The problem is most acute for secondary cavity-nesting birds. which rely on primary cavity excavators (mainly woodpeckers). physical damage (from storms). or natural tree rot to produce cavities of sufficient size and quality.A review of the North American Blue List. the European EEC Directive Annex I list. and the Red Data Book list indicates that at least 25 species of primary cavity-nesting birds and 38 species of secondary cavity-nesters currently are or have recently been of conservation concern (table 12-1). An additional 57 species listed in the Red Data Book probably are secondary cavity-nesters. but we were unable to confirm this. Thus 63-120 species of known or assumed cavity-nesting birds have declined sufficiently to warrant national and international concern. At least two of these species. and possibly four. are already extinct. Loss of nesting habitat is not the only threat to cavity-nesting species.

USA. has restricted traditional open‐field burning of rice straw residues. leading farmers to adopt alternative methods of straw disposal such as post‐harvest flooding of rice fields. These changes may benefit wildlife because winter‐flooded fallow rice fields provide foraging habitat to migratory waterfowl. In turn. the foraging activity of waterfowl may help to increase rice straw decomposition. providing a reciprocal benefit to farmers. We examined the effects of waterfowl foraging activity on straw decomposition and nitrogen mineralization following rice harvest in a fallow flooded soil. 2.  Experimental plots (25 m2) were established on a silty clay soil and were subjected to two post‐harvest treatments: wet‐rolled or untilled.

Nests were visited from mid-June to mid-July when most nesting females either had hatched their clutches or were finishing incubation. Females often visited more than one nest site and each nest site could be visited by several birds. Observations of marked individuals and body measurements of trapped birds show that most visiting females were either yearlings or failed breeders.

Our results show that parasitism can be maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. which is consistent with recent speculations. However. when we include the effects of density dependence. we find a density threshold below which frequency-dependent effects on fitness are negligible but above which frequency dependence plays a prominent role. Patterns consistent with either a mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) or a conditional ESS can therefore be obtained simply by varying population density. These results may provide an explanation for contradictory patterns found in a previous field study of brood parasitism in goldeneyes.

Instead they study a species that substitutes for the one of concern in the hope that it will cast light on the conservation problem. Here we outline the assumptions underlying this approach. Substitutes can be different populations or species and may be chosen because they are similar biologically to the target or representatives of a constellation of species of which the target is one. They also may be used to develop a predictive model to which the conservation target can be related.

1147321,Alternative reproductive tactics in a precocial bird: the ecology and evolution of brood parasitism in goldeneyes,1989,John McAllister Eadie,,,,,,Description Facultative brood parasitism is common among waterfowl (Anatidae). but we have limited understanding of the ecological or evolutionary basis for this behaviour. I studied facultative brood parasitism in two species of cavity-nesting ducks. the Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica) and the common goldeneye (B. clangula). During a four year study in central British Columbia. I used field experiments. observational studies of marked individuals. and simulation models to (i) examine the consequences of brood parasitism to hosts. and (ii) identify the factors that promote and maintain parasitic behaviour. In order to assess the costs and benefits of brood parasitic behaviour. I first examined proximate influences on reproductive performance of goldeneye females. Variance in reproductive success among females was substantial and some females were consistently more successful than others. Reproductive success was also influenced by breeding experience. time of breeding. and by the availability and quality of nest-sites. Circumstantial evidence suggests that females compete exploitatively and aggressively for nest-sites and brood territories. I argue that such conditions favour the evolution of parasitic reproductive behaviours. Parasitic egg-laying occurred frequently during the four years of this study; 35% of all nests were parasitized. while 17% of all eggs were parasitic. Parasitism had few deleterious effects on the reproductive success of hosts. On average. parasitized females produced as many of their own young as non-parasitized females. and there was no effect of parasitism on female survival or on the growth and survival of …,True,juQDcN0AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,82,https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/831/831/items/1.0098189,2958172589535840779,/scholar?cites=2958172589535840779,,https://open.library.ubc.ca/collections/831/831/items/1.0098189,0,0,0

Gulf Coast. and Central California. Residual rice. weed seeds. and invertebrates provide food for many avian species during fall and winter. In North America. considerable information exists on the use of ricefields by wintering waterbirds. the value of ricelands as breeding habitat for birds. and the effects of organic chemicals on birds that-feed in ricefields. Recent research has also examined the influence of field management practices. such as winter flooding and post-harvest straw manipulation. on the suitability of ricefields for wildlife. Whereas early studies focused on detrimental effects of wildlife on rice production (eg. crop depredation). it has become apparent that waterbirds may benefit producers by enhancing straw decomposition. reducing weed and pest pressure. and providing additional income through hunting and wildlife viewing opportunities. A comprehensive evaluation of agronomic and environmental issues is needed to meet the challenges of producing food and sustaining wildlife in twenty-first-century rice lands.

1147326,Mode of development and interspecific avian brood parasitism,1991,Bruce E Lyon and John M Eadie,2,Behavioral Ecology,4,309-318,Oxford University Press,Avian interspecific brood parasites differ considerably in their commitment to parasitism; 87 species are obligate brood parasites. whereas 35 species are known to be facultative brood parasites. This variation is strongly related to mode of development. Obligate parasitism is found almost exclusively in altricial species. whereas facultative interspecific parasitism is predominant in precocial birds. We propose that the association between mode of development and form of parasitism reflects a fundamental difference between altricial and precocial birds in the relative benefits of emancipation from parental care after laying. We argue that altricial brood parasites obtain such a large increase in realized fecundity by avoiding the costs of parental care that obligate parasitism is favored over facultative parasitism.

The structure of dominance relations has often been measured using indices of linearity (e.g. Landau’s h. Kendall’s K): the degree to which dominance relations adhere to a linear hierarchy. An alternative measure is the transitivity of dominance relations among sets of three players that all interact with each other. a measure we call triangle transitivity (ttri). Triangle transitivity and linearity are essentially equivalent when dominance relations of all dyads are known. but such complete observations are rare in empirical studies.

We analysed networks of co‐membership in short‐term flocks for wintering golden‐crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia atricapilla) across three years and discovered social complexity unsuspected for migratory songbirds. The population was consistently clustered into distinct social communities within a relatively small area (~ 7 ha). Birds returned to the same community across years. with mortality and recruitment leading to some degree of turnover in membership.

1147336,Comparative transitive and temporal orderliness in dominance networks,2013,David B McDonald and Daizaburo Shizuka,24,Behavioral Ecology,2,511-520,Oxford University Press,Dominance is a social relation between a subordinate animal and the dominant to which it submits. Animal groups seem regularly to form dominance hierarchies in which dominance relations are transitive and stable. but comparative studies are rare. Dominance hierarchies can be formalized as social networks. with arrows (directed edges) pointing from dominant animals (nodes) to subordinates. Using this network perspective. we explored the orderliness of 40 published datasets for taxa from ants to elephants. To quantify orderliness. we used the triad census. a technique from sociology. that enumerates the proportion of orderly (transitive) triads (e.g.. A dominates B and C. B dominates C. yielding clear top. middle. and bottom rankings) versus disorderly (cyclic) triads (e.g.. A dominates B. B dominates C. but C in turn dominates A).

We applied network motif analysis to compare the structures of dominance networks from data published over the past 80 years. Overall patterns of dominance relations. including some aspects of non-interactions. were strikingly similar across disparate group types. For example. nearly all groups exhibited high frequencies of transitive triads. whereas cycles were very rare. Moreover. pass-along triads were rare. and double-dominant triads were common in most groups.

1147356,Introductory whistle is sufficient for early song recognition by golden-crowned sparrow nestlings,2017,Emily J Hudson and Daizaburo Shizuka,133,Animal Behaviour,,83-88,Academic Press,Many songbird species have a predisposition to learn conspecific songs. suggesting song learning may be guided by an innate auditory template. Evidence for such a template includes preferential response to conspecific song in early life. even before song learning begins. A prime example of an innate cue for selective song learning is the introductory whistle of white-crowned sparrows. Zonotrichia leucophrys. The songs of its sister species. the golden-crowned sparrow. Zonotrichia atricapilla. also contain an introductory whistle. which differs in structure from that of white-crowned sparrows.

Accordingly. selection should favor the evolution of strategies that enhance the reliability of information used in learning and decision making. For example. hosts of avian brood parasites should be selected to increase the reliability of the information they use to learn to recognize their own eggs and chicks [1. 2. 3]. The American coot (Fulica americana). a conspecific brood parasite. uses cues learned from the first-hatched chicks of each brood to recognize and reject parasitic chicks [3]. However. if parasitic eggs are among the first to hatch. recognition cues are confounded and parents then fail to distinguish parasitic chicks from their own chicks. Therefore. hosts could ensure correct chick recognition by delaying parasitic eggs from hatching until after the first host eggs.

Temporal variation in female choice could dampen sexual selection. but scant information exists on the degree to which individual female preferences are flexible. Here we show that in lark buntings sexual selection on male traits varied dramatically across years and. in some cases. exhibited reversals in the direction of selection for a single trait. We show that these shifts are probably because of flexibility in mate choice by individual females and that they parallel shifts in the male traits that predict female reproductive success in a given year.

Here we show that payoffs of cooperation depend on asymmetric costs of orange neighbors. One blue male experiences low fitness and buffers his unrelated partner from aggressive orange males despite the potential benefits of defection.

We describe how cognition can be subject to natural selection like any other biological trait and how this evolutionary approach can be used to understand the evolution of animal cognition. We recount how comparative and fitness methods have been used to understand the evolution of cognition and outline how these approaches could extend our understanding of cognition. The fitness approach. in particular. offers unprecedented opportunities to study the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for variation in cognition within species and could allow us to investigate both proximate (ie: neural and developmental) and ultimate (ie: ecological and evolutionary) underpinnings of animal cognition together. We highlight recent studies that have successfully shown that cognitive traits can be under selection. in particular by linking individual variation in cognition to fitness.

High dispersal rates reduce group stability and kin cohesion. so it is generally assumed that there is a fundamental trade-off between cooperation and dispersal. However. empirical tests of this relationship are rare. We tested this assumption experimentally using ten genetically isolated strains of a ciliate. Tetrahymena thermophila. The propensity for social aggregation was greater in strains with reduced cell quality and lower growth performance. While we found a trade-off between costly aggregation and local dispersal in phenotypic analyses. aggregative strains showed a dispersal polymorphism by producing either highly sedentary or long-distance dispersive cells. in contrast to less aggregative strains whose cells were monomorphic local dispersers. High dispersal among aggregative strains may not destroy group stability in T. thermophila because the dispersal polymorphism allows social strains to more readily escape kin groups than less aggregative strains. yet still benefit from stable group membership among sedentary morphs.

We use the California sea otter population as a case study to validate the use of archival time–depth data to detect and measure differences in foraging behaviour and diet.

After recapturing the study animals and retrieving the TDRs it was possible to compare the two data types. by matching individual dives from the TDR record with observational data and thus examining behavioural correlates of capture success and prey species.

Understanding the processes responsible is perhaps ecology’s most fundamental challenge. Kelp-forest ecosystems in southwest Alaska have undergone several phase shifts between alga- and herbivore-dominated states in recent decades. Overhunting and recovery of sea otters caused the earlier shifts. Studies focusing on these changes demonstrate the importance of top-down forcing processes. a variety of indirect food-web interactions associated with the otter-urchin-kelp trophic cascade. and the role of food-chain length in the coevolution of defense and resistance in plants and their herbivores. This system unexpectedly shifted back to an herbivore-dominated state during the 1990s. because of a sea-otter population collapse that apparently was driven by increased predation by killer whales.

This is especially important for apex predators. since they can potentially have wide dietary niches and a large impact on trophic dynamics within ecosystems. We evaluate the diet of an apex predator. the white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). by measuring the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of vertebral growth bands to create lifetime records for 15 individuals from California. Isotopic variations in white shark diets can reflect within-region differences among prey (most importantly related to trophic level). as well as differences in baseline values among the regions in which sharks forage. and both prey and habitat preferences may shift with age. The magnitude of isotopic variation among sharks in our study (>5‰ for both elements) is too great to be explained solely by geographic differences. and so must reflect differences in prey choice that may vary with sex. size. age and location. Ontogenetic patterns in δ15N values vary considerably among individuals. and one third of the population fit each of these descriptions: 1) δ15N values increased throughout life. 2) δ15N values increased to a plateau at ∼5 years of age. and 3) δ15N values remained roughly constant values throughout life. Isotopic data for the population span more than one trophic level. and we offer a qualitative evaluation of diet using shark-specific collagen discrimination factors estimated from a 3+ year captive feeding experiment (Δ13Cshark-diet and Δ15Nshark-diet equal 4.2‰ and 2.5‰. respectively).

This assessment. undertaken in response to earlier reports of precipitous declines at several islands (Estes et al. 1998). was based on archipelago-wide aerial surveys conducted in 1965. 1992. and 2000. and skiff surveys of particular islands or small island groups during various years from the early 1990s through 2000. To summarize the main findings:(1) aerial counts declined by about 70% from 1992 to 2000.(2) populations at those islands thought by Kenyon (1969) to be at or near carrying capacity in 1965 had declined 88% by 2000.(3) most of the overall decline occurred after the late 1980s or early 1990s. and (4) sea otters had reached a uniformly low population density (numbers per unit length of shoreline) throughout the Aleutian archipelago by 2000. Doroff et al.(2003) interpreted this latter finding to mean that the factors responsible for the decline were density-dependent. thus implying that a steady state may have been attained between killer whale predation. the purported cause of the decline (Estes et al. 1998). and the reduced availability of sea otters.

This hypothesis was evaluated through environmental detection of potential freshwater and marine microcystin sources. sea otter necropsy with biochemical analysis of tissues and evaluation of bioaccumulation of freshwater microcystins by marine invertebrates. Ocean discharge of freshwater microcystins was confirmed for three nutrient-impaired rivers flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. and microcystin concentrations up to 2.900 ppm (2.9 million ppb) were detected in a freshwater lake and downstream tributaries to within 1 km of the ocean.

Costa and Kooyman 1982. Yeates et al. 2007). This trait. in conjunction with their distribution and the preponderance of filter feeding benthic invertebrates in their diet. makes southern sea otters especially susceptible to naturally occurring and human-induced stressors in their environment. and as such. they are effective sentinels of the health of California’s coastal ocean (Jessup et al. 2007).

Santa Cruz,I investigated diet specialization for female southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) in a density dependent population along the Monterey Peninsula to determine if alternative foraging strategies had an effect on maternal care. reproductive success and pup ontogeny. Thirty adult female otters were weighed. tagged and instrumented with VHF radios and time depth recorders in the fall of 2006 and 2007. I evaluated the body condition of each female based on the weight/length ratio at capture. which is shown to be a significant factor in the successful weaning of pups. I collected forage data on females prior to and during the pup dependency period to establish individual diet preferences and energy intake. and to determine whether these varied with different reproductive states no pup. very small pup. small pup. and large pup. Analysis results indicated three diet specialty groups: large prey (LR-type; Cancer crab and abalone) rocky intertidal feeders; medium prey (MR-type; mussels. urchins. kelp crabs) rocky intertidal feeders; and. medium sandy substrate feeders (MS-type; clams. worms. sand dollars). Mothers' diets varied in terms of energy take. and preferred prey in a female’s diet varied depending on the pup's age. possibly reflecting trade-offs between energy acquisition and pup rearing requirements.

Some coastal areas within this range are heavily developed and highly impacted by humans. while other areas are wild and largely pristine. Determining the relative importance of food resource abundance. environmental conditions. and anthropogenic increases in pathogens and pollutants to population change in sea otters is critical to understanding limitations to population growth. To investigate the causal links between the sluggish population growth of sea otters in central California and factors that could be driving variation in survival and reproduction. we designed a study to compare two distinct subpopulations—one in an area of low human impact (Big Sur) and one in an area of high human impact (Monterey). Between 2008 and 2011. the US Geological Survey and collaborators conducted a telemetry-based study of sea otters at these two locations. The results of this study were not consistent with the hypothesis that sea otters adjacent to human population centers (Monterey) experience higher exposure to pollutants and pathogens than those in lower impacted areas (Big Sur). In fact. based on serological analysis. female sea otters from Big Sur showed higher exposure rates to Toxoplasma gondii than did female otters from Monterey. while domoic acid exposure appeared to be similar at both sites. Gene expression (specifically transcription) analysis did not indicate any consistent differences between the two populations that would have suggested a response to pathogen or toxin exposure. although there …,True,Q21wgm4AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,9,https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20191022,11697465229850525418,/scholar?cites=11697465229850525418,,,0,0,0

Series B: Biological Sciences,1550,1823-1829,The Royal Society,Recent studies of non–social animals have shown that sexually selected traits signal at least one measure of genetic quality: heterozygosity. To determine whether similar cues reveal group quality in more complex social systems. we examined the relationship between territory size. song structure and heterozygosity in the subdesert mesite (Monias benschi). a group–living bird endemic to Madagascar. Using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. we found that heterozygosity predicted both the size of territories and the structure of songs used to defend them: more heterozygous groups had larger territories. and more heterozygous males used longer. lower–pitched trills in their songs. Heterozygosity was linked to territory size and song structure in males. but not in females. implying that these traits are sexually selected by female choice and/or male–male competition.

Furthermore. an overlapping pattern of singing generally elicited responses characteristic of highly aroused males.

We show that patterns of species and subspecies richness are best predicted by a suite of avian specialisms common in tropical avifaunas but rare in the temperate zone. However. this only applied to niche traits associated with dispersal limitation rather than vagility. These findings are consistent with the view that diversity is promoted by more finely partitioned niches. although not simply by coevolutionary adaptation and niche packing as is often assumed.

Divergence in sympatry strengthens reproductive isolation. and divergence in allopatry can reduce or eliminate gene flow between populations on secondary contact. In birds. the first of these processes has empirical support. but the second remains largely hypothetical. This is perhaps because most studies have focused on oscine passerines. whose song learning ability may reduce the influence of vocalizations in reproductive isolation. In suboscine passerines. the role of learning in song development is thought to be minimal. and the resultant signals are relatively fixed. To investigate the role of song in the early stages of peripatric speciation. we therefore studied a suboscine. the chestnut-tailed antbird Myrmeciza hemimelaena.

They face the twin challenges of discriminating between species to identify conspecific mates. and between individuals to recognize collaborators and competitors. It is therefore often assumed that long-distance signals are under strong selection for species-specificity and individual distinctiveness. and that this will drive character displacement when closely related species meet. particularly in noisy environments. However. the occurrence of signal stereotypy and convergence in rainforest species seems to contradict these ideas. and raises the question of whether receivers in these systems can recognize species or individuals by long-distance signals alone.

Eavesdropping on male-male vocal interactions is a means by which females can compare different males’ singing behavior directly and make immediate comparisons between potential partners on the basis of their relative vocal performance (1. 2). Using an interactive playback experiment followed by microsatellite paternity analysis. we investigated whether female black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) base their reproductive decisions on information gained through eavesdropping. Black-capped chickadees are socially monogamous songbirds that follow a mixed reproductive strategy in which one-third of broods include young that are not related to their social father (3).

Males arriving to breed in Canada from high-quality winter habitats arrive earlier than males from poor-quality habitats. resulting in a lower probability of paternity loss. a higher probability of achieving polygyny …,True,AjTltIwAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,157,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2008.1452,1996237672686392840,/scholar?cites=1996237672686392840,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660976/,0,0,0

However. the assumption of male benefit has been little tested.

Diversification has intrigued biologists because its extent varies even among closely related lineages under similar ecological conditions. Recent research has suggested that some of this puzzling variation may be caused by stochastic differences in the history of immigration (relative timing and order of immigration by founding populations). indicating that immigration and diversification may affect community assembly interactively. However. it remains unclear under what conditions immigration history affects diversification. Here we propose the hypothesis that whether or not immigration history influences the extent of diversification depends on the founding populations’ prior evolutionary history. using evidence from a bacterial experiment. To create genotypes with different evolutionary histories. replicate populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens were allowed to adapt to a novel environment for a short or long period of time (approximately 10 or 100 bacterial generations) with or without exploiters (viral parasites). Each evolved genotype was then introduced to a new habitat either before or after a standard competitor genotype. Most genotypes diversified to a greater extent when introduced before. rather than after. the competitor. However. introduction order did not affect the extent of diversification when the evolved genotype had previously adapted to the environment for a long period of time without exploiters.

In this group. the basal‐rooted species primarily occupy the subtidal habitat. whereas the species in the most distal clades are found in the intertidal. We tested multiple evolutionary models to determine whether changes in body size and changes in number of scales are adaptive for habitat use in sculpins. Based on a statistically robust. highly resolved molecular phylogeny of 26 species of sculpins. in combination with morphometric and habitat affinity data. our analyses show that an adaptive model based on habitat use best explains changes in body size and number of scales.

Increasingly. palaeontologists are using logistic regression to quantify extinction selectivity because the selectivity metric is independent of extinction intensity and multiple predictor variables can be assessed simultaneously. We illustrate the use of logistic regression with an analysis of physiological buffering capacity and extinction risk in the Phanerozoic marine fossil record. We propose the geometric mean of extinction intensity and selectivity as a metric for the influence of extinction events. The end-Permian mass extinction had the largest influence on the physiological composition of the fauna owing to its combination of high intensity and strong selectivity.

1147527,Autotomy in porcelain crabs is an effective escape mechanism from rockfish predation,2014,Matthew L Knope and Ralph J Larson,35,Marine Ecology,4,471-477,,Porcelain crabs possess a ‘hair‐trigger’ propensity to autotomize their chelipeds (claws). and laboratory studies have demonstrated that this ability is highly effective in avoiding predation from other crabs. However. porcelain crabs are also subject to predation from fishes. which use a very different means of capture. In this study. we investigated whether autotomy in porcelain crabs is also effective against predation by fishes. To do this. we examined stomach‐contents data from four common species of kelp‐forest rockfishes and determined the frequency of disassociated chelipeds (those with no associated bodies) in porcelain crabs and in brachyuran crabs. which do not readily autotomize their chelipeds. We found that disassociated chelipeds of porcelain crabs were six times as common as those of brachyuran crabs (35% of the remains of all porcelain crabs versus 6% of the remains of all brachyuran crabs).

However. an analysis of 30.074 genera of living marine animals and 19.992 genera of fossil marine animals indicates that greater ecological differentiation in the modern oceans is actually associated with lower rates of origination over evolutionary time. Ecologically differentiated clades became taxonomically diverse over time because they were better buffered against extinction. particularly during mass extinctions. which primarily affected genus-rich. ecologically homogeneous clades. The relationship between ecological differentiation and taxonomic richness was weak early in the evolution of animals but has strengthened over geological time as successive extinction events reshaped the marine fauna.,True,4WKcrboAAAAJ:rHJHxKgnXwkC,8,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6481/1035.abstract,4018841293952464832,/scholar?cites=4018841293952464832,,https://www.sfu.ca/~lmgonigl/pdfs-ee/knope-2020-1035.pdf,0,0,0

We surveyed the shapes of this bone among 110 families spanning the teleost tree and examined its pattern of occupancy in a principal component-based morphospace. Contrasting with expectations from the literature that suggest the local morphospace would be only sparsely occupied. we find primarily dense. broad filling of the morphological landscape. indicating rich diversity. Phylomorphospace plots suggest that dynamic evolution underlies the observed spatial patterning. Evolutionary transits through the morphospaces are sometimes long. and occur in a variety of directions. The trajectories seem to represent both evolutionary divergences and convergences. the latter supported by convevol analysis.

Contrary to prior expectations. birds are only very rarely sexually monogamous. with ‘extra‐pair offspring’ found in approximately 90% of species. Even among socially monogamous species. over 11% of offspring are. on average. the result of extra‐pair paternity (EPP). Based on over 150 molecular genetic studies of EPP in birds. we review two topical areas: (i) ecological explanations for interspecific variation in the rate of EPP; and (ii) evidence bearing on the adaptive function of EPP.

Here we show that. paradoxically. pairing with another species may offer the best fitness return for an individual. despite reduced fitness of hybrid offspring. Two mechanisms reduce the costs to female collared flycatchers of pairing with male pied flycatchers. A large proportion of young are sired by conspecific male collared flycatchers through extra-pair copulations. and there is a bias in favour of male offspring (which. unlike females. are fertile) within hybrid pairs. In combination with temporal variation in breeding success. these cost-reducing mechanisms yield quantitative predictions about when female collared flycatchers should accept a male pied flycatcher as a mate; empirical data agree with these predictions.

In a field study of collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis we used a previously uncharacterized method to determine the frequency and timing of extra-pair inseminations. By counting the number of sperm trapped on the perivitelline layer of eggs. we determined the timing of inseminations and estimated. on a day-to-day basis. the amount of sperm females stored. Our results showed that female collared flycatchers preferentially engaged in extra-pair copulations when mated to an unattractive male with a small white forehead patch. These copulations were timed for the middle part of their fertile period. at least 2 days after the last within-pair insemination.

Instead. it was argued that extrapair copulations are the result of antagonistic selection on male behavior driving female coercion. While the approach and framework of the study were very good. the conclusions of the study were premature because a number of potential adaptive components of polyandry were unaccounted for. and several critical assumptions are unsupported by the current empirical data.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1421,765-770,The Royal Society,Theories of sexual selection usually assume that female preferences for male ornamental traits are fixed and always likely to favour the largest or most extravagant sexual ornaments. This is not. however. always necessary or likely. particularly in resource–based monogamous systems. Here we show that in a closed population of house sparrows. small–badged males were preferred by females as both social and genetic mates and produced a higher number of viable offspring. Previous studies of other house sparrow populations have shown females to prefer large–badged males.

This question has puzzled behavioural ecologists for more than two decades.

In Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae). females paired with genetically incompatible males of alternative color morphs overproduce sons. presumably to reduce investment in inviable daughters. We also observed a reduced overall investment in clutch size. egg size. and care to offspring resulting from incompatible matings. Within-female experimental pairings demonstrate that female birds have the ability to adaptively adjust the sex of their eggs and allocate resources on the basis of partner quality.

1147586,Quantifying the costs and benefits of parental care in female treehoppers,2003,Andrew G Zink,14,Behavioral Ecology,5,687-693,Oxford University Press,Parental protection of eggs represents one of the most basic forms of parental care. Theory suggests that even such basic parental investment represents a trade-off between current offspring survival and future reproductive success. However. few studies have quantified the underlying costs and benefits of parental care for marked individuals across an entire lifetime. I marked and followed 370 females of Publilia concava (Hemiptera: Membracidae) that exhibited a range of guarding durations for their first clutch.

It is challenging to understand why societies are stable. given the reproductive conflicts inherent within them. Reproductive skew theory provides a compelling explanation for how and why reproductive conflicts are resolved. Indeed. some have suggested that skew theory represents a general theory of social evolution. Lamentably. skew theory is composed of many independent models. with the generality of each model being restricted by its assumptions. Here. we tackle this problem. using Hamilton's rule to predict the conditions under which assumptions of major classes of skew models (transactional and tug-of-war) apply.

This study is the first to describe such a behavior in the insect Publilia concava (Hemiptera: Membracidae) through field studies that followed 849 marked females across 1.828 brood associations. While brood parasitism increased the total number of eggs in a host brood. it did not reduce the overall hatching success of host broods. Solitary females exhibited a range of guarding durations while parasitic females rarely remained to guard eggs. Females exhibiting the parasitic tactic increased their lifetime number of clutches without decreasing the number of solitary clutches that they were able to initiate.

This study examined the extent to which environmental factors and host taxonomic identity explain microbiome variation within two salamander genera.

In particular we assessed whether microbiome differentiation paralleled host genetic distance at three levels of taxonomy: genus and high and low clade levels within Ensatina eschscholtzii. We predicted that more genetically related host populations would have more similar microbiomes than more distantly related host populations. We found that salamander microbiomes possess bacterial species that are most likely acquired from their surrounding soil environment. but the relative representation of those bacterial species is significantly different on the skin of salamanders compared to soil. We found differences in skin microbiome alpha diversity among Ensatina higher and lower clade groups. as well as differences between Ensatina and Batrachoseps. We also found that relative microbiome composition (beta diversity) did vary between Ensatina lower clades. but differences were driven by only a few clades and not correlated to clade genetic distances.

Here. we develop a model that links these alternative reproductive tactics by focusing on nonnesting females (S) that either breed cooperatively with a nesting female (N) or parasitize a third. outside host female (H). We find that cooperative breeding is more likely to evolve with increasing relatedness of cooperating females (S or N) to the outside host female (H) and with increasing costs to the hosts for receiving parasitic eggs. Conversely. cooperation is less likely with increasing kinship between the two potentially cooperative nesters (S and N). This is because even the nesting female gains higher inclusive fitness as long as the number of parasitic eggs (of her otherwise potentially cooperating partner) is sufficiently high.

One potential limitation of these models is that individuals make a single. fixed decision about group membership and reproductive allocation at the beginning of the breeding period. While this is appropriate for animals that reproduce in a synchronous bout. many cooperative breeders produce offspring over a prolonged period of time. It is likely that these species adjust reproductive allocation and group membership over time in response to temporal shifts in group productivity and ecological constraints.

1147605,The optimal degree of parental care asymmetry among communal breeders,2001,Andrew G Zink,61,Animal behaviour,2,439-446,Academic Press,Intraspecific brood parasitism and cooperative breeding can be considered extremes on a continuum of parental care investment by a secondary female that visits the nest of a primary female. However. we lack a theoretical framework that predicts exactly where a secondary female will fall along this continuum. In this paper I present a model that predicts the fraction of a nesting period during which a secondary female is expected to stay and provide parental care. To develop this model.

1147606,The dynamics of brood desertion among communally breeding females in the treehopper. Publilia concava,2005,Andrew G Zink,58,Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology,5,466-473,Springer-Verlag,In species that exhibit extended parental care. females sometimes lay eggs communally in order to redistribute the costs of offspring care. Communal egg-laying often involves redundancy in female effort. such that the number of females contributing to reproduction is more than is needed to provide adequate parental care. As a result. a subset of females will often abandon the communal brood. with the time of departure ranging from immediate abandonment after egg-laying (brood parasitism) to delayed abandonment with prolonged care (cooperative breeding). In this paper I approach the parental care dynamics of female-female broods as a desertion game similar to that of mate desertion in species with bi-parental care. I describe a field study of the insect Publilia concava (Hemiptera: Membracidae). a species that exhibits communal oviposition and a full range of egg guarding.

1147607,Kin selection and the evolution of mutualisms between species,2015,Andrew G Zink,121,,9,823-830,,Hamilton's theory of kin selection has revolutionized and inspired fifty years of additional theories and experiments on social evolution. Whereas Hamilton's broader intent was to explain the evolutionary stability of cooperation. his focus on shared genetic history appears to have limited the application of his theory to populations within a single species rather than across interacting species. The evolutionary mechanisms for cooperation between species require both spatial and temporal correlations among interacting partners for the benefits to be not only predictable but of sufficient duration to be reliably delivered. As a consequence when the benefits returned by mutualistic partners are redirected to individuals other than the original donor. cooperation usually becomes unstable and parasitism may evolve. However. theoretically. such redirection of mutualistic benefits may actually reinforce. rather than undermine …,True,6Yul9l8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,5,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/eth.12383,1849360897627064931,/scholar?cites=1849360897627064931,,http://userwww.sfsu.edu/zink/2015eth.pdf,0,0,0

The infectious disease chytridiomycosis. caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has led to the decline and extinction of hundreds of amphibian species. Severe Bd-caused epizootics have been documented in North. Central and South America—with many of the research focused on anurans. California. where Bd-related epizootics and amphibian declines have been reported. has some of the highest diversity of salamanders. After more than a decade since the first known epizootic in California. little is known about Bd disease dynamics in salamanders. Pacific newts (Genus: Taricha) are ideal study species because of their abundance. wide geographic range. occurrence in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. and how little is known about Bd infection dynamics for this group. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the relationship between Pacific newts and the fungal pathogen. We tested 1895 specimens collected between 1889–2009 and found no evidence of Bd-infected Pacific newts until the late 1940’s. Although we estimate that Bd emerged in this genus and rapidly spread geographically throughout California. we did not find evidence for epizootic dynamics. Bd infection prevalence and intensity. two measures commonly used to estimate dynamics. remained consistently low over time; suggesting Pacific newts may not be highly susceptible. Also. we found the timing of first Bd emergence in Pacific newts predate Bd emergence in other California salamander species.

However. the nature of social and ecological environments that favour individual acceptance of such costs of sociality is not well understood. Taxa with short periods of direct social interaction. such as some communal egg layers. are interesting models for study of the cost of social interaction because opportunities to control reproduction of others are limited to brief periods of reproduction. To understand the conditions under which communal egg layers are in fitness conflict and thus likely to influence each other's reproduction. we develop an optimality model involving a brood guarding ‘host’ and a nonguarding disperser. or ‘egg dumper’.

Concerns about effects on nontarget fishes have led to the construction of specially designed vertical-slot trap-and-sort fishways to mitigate potential barrier effects. To improve passage at these fishways. we used passive integrated transponder technology to assess the performance of two fishways located on low-head sea lamprey barriers. Fishways on the Big Carp River (which flows into Lake Superior) and Cobourg Brook (which flows into Lake Ontario) were assessed for attraction efficiency. trap attraction and retention. and passage efficiency.

Longspur parents divided their families into single-parent brood units within a day of leaving the nest. and these brood units remained stable until offspring became independent. There were no differences in either the food load sizes or the feeding visit rates of male and female parents. but by the last week of parental care. female-tended offspring had moved an average of 626 m from their nest. almost 4 times farther than those tended by males. We outline the potential costs and benefits of brood division and suggest that this behavior may be common among birds with biparental care because it helps to reduce predation of entire broods and to improve the foraging economics of parents.,True,tXkhuewAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,65,https://academic.oup.com/auk/article-abstract/102/4/687/5191331,15214638262744987472,/scholar?cites=15214638262744987472,,https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v102n04/p0687-p0695.pdf,0,0,0

Some charr are sedentary and eat crustaceans from the lower portion of the water column. Others are mobile and eat insects from the upper portion of the water column. This study examines whether this behavioural diversification represents potentially adaptive responses made by individuals to local environmental conditions.  2  Four models were constructed to predict how the ratio of mobile to sedentary charr was expected to change with pool morphometry. and how the location and orientation of mobile and sedentary charr were expected to differ within pools.

Trapping is often used for control or assessment. and understanding the invasive species’ behaviour is important for trapping success. A framework linking behaviour to trapping success and management responses was used to test hypotheses for the low trapping success of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the St. Marys River connecting Lakes Superior and Huron. Behaviour of sea lamprey approaching and at traps was quantified using external and internal tags and video. Multistate Markov models identified phenotypic and environmental factors influencing trapping success.

Migratory species exploit different habitats at different times of the year. Biotic and abiotic features that determine where a species lives vary due to natural and anthropogenic factors. This spatiotemporal variation needs to be accounted for in any modeling of species' distributions. In this paper we introduce a semiparametric model that provides a flexible framework for analyzing dynamic patterns of species occurrence and abundance from broad‐scale survey data. The spatiotemporal exploratory model (STEM) adds essential spatiotemporal structure to existing techniques for developing species distribution models through a simple parametric structure without requiring a detailed understanding of the underlying dynamic processes.

Notably. migratory species have been shown to commonly display such carry-over effects. facing severe time constraints and physiological stresses that can influence events across seasons. However. to date. no study has examined a full annual cycle to determine when these carry-over effects arise and how long they persist within and across years. Understanding when carry-over effects are created and how they persist is critical to identifying those periods and geographic locations that constrain the annual cycle of a population and determining how selection is acting upon individuals throughout the entire year. Using three consecutive years of migration tracks and four consecutive years of breeding success data. we tested whether carry-over effects in the form of timing deviations during one migratory segment of the annual cycle represent fitness costs that persist or accumulate across the annual cycle for a long-distance migratory bird. the Hudsonian godwit. Limosa haemastica. We found that individual godwits could migrate progressively later than population mean over the course of an entire migration period. especially southbound migration. but that these deviations did not accumulate across the entire year and were not consistently detected among individuals across years.

While most studies have focused on single badges of status. recent empirical work has shown that multiple status signals may exist.

While previous work has explored effects of dyadic interactions. limited understanding exists regarding how group-level characteristics of the social environment affect extrapair paternity (EPP) and cuckoldry. We use a wild population of great tits (Parus major) to examine how. in addition to the phenotypes of focal parents. two neighborhood-level traits—age and personality composition—predict EPP and cuckoldry. We used the well-studied trait “exploration behavior” as a measure of the reactive-proactive personality axis.

1147667,Exploring the intersection between animal personality and sociality,2019,Allison Roth,,,,,,A topic of growing interest in behavioral ecology centers around the causes and consequences of animal personality - defined as consistent interindividual differences in behavior. Although much work has focused on examining the relationships between an individual’s personality and its fitness. limited knowledge exists regarding how variation in personality is maintained or how the personalities of competitors and actual or potential mates may play into this. Furthermore. few studies have examined how other aspects of an individual’s social environment (e.g. competition levels) might influence relationships between focal personality and fitness. or how the combined personalities of individuals in a group might affect emergent group properties. A main objective of this thesis was to explore how the relationship between focal personality and reproductive performance is modulated by the social environment. In doing so. I aimed to elucidate potential mechanisms that help maintain variation in personality within populations. I progressed from examining the individual level consequences of personality to investigating the effects of group personality composition on emergent group dynamics which. while not examined here. could promote differential fitness between groups.My thesis demonstrates the potential for an individual’s social environment to interact with its personality to affect reproductive performance.

Sometimes. the opportunity to gain these additional matings coincides with periods when males are providing parental care. At such times. males might be expected to allocate time and effort to these alternative behaviours in a way that maximizes their overall reproductive success. But do they? Here. we examine the recent evidence for a tradeoff between parental effort and additional mating effort and highlight some of the factors that might influence how this conflict is resolved.

Although several mechanisms have been put forward to explain how females might control the sex of their eggs. virtually nothing is known. As females are the heterogametic sex in birds. adjustment of the clutch sex ratio could arise either by pre– or post-ovulation control mechanisms. The Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) exhibits extreme adaptive egg sex ratio bias. Typically. warblers produce only single–egg clutches. but by translocating pairs to vacant habitat of very high quality. most females were induced to produce two–egg clutches.

However. some hosts have not evolved defenses against parasitism. One hypothesis to explain a lack of host defenses is that the life-history strategies of some hosts reduce the cost of parasitism to the extent that accepting parasitic eggs in the nest is evolutionarily stable. Under this hypothesis. it pays hosts to accept cuckoo eggs if (1) the energetic cost of raising the cuckoo is low. (2) there is time to renest. and (3) clutch size is small. We parasitized the nests of host and nonhost species with nonmimetic model eggs to test whether the evolution of egg recognition by cuckoo hosts could be explained by life-history variables of the host.

Series B: Biological Sciences,suppl_5,S347-S349,The Royal Society,Sex biases in the allocation of resources to offspring occur in a broad range of taxa. Parents have been shown to achieve such biases either by producing numerically more of one sex or by providing the individuals of one sex with a greater quantity of resources. In addition. skews in allocation could occur if the offspring of one sex receive resources of higher quality (greater nutritional or energetic value by weight or volume). although this mode of adjustment has. to our knowledge. never been demonstrated. We compared the types of prey and the metabolizable energy provisioned to male and female nestlings in one of the most sexually size dimorphic of all birds. the brown songlark.

Empirical evidence for the use of colour patches in conflict resolution is largely restricted to pigment‐based colours (melanins and carotenoids) and rarely defines the context in which the signals are used. 2. Here we test whether structural‐based ultraviolet (UV) crown colouration functions in conflict resolution among dyads of first‐year male blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus in captivity. in a context that is known to favour aggressive individuals. 3. We found that on first encounter in a pairwise context. experimentally UV‐reduced males were significantly more likely to lose to control‐treated opponents than expected by chance.

However. the extent to which these phenomena increase variance in male reproductive success will depend on the covariance between success at these two strategies. We analysed these patterns over four breeding seasons in facultatively polygynous blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus. We found that both polygyny and extra-pair paternity increased variance in male reproductive success and that standardised variance in annual number of genetic fledglings was 2.6 times higher than standardised variance in apparent success when assuming strict monogamy.

Whether a pathogen is able to acquire a new host depends on the genetic compatibility between the two. through either preadaptation of the pathogen or subsequent evolutionary change. The ecological outcome of the novel interaction—for example. a spreading disease epidemic or the extinction of an incipient plant invasion—depends on the life history of the pathogen. opportunities for rapid evolution of virulence or resistance. and the presence of a suitable environment.

For a suite of 18 sympatric clover species (Trifolium and Medicago. Fabaceae). we evaluated leaf traits affecting leaf wetness and susceptibility to infection by the fungal pathogen Stemphylium sp.. causal agent of Stemphylium leaf spot. Spore germination increased with time in free water. and the relative susceptibility of host plants to infection was proportional to the duration of water retention on leaves. Larger leaves captured more water and retained it longer. Unexpectedly. trichomes and leaf wettability did not affect water capture. For clovers planted within natural clover populations at two sites. infection was threefold greater at the wetter site.

No current hypotheses can explain this phenomenon. We show that egg viability declines during the period of egg laying if eggs remain unincubated. and we suggest that early nest attendance may slow the rate of decline in viability. We then develop the hypothesis that declining egg viability associated with delayed incubation plays an important role in determining the most productive clutch size in temperate-breeding waterfowl. The benefit of laying additional eggs is offset by the reduced value of the first-laid eggs. which suffer lowered viability and greater risk of predation.

Migrating birds frequently collide with manmade structures and such losses are believed to represent the majority of anthropogenic mortality for North American birds. However. estimates of total collision mortality range across several orders of magnitude and effects on population dynamics remain unknown. Herein. we develop a novel method to assess relative vulnerability to anthropogenic threats. which we demonstrate using 243.103 collision records from 188 species of eastern North American landbirds. After correcting mortality estimates for variation attributable to population size and geographic overlap with potential collision structures. we found that per capita vulnerability to collision with buildings and towers varied over more than four orders of magnitude among species. Species that migrate long distances or at night were much more likely to be killed by collisions than year-round residents or diurnal migrants. However. there was no correlation between relative collision mortality and long-term population trends for these same species. Thus. although millions of North American birds are killed annually by collisions with manmade structures. this source of mortality has no discernible effect on populations.,True,t4XWQ3MAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,111,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024708,15818208154213922865,/scholar?cites=15818208154213922865,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024708,0,0,0

1147750,Costs of reproduction in breeding female mallards: predation risk during incubation drives annual mortality,2012,Todd Arnold and Erin Roche and James Devries and David Howerter,7,Avian Conservation and Ecology,1,,The Resilience Alliance,The effort expended on reproduction may entail future costs. such as reduced survival or fecundity. and these costs can have an important influence on life-history optimization. For birds with precocial offspring. hypothesized costs of reproduction have typically emphasized nutritional and energetic investments in egg formation and incubation. We measured seasonal survival of 3856 radio-marked female Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from arrival on the breeding grounds through brood-rearing or cessation of breeding. There was a 2.5-fold direct increase in mortality risk associated with incubating nests in terrestrial habitats. whereas during brood-rearing when breeding females occupy aquatic habitats. mortality risk reached seasonal lows. Mortality risk also varied with calendar date and was highest during periods when large numbers of Mallards were nesting. suggesting that prey-switching behaviors by common predators may exacerbate risks to adults in all breeding stages. Although prior investments in egg laying and incubation affected mortality risk. most relationships were not consistent with the cost of reproduction hypothesis; birds with extensive prior investments in egg production or incubation typically survived better. suggesting that variation in individual quality drove both relationships. We conclude that for breeding female Mallards. the primary cost of reproduction is a fixed cost associated with placing oneself at risk to predators while incubating nests in terrestrial habitats.RÉSUMÉL’effort investi à la reproduction peut avoir une incidence sur les coûts futurs–comme un faible taux de survie ou de fertilité–et ces coûts peuvent …,True,t4XWQ3MAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,47,https://www.ace-eco.org/vol7/iss1/art1/,9046417140420495867,/scholar?cites=9046417140420495867,,https://www.ace-eco.org/vol7/iss1/art1/,0,0,0

1147760,Barrier crops as a cultural control measure of non-persistently transmitted aphid-borne viruses,2000,Alberto Fereres,71,Virus research,1-2,221-231,Elsevier,Barrier crops have been used since the early 1950s as a cultural control strategy for reducing the spread of non-persistently transmitted aphid-borne viruses. Since then. this strategy has been investigated by several authors. resulting in a wide range of divergent conclusions on its effectiveness. In a series of field and laboratory experiments carried out in central Spain during 1995–1998. we investigated the efficacy and mode of action of various barrier crops for reducing the spread of Potato virus Y and Cucumber mosaic virus in pepper. The barriers acted as natural ‘sinks’ for non-persistent viruses and did not reduce the number of aphids landing in the protected crop. as suggested by some authors. There was a significant reduction in virus spread and an increase in yield in two of the four years of trials. Such differences in the effectiveness of the barrier crop strategy show that its efficacy depends on a series of …,True,A7fGRWwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,147,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170200002008,8325159056179876742,/scholar?cites=8325159056179876742,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alberto-Fereres/publication/12192360_Barrier_crops_as_a_cultural_control_measure_of_non-persistently_transmitted_aphid-borne_viruses/links/5b9774224585153a53292c05/Barrier-crops-as-a-cultural-control-measure-of-non-persistently-transmitted-aphid-borne-viruses.pdf,0,0,0

Thus. it is often assumed that viruses have large populations. and RNA virus evolution has been mostly explained using purely deterministic models. However. population bottlenecks during the virus life cycle could result in effective population numbers being much smaller than reported censuses. and random genetic drift could be important in virus evolution. A step at which population bottlenecks may be severe is host-to-host transmission. We report here an estimate of the size of the population that starts a new infection when Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is transmitted by the aphid Aphis gossypii. based on the segregation of two CMV genotypes in plants infected by aphids that acquired the virus from plants infected by both genotypes.

UV-blocking materials have properties to filter the UV radiation (280-400 nm) interfering with the vision of insects and in consequence. their behaviour related with movement. host location ability and their population parameters. The exclusion of part of the UV radiation within the greenhouse environment has a dramatically incidence on insect orientation. movement and on the spread of insect-transmitted viral diseases. In the same way. the impact of UV-absorbing materials on population dynamics of natural enemies. pollinators and crop yield needs further investigation. The level of protection of the different UV-blocking materials may vary among different designs of greenhouses and the geographic location that determines different internal climatic conditions and the amount of UV and visible light absorbed and transmitted within the covered structures.

A 2-year experiment was carried out in northeastern Spain (Navarra) to evaluate the impact of a UV-blocking film (AD-IR AV) on the population density of insect pests and the spread of insect-transmitted virus diseases associated with head lettuce [Lactuca sativa (L.)]. Results showed that the UV-absorbing plastic film did not loose its ability to filter UV radiation after three lettuce crop cycles (14 months). The UV-absorbing plastic film was effective in reducing the abundance and in delaying the colonization of lettuce by aphids [Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) and Acyrthosiphum lactucae (Passerini)]. A significant increase in the percentage of marketable plants was achieved under UV-absorbing films due to a reduction in the number of plants infested by aphids and by insect-transmitted virus diseases (mainly potyviruses). Also the UV-absorbing plastic films were effective in reducing the population density of Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and the spread of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) as well as the population density of the lepidopteran pest.

This is particularly true for viruses—rapidly evolving entities that form populations with transient and explosive expansions alternating with phases of migration. resulting in strong population bottlenecks and associated founder effects that increase genetic drift. A typical illustration of this pattern is the progression of viral disease within a eukaryotic host. where such demographic fluctuations are a key factor in the emergence of new variants with altered virulence. Viruses initiate replication in one or only a few infection foci. then move through the vasculature to seed secondary infection sites and so invade distant organs and tissues. Founder effects during this within-host colonization might depend on the concentration of infectious units accumulating and circulating in the vasculature. as this represents the infection dose reaching new organs or “territories”. Surprisingly. whether or not the easily measurable circulating (plasma) virus load directly drives the size of population bottlenecks during host colonization has not been documented in animal viruses. while in plants the virus load within the sap has never been estimated. Here. we address this important question by monitoring both the virus concentration flowing in host plant sap. and the number of viral genomes founding the population in each successive new leaf.

Studies on induced plant resistance to herbivores. especially piercingsucking insects. are less abundant than those devoted to pathogens. Several experiments under controlled conditions have been conducted to demonstrate that infestations by Macrosiphum euphorbiae induce plant resistance to Bemisia tabaci in susceptible tomato plants. After three days of exposure to 20 apterous adult aphids. the plants acquired a transiently induced resistance to B. tabaci when aphid removal occurred one or 18 hours prior to B. tabaci infestation; the effect disappeared when four days passed between aphid and whitefly infestations. The resistance observed was both locally and systemically induced. Other assays were performed to evaluate the effect of preinfestation with ten adults of B. tabaci during 48 h on the tomato responses to two different clones (Sp and Nt) of M. euphorbiae. The numbers of nymph and adult aphids were counted after the same time interval as the pre-reproductive period and 20 (Sp clone) or 22 (Nt clone) days after adult aphid removal. The tomato responses induced by whitefly feeding depend on the aphid clone. For the Sp clone. the number of aphid nymphs ten days after adult removal was significantly higher on whitefly preinfested plants than on uninfested plants. However. no significant differences were observed when the aphid clone Nt was tested.

Previous studies proved that the tomato breeding line ABL 14-8 was resistant to B. tabaci. the vector of tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD). This resistance is based on the presence of type IV glandular trichomes and acylsucrose production. These trichomes deter settling and probing of B. tabaci in ABL 14-8. which reduces primary and secondary spread of TYLCD.   Methodology/Principal Findings Whitefly settlement preference was evaluated on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of nearly-isogenic tomato lines with and without B. tabaci-resistance traits. ‘ABL 14-8 and Moneymaker’ respectively. under non-choice and free-choice conditions. In addition. the Electrical Penetration Graph technique was used to study probing and feeding activities of B. tabaci on the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of the same genotypes. B. tabaci preferred to settle on the abaxial than on the adaxial surface of ‘Moneymaker’ leaves. whereas no such preference was observed on ABL 14-8 tomato plants at the ten-leaf growth stage. Furthermore. B. tabaci preferred to feed on the abaxial than on the adaxial leaf surface of ‘Moneymarker’ susceptible tomato plants as shown by a higher number of sustained phloem feeding ingestion events and a shorter time to reach the phloem. However. B. tabaci standard probing and feeding behavior patterns were altered in ABL 14-8 plants and whiteflies were unable to feed from the phloem and spent more time in non-probing activities when exposed to the abaxial leaf surface.

Puesto que la secreción de MT aumenta en la rata con diabetes tipo I. y dada la importancia de MT en el tracto gastrointestinal. es interesante comprobar los efectos de MT sobre el alterado comportamiento ingestivo de estos animales. Se ha estudiado el efecto de la suplementación oral de MT (1 mg por kg de peso corporal y día) en la escotofase sobre el comportamiento ingestivo de ratas Wistar macho diabéticas y no diabéticas durante cuatro semanas mediante análisis de pautas de ingestión asistido por ordenador. La administración de MT exógena indujo un efecto de saciación en ratas no diabéticas. pero no en animales diabéticos. Los cambios en comportamiento ingestivo inducidos por MT en animales no diabéticos están relacionados con cambios en frecuencia. tamaño y duración de las comidas. con el resultado de una disminución de la ingestión total de alimento durante la escotofase.

Here we briefly review the current views of virus evolution and propose a new. coherent scenario that appears to be best compatible with comparative-genomic data and is naturally linked to models of cellular evolution that. from independent considerations. seem to be the most parsimonious among the existing ones. Several genes coding for key proteins involved in viral replication and morphogenesis as well as the major capsid protein of icosahedral virions are shared by many groups of RNA and DNA viruses but are missing in cellular life forms. On the basis of this key observation and the data on extensive genetic exchange between diverse viruses. we propose the concept of the ancient virus world. The virus world is construed as a distinct contingent of viral genes that continuously retained its identity throughout the entire history of life. Under this concept. the principal lineages of viruses and related selfish agents emerged from the primordial pool of primitive genetic elements. the ancestors of both cellular and viral genes. Thus. notwithstanding the numerous gene exchanges and acquisitions attributed to later stages of evolution. most. if not all. modern viruses and other selfish agents are inferred to descend from elements that belonged to the primordial genetic pool. In this pool. RNA viruses would evolve first. followed by retroid elements. and DNA viruses.

Various selfish elements parasitize on all cellular life forms. The relative abundances of different classes of viruses are dramatically different between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes. the great majority of viruses possess double-stranded (ds) DNA genomes. with a substantial minority of single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses and only limited presence of RNA viruses. In contrast. in eukaryotes. RNA viruses account for the majority of the virome diversity although ssDNA and dsDNA viruses are common as well. Phylogenomic analysis yields tangible clues for the origins of major classes of eukaryotic viruses and in particular their likely roots in prokaryotes.

Comparative analysis of the viruses from the latter family reveals three levels of gene conservation. The most conserved gene module defines RNA replication and is shared with plant and animal viruses in the alphavirus-like superfamily. A module of five genes that function in particle assembly and transport is a hallmark of the family Closteroviridae and was likely present in the ancestor of all three closterovirus genera. This module includes a homologue of Hsp70 molecular chaperones and three diverged copies of the capsid protein gene.

Among eight proteins tested. only a 21-kDa protein (p21) was able to suppress double-stranded (ds) RNA-induced silencing of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA. Restoration of GFP expression by p21 under these conditions had no apparent effect on accumulation of the small interfering RNAs. In addition. p21 elevated the transient expression level of the GFP mRNA in the absence of dsRNA inducer. Similar activities were detected using homologs of p21 encoded by other members of the genus Closterovirus. Computer analysis indicated that p21-like proteins constitute a novel protein family that is unrelated to other recognized suppressors of RNA silencing.

Structurally similar. apparently homologous capsids are present in a huge variety of icosahedral viruses that infect bacteria. archaea. and eukaryotes. These findings prompted the concept of the capsid as the virus “self” that defines the identity of deep. ancient viral lineages. However. several other widespread viral “hallmark genes” encode key components of the viral replication apparatus (such as polymerases and helicases) and combine with different capsid proteins. given the inherently modular character of viral evolution.

Family Geminiviridae) represents a serious looming threat to tomato production in all temperate parts of the world. Whereas determining where and when TYLCV movements have occurred could help curtail its spread and prevent future movements of related viruses. determining the consequences of past TYLCV movements could reveal the ecological and economic risks associated with similar viral invasions. Towards this end we applied Bayesian phylogeographic inference and recombination analyses to available TYLCV sequences (including those of 15 new Iranian full TYLCV genomes) and reconstructed a plausible history of TYLCV's diversification and movements throughout the world. In agreement with historical accounts. our results suggest that the first TYLCVs most probably arose somewhere in the Middle East between the 1930s and 1950s (with 95% highest probability density intervals 1905–1972) and that the global spread of TYLCV only began in the 1980s after the evolution of the TYLCV-Mld and -IL strains. Despite the global distribution of TYLCV we found no convincing evidence anywhere other than the Middle East and the Western Mediterranean of epidemiologically relevant TYLCV variants arising through recombination. Although the region around Iran is both the center of present day TYLCV diversity and the site of the most intensive ongoing TYLCV evolution. the evidence indicates that the region is epidemiologically isolated. which suggests that novel TYLCV variants found there are probably not direct global threats.

One type was assigned to biotype B and the other was genetically dissimilar to the populations described elsewhere and was named Ms. after the Mascarenes Archipelago. This new genetic type forms a distinct group that is sister to two other groups. one to which the B biotype is a member and one to which the Q biotype belongs. The Ms biotype is thought to be indigenous to the region as it was also detected in Mauritius. the Seychelles and Madagascar.

Recombination is apparently a major mechanism in virus evolution. allowing viruses to evolve more quickly by providing immediate direct access to many more areas of a sequence space than are accessible by mutation alone. Recombination has been widely described amongst the insect-transmitted plant viruses in the genus Begomovirus (family Geminiviridae). with potential recombination hot- and cold-spots also having been identified. Nevertheless. because very little is understood about either the biochemical predispositions of different genomic regions to recombine or what makes some recombinants more viable than others. the sources of the evolutionary and biochemical forces shaping distinctive recombination patterns observed in nature remain obscure. Here we present a detailed analysis of unique recombination events detectable in the DNA-A and DNA-A-like genome components of bipartite and monopartite begomoviruses. We demonstrate both that recombination breakpoint hot- and cold-spots are conserved between the two groups of viruses. and that patterns of sequence exchange amongst the genomes are obviously non-random. Using a computational technique designed to predict structural perturbations in chimaeric proteins. we demonstrate that observed recombination events tend to be less disruptive than sets of simulated ones.
