Strong efforts have been devoted to investigate technological solutions aiming at overcoming the problems of fossil fuel depletion and the environmental issues due to the carbon emissions. Hybrid (activated by both renewables and fossil fuels) distributed energy systems can be considered a very effective and promising technology to replace traditional centralized energy systems. As a most peculiar characteristic. they reduce the use of fossil sources and transmission and distribution losses along the main power grid and contribute to electric peak shaving and partial-loads losses reduction. As a direct consequence. the transition from centralized towards hybrid decentralized energy systems leads to a new role for citizens. shifting from a passive energy consumer to active prosumers able to produce energy and distribute energy. Such a complex system needs to be carefully modelled to account for the energy interactions with prosumers. local microgrids and main grids. Thus. the aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of a hybrid distributed energy system serving an urban community and modelled within the framework of agent-based theory. The model is of general validity and estimates (i) the layout of the links along which electricity is distributed among agents in the local microgrid.(ii) electricity exchanged among agents and (iii) electricity exported to the main power grid or imported from it. A scenario analysis has been conducted at varying the distance of connection among prosumers. the installed capacity in the area and the usage of links.

However. the evaluation of the effective energy and environmental performance of an electric heat pump meeting the space heating and cooling requests of a building has to consider several factors that affect the results. Among them great attention should be given to the variability of weather conditions in which the system operates. the changeability of the efficiency and environmental indicators of power grid.

The system. fed by geothermal energy. provides thermal energy for heating and cooling. and domestic hot water for a residential district located in the metropolitan city of Naples (South of Italy). The produced electricity is partly used for auxiliaries of the thermal district and partly sold to the power grid. A calibration control strategy was implemented by considering manufacturer data matching the appropriate operating temperature levels in each component. The cooling and thermal demands of the connected users were calculated using suitable building dynamic simulation models. An energy network dedicated to heating and cooling loads was designed and simulated by considering the variable ground temperature throughout the year. as well as the accurate heat transfer coefficients and pressure losses of the network pipes. The results were based on a 1-year dynamic simulation and were analyzed on a daily. monthly. and yearly basis. The performance was evaluated by means of the main economic and environmental aspects. Two parametric analyses were performed by varying geothermal well depth. to consider the uncertainty in the geofluid temperature as a function of the depth. and by varying the time of operation of the district heating and cooling network. Additionally. the economic analysis was performed by considering two different scenarios with and without feed-in tariffs.

Geothermal fluids at medium and low temperature could be considered to feed binary cycle power plants using organic fluids for electricity “production” or in cogeneration configuration. The improvement in the use of geothermal aquifers at low-medium enthalpy in small deep sites favours the reduction of drilling well costs. and in addition. it allows the exploitation of local resources in the energy districts. The heat exchanger evaporator enables the thermal heat exchange between the working fluid (which is commonly an organic fluid for an Organic Rankine Cycle) and the geothermal fluid (supplied by the aquifer). Thus. it has to be realised taking into account the thermodynamic proprieties and chemical composition of the geothermal field. The geothermal fluid is typically very aggressive. and it leads to the corrosion of steel traditionally used in the heat exchangers. This paper analyses the possibility of using plastic material in the constructions of the evaporator installed in an Organic Rankine Cycle plant in order to overcome the problems of corrosion and the increase of heat exchanger thermal resistance due to the fouling effect. A comparison among heat exchangers made of commonly used materials. such as carbon. steel. and titanium. with alternative polymeric materials has been carried out.

Following this interest. this paper analyses the energy and environmental performance of a renewable energy community composed of two office buildings located in Naples (Italy). Each building has a rooftop photovoltaic plant and one office presents an electric vehicle. The heating and cooling demands of both offices are satisfied by two reversible air to water heat pumps. The offices are connected through an electric microgrid and they are in parallel with a power grid. Buildings and plants are modelled and simulated by means of TRNSYS 17 simulation software. The first analysis has concerned the comparison of the results achieved in renewable energy community configuration and from individual buildings in terms of quantity of electricity imported. exported from/to power grid and consumed on-site. The share of self-consumed photovoltaic electricity rises up to 79% when energy sharing is allowed. The second analysis has been carried out to evaluate the energy and environmental performance of a renewable energy community by means of fixed and hourly varying values for power grid efficiency and emission factors for electricity. The use of time-dependent indicators has led to a lower community primary energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions of 18% and 12%. respectively. in comparison with the scenario in which the fixed parameters have been adopted.

1329501,Alternative use of tobacco stems as sustainable biofuel,2020,P Bareschino and E Marrasso and C Roselli,,,,,Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture,Climate change. rising pollution and the fossil fuels depletion encourage many countries to push towards the introduction of renewable-based energy conversion systems. In particular. European Union energy policy gives a high priority on the increasing use of renewable energy sources because of their strong contribution to the diversification of energy supply. the improvement of energy security. the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the social and economic cohesion. Among renewables. biomass is currently the dominating energy source for multiple uses in heat and electricity sectors as well as in transport sector. even if the production sustainability of biomass has been questioned because of the competition with food crops. Therefore. novel non-food biomass resources need to be investigated. In particular. most plant residues of agro-industrial cultivation present a high concentrations of cellulose and thus they could be used as biofuel. Among these the tobacco stems have a high cellulose content (30-40% of dry matter). Tobacco is traditionally used for cigarettes and cigars manufacturing and after the drying process a great quantity of dry tobacco stems (up to 3 t/hectare) is treated as wastes. In this framework. the aim of the paper is to investigate the use of tobacco stems to feed a biomass boiler after a chipping process in order to obtain two advantages: the avoiding of the tobacco stems disposal costs for the agro-industrial company and the promoting the energy recovery from wastes. First of all. tobacco stems sampled out in an air-curing factory of South Italy crops have been characterized according to ASTM D5142 and ASTM …,True,4AETWK8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://iris.unisannio.it/handle/20.500.12070/45056,,,,,,0,0,0

1329503,Comparison of Two Solar PV-Driven Air Conditioning Systems with Different Tracking Modes,2020,Elisa Marrasso and Carlo Roselli and Francesco Tariello,13,Energies,14,3585,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this paper two solar electric-driven air conditioning systems are compared and analyzed from an energy and environmental point of view. Both systems satisfy the electricity. space heating and cooling needs of an existing multi-purpose. multi-story building that is simulated with TRNSYS 17. The first one. considered as reference system. is based on a centralized electric heat pump coupled with a conventional photovoltaic plant installed 10 years ago. The second one. hereinafter proposed system. has a hybrid configuration. consisting of a ground-source heat pump. a low temperature thermal network and a series of electric heat pumps. one per apartment. In addition. the plant is connected to a high-performance commercial photovoltaic system equipped with a solar tracking system to the panels. Five different solutions realized with vertical. two horizontal orientations. polar and two-axis trackers are taken into account and compared with the standard fixed configuration. The last hybrid configuration can be seen as an upgrade of an existing decentralized air conditioning system in which the local electric heat pumps are converted in water-to-water devices that interact with the thermal grid representing the heat source/sink for them.

1329504,Performance analysis of a polygeneration system in different power grid efficiency scenarios,2019,C Roselli and E Marrasso and F Tariello and M Sasso,,,,0773-1-0773-16,HRV,Combined heat and power generation traditionally allows for higher energy performance than separate production of heat and electricity. However the significant increase of the renewable energy sources contribution in electricity production has spatially and temporally modified the context in which polygeneration systems operate and the energy and environmental profitability of these technologies could be undetermined. In this framework the aim of the paper is to investigate the influence of the power grid efficiency scenarios variation on the polygeneration systems performance. For this purpose the energy and environmental performance of a proposed system based on combined production are compared to those one achieved by a conventional system based on separate production. Both systems satisfy the space heating. cooling and domestic hot water demands of a multipurpose building located in Naples. The primary energy demand of conventional and proposed system due to electricity depends on the efficiency of the national electric energy system features. In this paper. this factor is considered to be time-varying (hour-by-hour) and it is further taken into account that the electric system efficiency changes in the different regions of the same Country. In particular. for the Italian day-ahead market of electricity the national territory is divided in 6 zones; in this analysis two of them will be considered (Centre-North zone and Centre-South zone) and compared. The differences that arise in the results are also assessed with respect to the case in which the national and local average efficiency is taken into account.

1329505,Comparison of centralized and decentralized air-conditioning systems for a multi-storey/multi users building,2018,E Marrasso and C Roselli and M Sasso and F Tariello,,,,,,Buildings are responsible for consuming up to 40% of the total energy in European Countries. with a related emission of 40% of total greenhouse gas emissions. A percentage of 65% of residential sector requirements is for space heating and cooling demand. This scenario led to a great in terest in developing energy efficiency policies to reduce the primary energy demand and the greenhouse gas emissions. as required by climate and energy targets of European Union within 2030. In this paper three different air conditioning systems for space heating and cooling of a building located in Naples. are investigated. The multi-storey building has six floors. the first two are intended for office use. while the remaining are residential apartments. In the first solution the building space heating dem and is satisfied by a centralised natural gas boiler delivering up to 65 kW of thermal power. while the cooling load is met by an electric chiller with a nominal cooling power of 59.8 kW. Both energy conversion systems interact with a thermal energy storag e tank. The second analysed plant is based on distributed energy conversion systems. It consists of twelve boilers. each one able to delivers up to 25 kW. and twelve electric chillers. each one with a nominal cooling power of 6.14 kW. In both cases the bui lding electric energy demand is satisfied by the external electric grid.

The paper analyses a microcogeneration system used to satisfy electric and thermal demand (space heating and domestic hot water) of two semi-detached houses. It consists of a reciprocating internal combustion engine fuelled by natural gas. with a thermal and electric power of 12.5 kW and 5.5 kW. respectively. A high efficiency auxiliary boiler with a nominal thermal power of 24 kW. is included to supply heat when microgeneration unit capacity is not enough to meet the heating load. A load sharing approach between the two residential building is taken into account. The domestic hot water and the heating requests are managed by means of two different thermal storages. In order to analyse the influence of climatic conditions and to make the results more general for different geographical areas. two different locations one in Italy and one in Spain. are considered..

1329509,ENERGY AND EMISSIONS ANALYSIS OF A HYBRID DESICCANT COOLING SYSTEM WITH A GAS ENGINE DRIVEN HEAT PUMP,2015,G Angrisani and E Marrasso and C Roselli and M Sasso,,,,10-19,The 4th International Conference on Microgeneration and Related Technologies,Desiccant cooling systems handle latent loads by sorption dehumidification and sensible loads by over-drying the process air to allow its direct evaporative cooling. In hot and humid climates. such as in Southern Italy. the performed dehumidification may be not enough to enable evaporative cooling of the air. Higher regeneration temperatures are needed to achieve the required humidity ratio reduction. but this limits the use of waste heat or renewable energy as thermal energy source for regeneration. Therefore. other cooling equipment should be incorporated to constitute hybrid system. where latent and sensible loads are removed by the desiccant wheel and ie a cooling coil. respectively. Advantages of hybrid desiccant cooling systems are: improved IAQ thanks to the independent control of temperature and humidity ratio. lower size and improved energy performance of the cooling unit as it handles only sensible load and operates with a reduced thermal lift between evaporator and condenser. In most cases. hybrid systems are equipped with electric-driven chillers. powered by electricity from the grid. cogenerators or renewable technologies (typically PV). Nevertheless. the introduction of a gas engine-driven heat pump seems very interesting. as the compressor of the vapor cycle is directly activated by a natural gas internal combustion engine.This paper examines the benefits of coupling a desiccant dehumidification sub-system to a gas engine-driven vapor compression unit. The former. based on a silica-gel desiccant rotor. is analyzed by means of numerical models. calibrated and validated by means of experimental tests in previous works …,True,4AETWK8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Sasso/publication/313860708_Energy_and_emissions_analysis_of_a_hybrid_desiccant_cooling_system_with_a_gas_engine_driven_heat_pump/links/5978b36ea6fdcc30bdc31dd8/Energy-and-emissions-analysis-of-a-hybrid-desiccant-cooling-system-with-a-gas-engine-driven-heat-pump.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Sasso/publication/313860708_Energy_and_emissions_analysis_of_a_hybrid_desiccant_cooling_system_with_a_gas_engine_driven_heat_pump/links/5978b36ea6fdcc30bdc31dd8/Energy-and-emissions-analysis-of-a-hybrid-desiccant-cooling-system-with-a-gas-engine-driven-heat-pump.pdf,0,0,0

The generator can be clamped onto the outer wall of a geothermal steam or hot water pipe and was successfully tested in temperatures up to 160 C. A test bed at the Cooper Union in New York City was used to evaluate different ambient and working fluid temperatures. The thermoelectric generator was attached to a steam pipe at 160 C and was used to power two microcontroller based security cameras. one with wireless LAN and another with cellular connectivity. Additional testing of the PV voltage controller and the generator occurred in Iceland using a 100-120 C geothermal waste steam condensate pipe.The results show that the system can be used to run low power surveillance systems. Because the security system can operate without grid access. it will run constantly. and hence improve security. The unit’s power generation is directly dependent on the temperature difference between the heat source and the ambient. This temperature difference becomes greater in colder climates such as in Iceland.

Geotherm. Resour. Counc,,117-124,,In Iceland there is a super abundance of waste hot water from geothermal power plants at a temperature between 130-160 C. Some of this is re-purposed to heat cold water and is used for district heating and heated swimming pools. This waste energy source has also enabled the growth of out of zone plants. enhanced agricultural production by 20%. and extended the growing season by using the authors’ energy intensive shallow system of bottom heat that incorporates existing heated sidewalk technology.Complete autonomy of the field tested heated garden system is not possible without an independent. sustainably powered irrigation control system. Long term plant studies on the plant growth have been limited due to the lack of scheduled and reliable watering cycle as plants die during the growing season. The authors have also designed and constructed an automated thermoelectric powered irrigation system that was developed for the maximum plant growth of the Icelandic heated gardens. It has a subsystem that records soil moisture and ambient temperature. When the soil is too dry it is irrigated by opening a valve connected to a municipal water line. An identical irrigation system is currently in use for the author’s heated green roof experiments at The Cooper Union in New York City that uses waste heat from a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system as the heat source.
