To study the molecular mechanisms underlying the LPS and antibody effects in the brain. we employed an in vivo model of acute LPS-induced inflammation and an in vitro model of cultured glioblastoma U373 cells.

Adding 7(1-208)-specific antibodies to the LPS challenge prevented elevation of both the anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic miRNAs while supporting the resistance of brain mitochondria to Ca2+ and maintaining 7 nAChR/AChE decreases. In U373 cells. 7-specific antibodies and LPS both stimulated interleukin-6 production through the p38/Src-dependent pathway.

Here we have studied expression and hypoxic regulation of the testis isoenzyme of PFKFB4 in several malignant cell lines from a female organ--the mammary gland. Our studies clearly demonstrated that PFKFB4 mRNA is also expressed in mammary gland malignant cells (MCF-7 and T47D cell lines) in normoxic conditions and that hypoxia strongly induces it expression. To better understand the mechanism of hypoxic regulation of PFKFB4 gene expression. we used dimethyloxalylglycine. a specific inhibitor of HIF-1alpha hydroxylase enzymes. which strongly increases HIF-1alpha levels and mimics the effect of hypoxia. It was observed that PFKFB4 expression in the MCF7 and T47D cell lines was highly responsive to dimethyloxalylglycine. suggesting that the hypoxia responsiveness of PFKFB4 gene in these cell lines is regulated by HIF-1 proteins. Moreover. desferrioxamine and cobalt chloride. which mimic the effect of hypoxia by chelating or substituting for iron. had a similar stimulatory effect on the expression of PFKFB mRNA. In other mammary gland malignant cell lines (BT549. MDA-MB-468. and SKBR-3) hypoxia and hypoxia mimics also induced PFKFB4 mRNA. but to variable degrees. The hypoxic induction of PFKFB4 mRNA was equivalent to the expression of PFKFB3. Glut1. and VEGF. which are known HIF-1-dependent genes.

Previously we found that α7 nAChR-specific antibody induced pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 production in U373 glioblastoma cells and that such antibodies were present in the blood of humans. We raised a hypothesis that α7 nAChR-specific antibody can cause neuroinflammation when penetrating the brain. To test this. C57Bl/6 mice were either immunized with extracellular domain of α7 nAChR subunit α7(1-208) or injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 5 months. We studied their behavior and the presence of α3. α4. α7. β2 and β4 nAChR subunits. Aβ40 and Aβ42 and activated astrocytes in the brain by sandwich ELISA and confocal microscopy.

Intravenously transferred α7 nAChR-specific-antibodies penetrated the brain parenchyma of mice pre-injected with LPS. Our data demonstrate that (1) neuroinflammation is sufficient to provoke the decrease of α7 and α4β2 nAChRs.

Inc.,Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been implicated in the regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB. a key regulator of the inflammatory process and adaptive immunity. However. no consensus exists regarding the regulatory role played by H2O2. We discuss how the experimental methodologies used to expose cells to H2O2 produce inconsistent results that are difficult to compare. and how the steady-state titration with H2O2 emerges as an adequate tool to overcome these problems. The redox targets of H2O2 in the NF-κB pathway—from the membrane to the post-translational modifications in both NF-κB and histones in the nucleus—are described. We also review how H2O2 acts as a specific regulator at the level of the single gene. and briefly discuss the implications of this regulation for human health in the context of κB polymorphisms.

1029671,Epigallocatechin-3-gallate as a potential therapeutic drug for TTR-related amyloidosis:“in vivo” evidence from FAP mice models,2012,Nelson Ferreira and Maria João Saraiva and Maria Rosário Almeida,7,PloS one,1,e29933,Public Library of Science,Background Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the extracellular deposition of mutant transthyretin (TTR). with special involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Currently. hepatic transplantation is considered the most efficient therapy to halt the progression of clinical symptoms in FAP since more than 95% of TTR is produced by the liver. However. less invasive and more reliable therapeutic approaches have been proposed for FAP therapy. namely based on drugs acting as inhibitors of amyloid formation or as amyloid disruptors. We have recently reported that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). the most abundant catechin in green tea. is able to inhibit TTR aggregation and fibril formation. “in vitro” and in a cellular system. and is also able to disrupt pre-formed amyloid fibrils “in vitro”.   Methodology and Principal Findings In the present study. we assessed the effect of EGCG subchronic administration on TTR amyloidogenesis “in vivo”. using well characterized animal models for FAP. Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (SQ-IHC) and Western blot analysis of mice tissues after treatment demonstrated that EGCG inhibits TTR toxic aggregates deposition in about 50% along the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Moreover EGCG treatment considerably lowered levels of several biomarkers associated with non-fibrillar TTR deposition. namely endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress. protein oxidation and apoptosis markers. Treatment of old FAP mice with EGCG resulted not only in the decrease of non-fibrillar TTR deposition but also in disaggregation of amyloid …,True,nwsg7VAAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,79,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029933,14829597518065227533,/scholar?cites=14829597518065227533,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029933,0,0,0

Since oxidative stress. apoptosis and inflammation are associated with transthyretin (TTR) deposition in Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (FAP). we investigated the possible TUDCA therapeutical application in this disease. We show by semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry and western blotting that administration of TUDCA to a transgenic mouse model of FAP decreased apoptotic and oxidative biomarkers usually associated with TTR deposition. namely the ER stress markers BiP and eIF2α. the Fas death receptor and oxidation products such as 3-nitrotyrosine. Most important. TUDCA treatment significantly reduced TTR toxic aggregates in as much as 75%.

It can lead to cardiac conduction disturbances. restrictive cardiomyopathy. and low output heart failure. The heart is variably involved during the development of systemic amyloidosis and seems to be more frequently affected in immunoglobulin (primary) than in reactive (secondary) amyloidosis. Amyloid is common in the elderly. Isolated atrial amyloid. for which a major subunit is the atrial natriuretic peptide. seems to be three times more frequent than senile cardiac amyloid. which is derived from normal prealbumin (transthyretin). Like polyneuropathy. cardiac amyloidosis is a prominent clinical feature of hereditary amyloidosis. namely of the autosomal dominant transthyretin (TTR) type. All 28 cases of TTR amyloidoses reported so far were heterozygotes for a single nucleotide change in the gene for TTR that resulted …,True,nwsg7VAAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,64,https://heart.bmj.com/content/70/2/111.short,4842520179457870309,/scholar?cites=4842520179457870309,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1025267/pdf/brheartj00020-0011.pdf,0,0,0

Current research suggests that antioxidant therapy may afford some level of protection against the toxicity of alcohol and alcoholic beverage in cellular and genomic levels. Seven day pregnant wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: control. ethanol and vitamin E treated alcoholic groups. Apoptosis. lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation amounts. as well as. catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were compared in male offspring hippocampus and cerebellum in the end of lactation. Offspring from ethanol-exposed animals showed significant increase in apoptosis. protein carbonyl and lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) in hippocampus and cerebellum than controls.

It was found that the biosorption capacities were significantly affected by solution pH. with pH 4 favoring higher mercury removal. Biosorption rate and kinetic were obtained from batch adsorption experiments. Kinetic and isotherm experiments were canied out at the optimal pH. Biosorption kinetic was found to be fast. with 90% of adsorption within 15 min and equilibrium reached at 30 min. Langmuir adsorption models was suitable for describing the short—term biosorption of mercury by the algal species. The results indicated that the biomass of Spirogym is suitable for the development of efficient biosorbent for the removal and recovery of mercury from wastewater.,True,Bte5YsQAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC,52,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bahman_Ramavandi/publication/26561530_Biosorption_of_Mercury_by_Biomass_of_Filamentous_Algae_Spirogyra_Species/links/0912f513e9bde2869d000000.pdf,2321190810762942118,/scholar?cites=2321190810762942118,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bahman_Ramavandi/publication/26561530_Biosorption_of_Mercury_by_Biomass_of_Filamentous_Algae_Spirogyra_Species/links/0912f513e9bde2869d000000.pdf,0,0,0
