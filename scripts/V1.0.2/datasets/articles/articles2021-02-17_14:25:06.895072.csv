This forward electron transfer is an essential process in light energy conversion. Meanwhile. backward electron transfer is also significant in photoprotection of PSII proteins. Modulation of the redox potential (Em) gap of QA and QB mainly regulates the forward and backward electron transfers in PSII.

We observed a spatially restricted structural remodeling of mitochondria in the apical tufts of CA1 PNs dendrites in the hAPPSWE.IND transgenic AD mouse model (J20). corresponding to the dendritic domain receiving presynaptic inputs from the entorhinal cortex and where the earliest synaptic loss is detected in vivo. We also observed significant loss of mitochondrial biomass in human neurons derived from a new model of human ES cells where CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome engineering was used to introduce the ‘Swedish’ mutation bi-allelically (APPSWE/SWE). Recent work uncovered that Aβ42o mediates synaptic loss by over-activating the CAMKK2-AMPK kinase dyad. and that AMPK is a central regulator of mitochondria homeostasis in non-neuronal cells. Here. we demonstrate that Aβ42o-dependent over-activation of CAMKK2-AMPK mediates synaptic loss through coordinated MFF-dependent mitochondrial fission and ULK2-dependent mitophagy in dendrites of PNs. We also found that the ability of Aβ42o-dependent mitochondrial remodeling to trigger synaptic loss requires the ability of AMPK to phosphorylate Tau on Serine 262.

Phosphoproteomic screening identifies Rab GTPases as novel downstream targets of PINK1 …,,YC Lai and C Kondapalli and R Lehneck and J Procter and BD Dill and HI Woodroof and R Gourlay,,,,,,Mutations in the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) are causative of autosomal recessive Parkinson’s disease (PD). We have previously reported that PINK1 is activated by mitochondrial depolarisation and phosphorylates serine 65 (Ser 65) of the ubiquitin ligase Parkin and ubiquitin to stimulate Parkin E3 ligase activity. Here. we have employed quantitative phosphoproteomics to search for novel PINK1-dependent phosphorylation targets in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells stimulated by mitochondrial depolarisation. This led to the identification of 14.213 phosphosites from 4.499 gene products. Whilst most phosphosites were unaffected. we strikingly observed three members of a sub-family of Rab GTPases namely Rab8A. 8B and 13 that are all phosphorylated at the highly conserved residue of serine 111 (Ser 111) in response to PINK1 activation. Using phospho-specific antibodies raised against Ser 111 of each of the Rabs. we demonstrate that Rab Ser 111 phosphorylation occurs specifically in response to PINK1 activation and is abolished in HeLa PINK1 knockout cells and mutant PINK1 PD patient-derived fibroblasts stimulated by mitochondrial depolarisation. We provide evidence that Rab8A GTPase Ser 111 phosphorylation is not directly regulated by PINK1 in vitro and demonstrate in cells the time course of Ser 111 phosphorylation of Rab8A. 8B and 13 is markedly delayed compared to phosphorylation of Parkin at Ser 65. We further show mechanistically that phosphorylation at Ser 111 significantly impairs Rab8A activation by its cognate guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF).

To search for unique structural features of the neuraminidase from this virus that might have contributed to its unusual virulence. we expressed this enzyme. The purified enzyme appeared as a monomer. a dimer and a tetramer. with only the tetramer being active and therefore biologically relevant. The monomer and the dimer could not be oligomerized into the tetramer in solution. suggesting that some unique structural features were required for oligomerization and activation. These features could be related to N-glycosylation. because the tetramer displayed different N-glycans than the monomer and the dimer. Furthermore. the tetramer was found to be resistant to trypsin digestion. which may give the virus the capability to invade tissues that are normally not infected by influenza viruses and make the virus more robust for …,True,ZN_nZGoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,38,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X08025400,8234045463222088868,/scholar?cites=8234045463222088868,,,0,0,0

An ADP-based phosphatase-coupled kinase assay is described here. In this assay. CD39L2. a nucleotidase. is added into a kinase reaction to hydrolyze ADP to AMP and phosphate. The phosphate is subsequently detected using malachite green phosphate-detection reagents. As ADP hydrolysis by CD39L2 displays a first-order rate constant. relatively simple equations are derived to calculate the coupling rate and the lagging time of the coupling reaction. allowing one to obtain kinase kinetic parameters without the completion of the coupling reaction. ATP inhibition of CD39L2-catalyzed ADP hydrolysis is also determined for correction of the kinetic data. As examples. human glucokinase.

Recent studies indicate that the non-reducing end of heparan sulfate might be the place where fibroblast growth factor signaling complex forms. The non-reducing end also changes with heparanase digestion and. thus. might serve as a marker for tumor pathology. Using high performance liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. we have identified and characterized the non-reducing end of bovine kidney heparan sulfate. We find that the non-reducing end region is highly sulfated and starts with a glucuronic acid (GlcA) residue.

We have developed a strategy to determine the structure of sulfotransferase recognition sites which constitute these motifs. Stable isotope is first introduced into specific sites on HS with HS sulfotransferases and the modified HS is then digested into oligosaccharides of differing sizes. The overlapping oligosaccharides containing the introduced stable isotope are identified by changes in the m/z profiles by mass spectrometry. and their relationships are elucidated. In this way. the HS structures in the vicinity of the sulfotransferase recognition site are quickly determined and groups on precursor structures of HS that direct the action of HS sulfotransferases are pinpointed.,True,ZN_nZGoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820687440,4447310662203367280,/scholar?cites=4447310662203367280,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820687440,0,0,0

Here. we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying cell cycle inhibition in young proliferating leaves of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana when subjected to mild osmotic stress. A detailed cellular analysis demonstrated that as soon as osmotic stress is sensed. cell cycle progression rapidly arrests. but cells are kept in a latent ambivalent state allowing a quick recovery (pause). Remarkably. cell cycle arrest coincides with an increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate levels and the activation of ethylene signaling.

Recent advances have highlighted the similarity between AMPs and amyloid proteins. Using the Eosinophil Cationic Protein as a model. we have rationalized the structure-activity relationships between amyloid aggregation and antimicrobial activity. Our results show how protein aggregation can induce bacteria agglutination and cell death. Using confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy we have tracked the formation in situ of protein amyloid-like aggregates at the bacteria surface and on membrane models. In both cases. fibrillar aggregates able to bind to amyloid diagnostic dyes were detected. Additionally. a single point mutation (Ile13 to Ala) can suppress the protein amyloid behavior. abolishing the agglutinating activity and impairing the antimicrobial action. The mutant is also defective in triggering both leakage and lipid vesicle aggregation. We conclude that ECP aggregation at the bacterial surface is essential for its cytotoxicity.

In addition to its direct antimicrobial action. AMPs can modulate the host immune response by promoting or restraining the recruitment of cells and chemicals to the infection focus. Binding of AMPs to lipopolysaccharide is a critical step for both their antimicrobial action and their immunomodulatory properties. On the one hand. removal of Gram-negative bacteria by AMPs can be an effective strategy to prevent a worsened inflammatory response that may lead to septic shock. On the other hand. by neutralizing circulating endotoxins. AMPs can successfully reduce nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-α production. hence preventing severe tissue damage. Furthermore.

Vertebrate RNases. while sharing the active site architecture. are found to display a variety of noncatalytical biological properties. providing an excellent example of multitask proteins. The antibacterial activity of distant related RNases suggested that the family evolved from an ancestral host-defence function. The review provides a structural insight into antimicrobial RNases. taking as a reference the human RNase 3. also named eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). A particular high binding affinity against bacterial wall structures mediates the protein action. In particular. the interaction with the lipopolysaccharides at the Gram-negative outer membrane correlates with the protein antimicrobial and specific cell agglutinating activity. Although a direct mechanical action at the bacteria wall seems to be sufficient to trigger bacterial death. a potential intracellular target cannot be discarded. Indeed. the cationic clusters at the protein surface may serve both to interact with nucleic acids and cell surface heterosaccharides.

The so-called histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). best known for their roles in controlling chromatin remodeling via histone acetylation/deacetylation. are now known to modify a large number of non-histone proteins to control diverse cell processes. In relation to inflammation. acetylation modulates the activity or function of cytokine receptors. nuclear hormone receptors. intracellular signaling molecules and transcription factors. Small molecule inhibitors of HDACs have been found to trigger both pro- and antiinflammatory effects in a range of inflammation-relevant cell types.

N. and O near-edge ion yield spectroscopy of 8+ selected electrosprayed cations of cytochrome c protein (12 kDa) has been performed by coupling a linear quadrupole ion trap with a soft X-ray beamline. The photoactivation tandem mass spectra were recorded as a function of the photon energy. Photoionization of the precursor. accompanied by CO2 loss. is the dominant relaxation process. showing high photoion stability following direct or resonant photoionization. The partial ion yields extracted from recorded mass spectra show significantly different behaviors for single and double ionization channels. which can be qualitatively explained by different Auger decay mechanisms. However. the single ionization spectra reveal characteristic structures when compared to existing near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectra from thin films of peptides and proteins.

These biopolymers have emerged as new polymeric materials with novel and unique physical characteristics that have found extensive applications. In marine microorganisms the produced EPS provide an instrument to survive in adverse conditions: They are found to envelope the cells by allowing the entrapment of nutrients or the adhesion to solid substrates. Even if the processes of synthesis and release of exopolysaccharides request high-energy investments for the bacterium. these biopolymers permit resistance under extreme environmental conditions. Marine bacteria like Bacillus. Halomonas. Planococcus. Enterobacter. Alteromonas. Pseudoalteromonas. Vibrio. Rhodococcus.

Using insulated electrodes. we are able to determine kinetic parameters for cytochrome c with remarkable precision and experimental ease. In spite of considerable amino acid sequence differences. the cytochromes c from horse. tuna. and yeast have identical reorganization energies (0.61 eV) and electronic coupling terms.

This uncommon trait for a RNA virus provides influenza with the advantage of access to the nuclear machinery during replication. However. it also increases the complexity of the intracellular trafficking that is required for the viral components to establish a productive infection. The influenza genome segmentation makes the additional trafficking requirements especially challenging. as each viral RNA (vRNA) gene segment must navigate the network of cellular membrane barriers during the processes of entry and assembly. To accomplish this goal. influenza A viruses (IAVs) utilize a combination of viral and cellular mechanisms to coordinate the transport of their proteins and the eight vRNA gene segments in and out of the cell. The aim of this review is to present the current mechanistic understanding for how IAVs facilitate cell entry. replication. virion assembly and intercellular movement. in an effort to highlight some of the unanswered questions regarding the coordination of the IAV infection process.,True,XOkZOt0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,160,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01581/full,11217827755418466240,/scholar?cites=11217827755418466240,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01581/full,0,0,0

Here. we demonstrate that SV40 expresses a novel later protein termed VP4 that triggers the timely lytic release of its progeny. Like VP3. VP4 synthesis initiates from a downstream AUG start codon within the VP2 transcript and localizes to the nucleus. However. VP4 expression occurs ∼24 h later at a time that coincides with cell lysis. and it is not incorporated into mature virions. Mutation of the VP4 initiation codon from the SV40 genome delayed lysis by 2 d and reduced infectious particle release. Furthermore. the co-expression of VP4 and VP3. but not their individual expression. recapitulated cell lysis in bacteria. Thus. SV40 regulates its life cycle by the later temporal expression of VP4. which results in cell lysis and enables the 50-nm virus to exit the cell.

This counteraction is commonly achieved by the expression of viral proteins capable of sequestering host ubiquitin E3 ligases and their regulators. In particular. many viruses hijack members of the Cullin-RING E3 Ligase (CRL) family. Viruses interact in many ways with CRLs in order to impact their ligase activity; one key recurring interaction involves re-directing CRL complexes to degrade host targets that are otherwise not degraded within host cells. Removal of host immune factors by this mechanism creates a more amenable cellular environment for viral propagation. To date. a small number of target host factors have been identified. many of which are degraded via a CRL-proteasome pathway. Substantial effort within the field is ongoing to uncover the identities of further host proteins targeted in this fashion and the underlying mechanisms driving their turnover by the UPS. Elucidation of these targets and mechanisms will provide appealing anti-viral therapeutic opportunities. This review is focused on the many methods used by viruses to perturb host CRLs. focusing on substrate sequestration and viral regulation of E3 activity.

Because these host-pathogen interactions are extensive and interactions between human proteins are found within many different databases. it is difficult to generate integrated HIV-human interaction networks. We have developed a web-based platform. termed GPS-Prot                      http://www.gpsprot.org                                        . that allows for facile integration of different HIV interaction data types as well as inclusion of interactions between human proteins derived from publicly-available databases. including MINT. BioGRID and HPRD. The software has the ability to group proteins into functional modules or protein complexes. generating more intuitive network representations and also allows for the uploading of user-generated data. GPS-Prot is a software tool that allows users to easily create comprehensive and integrated HIV-host networks. A major advantage of this platform compared to other visualization tools is its web-based format. which requires no software installation or data downloads. GPS-Prot allows novice users to quickly generate networks that combine both genetic and protein-protein interactions between HIV and its human host into a single representation.

They are estimated to contribute to the destruction of~ 14% of the world’s annual crop production and transmit many pathogens. Presently. arthropod pests of agricultural and health significance are controlled predominantly through the use of chemical insecticides. Unfortunately. the widespread use of these agrochemicals has resulted in genetic selection pressure that has led to the development of insecticide-resistant arthropods. as well as concerns over human health and the environment. Bioinsecticides represent a new generation of insecticides that utilise organisms or their derivatives (eg. transgenic plants. recombinant baculoviruses. toxin-fusion proteins and peptidomimetics) and show promise as environmentally-friendly alternatives to conventional agrochemicals. Spider-venom peptides are now being investigated as potential sources of bioinsecticides. With an estimated 100.000 species. spiders are one of the most successful arthropod predators. Their venom has proven to be a rich source of hyperstable insecticidal mini-proteins that cause insect paralysis or lethality through the modulation of ion channels. receptors and enzymes.

To determine how the abundance of shrubland birds varies with habitat within ROW corridors and with land use patterns surrounding corridors. we ran Poisson regression models on data from 93 plots on ROWs and compared regression coefficients. We also determined nest success rates on a 1-km stretch of ROW. Seven species of shrubland birds were common in powerline corridors. However. the nest success rates for prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor) and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) were <21%. which is too low to compensate for estimated annual mortality. Some shrubland bird species were more abundant on narrower ROWs or at sites with lower vegetation or particular types of vegetation. indicating that vegetation management could be refined to favor species of high conservation priority. Also. several species were more abundant in ROWs traversing unfragmented forest than those near residential areas or farmland. indicating that corridors in heavily forested regions may provide better habitat for these species. In the area where we monitored nests. brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) occurred more frequently close to a residential area.

Although spiders have deployed insecticidal toxins in their venoms for over 250 million years. there is no evolutionary selection pressure on these toxins to possess oral activity since they are injected into prey and predators via a hypodermic needle-like fang. Thus. it has been assumed that spider-venom peptides are not orally active and are therefore unlikely to be useful insecticides. Contrary to this dogma. we show that it is possible to isolate spider-venom peptides with high levels of oral insecticidal activity by directly screening for per os toxicity. Using this approach. we isolated a 34-residue orally active insecticidal peptide (OAIP-1) from venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes. The oral LD50 for OAIP-1 in the agronomically important cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera was 104.2±0.6 pmol/g. which is the highest per os activity reported to date for an insecticidal venom peptide. OAIP-1 is equipotent with synthetic pyrethroids and it acts synergistically with neonicotinoid insecticides. The three-dimensional structure of OAIP-1 determined using NMR spectroscopy revealed that the three disulfide bonds form an inhibitor cystine knot motif; this structural motif provides the peptide with a high level of biological stability that probably contributes to its oral activity. OAIP-1 is likely to be synergized by the gut-lytic activity of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry toxin (Bt) expressed in insect-resistant transgenic crops. and consequently it might be a …,True,Btc69bYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,48,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073136,1284751748900266224,/scholar?cites=1284751748900266224,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073136,0,0,0

1038410,SVM-based prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins identifies toxin innovation in an Australian tarantula,2013,Emily SW Wong and Margaret C Hardy and David Wood and Timothy Bailey and Glenn F King,8,PLOS One,7,e66279,Public Library of Science,Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic. the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts. without resorting to protein sequencing. the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines. hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Furthermore. we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80% sensitivity and 99.6% 8-mer specificity.

1038412,A review of chemical control options for invasive social insects in island ecosystems,2009,MC Gentz,133,,4,229-235,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Social insects present unique challenges to chemically based management strategies. especially because fast‐acting compounds commonly applied for many pest insects may not be the most effective for colony elimination. The reproductive caste of a colony is the most protected from direct damage by insecticides. and compounds that cause rapid mortality among foragers frequently do not impact the reproductive members or even markedly reduce overall colony size. With recent bans on persistent insecticides that previously have been used to control social insects. especially termites. new compounds must be used. Island and coastal ecosystems are particularly sensitive to the effects of widespread pesticide use and concerns about unintentional water pollution and runoff are common. and international attention is being paid to developing sustainable pesticide options for agricultural and urban pest insects in …,True,Btc69bYAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,28,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0418.2008.01326.x,13811002579874277759,/scholar?cites=13811002579874277759,,https://littlefireants.com/wp-content/uploads/Gentz-2009_compressed.pdf,0,0,0

The minimal ‘cap0’ consists of N7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide via a 5′-5′ triphosphate (ppp) bridge. Cap0 is further modified by 2′-O-methylation of the next two riboses. yielding ‘cap1’ (m7GpppNmN) and ‘cap2’ (m7GpppNmNm). However. some viral RNAs lack 2′-O-methylation. whereas others contain only ppp- at their 5′-end. Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are highly expressed effectors of innate immunity that inhibit viral replication by incompletely understood mechanisms.

A low pKa means higher availability of the thiolate at neutral pH but often a lower nucleophilicity. Protein structural factors contribute to increasing the reactivity of the thiol in very specific reactions. but these factors do not provide an indiscriminate augmentation in general reactivity. Notably. reduction of hydroperoxides by the catalytic cysteine of peroxiredoxins can achieve extraordinary reaction rates relative to free cysteine. The discussion of this catalytic efficiency has centered in the stabilization of the thiolate as a way to increase nucleophilicity. Such stabilization originates from electrostatic and polar interactions of the catalytic cysteine with the protein environment.

Any structural change that could affect their redox state. oligomeric structure. and/or interaction with other proteins could have a significant impact on the cascade of signaling events. Several post-translational modifications have been reported to modulate Prx activity. One of these. overoxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine to the sulfinic derivative. inactivates the enzyme and has been proposed as a mechanism of H2O2 accumulation in redox signaling (the floodgate hypothesis). Nitration of Prx has been reported in vitro as well as in vivo; in particular. nitrated Prx2 was identified in brains of Alzheimer disease patients.

Nucleophilicity of the thiolate is measured as the pH-independent second-order rate constant of its reaction with mBBr. The ionization constants of the thiols are obtained through the pH dependence of either second-order rate constant or initial rate of reaction. For readily available thiols. the apparent second-order rate constant is measured at different pHs and then plotted and fitted to an appropriate pH function describing the observed number of ionization equilibria. For less available thiols. such as protein thiols. the initial rate of reaction is determined in a wide range of pHs and fitted to the appropriate pH function.

1038467,Regulated methionine oxidation by monooxygenases,2017,Bruno Manta and Vadim N Gladyshev,109,,,141-155,Pergamon,Protein function can be regulated via post-translational modifications by numerous enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. including oxidation of cysteine and methionine residues. Redox-dependent regulatory mechanisms have been identified for nearly every cellular process. but the major paradigm has been that cellular components are oxidized (damaged) by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a relatively unspecific way. and then reduced (repaired) by designated reductases. While this scheme may work with cysteine. it cannot be ascribed to other residues. such as methionine. whose reaction with ROS is too slow to be biologically relevant. However. methionine is clearly oxidized in vivo and enzymes for its stereoselective reduction are present in all three domains of life.

A reappraisal and future perspectives,2014,Angela Risso and Annarita Ciana and Cesare Achilli and Guglielmo Antonutto and Giampaolo Minetti,5,,,54,Frontiers,Neocytolysis is the hypothesis formulated to explain experimental evidence of selective lysis of young red blood cells (RBCs) (neocytes) associated with decreased plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO). In humans. it appears to take place whenever a fast RBC mass reduction is required. i.e. in astronauts during the first days of spaceflight under weightlessness. where a fast reduction in plasma volume and increase in haematocrit occur. EPO plasma levels then decline and a decrease in RBC mass takes place. apparently because of the selective lysis of the youngest. recently generated RBCs (neocytes). The same process seems to occur in people descending to sea level after acclimatization at high altitude. After descent. the polycythaemia developed at high altitude must be abrogated. and a rapid reduction in the number of circulating RBCs is obtained by a decrease in EPO synthesis and the lysis of what seem to be young RBCs. In vivo. neocytolysis seems to be abolished by EPO administration. More recent research has ascribed to neocytolysis the RBC destruction that occurs under such disparate pathophysiologic conditions as nephropathy. severe obstructive pulmonary disease. blood doping. and even malaria anaemia. According to the theory. EPO’s central role would be not only to stimulate the production of new RBCs in conditions of anaemia. as maintained by the orthodox view. but also that of a cytoprotective factor for circulating young RBCs. Why neocytes are specifically destroyed and how is this related to decreased EPO levels has not yet been elucidated.

We found that threonine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) metabolism are coupled in pluripotent stem cells. resulting in regulation of histone methylation. Isotope labeling of mESCs revealed that threonine provides a substantial fraction of both the cellular glycine and the acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) needed for SAM synthesis. Depletion of threonine from the culture medium or threonine dehydrogenase (Tdh) from mESCs decreased accumulation of SAM and decreased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). leading to slowed growth and increased differentiation.

Here. we demonstrate that mTORC1 promotes lipid biogenesis via SRPK2. a key regulator of RNA-binding SR proteins. mTORC1-activated S6K1 phosphorylates SRPK2 at Ser494. which primes Ser497 phosphorylation by CK1. These phosphorylation events promote SRPK2 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of SR proteins. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals that lipid biosynthetic enzymes are among the downstream targets of mTORC1-SRPK2 signaling. Mechanistically. SRPK2 promotes SR protein binding to U1-70K to induce splicing of lipogenic pre-mRNAs.

PARK2 depletion contributes to AMPK-mediated activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species. and a concomitant increase in oxidized nitric oxide levels. thereby promoting the inhibition of PTEN by S-nitrosylation and ubiquitination.

The proteins are modelled as spheres. each having a central monopole carrying the net charge and two dipolar charges imbedded 1.0 Á inside the protein surface. The magnitudes of the monopole and dipole moments generated by this simplified charge distribution are determined directly from the X-ray crystallographic coordinates of the proteins by assigning partial charges to each non-hydrogen atom. Solvent electrolyte effects are modelled by using the Debye-Hiickel screening law modified to include the effect of the large ion-exclusion sizes of macromolecules.

The emergence of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). which are believed to play a crucial role in several different biological processes. has made the regulation of gene expression more complex. Although the function of lncRNAs is still rather elusive. their broad involvement in the initiation and progression of various cancers is clear. They are also involved in the pathogenesis of cancers of the female reproductive system. LncRNAs play a critical physiological role in apoptosis. metastasis. invasion. migration and cell proliferation in these cancers. Different expression profiles of lncRNAs have been observed in various types of tumors compared with normal tissues and between malignant and benign tumors. These differential expression patterns may lead to the promotion or suppression of cancer development and tumorigenesis.

When platinated. tubulin does not assemble into microtubules (direct electron microscopic studies). In place of them. highly stable and inert circled rings arise. Such tubulin aggregates are unable to participate in the process of chromosome separation during the mitosis. thus blocking cell division in living cells. which is a direct evidence of cisplatin antitumor activity. Cisplatin attack on tubulin causing blockage of tubulin assembly occurs via a two-step binding to GTP in the GTP center of tubulin (195Pt. 31P NMR studies). The calculated binding rates are close to those reported in cisplatin–DNA interactions.

The reaction between Mg. CH3F gives rise to a triplet complex which has a lower energythan the corresponding singlet complex at MgFCH3 angles ranging from 60 to 139°. The transition from thesinglet branch of the reaction to the nonequilibrium triplet branch results in decomposition of CH3F with formation of various final products.

Tubulin polymerization starts upon binding Mg2+ with the tubulin guanosine triphosphate (GTP) site.

Enzymatic transesterification can be a technological option to produce trans free fats targeting commercial applications. Palm stearin and palm olein blends in different ratios were enzymatically transesterified in a solvent free system using a Rhizopus oryzae lipase immobilised onto CaCO3 to produce a suitable fat for margarine formulation. Slip melting points and triacylglycerols profiles were evaluated upon transesterification. Results indicated that all transesterified blends had lower slip melting points than their non transesterified counterparts. Furthermore. the triacylglycerols profile showed a decrease in the concentration of the high melting point triacylglycerols. The rheological analysis showed that margarine prepared with the transesterified blend showed a better spreadability than that of a control margarine prepared with non transesterified fat. Adding powder of dry bark orange to margarine preparation improved its colour and fairly affected its spreadability and rheological behaviour. The margarine prepared with transesterified fat displayed a rheological behaviour that was comparable to that of commercial sample.

E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) proteins. Polyubiquitination of target proteins is also implicated in several critical cellular processes. Although Arabidopsis genome research has estimated more than 1.300 proteins involved in ubiquitination. little is known about the biochemical functions of these proteins. Here we demonstrate a novel. simple and high-sensitive method for in vitro analysis of ubiquitination and polyubiquitination based on wheat cell-free protein synthesis and luminescent detection. Using wheat cell-free synthesis. 11 E3 proteins from Arabidopsis full-length cDNA templates were produced. These proteins were analyzed either in the translation mixture or purified recombinant protein from the translation mixture. In our luminescent method using FLAG- or His-tagged and biotinylated ubiquitins. the polyubiquitin chain on AtUBC22. UPL5 and UPL7 (HECT) and CIP8 (RING) was detected. Also. binding of ubiquitin to these proteins was detected using biotinylated ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged recombinant protein. Furthermore. screening of the RING 6 subgroup demonstrated that At1g55530 was capable of polyubiquitin chain formation like CIP8. Interestingly. these ubiquitinations were carried out without the addition of exogenous E1 and/or E2 proteins. indicating that these enzymes were endogenous to the wheat cell-free system.

Also. we demonstrate that SATB1. a protein factor that has been implicated in the formation of network like higher order chromatin structures at some gene loci. takes part in β-globin specific inter-MAR association through binding the specific MARs. Knocking down of SATB1 obviously reduces the binding of SATB1 to the MARs and diminishes the frequency of the inter-MAR association.

GabR is a member of the understudied MocR/GabR subfamily of the GntR family of transcription regulators. A typical MocR/GabR-type regulator is a chimeric protein containing a short N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain and a long C-terminal pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-binding putative aminotransferase domain. In the presence of PLP and GABA. GabR activates the gabTD operon. which allows the bacterium to use GABA as nitrogen and carbon sources. GabR binds to its own promoter and represses gabR transcription in the absence of GABA.

Substrate selectivity was evaluated using steady-state kinetic constants for hydrolysis of N-acyl-homoserine lactones (HSLs) and p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters. PvdQ prefers substrates with alkyl chains between 12 and 14 carbons long that do not bear a 3-oxo substitution and is revealed here to have a relatively high specificity constant for selected N-acyl-HSLs (kcat/KM = 105 to 106 M–1 s–1).

Interfering intracellular PPIs with small molecules has been extremely difficult for larger or flat binding sites. as antibodies cannot cross the cell membrane to reach such target sites. In recent years. peptides smaller size and balance of conformational rigidity and flexibility have made them promising candidates for targeting challenging binding interfaces with satisfactory binding affinity and specificity. Deciphering and characterizing peptide–protein recognition mechanisms is thus central for the invention of peptide-based strategies to interfere with endogenous protein interactions. or improvement of the binding affinity and specificity of existing approaches. Importantly. a variety of computation-aided rational designs for peptide therapeutics have been developed. which aim to deliver comprehensive docking for peptide–protein interaction interfaces. Over 60 peptides have been approved and administrated globally in clinics. Despite this. advances in various docking models are only on the merge of making their contribution to peptide drug development. In this review. we provide (i) a holistic overview of peptide drug development and the fundamental technologies utilized to date. and (ii) an updated review on key developments of computational modeling of peptide–protein interactions (PepPIs) with an aim to assist experimental biologists exploit suitable docking methods to advance peptide interfering strategies against PPIs.

In this study. we found that nickel oxide (NiO) significantly improved 2.4-D degradation and mineralization in reaction with ozone. Other metal oxides. such as titania. silica and alumina. were also tested in this reaction. so that. the mineralization degree was almost the same for all of them (ca. 25%). whereas NiO showed more than 60% in 1 h. These outstanding results led us to study in more depth the role of NiO as catalyst in the degradation of 2.4-D. For instance. the optimum NiO loading amount was 0.3 g L−1. The catalytic ozonation showed a high stability after three reaction cycles. With the aim of identifying the surface species responsible for the high activity of NiO. besides knowing the byproducts during the degradation of 2.4-D.

Therefore. proteins interacting with COP1 could be important regulators of light-dependent development. Here. we identify CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3) as a novel interaction partner of COP1. A green fluorescent protein–COL3 fusion protein colocalizes with COP1 to nuclear speckles when transiently expressed in plant cells. This localization requires the B-box domains in COL3. indicating a novel function of this domain. A loss-of-function col3 mutant has longer hypocotyls in red light and in short days. Unlike constans. the col3 mutant flowers early and shows a reduced number of lateral branches in short days. The mutant also exhibits reduced formation of lateral roots.

1038690,Opposite root growth phenotypes of hy5 versus hy5 hyh mutants correlate with increased constitutive auxin signaling,2006,Richard Sibout and Poornima Sukumar and Chamari Hettiarachchi and Magnus Holm and Gloria K Muday and Christian S Hardtke,2,PLoS Genet,11,e202,Public Library of Science,The Arabidopsis transcription factor HY5 controls light-induced gene expression downstream of photoreceptors and plays an important role in the switch of seedling shoots from dark-adapted to light-adapted development. In addition. HY5 has been implicated in plant hormone signaling. accounting for the accelerated root system growth phenotype of hy5 mutants. Mutants in the close HY5 homolog HYH resemble wild-type. despite the largely similar expression patterns and levels of HY5 and HYH. and the functional equivalence of the respective proteins. Moreover. the relative contribution of HYH to the overall activity of the gene pair is increased by an alternative HYH transcript. which encodes a stabilized protein. Consistent with the enhanced root system growth observed in hy5 loss-of-function mutants. constitutively overexpressed alternative HYH inhibits root system growth. Paradoxically. however. in double mutants carrying hy5 and hyh null alleles. the hy5 root growth phenotype is suppressed rather than enhanced. Even more surprisingly. compared to wild-type. root system growth is diminished in hy5 hyh double mutants. In addition. the double mutants display novel shoot phenotypes that are absent from either single mutant. These include cotyledon fusions and defective vasculature. which are typical for mutants in genes involved in the transcriptional response to the plant hormone auxin. Indeed. many auxin-responsive and auxin signaling genes are misexpressed in hy5 mutants. and at a higher number and magnitude in hy5 hyh mutants.

How plants integrate the external light signal with endogenous ABA pathway for better adaptation and survival remains poorly understood. Here. we show that BBX21 (also known as SALT TOLERANCE HOMOLOG 2). a B-box (BBX) protein previously shown to positively regulate seedling photomorphogenesis. is also involved in ABA signaling. Our genetic data show that BBX21 may act upstream of several ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI) genes and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) in ABA control of seed germination. Previous studies showed that HY5 acts as a direct activator of ABI5 expression. and that BBX21 interacts with HY5. We further demonstrate that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. In addition. ABI5 was shown to directly activate its own expression. whereas BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by directly interacting with ABI5. Together. our study indicates that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter and that these transcriptional regulators work in concert to integrate light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana.,True,T6skTrQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,113,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004197,2819729027130337282,/scholar?cites=2819729027130337282,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004197,0,0,0

In this paper one such model is considered where inelastic deformations are accounted for via conservation laws for elastic strain with relaxation source terms. Plastic deformations are governed by the relaxation time of tangential stresses. Compared with alternative Eulerian conservative models. the governing system consists of fewer equations overall.

One segment that seemed particularly rich in strain-specific genes was found by comparing the first two sequenced Helicobacter pylori genomes (strains 26695 and J99) and was named a “plasticity zone”.  Principal Findings We studied the nature and evolution of plasticity zones by sequencing them in five more Helicobacter strains. determining their locations in additional strains. and identifying them in recently released genome sequences. They occurred as discrete units. inserted at numerous chromosomal sites. and were usually flanked by direct repeats of 5′AAGAATG. a sequence generally also present in one copy at unoccupied sites in other strains. This showed that plasticity zones are transposable elements. to be called TnPZs. Each full length TnPZ contained a cluster of type IV protein secretion genes (tfs3). a tyrosine recombinase family gene (“xerT”). and a large (≥2800 codon) orf encoding a protein with helicase and DNA methylase domains. plus additional orfs with no homology to genes of known function. Several TnPZ types were found that differed in gene arrangement or DNA sequence. Our analysis also indicated that the first-identified plasticity zones (in strains 26695 and J99) are complex mosaics of TnPZ remnants. formed by multiple TnPZ insertions. and spontaneous and transposable element mediated deletions.

Algal monocultures are difficult to maintain because they are easily contaminated by wild algal strains. grazers. and pathogens. In contrast. theory suggests that polycultures (multispecies assemblages) can promote both ecosystem stability and productivity. A greater understanding of species interactions and how communities change with time needs to be developed. Ultimately a predictive model of community interactions is needed to harness the capacity of biodiversity to enhance productivity of algal polycultures at industrial scales.

Our observations suggest that some ribosomal protein genes have been conserved stringently in the several phylogenetic lines examined. These genes apparently were established early in evolution and encode products that are fundamental to the translational apparatus.

Though anti-cancer potential of many such similar constituents has been demonstrated. critical biochemical targets and exact mechanism for their apoptosis-inducing actions have not been fully elucidated. The present study was aimed to investigate if PN induced apoptosis in cervical cancer cells (HeLa) of human origin. It is demonstrated that PN at increasing dose effectivity reduced the cell viability as well as GSH and NO2- levels. Condensed nuclei with fragmented chromatin and changes in mitochondrial matrix morphology clearly indicated the role of mitochondria in PN induced apoptosis. A marked reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS production after PN treatment showed involvement of free radicals. which in turn further augment ROS levels. PN treatment resulted in DNA damage. which could have been triggered by an increase in ROS levels. Decrease in apoptotic cells in the presence of caspase 3 inhibitor in PN-treated cells suggested that PN induced apoptosis via caspase dependent pathways. Additionally. a significant increase in the expression of proteins of extrinsic (TRAIL R1/DR4. TRAIL R2/DR5. TNF RI/TNFRSF1A. FADD. Fas/TNFRSF6) and intrinsic pathway (Bad. Bax. HTRA2/Omi. SMAC/Diablo. cytochrome C. Pro-Caspase-3. Cleaved Caspase-3) was observed in the cells exposed to PN.

DNA is translocated into the empty procapsid through the portal ring channel to high density.

Here. structural studies reveal that H3K36 specificity for KDM2A is mediated by the U-shaped threading of the H3K36 peptide through a catalytic groove within KDM2A. The side chain of methylated K36 inserts into the catalytic pocket occupied by Ni2+ and cofactor. where it is positioned and oriented for demethylation. Key residues contributing to K36me specificity on histone H3 are G33 and G34 (positioned within a narrow channel). P38 (a turn residue). and Y41 (inserts into its own pocket).

Proteins also can move on DNA by multiple cycles of dissociation/reassociation within the same chain. To distinguish these pathways. a strategy was developed to analyze protein motion between DNA sites. The strategy reveals whether the protein maintains contact with the DNA as it transfers from one site to another by sliding or whether it loses contact by a dissociation/reassociation step. In reactions at low salt. the test protein stayed on the DNA as it traveled between sites. but only when the sites were <50 bp apart.

We report here that non-specific DNA conveys proteins to their target sites just as well when held near the target by catenation as when co-linear with the target. Hence. contrary to the prevalent view. proteins move from random to specific sites primarily by threedimensional (3D) rather than 1D pathways. by multiple dissociation/re-association events within a single DNA molecule.

How the oxidized SoxR returns to and is maintained in its reduced state has been under question. To identity genes that constitute the SoxR-reducing system. we screened an E. coli mutant library carrying a chromosomal soxSp:: lacZ fusion. for constitutive mutants. Mutations mapped to two loci: the rsxABCDGE operon (named for reducer of SoxR) that is highly homologous to the rnfABCDGE operon in Rhodobacter capsulatus involved in transferring electrons to nitrogenase. and the rseC gene in the rpoEąrseABC operon. In-frame deletion of each open reading frame in the rsxABCDGE operon produced a similar constitutive phenotype.

1038802,Underlying mechanism of antimicrobial activity of chitosan microparticles and implications for the treatment of infectious diseases,2014,Soo Jin Jeon and Manhwan Oh and Won-Sik Yeo and Klibs N Galvao and Kwang Cheol Jeong,9,PLoS One,3,e92723,Public Library of Science,The emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms is a great public health concern and has triggered an urgent need to develop alternative antibiotics. Chitosan microparticles (CM). derived from chitosan. have been shown to reduce E. coli O157:H7 shedding in a cattle model. indicating potential use as an alternative antimicrobial agent. However. the underlying mechanism of CM on reducing the shedding of this pathogen remains unclear. To understand the mode of action. we studied molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial activity of CM using in vitro and in vivo methods. We report that CM are an effective bactericidal agent with capability to disrupt cell membranes. Binding assays and genetic studies with an ompA mutant strain demonstrated that outer membrane protein OmpA of E. coli O157:H7 is critical for CM binding. and this binding activity is coupled with a bactericidal effect of CM. This activity was also demonstrated in an animal model using cows with uterine diseases. CM treatment effectively reduced shedding of intrauterine pathogenic E. coli (IUPEC) in the uterus compared to antibiotic treatment. Since Shiga-toxins encoded in the genome of bacteriophage is often overexpressed during antibiotic treatment. antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended because of high risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. However. CM treatment did not induce bacteriophage or Shiga-toxins in E. coli O157:H7; suggesting that CM can be a potential candidate to treat infections caused by this pathogen. This work establishes an underlying mechanism whereby CM exert antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. providing significant insight for the …,True,wTG5BM0AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,127,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092723,12128719538574524676,/scholar?cites=12128719538574524676,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092723,0,0,0

Here we show that calprotectin can also enhance the activity of the SaeRS two component system (TCS). a signaling system essential for production of over 20 virulence factors in S. aureus. The activity of the SaeRS TCS is repressed by certain divalent ions found in blood or neutrophil granules; however. the Zn bound-form of calprotectin relieves this repression. During staphylococcal encounter with murine neutrophils or staphylococcal infection of the murine peritoneal cavity. calprotectin increases the activity of the SaeRS TCS as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α. resulting in higher murine mortality.

PhoQ is the sensor kinase/phosphatase that modifies the phosphorylation state of the regulator PhoP in response to stimuli. The amount of phosphorylated PhoP surges after activation. then declines to reach a steady-state level. We now recapitulate this surge in vitro by incubating PhoP and PhoQ with ATP and ADP. Mathematical modeling identified PhoQ's affinity for ADP as the key parameter dictating phosphorylated PhoP levels. as ADP promotes PhoQ's phosphatase activity toward phosphorylated PhoP. The lid covering the nucleotide-binding pocket of PhoQ governs the kinase to phosphatase switch because a lid mutation that decreased ADP binding compromised PhoQ's phosphatase activity in vitro and resulted in sustained expression of PhoP-dependent mRNAs in vivo.

1038809,The extracytoplasmic linker peptide of the sensor protein SaeS tunes the kinase activity required for staphylococcal virulence in response to host signals,2015,Qian Liu and Hoonsik Cho and Won-Sik Yeo and Taeok Bae,11,PLoS Pathog,4,e1004799,Public Library of Science,Bacterial pathogens often employ two-component systems (TCSs). typically consisting of a sensor kinase and a response regulator. to control expression of a set of virulence genes in response to changing host environments. In Staphylococcus aureus. the SaeRS TCS is essential for in vivo survival of the bacterium. The intramembrane-sensing histidine kinase SaeS contains. along with a C-terminal kinase domain. a simple N-terminal domain composed of two transmembrane helices and a nine amino acid-long extracytoplasmic linker peptide. As a molecular switch. SaeS maintains low but significant basal kinase activity and increases its kinase activity in response to inducing signals such as human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1). Here we show that the linker peptide of SaeS controls SaeS’s basal kinase activity and that the amino acid sequence of the linker peptide is highly optimized for its function. Without the linker peptide. SaeS displays aberrantly elevated kinase activity even in the absence of the inducing signal. and does not respond to HNP1. Moreover. SaeS variants with alanine substitution of the linker peptide amino acids exhibit altered basal kinase activity and/or irresponsiveness to HNP1. Biochemical assays reveal that those SaeS variants have altered autokinase and phosphotransferase activities. Finally. animal experiments demonstrate that the linker peptide-mediated fine tuning of SaeS kinase activity is critical for survival of the pathogen. Our results indicate that the function of the linker peptide in SaeS is a highly evolved feature with very optimized amino acid sequences. and we propose that. in other SaeS-like intramembrane …,True,wTG5BM0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,31,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004799,1218771569189122244,/scholar?cites=1218771569189122244,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004799,0,0,0

ATF4 upregulation by p62 deficiency in the stroma activates glucose carbon flux through a pyruvate carboxylase-asparagine synthase cascade that results in asparagine generation as a source of nitrogen for stroma and tumor epithelial proliferation.

The crystal structure of a complex of actinidin and E-64 has been determined at 1.86-Á resolution by using the difference Fourier method and refined to an/^-factor of 14.5%. The electron density map clearly shows that theC2 atom of the E-64 epoxide ring is covalently bonded to the S atom of the active-site cysteine 25. The charged carboxyl group of E-64 forms four H-bonds with the protein and thus may play an important role in favorably positioning the inhibitor molecule for nucleophilic attack by the active-site thiolate anion. The interaction features between E-64and actinidin are very similar to those seen in the papain-E-64 complex; however. the amino-4-guanidinobutane group orients differently.

It showed striking sequence similarities to ATP-binding proteins of binding-protein-dependent transport systems (ABC transporters). Mutants of ggtA and three neighboring reading frames were constructed by inserting an aphII gene cassette and were physiologically and genetically characterized. The ggtA insertion mutant lost its glucosylglycerol (GG) uptake ability. but its salt tolerance did not change. Therefore. it was concluded that active transport of the osmoprotective compound GG in Synechocystis is mediated by an ABC transporter.

SPP contains an HXXEH zinc-binding motif characteristic of members of the metallopeptidase family M16. We previously found that the three steps of precursor processing by SPP (i.e. transit peptide binding. removal. and conversion to a degradable subfragment) are mediated by features that reside in the C-terminal 10–15 residues of the transit peptide. In this study. we performed a mutational analysis of SPP to identify structural elements that determine its function. SPP loses the ability to proteolytically remove the transit peptide when residues of the HXXEH motif. found in an N-terminal region. are mutated.

Here we performed competition experiments using synthesized oligopeptides of the transit peptide of ferredoxin precursor to investigate the mechanism of these processes. We found that binding and processing of ferredoxin precursor depend on specific interactions of SPP with the region consisting of the C-terminal 12 residues of the transit peptide.

1038891,Sorghum utilization as food,2013,CV Ratnavathi and JV Patil,4,,1,1-8,,Sorghum is an important crop for food and fodder in the semi-arid tropics of the world. Sorghum is a staple food in African and Asian subcontinents. Most of the grain produced in these countries is utilised for human consumption. Though sorghum is known for its nutritional quality. the consumption of this cereal is decreasing due to easy availability of rice and wheat through public distribution system and easy methods of processing and cooking of fine cereals (such as rice). The various foods that are made in different parts of the world especially in Indian and African sub continent are described in this review. The objective of this review is to explore the global utilization of sorghum as a food. The requirement of special skill in preparing sorghum rotis and non availability of ready-made sorghum flour and suji in the market are deterrents for wider use of sorghum as food. The grain sorghum is utilised in preparation of …,True,p3SD91cAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C,49,http://eprints.icrisat.ac.in/12456/,11334821562840438753,/scholar?cites=11334821562840438753,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,BACKGROUND: Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an important coarse cereal crop grown for grain and fodder in the semi‐arid Tropics. mainly in Asian and African countries. In India sorghum is consumed as human food and poultry feed. Sorghum grain grown in the rainy season (kharif) is becoming severely affected by grain moulds. the major fungi involved being Aspergillus. Fusarium and Curvularia. If the extent of mould is severe. the grain is unsafe for consumption owing to contamination by mycotoxins.RESULTS: This paper presents a multi‐centre study conducted in sorghum to evaluate natural contamination of aflatoxin B1 in India. A total of 1606 grain sorghum samples were collected during the rainy (kharif) season across 4 years from seven states of India. representing different geographical regions of the country. Aflatoxin B1 contamination during 2007–08 was the highest (13.1%). followed by …,True,p3SD91cAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,31,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.5646,13349884854327582735,/scholar?cites=13349884854327582735,,,0,0,0

The optimum alpha-amylase activities in all cultivars were observed after steeping for 20 h. The alpha-amylase activity increased rapidly. but at different magnitudes. in most cultivars during germination. reaching a peak activity at 96 h. After 120 h. however. activity was reduced significantly. Steeping for 20 h followed by germination for 96 h was found to be the optimal malting condition for comparative evaluation of diverse sorghum cultivars. A three- to four-fold variation in alpha-amylase and diastatic activities was observed among 29 white seeded Indian cultivars. Alpha-amylase activity and diastatic activity were found to be significantly correlated (r = 0·88) in these cultivars.,True,p3SD91cAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521009800477,9907234336770228400,/scholar?cites=9907234336770228400,,,0,0,0
