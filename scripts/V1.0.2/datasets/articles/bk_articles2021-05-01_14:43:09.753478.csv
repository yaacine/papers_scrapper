1274670,Jet energy measurement and its systematic uncertainty in proton–proton collisions at√ s= 7TeV with the ATLAS detector,2015,Melissa Franklin and John Huth and L Jeanty and D Lopez Mateos and Kevin Mercurio and Masahiro Morii and William Spearman and Andy Yen and G Zevi Della Porta,,The European Physical Journal C,,,Springer Nature,The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton–proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s√=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb −1 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 . and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson. for  20≤pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |η|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton–proton interactions is corrected for. and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |η|<1.2 ) for jets with  55≤pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT . the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton–proton collisions and test-beam data. which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |η|=4.5 . Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies. such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating …,True,CIQdaf8AAAAJ:YiBZ6_7J9mkC,4145,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/33839898,6727422993564776635,/scholar?cites=6727422993564776635,,,https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33839898/10.1140%252Fepjc%252Fs10052-014-3190-y.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV. selected with a minimum bias trigger. jets are reconstructed in fine-grained. longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries. not observed in proton-proton collisions. which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot. dense medium.,True,CIQdaf8AAAAJ:S_Qw7xXuMuIC,3268,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303,10374830077736851981,/scholar?cites=10374830077736851981,,,https://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303,0,0,0

These features include heavy-tail flight and pause-time distributions and the super-diffusive nature of mobility. Human walks are not random walks. but it is surprising that the patterns of human walks and Levy walks contain some statistical similarity. Our study is based on 226 daily GPS traces collected from 101 volunteers in five different outdoor sites. The heavy-tail flight distribution of human mobility induces the super-diffusivity of travel. but up to 30 min to 1 h due to the boundary effect of people's daily movement. which is caused by the tendency of people to move within a predefined (also confined) area of daily activities.

1274680,Slaw: A new mobility model for human walks,2009,Kyunghan Lee and Seongik Hong and Seong Joon Kim and Injong Rhee and Song Chong,,,,855-863,IEEE,Simulating human mobility is important in mobile networks because many mobile devices are either attached to or controlled by humans and it is very hard to deploy real mobile networks whose size is controllably scalable for performance evaluation. Lately various measurement studies of human walk traces have discovered several significant statistical patterns of human mobility. Namely these include truncated power-law distributions of flights. pause-times and inter-contact times. fractal way-points. and heterogeneously defined areas of individual mobility. Unfortunately. none of existing mobility models effectively captures all of these features. This paper presents a new mobility model called SLAW (self-similar least action walk) that can produce synthetic walk traces containing all these features. This is by far the first such model.

The key to success is finding the right balance between the two. which will vary from project to project according to the circumstances and risks involved. Developers. pulled toward opposite ends by impassioned arguments. ultimately must learn how to give each value its due in their particular situations. Balancing Agility and Discipline sweeps aside the rhetoric. drills down to the operational core concepts. and presents a constructive approach to defining a balanced software development strategy. The authors expose the bureaucracy and stagnation that mark discipline without agility. and liken agility without discipline to unbridled and fruitless enthusiasm. Using a day in the life of two development teams and ground-breaking case studies. they illustrate the differences and similarities between agile and plan-driven methods. and show that the best development strategies have ways to combine both attributes.

Four voice types were examined: modal. vocal fry. falsetto. and breathy. Three categories of analysis techniques were developed to extract source‐related features from speech and electroglottographic (EGG) signals. Four factors were found to be important for characterizing the glottal excitations for the four voice types: the glottal pulse width. the glottal pulse skewness. the abruptness of glottal closure. and the turbulent noise component. The significance of these factors for voice synthesis was studied and a new voice source model that accounted for certain physiological aspects of vocal fold motion was developed and tested using speech synthesis.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of 1.7 s~ with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal. the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M.

Although α-synuclein function is uncertain. the protein has homology to the chaperone molecule 14-3-3. In addition. α-synuclein can bind to 14-3-3. and both α-synuclein and 14-3-3 bind to many of the same proteins. Because 14-3-3 binds to and activates tyrosine hydroxylase. the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine (DA) biosynthesis. we explored whether α-synuclein also bound to tyrosine hydroxylase and influenced its activity. Immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between α-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase in brain homogenates and MN9D dopaminergic cells.

Collecting and storing solar energy into fuel through photocatalyzed water splitting to generate hydrogen in a cost-effective way is desirable. To achieve this goal. low cost and environmentally benign urea was used to synthesize the metal-free photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). A porous structure is achieved via one-step polymerization of the single precursor. The porous structure with increased BET surface area and pore volume shows a much higher hydrogen production rate under simulated sunlight irradiation than thiourea-derived and dicyanamide-derived g-C3N4. The presence of an oxygen atom is presumed to play a key role in adjusting the textural properties.

In an in vitro model of a vessel wall. lipid mediators lysophosphatidic acid and platelet-activating factor. whose signals are implicated in promoting atherosclerosis. blocked conversion of monocytes into migratory cells and favored their retention in the subendothelium. In vivo studies revealed trafficking of monocyte-derived cells from atherosclerotic plaques during lesion regression. but little emigration was detected from progressive plaques. Thus. progression of atherosclerotic plaques may result not only from robust monocyte recruitment into arterial walls but also from reduced emigration of these cells from lesions.,True,5c8-XCAAAAAJ:6pF0wJmtdfAC,574,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/32/11779.short,3870458703541700606,/scholar?cites=3870458703541700606,,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/32/11779.full.pdf,0,0,0

On the basis of a theoretical prediction that increasing interaction potential between CNTs lowers their critical concentration to form an infinite percolation network. poly(3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate) (PTMSPMA) is used to disperse and functionalize MWCNTs where the subsequent hydrolysis and condensation of PTMSPMA introduces strong and permanent chemical bonding between MWCNTs. The interaction is both experimentally and theoretically proven to facilitate the formation of a MWCNT percolation network. which leads to the gelation of MWCNT dispersion at ultralow MWCNT concentration.

In this work. a detailed investigation into the balling behavior of selective laser melting of stainless steel and pure nickel powder was conducted. It was found that the SLM balling phenomenon can be divided into two types generally: the ellipsoidal balls with dimension of about 500 μm and the spherical balls with dimension of about 10 μm. The former is caused by worsened wetting ability and detrimental to SLM quality; the latter has no obvious detriment to SLM quality. The oxygen content plays an important role in determining the balling initiation. which can be considerably lessened by decreasing the oxygen content of atmosphere to 0.1%.

Runs were performed in the membrane reactor in semi-batch mode at 60. 65 and 70 °C and at different catalyst concentrations and feed flow rates. Increases in temperature. catalyst concentration and feedstock (methanol/oil) flow rate significantly increased the conversion of oil to biodiesel.

1274751,3d tracking via body radio reflections,2014,Fadel Adib and Zach Kabelac and Dina Katabi and Robert C Miller,,,,317-329,,This paper introduces WiTrack. a system that tracks the 3D motion of a user from the radio signals reflected off her body. It works even if the person is occluded from the WiTrack device or in a different room. WiTrack does not require the user to carry any wireless device. yet its accuracy exceeds current RF localization systems. which require the user to hold a transceiver. Empirical measurements with a WiTrack prototype show that. on average. it localizes the center of a human body to within a median of 10 to 13 cm in the x and y dimensions. and 21 cm in the z dimension. It also provides coarse tracking of body parts. identifying the direction of a pointing hand with a median of 11.2. WiTrack bridges a gap between RF-based localization systems which locate a user through walls and occlusions. and human-computer interaction systems like Kinect. which can track a user without instrumenting her body. but require the user to stay within the direct line of sight of the device.,True,e-c3R8QAAAAJ:Fu2w8maKXqMC,638,https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi14/technical-sessions/presentation/adib,11725905206899622020,/scholar?cites=11725905206899622020,,,https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-adib.pdf,0,0,0

For this purpose. a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field. and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a flow map. whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field. which reveals the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow.

The set of kinematic features includes divergence. vorticity. symmetric and antisymmetric flow fields. second and third principal invariants of flow gradient and rate of strain tensor. and third principal invariant of rate of rotation tensor. Each kinematic feature. when computed from the optical flow of a sequence of images. gives rise to a spatiotemporal pattern. It is then assumed that the representative dynamics of the optical flow are captured by these spatiotemporal patterns in the form of dominant kinematic trends or kinematic modes. These kinematic modes are computed by performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the spatiotemporal volumes of the kinematic features.

Heidelberg,This paper presents an algorithm for tracking individual targets in high density crowd scenes containing hundreds of people. Tracking in such a scene is extremely challenging due to the small number of pixels on the target. appearance ambiguity resulting from the dense packing. and severe inter-object occlusions. The novel tracking algorithm. which is outlined in this paper. will overcome these challenges using a scene structure based force model. In this force model an individual. when moving in a particular scene. is subjected to global and local forces that are functions of the layout of that scene and the locomotive behavior of other individuals in the scene. The key ingredients of the force model are three floor fields. which are inspired by the research in the field of evacuation dynamics. namely Static Floor Field (SFF).

1274758,Groups and capabilities,2005,Frances Stewart,6,Journal of human development,2,185-204,Taylor & Francis Group,The paper suggests that groups should be given a more central role than they generally are in the capability approach. Being a member of a group or groups is an intrinsic aspect of human life: the quality of groups with which individuals identify forms an important direct contribution to their well‐being. is instrumental to other capabilities. and influences people's choices and values. The argument is illustrated empirically by reference to identity groups in conflict; and to empowering and enriching groups among the poor. The paper concludes that one should analyse and categorise group capabilities as well as individual capabilities. While capabilities are beings and doings of individuals in the capability approach. groups are included in some of the analysis. The paper is thus consistent with the capability approach. but argues that groups play a much more dominant role in human life and well‐being than appears in …,True,1ZJ2BD0AAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C,472,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649880500120517,16125987089342330023,/scholar?cites=16125987089342330023,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frances-Stewart/publication/227620346_Groups_and_Capabilities/links/544e62140cf26dda08900ed5/Groups-and-Capabilities.pdf,0,0,0

Following theoretical indications. we try to obtain fits with an l-independent attractive part having a longer range than the repulsive parts. Further. we attempt to obtain. at first. the attractive part from just the l = 4 phase shift in view of the effect of the large l = 4 centrifugal barrier in masking the inner repulsive part. It is. in fact. found possible to obtain acceptable potentials with a common attractive part. These potentials are. however. strongly l-dependent through the repulsive part which becomes weaker as l increases. For l = 4. only a quite weak repulsive part is found to be permissible.

Trajectories of reference joints are used as the representation of the non-linear dynamical system that is generating the action.

The properties of the reconstructed phase space are captured in terms of dynamical and metric invariants that include Lyapunov exponent. correlation integral and correlation dimension.

The fusion of multiple features is important for recognizing actions as often a single feature based representation is not enough to capture the imaging variations (view-point. illumination etc.) and attributes of individuals (size. age. gender etc.). Hence. we use two types of features: i) a quantized vocabulary of local spatio-temporal (ST) volumes (or cuboids). and ii) a quantized vocabulary of spin-images. which aims to capture the shape deformation of the actor by considering actions as 3D objects (x. y. t).

On the contrary. the gradient descending method can achieve faster convergent speed around global optimum. and at the same time. the convergent accuracy can be higher.

1274781,Fused matrix factorization with geographical and social influence in location-based social networks,2012,Chen Cheng and Haiqin Yang and Irwin King and Michael Lyu,26,Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence,1,,,Recently. location-based social networks (LBSNs). such as Gowalla. Foursquare. Facebook. and Brightkite. etc.. have attracted millions of users to share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins. The available check-in information makes it possible to mine users’ preference on locations and to provide favorite recommendations. Personalized Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a significant task in LBSNs since it can help targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party developers to provide personalized services. To solve this task. matrix factorization is a promising tool due to its success in recommender systems. However. previously proposed matrix factorization (MF) methods do not explore geographical influence. eg. multi-center check-in property. which yields suboptimal solutions for the recommendation. In this paper. to the best of our knowledge. we are the first to fuse MF with geographical and social influence for POI recommendation in LBSNs. We first capture the geographical influence via modeling the probability of a user’s check-in on a location as a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM). Next. we include social information and fuse the geographical influence into a generalized matrix factorization framework. Our solution to POI recommendation is efficient and scales linearly with the number of observations. Finally. we conduct thorough experiments on a large-scale real-world LBSNs dataset and demonstrate that the fused matrix factorization framework with MGM utilizes the distance information sufficiently and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods significantly.,True,uQnBgK0AAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC,615,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/8100,6935643287147694318,/scholar?cites=6935643287147694318,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/8100/7958,0,0,0

Usually. the user-item matrix is quite sparse. which directly leads to inaccurate recommendations. This paper focuses the memory-based collaborative filtering problems on two crucial factors:(1) similarity computation between users or items and (2) missing data prediction algorithms. First. we use the enhanced Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) algorithm by adding one parameter which overcomes the potential decrease of accuracy when computing the similarity of users or items. Second. we propose an effective missing data prediction algorithm. in which information of both users and items is taken into account.

1274784,Where you like to go next: Successive point-of-interest recommendation,2013,Chen Cheng and Haiqin Yang and Michael R Lyu and Irwin King,,,,,,Personalized point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a significant task in location-based social networks (LBSNs) as it can help provide better user experience as well as enable third-party services. eg. launching advertisements. To provide a good recommendation. various research has been conducted in the literature. However. pervious efforts mainly consider the “check-ins” in a whole and omit their temporal relation. They can only recommend POI globally and cannot know where a user would like to go tomorrow or in the next few days. In this paper. we consider the task of successive personalized POI recommendation in LB-SNs. which is a much harder task than standard personalized POI recommendation or prediction. To solve this task. we observe two prominent properties in the check-in sequence: personalized Markov chain and region localization. Hence. we propose a novel matrix factorization method. namely FPMCLR. to embed the personalized Markov chains and the localized regions. Our proposed FPMC-LR not only exploits the personalized Markov chain in the check-in sequence. but also takes into account users’ movement constraint. ie. moving around a localized region. More importantly. utilizing the information of localized regions. we not only reduce the computation cost largely. but also discard the noisy information to boost recommendation. Results on two real-world LBSNs datasets demonstrate the merits of our proposed FPMC-LR.,True,uQnBgK0AAAAJ:KS-xo-ZNxMsC,476,https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/384.pdf,484199005012735994,/scholar?cites=484199005012735994,,,https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/384.pdf,0,0,0

However. it is usually validated by using a measure of behavioural intention to use (BI) rather than actual usage.This review examines the evidence that the TAM predicts actual usage using both subjective and objective measures of actual usage.We performed a systematic literature review based on a search of six digital libraries. along with vote-counting meta-analysis to analyse the overall results.The search identified 79 relevant empirical studies in 73 articles. The results show that BI is likely to be correlated with actual usage.

1274796,Towards a framework for software measurement validation,1995,Barbara Kitchenham and Shari Lawrence  Pfleeger and Norman Fenton,21,IEEE Transactions on software Engineering,12,929-944,IEEE,In this paper we propose a framework for validating software measurement. We start by defining a measurement structure model that identifies the elementary component of measures and the measurement process. and then consider five other models involved in measurement: unit definition models. instrumentation models. attribute relationship models. measurement protocols and entity population models. We consider a number of measures from the viewpoint of our measurement validation framework and identify a number of shortcomings; in particular we identify a number of problems with the construction of function points. We also compare our view of measurement validation with ideas presented by other researchers and identify a number of areas of disagreement. Finally. we suggest several rules that practitioners and researchers can use to avoid measurement problems. including the use of measurement …,True,CQDOm2gAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC,792,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/489070/,13873981180477949296,/scholar?cites=13873981180477949296,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Norman_Fenton/publication/3187784_Towards_a_Framework_for_Software_Measurement_Validation/links/0046351b05e6af3200000000/Towards-a-Framework-for-Software-Measurement-Validation.pdf,0,0,0

1274802,Simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART): a superior implementation of the ART algorithm,1984,Anders H Andersen and Avinash C Kak,6,Ultrasonic imaging,1,81-94,No longer published by Elsevier,In this paper we have discussed what appears to be a superior implementation of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). The method is based on 1) simultaneous application of the error correction terms as computed by ART for all rays in a given projection; 2) longitudinal weighting of the correction terms back-distributed along the rays; and 3) using bilinear elements for discrete approximation to the ray integrals of a continuous image. Since this implementation generates a good reconstruction in only one iteration. it also appears to have a computational advantage over the more traditional implementation of ART. Potential applications of this implementation include image reconstruction in conjunction with ray tracing for ultrasound and microwave tomography in which the curved nature of the rays leads to a non-uniform ray density across the image.,True,Ii7P2QQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1697,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0161734684900087,2782577054823582775,/scholar?cites=2782577054823582775,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anders-Andersen/publication/16648367_Simultaneous_Algebraic_Reconstruction_Technique_SART_A_Superior_Implementation_of_the_ART_Algorithm/links/5a0b484f458515e482748f77/Simultaneous-Algebraic-Reconstruction-Technique-SART-A-Superior-Implementation-of-the-ART-Algorithm.pdf,0,0,0

These computer simulations were conducted on single cylinders. since in this case analytical expressions are available for the exact scattered fields. The simulations establish the first-order Born approximation to be valid for objects where the product of the relative refractive index and the diameter of the cylinder is less than 0.35 lambda. The first-order Rytov approximation is valid with essentially no constraint on the size of the cylinders; however. the relative refractive index must be less than a few percent.

This technique offers several potential advantages including increased speed and improved accuracy. In this approach we illuminate the scene with a single encoded grid of colored light stripes. The indexing problem. that of matching a detected image plane stripe with its position in the projection grid. is solved from a knowledge of the color grid encoding. In fact. the possibility exists for the first time to acquire high-resolution range data in real time for modest cost. since only a single projection and single color image are required. Grid to grid alignment problems associated with previous multistripe techniques are eliminated. as is the requirement for dark interstices between grid stripes.

One such domain is medical radiology for which the clinically useful information in an image typically consists of gray level variations in highly localized regions of the image. Currently. it is not possible to extract these regions by automatic image segmentation techniques. To address this problem. we have implemented a human-in-the-loop (a physician-in-the-loop. more specifically) approach in which the human delineates the pathology bearing regions (PBR) and a set of anatomical landmarks in the image when the image is entered into the database. To the regions thus marked. our approach applies low-level computer vision and image processing algorithms to extract attributes related to the variations in gray scale. texture. shape. etc. In addition …,True,Ii7P2QQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,542,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077314299907683,12548035304866319595,/scholar?cites=12548035304866319595,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6157/f52af50a826d6cf62e636efb0f3c7f982160.pdf,0,0,0

The rapidly rising number of Internet users with smartphones and tablets around the world has supported the spread of e-learning. not only in higher education and vocational training but also in primary and secondary schools. E-learning and traditional distance education approaches share the emphasis on “any time. any place” learning and the assumption that students are at a distance from the instructor. The design of the initial e-learning courses tended to replicate existing distance education practice based on content delivery. However. long textual lectures were clearly not suitable for the online environment. These early insights guided the development of e-learning (technical and pedagogical) and emphasized the need for communication and interaction. B. Gros Universidad de Barcelona. Barcelona.

X-ray diffraction and Raman and UV-visible spectroscopies show that supported VOx species form polyvanadate domains of increasing size and ultimately monolayers. and clusters as vanadium surface density increases. Initial propene selectivities in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 606 K increase with increasing VOx surface density and reach constant values of 80% at surface densities of about 2–3 VOx/nm2. High selectivities to COx products at low surface densities and on bulk ZrV2O7 appear to be associated with exposed unselective V-O-Zr and Zr-O-Zr sites.

In particular. the creation of value-added services by composition of existing ones is gaining a significant momentum. Since many available Web services provide overlapping or identical functionality. albeit with different quality of service (QoS). a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. This paper presents a middleware platform which addresses the issue of selecting Web services for the purpose of their composition in a way that maximizes user satisfaction expressed as utility functions over QoS attributes. while satisfying the constraints set by the user and by the structure of the composite service.

In this approach. individual Web services are federated into composite Web services whose business logic is expressed as a process model. The tasks of this process model are essentially invocations to functionalities offered by the underlying component services. Usually. several component services are able to execute a given task. although with different levels of pricing and quality. In this paper. we advocate that the selection of component services should be carried out during the execution of a composite service. rather than at design-time.

The mix of constructs found in BPMN makes it possible to create models with semantic errors. Such errors are especially serious. because errors in the early phases of systems development are among the most costly and hardest to correct. The ability to statically check the semantic correctness of models is thus a desirable feature for modelling tools based on BPMN. Accordingly. this paper proposes a mapping from BPMN to a formal language. namely Petri nets. for which efficient analysis techniques are available. The proposed mapping has been implemented as a tool that. in conjunction with existing Petri net-based tools. enables the static analysis of BPMN models. The formalisation also led to the identification of deficiencies in the BPMN standard specification.,True,9lIttRkAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,866,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584908000323,12780046441163592156,/scholar?cites=12780046441163592156,,,,0,0,0

This allows investigation of the hypothesis that regions of premalignant lesions develop a substrate-limited environment as proliferation carries cells away from blood vessels which remain separated by the intact basement membrane. We find that selective forces in tumoural regions furthest from the blood supply act to favour cells whose metabolism is best suited to respond to local changes in oxygen. glucose and pH levels.

1274861,Deriving dichotomous outcome measures from continuous data in randomised controlled trials of analgesics,1996,Andrew Moore and Henry McQuay and David Gavaghan,66,PAIN®,2-3,229-237,No longer published by Elsevier,Reports of RCTs of analgesics frequently describe results of studies in the form of mean derived indices. rather than using discontinuous events — such as number or proportion of patients with 50% pain relief. Because mean data inadequately describe information with a non-normal distribution. combining mean data in systematic reviews may compromise the results. Showing that dichotomous data can reliably be derived from mean data. at least in acute pain models. indicates that more meaningful overviews or meta-analysis may be possible. This study investigated the relationship between continuous and dichotomous analgesic measures in a set of individual patient data. and then used that relationship to derive dichotomous from continuous information in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of analgesics.

1274869,A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering,2011,Andrea Arcuri and Lionel Briand,,,,1-10,IEEE,Randomized algorithms have been used to successfully address many different types of software engineering problems. This type of algorithms employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic. Randomized algorithms are useful for difficult problems where a precise solution cannot be derived in a deterministic way within reasonable time. However. randomized algorithms produce different results on every run when applied to the same problem instance. It is hence important to assess the effectiveness of randomized algorithms by collecting data from a large enough number of runs. The use of rigorous statistical tests is then essential to provide support to the conclusions derived by analyzing such data.

Ltd,Regression testing is a testing activity that is performed to provide confidence that changes do not harm the existing behaviour of the software. Test suites tend to grow in size as software evolves. often making it too costly to execute entire test suites. A number of different approaches have been studied to maximize the value of the accrued test suite: minimization. selection and prioritization. Test suite minimization seeks to eliminate redundant test cases in order to reduce the number of tests to run. Test case selection seeks to identify the test cases that are relevant to some set of recent changes. Test case prioritization seeks to order test cases in such a way that early fault detection is maximized.

Research on past tools has had enormous impact on today's developers—virtually all applications today are built using some form of user interface tool. In this article. we consider cases of both success and failure in past user interface tools. From these cases we extract a set of themes which can serve as lessons for future work. Using these themes. past tools can be characterized by what aspects of the user interface they addressed. their threshold and ceiling. what path of least resistance they offer. how predictable they are to use. and whether they addressed a target that became irrelevant. We believe the lessons of these past themes are particularly important now. because increasingly  rapid technological changes are likely to significantly change user interfaces.

That is why the drug delivery system should deliver dr ug at a state dictated by the needs of the body over a specified period of treatment. This idealized objective points to the two aspects most important to drug delivery. namely. spatial placement relates to targeting a drug to a specific organ or tissue while temporal delivery refers to the control of rate of drug delivery to the target tissue. Bioadhesion can be defined as the process by which a natural or a synthetic polymer can adhere to a biological substrate. When the biological substrate is a mucosal layer then the phenomena is known as mucoadhesion. The substrate possessing bioadhesive property can help in devising a delivery system capable of delivering a bioactive agent for a prolonged period of time at a specific delivery site. The current review provides a good insight on mucoadhesive polymers. the phenomenon of mucoadhesion and the factors which have the ability to affect the mucoadhesive properties of a polymer.,True,GY-upEkAAAAJ:yhXl426oeGMC,173,https://www.academia.edu/download/45629352/mucoadhesive_final.pdf,12326897770263301183,/scholar?cites=12326897770263301183,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45629352/mucoadhesive_final.pdf,0,0,0

We recently took advantage of next-generation sequencing technology to develop MutMap. a method that allows rapid identification of causal nucleotide changes of rice mutants by whole genome resequencing of pooled DNA of mutant F2 progeny derived from crosses made between candidate mutants and the parental line. Here we describe MutMap+. a versatile extension of MutMap. that identifies causal mutations by comparing SNP frequencies of bulked DNA of mutant and wild-type progeny of M3 generation derived from selfing of an M2 heterozygous individual. Notably. MutMap+ does not necessitate artificial crossing between mutants and the wild-type parental line. This method is therefore suitable for identifying mutations that cause early development lethality. sterility. or generally hamper crossing. Furthermore. MutMap+ is potentially useful for gene isolation in crops that are recalcitrant to artificial crosses.,True,GY-upEkAAAAJ:SFOYbPikdlgC,170,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068529,18261024556520535277,/scholar?cites=18261024556520535277,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068529,0,0,0

Along with reactor operations. activities like mining. fuel fabrication. fuel reprocessing and military operations are the major contributors to the nuclear waste. The presence of a large number of fission products along with multiple oxidation state long-lived radionuclides such as neptunium (237Np). plutonium (239Pu). americium (241/243Am) and curium (245Cm) make the waste streams a potential radiological threat to the environment. Commonly high concentrations of cesium (137Cs) and strontium (90Sr) are found in a nuclear waste. These radionuclides are capable enough to produce potential health threat due to their long half-lives and effortless translocation into the human body. Besides the radionuclides. heavy metal contamination is also a serious issue.

Furthermore. combining different independent cloud services necessitates a uniform description format that facilitates the design. customization. and composition. Cloud Blueprinting is a novel approach that allows SBA developers to easily design. configure and deploy virtual SBA payloads on virtual machines and resource pools on the cloud. We propose the Blueprint concept as a uniform abstract description for cloud service offerings that may cross different cloud computing layers. ie. SaaS. PaaS and IaaS. To support developers with the SBA design and development in the cloud. this paper introduces a formal Blueprint Template for unambiguously describing a blueprint. as well as a Blueprint Lifecycle that guides developers through the manipulation. composition and deployment of different blueprints for an SBA.

1274954,Scheduling independent tasks to reduce mean finishing time,1974,James Bruno and Edward G Coffman Jr and Ravi Sethi,17,Communications of the ACM,7,382-387,ACM,Sequencing to minimize mean finishing time (or mean time in system) is not only desirable to the user. but it also tends to minimize at each point in time the storage required to hold incomplete tasks. In this paper a deterministic model of independent tasks is introduced and new results are derived which extend and generalize the algorithms known for minimizing mean finishing time. In addition to presenting and analyzing new algorithms it is shown that the most general mean-finishing-time problem for independent tasks is polynomial complete. and hence unlikely to admit of a non-enumerative solution.,True,ID4wZFwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,646,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/361011.361064,1186799026363691563,/scholar?cites=1186799026363691563,,,,0,0,0

A consistent type discipline will ensure that any expression satisfying the constraints will not produce a run-time error. For example during any evaluation of the expression f (x). the value off must be a function; otherwise. a run-time error occurs because the computation cannot proceed. As we want to guarantee the absence of such run-time errors. the constraints on the values off and x must be spelled out further. In particular. if the value of x satisfies constraint s. then it suffices that f is a function that is applicable to all such values. For instance. f might satisfy the constraint of sending all values satisfying s to values satisfying another constraint t.

This paper discusses the difficulty of optimizing queries based on the relational algebra operations select. project. and join. A matrix. called a tableau. is proposed as a useful device for representing the value of a query. and optimization of queries is couched in terms of finding a minimal tableau equivalent to a given one. Functional dependencies can be used to imply additional equivalences among tableaux.

1274959,From regular expressions to deterministic automata,1986,Gerard Berry and Ravi Sethi,48,Theoretical computer science,,117-126,Elsevier,The main theorem allows an elegant algorithm to be refined into an efficient one. The elegant algorithm for constructing a finite automaton from a regular expression is based on ‘derivatives of’regular expressions; the efficient algorithm is based on ‘marking of’regular expressions. Derivatives of regular expressions correspond to state transitions in finite automata. When a finite automaton makes a transition under input symbol a. a leading a is stripped from the remaining input. Correspondingly. if the input string is generated by a regular expression E. then the derivative of E by a generates the remaining input after a leading a is stripped. Brzozowski (1964) used derivatives to construct finite automata; the state for expression E has a transition under a to the state for the derivative of E by a. This approach extends to regular expressions with new operators. including intersection and complement; however. explicit …,True,ID4wZFwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,415,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397586900885,4791326653788701007,/scholar?cites=4791326653788701007,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397586900885/pdf?md5=cd17dad7971b346f64aa5ce38b0cabdc&pid=1-s2.0-0304397586900885-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0

Flow is assumed to take place through the fracture network and between the fractures and matrix blocks. The matrix blocks are treated in a lumped parameter manner. with a single average pressure used for each matrix block. Rather than assuming that fracture/matrix flux is proportional to the difference between the fracture pressure and matrix pressure at each point. as is done in the Warren‐Root model. we use a nonlinear equation which more accurately models the flux over all time regimes. including both early and late times. This flux equation is compared with analytical solutions for spherical blocks with prescribed pressure variations on their boundaries.

We show that the superfluid order parameter destroyed by a large Zeeman field can be restored by the SOC. With increasing strengths of the Zeeman field. there is a series of topological quantum phase transitions from a nontopological superfluid state with fully gapped fermionic spectrum to a topological superfluid state with four topologically protected Fermi points (ie. nodes in the quasiparticle excitation gap) and then to a second topological superfluid state with only two Fermi points. The quasiparticle excitations near the Fermi points realize the long-sought low-temperature analog of Weyl fermions of particle physics.

Trehalose was introduced into cells using a genetically engineered version of α-hemolysin. a pore-forming protein; the cells were then dried and stored for weeks at different temperatures with ∼90% recovery of the intact plasma membrane. We show that protection of the plasma membrane by internal trehalose is dose dependent and estimate the amount of internal trehalose required for adequate protection to be ∼1010 molecules/cell.

The aim was to evaluate the association between vitamin D levels and AITD through systematic literature review. We identified all studies that assessed the association between vitamin D and AITD from PubMed. Embase. CENTRAL. and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. We included studies that compared vitamin D levels between AITD cases and controls as well as those that measured the odds of vitamin D deficiency by AITD status. We combined the standardized mean differences (SMD) or the odds ratios (OR) in a random effects model. Twenty case-control studies provided data for a quantitative meta-analysis. Compared to controls. AITD patients had lower levels of 25 (OH) D (SMD:− 0.99. 95% CI:− 1.31.− 0.66) and were more likely to be deficient in 25 (OH) D (OR 2.99. 95% CI: 1.88. 4.74). Furthermore. subgroup analyses result showed that GD and HT patients also had lower 25 (OH) D levels and were more likely to have a 25 (OH) D deficiency. suggesting that low levels of serum 25 (OH) D was related to AITD.

Since no central authorities may exist. the only way agents can find trustworthy correspondents is by collaborating with others to identify those whose past behavior has been untrustworthy. In other words. finding trustworthy correspondents reduces to the problem of distributed reputation management. Our approach adapts the mathematical theory of evidence to represent and propagate the ratings that agents give to their correspondents.

We consider the important case of interactions in electronic communities. where the agents assist and represent principal entities. such as people and businesses. We propose a social mechanism of reputation management. which aims at avoiding interaction with undesirable participants. Social mechanisms complement hard security techniques (such as passwords and digital certificates). which only guarantee that a party is authenticated and authorized. but do not ensure that it exercises its authorization in a way that is desirable to others. Social mechanisms are even more important when trusted third parties are not available.

We propose a rich formulation of social commitments that motivates an architecture for multiagent systems. which we dub spheres of commitment. We identify the key operations on commitments and multiagent systems. We distinguish between explicit and implicit commitments. Multiagent systems. viewed as spheres of commitment (SoComs). provide the context for the different operations on commitments. Armed with the above ideas. we can capture normative concepts such as obligations. taboos. conventions. and pledges as different kinds of commitments.

1274992,Detecting deception in reputation management,2003,Bin Yu and Munindar P Singh,,,,73-80,,We previously developed a social mechanism for distributed reputation management. in which an agent combines testimonies from several witnesses to determine its ratings of another agent. However. that approach does not fully protect against spurious ratings generated by malicious agents. This paper focuses on the problem of deception in testimony propagation and aggregation. We introduce some models of deception and study how to efficiently detect deceptive agents following those models. Our approach involves a novel application of the well-known weighted majority technique to belief function and their aggregation. We describe simulation experiments to study the number of apparently accurate witnesses found in different settings. the number of witnesses on prediction accuracy. and the evolution of trust networks.,True,qNznu3kAAAAJ:8Xgff_V0N9gC,491,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/860575.860588,8894630802360345266,/scholar?cites=8894630802360345266,,,http://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/papers/mas/aamas-03-deception.pdf,0,0,0
1274993,A social semantics for agent communication languages,2000,Munindar P Singh,,,,31-45,Springer Berlin/Heidelberg,The ability to communicate is one of the salient properties of agents. Although a number of agent communication languages (ACLs) have been developed. obtaining a suitable formal semantics for ACLs remains one of the greatest challenges of multiagent systems theory. Previous semantics have largely been mentalistic in their orientation and are based solely on the beliefs and intentions of the participating agents. Such semantics are not suitable for most multiagent applications. which involve autonomous and heterogeneous agents. whose beliefs and intentions cannot be uniformly determined. Accordingly. we present a social semantics for ACLs that gives primacy to the interactions among the agents. Our semantics is based on social commitments and is developed in temporal logic. This semantics. because of its public orientation. is essential to providing a rigorous basis for multiagent protocols.,True,qNznu3kAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,473,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/10722777_3,13721198880576791874,/scholar?cites=13721198880576791874,,,https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/bitstream/handle/1840.4/813/TR-99-03.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

1275012,Exploiting hardware performance counters with flow and context sensitive profiling,1997,Glenn Ammons and Thomas Ball and James R Larus,32,ACM Sigplan Notices,5,85-96,ACM,A program profile attributes run-time costs to portions of a program's execution. Most profiling systems suffer from two major deficiencies: first. they only apportion simple metrics. such as execution frequency or elapsed time to static. syntactic units. such as procedures or statements; second. they aggressively reduce the volume of information collected and reported. although aggregation can hide striking differences in program behavior.This paper addresses both concerns by exploiting the hardware counters available in most modern processors and by incorporating two concepts from data flow analysis--flow and context sensitivity--to report more context for measurements. This paper extends our previous work on efficient path profiling to flow sensitive profiling. which associates hardware performance metrics with a path through a procedure.

AspectJ provides support for modular implementation of a range of crosscutting concerns. In AspectJ’s dynamic join point model. join points are well-defined points in the execution of the program; pointcuts are collections of join points; advice are special method-like constructs that can be attached to pointcuts; and aspects are modular units of crosscutting implementation. comprising pointcuts. advice. and ordinary Java member declarations. AspectJ code is compiled into standard Java bytecode.

1275045,D: A language framework for distributed programming,1997,Cristina Videira Lopes and Gregor Kiczales,,,,,,Two of the most important issues in distributed systems are the synchronization of concurrent threads and the application-level data transfers between execution spaces. At the design level. addressing these issues typically requires analyzing the components under a different perspective than is required to analyze the functionality. Very often. it also involves analyzing several components at the same time. because of the way those two issues cross-cut the units of functionality. At the implementation level. existing programming languages fail to provide adequate support for programming in terms of these different and cross-cutting perspectives. The result is that the programming of synchronization and remote data transfers ends up being tangled throughout the components code in more or less arbitrary ways.This thesis presents a language framework called D that untangles the implementation of synchronization schemes and remote data transfers from the implementation of the components. In the D framework there are three kinds of modules:(1) classes. which are used to implement functional components. and are clear of code dealing with the aspects;(2) coordinators. which concentrate the code for dealing with the thread synchronization aspect; and (3) portals which concentrate the code for dealing with the aspect of application-level data transfers over remote method invocations. To support this separation. D provides two aspect-specific languages: COOL. for programming the coordinators. and RIDL. for programming the portals. COOL and RIDL were designed to address the specific needs of the two kinds of aspects.

Cost Modeling is the most mature tool in the toolkit. and this paper shows its effectiveness by demonstrating how practitioners can use it to examine the costs of deploying their IT systems on the cloud. The Cost Modeling tool is evaluated using a case study of an organization that is considering the migration of some of its IT systems to the cloud. The case study shows that running …,True,YkBQyNoAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,379,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.1072,8836617110821228990,/scholar?cites=8836617110821228990,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1900,0,0,0

This paper discusses some of the research challenges for cloud computing from an enterprise or organizational perspective. and puts them in context by reviewing the existing body of literature in cloud computing. Various research challenges relating to the following topics are discussed: the organizational changes brought about by cloud computing; the economic and organizational implications of its utility billing model; the security. legal and privacy issues that cloud computing raises. It is important to highlight these research challenges because cloud computing is not simply about a technological improvement of data centers but a fundamental change in how IT is provisioned and used.

The use of focus groups in design research poses interesting opportunities and challenges. Traditional focus group methods must be adapted to meet two specific goals of design research. For the refinement of an artifact design. exploratory focus groups (EFGs) study the artifact to propose improvements in the design. The cycle of build and evaluate using EFGs continues until the artifact is released for field test in the application environment. Then. the field test of the design artifact may employ confirmatory focus groups (CFGs) to establish the utility of the artifact in field use. Rigorous investigation of the artifact requires multiple CFGs to be run with opportunities for quantitative and qualitative data collection and analyses across the multiple CFGs. In this paper. we discuss the adaptation of focus groups to design research projects.

The effectiveness of a “modularization” is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules.

It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed.

Under various pathological conditions. abnormal expression of eNOS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular diseases. A variety of pathological stimuli has been reported to decrease eNOS expression mainly through decreasing eNOS mRNA stability by regulating the binding of several cytosolic proteins to the cis-acting sequences within eNOS mRNA 3′ untranslated regions. However. the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. Because microRNAs inhibit gene expression through binding to the 3′ untranslated regions of their target mRNAs. microRNAs may be the important posttranscriptional modulators of eNOS expression.

It is shown here that a (1S)-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethyl moiety at C-2 of a glycosyl donor can perform neighboring group participation to give a quasi-stable anomeric sulfonium ion. Due to steric and electronic factors. the sulfonium ion is formed as a trans-decalin ring system. Displacement of the sulfonium ion by a hydroxyl leads to the stereoselective formation of α-glycosides. NMR experiments were employed to show convincingly the presence of the β-linked sulfonium ion intermediate. The (1S)-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethyl moiety could be introduced by reaction of a sugar alcohol with acetic acid (1S)-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfanyl)ethyl ester in the presence of BF3−OEt2.

The total irreversibility of this process observed previously is shown to be a result of the presence of very unstable intermediates.

1275102,What makes process models understandable?,2007,Jan Mendling and Hajo Reijers and Jorge Cardoso,,Business Process Management,,48-63,Springer Berlin/Heidelberg,Despite that formal and informal quality aspects are of significant importance to business process modeling. there is only little empirical work reported on process model quality and its impact factors. In this paper we investigate understandability as a proxy for quality of process models and focus on its relations with personal and model characteristics. We used a questionnaire in classes at three European universities and generated several novel hypotheses from an exploratory data analysis. Furthermore. we interviewed practitioners to validate our findings. The results reveal that participants tend to exaggerate the differences in model understandability. that self-assessment of modeling competence appears to be invalid. and that the number of arcs in models has an important influence on understandability.,True,e3LVAMEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,394,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75183-0_4,82822122361024041,/scholar?cites=82822122361024041,,,"ftp://nozdr.ru/biblio/kolxoz/Cs/CsLn/Business%20Process%20Management,%205%20conf.,%20BPM%202007(LNCS4714,%20Springer,%202007)(ISBN%209783540751823)(429s)_CsLn_.pdf#page=60",0,0,0
1275103,Measuring similarity between business process models,2008,Boudewijn van Dongen and Remco Dijkman and Jan Mendling,,Advanced Information Systems Engineering,,450-464,Springer Berlin/Heidelberg,Quality aspects become increasingly important when business process modeling is used in a large-scale enterprise setting. In order to facilitate a storage without redundancy and an efficient retrieval of relevant process models in model databases it is required to develop a theoretical understanding of how a degree of behavioral similarity can be defined. In this paper we address this challenge in a novel way. We use causal footprints as an abstract representation of the behavior captured by a process model. since they allow us to compare models defined in both formal modeling languages like Petri nets and informal ones like EPCs. Based on the causal footprint derived from two models we calculate their similarity based on the established vector space model from information retrieval. We validate this concept with an experiment using the SAP Reference Model and an implementation in the ProM framework.,True,e3LVAMEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,370,https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/measuring-similarity-between-business-process-models,2101784846595601838,/scholar?cites=2101784846595601838,,,,0,0,0

These rules are manually defined to identify the key symptoms that characterize a code-smell using combinations of mainly quantitative (metrics). structural. and/or lexical information. We propose in this work to consider the problem of code-smell detection as a multi-objective problem where examples of code-smells and well-designed code are used to generate detection rules. To this end. we use multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) to find the best combination of metrics that maximizes the detection of code-smell examples and minimizes the detection of well-designed code examples. We evaluated our proposal on seven large open-source systems and found that. on average. most of the different five code-smell types were detected with an average of 87 % of precision and 92 % of recall.

Darwin is in essence a declarative binding language which can be used to define hierarchic compositions of interconnected components. Distribution is dealt with orthogonally to system structuring. The language supports the specification of both static structures and dynamic structures which may evolve during execution. The central abstractions managed by Darwin are components and services.

To address this we have advocated distributed development of specifications from multiple perspectives. However. this leads to problems of identifying and handling inconsistencies between such perspectives. Maintaining absolute consistency is not always possible. Often this is not even desirable since this can unnecessarily constrain the development process. and can lead to the loss of important information. Indeed since the real-world forces us to work with inconsistencies. we should formalize some of the usually informal or extra-logical ways of responding to them. This is not necessarily done by eradicating inconsistencies but rather by supplying logical rules specifying how we should act on them.

The approach supports verification against specification models and assigns semantics to the behavior of implementation model so as to confirm expected results for both the designer and implementer. Specifications of the design are modeled in UML (Unified Modeling Language). in the form of message sequence charts (MSC). and mechanically compiled into the finite state process notation (FSP) to concisely describe and reason about the concurrent programs. Implementations are mechanically translated to FSP to allow a trace equivalence verification process to be performed.

1275127,Software architecture in practice,2003,Len Bass and Paul Clements and Rick Kazman,,,,,Addison-Wesley Professional,This award-winning book. substantially updated to reflect the latest developments in the field. introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecture--how a software system is structured and how that system's elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation. algorithm. and data representation. an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality. is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems. and is crucial to a software organization's business strategy. Drawing on their own extensive experience. the authors cover the essential technical topics for designing. specifying. and validating a system. They also emphasize the importance of the business context in which large systems are designed. Their aim is to present software architecture in a real-world setting. reflecting both the opportunities and constraints that companies encounter. To that end. case studies that describe successful architectures illustrate key points of both technical and organizational discussions. Topics new to this edition include: Architecture design and analysis. including the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) Capturing quality requirements and achieving them through quality scenarios and tactics Using architecture reconstruction to recover undocumented architectures Documenting architectures using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) New case studies. including Web-based examples and a wireless Enterprise JavaBeans™(EJB) system designed to support wearable computers The financial aspects of architectures. including use of the Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM) to make decisions If you …,True,NUJQv_oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,9533,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZY6UZTjBnGQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:MlG8ogmxMbgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=gsnz0rQ4pj&sig=8mhFOdkIEpoupoZUQZZVav1yH-Y,13272584231780634930,/scholar?cites=13272584231780634930,,,https://baerbak.cs.au.dk/c/saip/slides/pdf/W2-2%20TeleMed%20Intro.pptx.pdf,0,0,0

1275129,SAAM: A method for analyzing the properties of software architectures,1994,Rick Kazman and Len Bass and Gregory Abowd and Mike Webb,,,,81-90,IEEE,While software architecture has become an increasingly important research topic in recent years. insufficient attention has been paid to methods for evaluation of these architectures. Evaluating architectures is difficult for two main reasons. First. there is no common language used to describe different architectures. Second. there is no clear way of understanding an architecture with respect to an organization's life cycle concerns -software quality concerns such as maintainability portability. modularity. reusability. and so forth. We address these shortcomings by describing three perspectives by which we can understand the description of a software architecture and then proposing a five-step method for analyzing software architectures called SAAM (Software Architecture Analysis Method). We illustrate the method by analyzing three separate user interface architectures with respect to the quality of modifiability.< >,True,NUJQv_oAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,846,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/296768/,16515405012091382477,/scholar?cites=16515405012091382477,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA633431.pdf,0,0,0

This method was developed to provide a principled way to evaluate a software architecture's fitness with respect to multiple competing quality attributes: modifiability. security. performance. availability. and so forth. These attributes interact-improving one often comes at the price of worsening one or more of the others-as is shown in the paper. and the method helps us to reason about architectural decisions that affect quality attribute interactions.

MA,Architectural styles have enjoyed widespread popularity in the past few years. and for good reason: they represent the distilled wisdom of many experienced architects and guide less experienced architects in designing their architectures. However. architectural styles employ qualitative reasoning to motivate when and under what conditions they should be used. In this paper we present the concept of an ABAS (Attribute-Based Architectural Style) which includes a set of components and connectors along with their topology. but which adds to this a quality attribute specific model that provides a method of reasoning about the behavior of component types that interact in the defined pattern.

The WebQuery system offers a powerful new method for searching the Web based on connectivity and content. We do this by examining links among the nodes returned in a keyword-based query.

WebQuery not only ranks and filters the results of a Web query. it also extends the result set beyond what the search engine retrieves. by finding “interesting” sites that are highly connected to those sites returned by the original query.

These markets require distinctive competitive strategies because the products are parts of systems that combine core components made by one company with complements usually made by a variety of companies. If a platform leader emerges and works with the companies supplying complementary products and services. they can together form an “ecosystem” of innovation that can greatly increase the value of their innovations as more users adopt the platform and its complements.

1275148,The business of software: What every manager. programmer. and entrepreneur must know to thrive and survive in good times and bad,2004,Michael A Cusumano,,,,,Simon and Schuster,The world's leading expert on the global software industry and coauthor of the bestseller Microsoft Secrets reveals the inner workings of software giants like IBM. Microsoft. and Netscape and shows what it takes to create. develop. and manage a successful company--in good times and bad--in the most fiercely competitive business in the world. In the $600 billion software industry it is the business. not the technology. that determines success or failure. This fact--one that thousands of once glamorous start-ups have unhappily discovered for themselves--is the well-documented conclusion of this enormously readable and revealing new book by Michael Cusumano. based on nearly twenty years of research and consulting with software producers around the world. Cusumano builds on dozens of personal experiences and case studies to show how issues of strategy and organization are irrevocably linked with those of managing the technology and demonstrates that a thorough understanding of these issues is vital to success. At the heart of the book Cusumano poses seven questions that underpin a three-pronged management framework. He argues that companies must adopt one of three basic business models: become a products company at one end of the strategic spectrum. a services company at the other end. or a hybrid solutions company in between. The author describes the characteristics of the different models. evaluates their strengths and weaknesses. and shows how each is more or less appropriate for different stages in the evolution of a business as well as in good versus bad economic times.

1275149,Model checking,2018,Edmund M Clarke Jr and Orna Grumberg and Daniel Kroening and Doron Peled and Helmut Veith,,,,,MIT press,An expanded and updated edition of a comprehensive presentation of the theory and practice of model checking. a technology that automates the analysis of complex systems. Model checking is a verification technology that provides an algorithmic means of determining whether an abstract model—representing. for example. a hardware or software design—satisfies a formal specification expressed as a temporal logic formula. If the specification is not satisfied. the method identifies a counterexample execution that shows the source of the problem. Today. many major hardware and software companies use model checking in practice. for verification of VLSI circuits. communication protocols. software device drivers. real-time embedded systems. and security algorithms. This book offers a comprehensive presentation of the theory and practice of model checking. covering the foundations of the key algorithms in depth. The field of model checking has grown dramatically since the publication of the first edition in 1999. and this second edition reflects the advances in the field. Reorganized. expanded. and updated. the new edition retains the focus on the foundations of temporal logic model while offering new chapters that cover topics that did not exist in 1999: propositional satisfiability. SAT-based model checking. counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. and software model checking.

1275153,Progress on the state explosion problem in model checking,2001,Edmund Clarke and Orna Grumberg and Somesh Jha and Yuan Lu and Helmut Veith,,,,176-194,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Model checking is an automatic verification technique for finite state concurrent systems. In this approach to verification. temporal logic specifications are checked by an exhaustive search of the state space of the concurrent system. Since the size of the state space grows exponentially with the number of processes. model checking techniques based on explicit state enumeration can only handle relatively small examples. This phenomenon is commonly called the “State Explosion Problem”. Over the past ten years considerable progress has been made on this problem by (1) representing the state space symbolically using BDDs and by (2) using abstraction to reduce the size of the state space that must be searched. As a result model checking has been used successfully to find extremely subtle errors in hardware controllers and communication protocols.

The publish-subscribe style facilitates developing large-scale systems by composing separately developed components because the style permits loose coupling between various components. One of the major bottlenecks in using publish-subscribe systems for very large scale systems is the efficiency of filtering incoming messages. i.e.. matching of published events with event subscriptions. This is a very challenging problem because in a realistic publish subscribe system the number of subscriptions can be large.

The objective of this study is to determine whether CBSE has the potential to advance the state of software engineering practice and. if so. whether the SEI can contribute to this advancement. This report is the second part of a threepart report on the study. Volume I contains a market assessment for CBSE. Volume III outlines a proposed course of action for the SEI. Volume II. this report. establishes the technical foundation for SEI work in CBSE. The paper asserts that the key technical challenge facing CBSE is to ensure that the properties of a system of components can be predicted from the properties of the components themselves. The key technical concepts of CBSE that are needed to support this vision are described: component. interface. contract. component model. component framework. composition. and certification.,True,xB1Z6VwAAAAJ:XoXfffV-tXoC,454,ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/prp/models/zeves-2.3/~/public/documents/00.reports/pdf/00tr008.pdf,2148091436580578624,/scholar?cites=2148091436580578624,,,ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/prp/models/zeves-2.3/~/public/documents/00.reports/pdf/00tr008.pdf,0,0,0
1275167,Quality attributes for service-oriented architectures,2007,Liam O'Brien and Paulo Merson and Len Bass,,,,3-3,IEEE,The SOA approach is a very popular choice today for the implementation of distributed systems. The use of SOA or more specifically the Web services technology is an important architecture decision. An architect should understand how different quality attributes for a system are impacted by that decision. While there are significant benefits with respect to interoperability and modifiability. other qualities such as performance. security and testability are concerns. This paper discusses how the different quality attributes of a system can be positively or negatively affected by the use of such technology. It describes the factors related to each attribute. as well as possible tradeoffs and existing efforts to achieve that quality. The paper also discusses open issues in service level agreements that are used to contract the level of service quality between service providers and users.,True,xB1Z6VwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,419,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4273291/,5383319999072291994,/scholar?cites=5383319999072291994,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA441830.pdf,0,0,0
1275168,Attribute-based architecture styles,1999,Mark H Klein and Rick Kazman and Len Bass and Jeromy Carriere and Mario Barbacci and Howard Lipson,,,,225-243,Springer. Boston. MA,Architectural styles have enjoyed widespread popularity in the past few years. and for good reason: they represent the distilled wisdom of many experienced architects and guide less experienced architects in designing their architectures. However. architectural styles employ qualitative reasoning to motivate when and under what conditions they should be used. In this paper we present the concept of an ABAS (Attribute-Based Architectural Style) which includes a set of components and connectors along with their topology. but which adds to this a quality attribute specific model that provides a method of reasoning about the behavior of component types that interact in the defined pattern. We will define ABASs in this paper. show how they are used. and argue for why this extension to the notion of architectural style is an important step toward creating a true engineering discipline of architectural design.,True,xB1Z6VwAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,401,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-35563-4_13,7494330789801807333,/scholar?cites=7494330789801807333,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-35563-4_13.pdf,0,0,0
1275169,Managing variability in software architectures,2001,Felix Bachmann and Len Bass,26,ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes,3,126-132,ACM,This paper presents experience with explicitly managing variability within a software architecture. Software architects normally plan for change and put mechanisms in the architecture to support those changes. Understanding the situations where change has been planned for and recording the options possible within particular situations is usually not done explicitly. This becomes important if the architecture is used for many product versions over a long period or in a product line context where the architecture is used to build a variety of different products. That is. it is important to explicitly represent variation and indicate within the architecture locations for which change has been allowed.We will describe how the management of variations in an architecture can be made more explicit and how the use of variation points connected to the choices a customer has when ordering a product can help to navigate to the …,True,xB1Z6VwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,269,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/379377.375274,11043941999890507460,/scholar?cites=11043941999890507460,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA631354.pdf,0,0,0

As a result. it is important to evaluate how a software architecture meets its quality demands. Though much focus has been placed on modeling and describing the software architecture as a design artifact. we found that relatively little is known about the current experience with software architecture evaluation. This report details the results of two workshops on software architecture evaluation. held at the Software Engineering Institute SEI on November 9-10. 1995 and May 9-10. 1996. The purpose of the workshops was to determine the state of industrial practice in the evaluation of software architectures with respect to a set of desired quality attributes. and to uncover recommendations for best practices.

Previous qualitative research suggests that distributed development may increase development cycle time for individual work items (modification requests). We use both data from the source code change management system and survey data to model the extent of delay in a distributed software development organization and explore several possible mechanisms for this delay. One key finding is that distributed work items appear to take about two and one-half times as long to complete as similar items where all the work is colocated. The data strongly suggest a mechanism for the delay. i.e.. that distributed work items involve more people than comparable same-site work items. and the number of people involved is strongly related to the calendar time to complete a work item.

Older engineering fields are examined to ascertain the character that software engineering might have. The current state of software technology is discussed. covering information processing as an economic force. the growing role of software in critical applications. the maturity of development techniques. and the scientific basis for software engineering practice. Five basic steps that the software engineering profession must take to become a true engineering discipline are described.

From its roots in qualitative descriptions of empirically observed useful system organizations. software architecture has matured to encompass a broad set of notations. tools. and analysis techniques. Whereas initially the research area interpreted software practice. it now offers concrete guidance for complex software design and development. It has made the transition from basic research to an essential element of software system design and construction. This retrospective examines software architecture's growth in the context of a technology maturation model. matching its significant accomplishments to the model's stages to gain perspective on where the field stands today.

The tester does this by finding test cases that cause faulty versions of the program to fail. These test cases will then either result in correct output from the test program (demonstrating its quality) or cause the test program to fail (detecting a fault). The technique thus serves two goals: it provides a test adequacy criterion. and it leads to detection of faults in the program being tested.Unit-level-testing techniques such as mutation hold great promise for improving the quality of software.

Ltd.,Several module and class testing techniques have been applied to object‐oriented (OO) programs. but researchers have only recently begun developing test criteria that evaluate the use of key OO features such as inheritance. polymorphism. and encapsulation. Mutation testing is a powerful testing technique for generating software tests and evaluating the quality of software. However. the cost of mutation testing has traditionally been so high that it cannot be applied without full automated tool support. This paper presents a method to reduce the execution cost of mutation testing for OO programs by using two key technologies. mutant schemata generation (MSG) and bytecode translation. This method adapts the existing MSG method for mutants that change the program behaviour and uses bytecode translation for mutants that change the program structure.

The tester does this by finding test cases that cause faulty versions of the program to fail. These test cases will then either result in correct output from the test program (demonstrating its quality) or cause the test program to fail (detecting a fault). The technique thus serves two goals: it provides a test adequacy criterion. and it leads to detection of faults in the program being tested.Unit-level-testing techniques such as mutation hold great promise for improving the quality of software. Unfortunately. most of these techniques are currently so expensive that we cannot afford to use them.

Ltd.,Mutation analysis is a powerful technique for testing software systems. The Mothra software testing project uses mutation analysis as the basis for an integrated software testing environment. Mutation analysis requires executing many slightly differing versions of the same program to evaluate the quality of the data used to test the program. The current version of Mothra includes a complete language system that translates a program to be tested into intermediate code so that it and its mutated versions can be executed by an interpreter.In this paper. we discuss some of the unique requirements of a language system used in a mutation‐based testing environment. We then describe how these requirements affected the design and implementation of the Fortran 77 version of the Mothra system. We also describe the intermediate language used by Mothra and the features of the language system that are needed for …,True,fAeRp3kAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,509,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/spe.4380210704,9638372446687146017,/scholar?cites=9638372446687146017,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.4916&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, USA",,34-44,,Mutation testing is a powerful. but computationally expensive. technique for unit testing software. This expense has prevented mutation from becoming widely used in practical situations. but recent engineering advances have given us techniques and algorithms for significantly reducing the cost of mutation testing. These techniques include a new algorithmic execution technique called schema-based mutation. an approximation technique called weak mutation. a reduction technique called selective mutation. heuristics for detecting equivalent mutants. and algorithms for automatic test data generation. This paper reviews experimentation with these advances and outlines a design for a system that will approximate mutation. but in a way that will be accessible to everyday programmers.

1275235,Testing web applications by modeling with FSMs,2005,Anneliese A Andrews and Jeff Offutt and Roger T Alexander,4,Software & Systems Modeling,3,326-345,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Researchers and practitioners are still trying to find effective ways to model and test Web applications. This paper proposes a system-level testing technique that combines test generation based on finite state machines with constraints. We use a hierarchical approach to model potentially large Web applications. The approach builds hierarchies of Finite State Machines (FSMs) that model subsystems of the Web applications. and then generates test requirements as subsequences of states in the FSMs. These subsequences are then combined and refined to form complete executable tests. The constraints are used to select a reduced set of inputs with the goal of reducing the state space explosion otherwise inherent in using FSMs. The paper illustrates the technique with a running example of a Web-based course student information system and introduces a prototype implementation to support the technique. ,True,fAeRp3kAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,479,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10270-004-0077-7.pdf,9009045767505358667,/scholar?cites=9009045767505358667,,,http://www.cs.albany.edu/~mhc/csi668/05S/1.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,Although the majority of software testing in industry is conducted at the system level. most formal research has focused on the unit level. As a result. most system‐level testing techniques are only described informally. This paper presents formal testing criteria for system level testing that are based on formal specifications of the software. Software testing can only be formalized and quantified when a solid basis for test generation can be defined. Formal specifications represent a significant opportunity for testing because they precisely describe what functions the software is supposed to provide in a form that can be automatically manipulated.This paper presents general criteria for generating test inputs from state‐based specifications. The criteria include techniques for generating tests at several levels of abstraction for specifications (transition predicates. transitions. pairs of transitions and sequences of transitions …,True,fAeRp3kAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,469,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/stvr.264,17894054503888096280,/scholar?cites=17894054503888096280,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30799669/scr-sp-JSTVR.pdf,0,0,0

Organizations now have a tendency to make greater development efforts in more attractive zones. The main advantage of this lies in a greater availability of human resources in decentralized zones at less cost. There are. however. some disadvantages which are caused by the distance that separates the development teams. Coordination and communication become more difficult as the software components are sourced from different places. thus affecting project organization. project control. and product quality.

For this reason. software developers need objective and valid measures for use in the evaluation and improvement of product quality from the initial stages of development. Class diagrams are a key artifact in the development of object-oriented (OO) software because they lay the foundation for all later design and implementation work. It follows that emphasizing class diagram quality may significantly contribute to higher quality OO software systems. The primary aim of this work. therefore. is to present a survey. as complete as possible. of the existing relevant works regarding class diagram metrics. Thus. from works previously published. researchers and practitioners alike may gain broad and ready access to insights for measuring these quality characteristics.

Since that time. the author has continued to develop the representation of application problems. both on a theoretical basis using modeling languages and on a practical basis using real-world studies.

The new title expresses the stricter emphasis on business processes in contrast to the previous edition. which was geared more toward a functional structure. This approach reflects the trend toward process oriented structural and procedural organization in enterprises that is currently being supported by new means of information processing. Perhaps the most obvious way in which the second English-language edition differs from the first is in the increased number of pages. This is a direct result of the higher degree of detail and the more thorough problem description presented in the new edition.

1275255,ARIS—architecture of integrated information systems,1998,August-Wilhelm Scheer and Kristof Schneider,,,,605-623,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,The last couple of years have been marked by technology. not by business. Today. companies are realizing that the use of IT must be tackled from a more processoriented point of view. This new approach is represented by re-engineering and the transformation of business processes. In addition. strategic and technical questions cannot be dealt with separately. In this article. a framework will be presented that encompasses the whole life-cycle. from business process design to information technology (IT) deployment. leading to a completely new process-oriented software concept.

1275256,Enterprise resource planning: making ERP a success,2000,August-Wilhelm Scheer and Frank Habermann,43,Communications of the ACM,4,57-61,ACM,ERP systems are instruments for improving business processes such as manufacturing. purchasing. or distribution. Therefore. ERP implementation and BPR activities should be closely connected. ERP implementation should involve the analysis of current business processes and the chance of reengineering. rather than designing an application system that makes only the best of bad processes. Due to the fact that business processes are very complex. in many cases analysis cannot be done directly on the real-world application. Thus. modeling aims at reducing the complexity of the reality in order to better understand business processes and their required software support. For this purpose. various aspects of business processes can be focused (interaction of organizational units involved. inputoutput-relationships. semantic data structures or communication and information flows. for example).

1275261,Software architecture as a set of architectural design decisions,2005,Anton Jansen and Jan Bosch,,,,109-120,IEEE,Software architectures have high costs for change. are complex. and erode during evolution. We believe these problems are partially due to knowledge vaporization. Currently. almost all the knowledge and information about the design decisions the architecture is based on are implicitly embedded in the architecture. but lack a first-class representation. Consequently. knowledge about these design decisions disappears into the architecture. which leads to the aforementioned problems. In this paper. a new perspective on software architecture is presented. which views software architecture as a composition of a set of explicit design decisions. This perspective makes architectural design decisions an explicit part of a software architecture. Consequently. knowledge vaporization is reduced. thereby alleviating some of the fundamental problems of software architecture.,True,Wr6oSWIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,769,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1620096/,14088156427707662627,/scholar?cites=14088156427707662627,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.60.8680&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

It enables new forms of distributed software architectures. where agreement on shared states can be established without trusting a central integration point. A major difficulty for architects designing applications based on blockchain is that the technology has many configurations and variants. Since blockchains are at an early stage. there is little product data or reliable technology evaluation available to compare different blockchains. In this paper. we propose how to classify and compare blockchains and blockchain-based systems to assist with the design and assessment of their impact on software architectures.

Heidelberg,It is generally claimed that object-based models are very suitable for building distributed system architectures since object interactions follow the client-server model. To cope with the complexity of today's distributed systems. however. we think that high-level linguistic mechanisms are needed to effectively structure. abstract and reuse object interactions. For example. the conventional object-oriented model does not provide high-level language mechanisms to model layered system architectures. Moreover. we consider the message passing model of the conventional object-oriented model as being too low-level because it can only specify object interactions that involve two partner objects at a time and its semantics cannot be extended easily. This paper introduces Abstract Communication Types (ACTs). which are objects that abstract interactions among objects.

Heidelberg,A key aspect of variability management in software product families is the explicit representation of the variability. Experiences at several industrial software development companies have shown that a software variability model should do four things: (1) uniformly represent variation points as first-class entities in all abstraction layers (ranging from features to code). (2) allow for the hierarchical organization of the variability. (3) allow for the first-class representation of simple (i.e.. one-to-one) and complex (i.e.. n-to-m) dependencies. and (4) allow for modeling the relations between dependencies.

Here we report results from calorimetric and stress relaxation experiments using a 20-million-year-old Dominican amber. By performing the stress relaxation experiments in a step-wise fashion. we measured the relaxation time at each temperature and. above the fictive temperature of this 20-million-year-old glass. this is an upper bound to the equilibrium relaxation time. The results deviate dramatically from the expectation of classical theory and are consistent with some modern ideas. in which the diverging timescale signature of complex fluids disappears below the glass transition temperature.,True,LVMYYNgAAAAJ:IxBLoz_EsGYC,208,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2809,16118244929099039096,/scholar?cites=16118244929099039096,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2809,0,0,0

Experimental evidence for protein flexibility is extensive both in solution and in the solid state. A major question is whether the flexibility observed in enzymes is simply an inherent property of proteins that must always be borne in mind or is essential for catalysis or substrate binding. The temperature factors or B-values. as determined crystallographically. are linearly related to the mean square displacement of an atom and give an indication of atomic flexibility in the crystalline state. In this paper. we describe the frequency distributions of the normalized B-factor (B′-factor) for the active site and non-active site residues in the selected 69 apo-enzymes.

1275300,Software metrics: successes. failures and new directions,1999,Norman E Fenton and Martin Neil,47,Journal of Systems and Software,2-3,149-157,Elsevier,The history of software metrics is almost as old as the history of software engineering. Yet. the extensive research and literature on the subject has had little impact on industrial practice. This is worrying given that the major rationale for using metrics is to improve the software engineering decision making process from a managerial and technical perspective. Industrial metrics activity is invariably based around metrics that have been around for nearly 30 years (notably Lines of Code or similar size counts. and defects counts). While such metrics can be considered as massively successful given their popularity. their limitations are well known. and mis-applications are still common. The major problem is in using such metrics in isolation. We argue that it is possible to provide genuinely improved management decision support systems based on such simplistic metrics. but only by adopting a less isolationist approach …,True,0APV5ScAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,381,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121299000357,13378556847059971381,/scholar?cites=13378556847059971381,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.8718&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1275301,Building large-scale Bayesian networks,2000,Martin Neil and Norman Fenton and Lars Nielson,15,,3,257-284,Cambridge University Press,Bayesian networks (BNs) model problems that involve uncertainty. A BN is a directed graph. whose nodes are the uncertain variables and whose edges are the causal or influential links between the variables. Associated with each node is a set of conditional probability functions that model the uncertain relationship between the node and its parents. The benefits of using BNs to model uncertain domains are well known. especially since the recent breakthroughs in algorithms and tools to implement them. However. there have been serious problems for practitioners trying to use BNs to solve realistic problems. This is because. although the tools make it possible to execute large-scale BNs efficiently. there have been no guidelines on building BNs. Specifically. practitioners face two significant barriers. The first barrier is that of specifying the graph structure such that it is a sensible model of the types of reasoning being applied. The second barrier is that of eliciting the conditional probability values. In this paper we concentrate on this first problem. Our solution is based on the notion of generally applicable``building blocks''. called idioms. which serve solution patterns. These can then in turn be combined into larger BNs. using simple combination rules and by exploiting recent ideas on modular and object oriented BNs (OOBNs). This approach. which has been implemented in a BN tool. can be applied in many problem domains. We use examples to illustrate how it has been applied to build large-scale BNs for predicting software safety. In the paper we review related research from the knowledge and software engineering literature.

That is. it should be operational. reflecting the degree to which the system can be expected to remain free of security breaches under particular conditions of operation (including attack). Instead. current security levels at best merely reflect the extensiveness of safeguards introduced during the design and development of a system. Whilst we might expect a system developed to a higher level than another to exhibit ‘more secure behaviour’in operation. this cannot be guaranteed; more particularly. we cannot infer what the actual security behaviour will be from knowledge of such a level.

1275322,Using students as experiment subjects–an analysis on graduate and freshmen student data,2003,Per Runeson,,Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Empirical Assessment in Software Engineering,,95-102,Keele University UK,The question whether students can be used as subjects in software engineering experiments is debated. In order to investigate the feasibility of using students as subjects. a study is conducted in the context of the Personal Software Process (PSP) in which the performance of freshmen students and graduate students are compared and also related to another study in an industrial setting. The hypothesis is that graduate students perform similarly to industry personnel. while freshmen student’s performance differ. A quantitative analysis compares the freshmen’and graduate students. The improvement trends are also compared to industry data. although limited data access does not allow a full comparison. It can be concluded that very much the same improvement trends can be identified for the three groups. However. the dispersion is larger in the freshmen group. The absolute levels of the measured characteristics are significantly different between the student groups primarily with respect to time. ie graduate students do the tasks in shorter time. The data does not give a sufficient answer to the hypothesis. but is a basis for further studies on the issue.,True,7B58FysAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,253,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.6046&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5747513794136193217,/scholar?cites=5747513794136193217,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.99.6046&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1275324,Integrating agile software development into stage-gate managed product development,2006,Daniel Karlström and Per Runeson,11,Empirical Software Engineering,2,203-225,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Agile methods have evolved as a bottom-up approach to software development. However. as the software in embedded products is only one part of development projects. agile methods must coexist with project management models typically of the stage-gate type. This paper presents a qualitative case study of two large independent software system projects that have used eXtreme Programming (XP) for software development within contexts of stage-gate project management models. The study is comprised of open ended interviews with managers as well as practitioners. followed by a structured. fully traceable. qualitative analysis. We conclude that it is possible to integrate XP in a gate model context. Key issues for success are the interfaces towards the agile subproject and management attitudes towards the agile approach.,True,7B58FysAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,198,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-006-6402-8,12050250677116672717,/scholar?cites=12050250677116672717,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.581.3453&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The hollow tubular structure of the α-Fe2O3 NTs presents a high surface area for reaction. while the incorporation of rGO provides an efficient two-dimensional conductive pathway to allow fast. reversible redox reaction. As a result. the nanocomposite materials exhibit a specific capacitance which is remarkably higher (∼7 times) than α-Fe2O3 NTs alone.

Osmotic concentration and its effect on air drying behaviour.,1982,MN Islam and JN Flink,17,International Journal of Food Science & Technology,3,387-403,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,In Part I of this paper (Islam & Flink. 1982). the drying behaviour of potato in a natural convection. solar dryer was discussed. A number of factors were shown to influence the ability to complete the drying process within 1 day. In the current paper. we report on another approach to increase solar dryer throughput. It is shown that osmotic concentration in a 45% sucrose/15% salt solution. prior to solar drying. results in a two‐ to five‐fold increase in product throughput. due to moisture loss and solids uptake in the osmosis step and higher. allowable. final moisture contents for the finished product.

The main idea is the use of simulations parameterized by Galois connections (α. γ). relating the lattices of properties of two systems. We propose and study a notion of preservation of properties expressed by formulas of a logic. by a function α mapping sets of states of a systemS into sets of states of a systemS'. We give results on the preservation of properties expressed in sublanguages of the branching time μ-calculus when two systemsS andS' are related via (α. γ)-simulations.

1275364,Use of Petri nets for performance evaluation,1979,Joseph Sifakis,4,Acta Cybernetica,2,185-202,,Petri nets [1].[2] have been found a simple and elegant formalism for the description of asynchronous systems with concurrent evolutions. According to the adopted interpretation. they can be used to model flow phenomena of information. of energy and of materials [3].[4] and [5]. However. this model is not complete enough for the study of system performances since no assumption is made about the firing of a transition as far as its duration and the moment at which it takes place after the transition has been enabled.Timed Petri nets have been introduced by C. Ramchandani [6] by associating firing times to the transitions of Petri nets. He studied the steady'state behavior and gave methods for calculating the throughput rate for certain classes of Petri nets. The results given in this paper are applicable to the class of pure [7] Petri nets and generalize. in some sense. those presented in [6]. The littérature on timed Petri nets is very poor: to the author's knowledge. the only works on this subjet are the Ramchandani's thesis and a paper by S.

1275369,Actors: A model of concurrent computation in distributed systems.,1985,Gul A Agha,,,,,MIT Press. Cambridge,A foundational model of concurrency is developed in this thesis. It examines issues in the design of parallel systems and show why the actor model is suitable for exploiting large-scale parallelism. Concurrency in actors is constrained only by the availability of hardware resources and by the logical dependence inherent in the computation. Unlike dataflow and functional programming. however. actors are dynamically reconfigurable and can model shared resources with changing local state. Concurrency is spawned in actors using asynchronous message-passing. pipelining. and the dynamic creation of actors. The author defines an abstract actor machine and provide a minimal programming language for it. A more expressive language. which includes higher level constructs such as delayed and eager evaluation. can be defined in terms of the primitives. Examples are given to illustrate the ease with which concurrent data and control structures can be programmed. This thesis deals with some central issues in distributed computing.

1275383,D: A language framework for distributed programming,1997,Cristina Videira Lopes and Gregor Kiczales,,,,,,Two of the most important issues in distributed systems are the synchronization of concurrent threads and the application-level data transfers between execution spaces. At the design level. addressing these issues typically requires analyzing the components under a different perspective than is required to analyze the functionality. Very often. it also involves analyzing several components at the same time. because of the way those two issues cross-cut the units of functionality. At the implementation level. existing programming languages fail to provide adequate support for programming in terms of these different and cross-cutting perspectives. The result is that the programming of synchronization and remote data transfers ends up being tangled throughout the components code in more or less arbitrary ways.This thesis presents a language framework called D that untangles the implementation of synchronization schemes and remote data transfers from the implementation of the components. In the D framework there are three kinds of modules:(1) classes. which are used to implement functional components. and are clear of code dealing with the aspects;(2) coordinators. which concentrate the code for dealing with the thread synchronization aspect; and (3) portals which concentrate the code for dealing with the aspect of application-level data transfers over remote method invocations. To support this separation. D provides two aspect-specific languages: COOL. for programming the coordinators. and RIDL. for programming the portals.

Much of the difficulty in creating information technology systems that truly meet people's needs lies in the problem of pinning down system requirements. This book offers a new approach to the requirements challenge. based on modeling and analyzing the relationships among stakeholders. Although the importance of the system-environment relationship has long been recognized in the requirements engineering field. most requirements modeling techniques express the relationship in mechanistic and behavioral terms. This book describes a modeling approach (called the i* framework) that conceives of software-based information systems as being situated in environments in which social actors relate to each other in terms of goals to be achieved. tasks to be performed. and resources to be furnished. Social perspectives on computing have provided much insight for many years. The i* framework aims to offer a modeling approach to the relationships embedded in computer systems that is part of an engineering method that offers systematic techniques and tools providing smooth linkages to the rest of the system development process. including system design and implementation.

To design an application that is very data driven. you can use an alternative approach to develop some other form of logical view. such as an entity-relationship diagram. The process view describes the design's concurrency and synchronization aspects. The physical view describes the mapping of the software onto the hardware and reflects its distributed aspect.

1275425,The Daikon system for dynamic detection of likely invariants,2007,Michael D Ernst and Jeff H Perkins and Philip J Guo and Stephen McCamant and Carlos Pacheco and Matthew S Tschantz and Chen Xiao,69,Science of computer programming,1-3,35-45,Elsevier,Daikon is an implementation of dynamic detection of likely invariants; that is. the Daikon invariant detector reports likely program invariants. An invariant is a property that holds at a certain point or points in a program; these are often used in assert statements. documentation. and formal specifications. Examples include being constant (x= a). non-zero (x≠ 0). being in a range (a≤ x≤ b). linear relationships (y= a x+ b). ordering (x≤ y). functions from a library (x= fn (y)). containment (x∈ y). sortedness (x is sorted). and many more. Users can extend Daikon to check for additional invariants. Dynamic invariant detection runs a program. observes the values that the program computes. and then reports properties that were true over the observed executions. Dynamic invariant detection is a machine learning technique that can be applied to arbitrary data. Daikon can detect invariants in C. C++.

MapReduce and Dryad are two popular platforms in which the dataflow takes the form of a directed acyclic graph of operators. These platforms lack built-in support for iterative programs. which arise naturally in many applications including data mining. web ranking. graph analysis. model fitting. and so on. This paper presents HaLoop. a modified version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework that is designed to serve these applications. HaLoop not only extends MapReduce with programming support for iterative applications. it also dramatically improves their efficiency by making the task scheduler loop-aware and by adding various caching mechanisms.

Our technique builds inputs incrementally by randomly selecting a method call to apply and finding arguments from among previously-constructed inputs. As soon as an input is built. it is executed and checked against a set of contracts and filters. The result of the execution determines whether the input is redundant. illegal. contract-violating. or useful for generating more inputs. The technique outputs a test suite consisting of unit tests for the classes under test. Passing tests can be used to ensure that code contracts are preserved across program changes; failing tests (that violate one or more contract) point to potential errors that should be corrected.

Because the set of faults in a program is usually unknowable. this definition is not useful to practitioners who are creating test suites. nor to researchers who are creating and evaluating tools that generate test suites. In place of real faults. testing research often uses mutants. which are artificial faults--each one a simple syntactic variation--that are systematically seeded throughout the program under test. Mutation analysis is appealing because large numbers of mutants can be automatically-generated and used to compensate for low quantities or the absence of known real faults. Unfortunately. there is little experimental evidence to support the use of mutants as a replacement for real faults.

SQL injection (SQLI) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are widespread forms of attack in which the attacker crafts the input to the application to access or modify user data and execute malicious code. In the most serious attacks (called second-order. or persistent. XSS). an attacker can corrupt a database so as to cause subsequent users to execute malicious code. This paper presents an automatic technique for creating inputs that expose SQLI and XSS vulnerabilities.

However. this is rarely the case for new software projects and for many companies. So far. only a few have studies focused on transferring prediction models from one project to another. In this paper. we study cross-project defect prediction models on a large scale. For 12 real-world applications. we ran 622 cross-project predictions. Our results indicate that cross-project prediction is a serious challenge. ie. simply using models from projects in the same domain or with the same process does not lead to accurate predictions. To help software engineers choose models wisely. we identified factors that do influence the success of cross-project predictions.

In order to allocate resources effectively. managers need to rely on their experience backed by code complexity metrics. But often dependencies exist between various pieces of code over which managers may have little knowledge. These dependencies can be construed as a low level graph of the entire system. In this paper. we propose to use network analysis on these dependency graphs. This allows managers to identify central program units that are more likely to face defects. In our evaluation on Windows Server 2003. we found that the recall for models built from network measures is by 10% points higher than for models built from complexity metrics.

Elements are either processing. data. or connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the properties of. and the relationships among. the elements --- that is. the constraints on the elements. The rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints. which most often derive from the system requirements.

An event notification service is an application-independent infrastructure that supports the construction of event-based systems. whereby generators of events publish event notifications to the infrastructure and consumers of events subscribe with the infrastructure to receive relevant notifications. The two primary services that should be provided to components by the infrastructure are notification selection (i. e.. determining which notifications match which subscriptions) and notification delivery (i.e.. routing matching notifications from publishers to subscribers).

A content-based network is a communication network that features a new advanced communication model where messages are not given explicit destination addresses. and where the destinations of a message are determined by matching the content of the message against selection predicates declared by nodes. Routing in a content-based network amounts to propagating predicates and the necessary topological information in order to maintain loop-free and possibly minimal forwarding paths for messages. The routing scheme we propose uses a combination of a traditional broadcast protocol and a content-based routing protocol.

Our understanding of insulin resistance has improved tremendously over the years. but certain aspects of its estimation still remain elusive to researchers and clinicians. The quantitative assessment of insulin sensitivity is not routinely used during biochemical investigations for diagnostic purposes. but the emerging importance of insulin resistance has led to its wider application research studies. Evaluation of a number of clinical states where insulin sensitivity is compromised calls for assessment of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is increasingly being assessed in various disease conditions where it aids in examining their pathogenesis. etiology and consequences.

For late-binding to be effective in the case of composite services. a QoS-aware composition mechanism is needed. This means determining the set of services that. once composed. not only will perform the required functionality. but also will best contribute to achieve the level of QoS promised in service level agreements (SLAs). However. QoS-aware composition relies on estimated QoS values and workflow execution paths previously obtained using a monitoring mechanism. At run-time. the actual QoS values may deviate from the estimations. or the execution path may not be the one foreseen. These changes could increase the risk of breaking SLAs and obtaining a poor QoS.

1275536,Specifying distributed software architectures,1995,Jeff Magee and Naranker Dulay and Susan Eisenbach and Jeff Kramer,,,,137-153,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,There is a real need for clear and sound design specifications of distributed systems at the architectural level. This is the level of the design which deals with the high-level organisation of computational elements and the interactions between those elements. The paper presents the Darwin notation for specifying this high-level organisation. Darwin is in essence a declarative binding language which can be used to define hierarchic compositions of interconnected components. Distribution is dealt with orthogonally to system structuring. The language supports the specification of both static structures and dynamic structures which may evolve during execution. The central abstractions managed by Darwin are components and services. Services are the means by which components interact.In addition to its use in specifying the architecture of a distributed system. Darwin has an operational semantics for …,True,wMLDvecAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1292,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-60406-5_12,6789742348574327925,/scholar?cites=6789742348574327925,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff_Kramer2/publication/227303083_Specifying_Distributed_Software_Architectures/links/0a85e53c548a084a6d000000.pdf,0,0,0

This separation of concerns permits the formulation of general structural rules for change at the configuration level without the need to consider application state. and the specification of application component actions without prior knowledge of the actual structural changes which may be introduced. In addition. the changes can be applied in such a way so as to leave the modified system in a consistent state. and cause no disturbance to the unaffected part of the operational system. The model is applied to an example problem. 'evolving philosophers'.

In the early days. developing CE software presented relatively minor challenges. but in the past several years three significant problems have arisen: size and complexity of the software in individual products; the increasing diversity of products and their software; and the need for decreased development time. The question of handling diversity and complexity in embedded software at an increasing production speed becomes an urgent one. The authors present their belief that the answer lies not in hiring more software engineers. They are not readily available. and even if they were. experience shows that larger projects induce larger lead times and often result in greater complexity. Instead. they believe that the answer lies in the use and reuse of software components that work within an explicit software architecture.

In this paper. we focus on architectural approaches to self-management. not because the language-level or network-level approaches are uninteresting or less promising. but because we believe that the architectural level seems to provide the required level of abstraction and generality to deal with the challenges posed.

The facility is a requirement in large distributed systems where it may not be possible or economic to stop the entire system to allow modification to part of its hardware or software. It is also useful during production of the system to aid incremental integration of component parts. and during operation to aid system evolution.

In practice. however. these invariants are usually implicit. An alternative to expecting programmers to fully annotate code with invariants is to automatically infer likely invariants from the program itself. This research focuses on dynamic techniques for discovering invariants from execution traces. This article reports three results. First. it describes techniques for dynamically discovering invariants. along with an implementation. named Daikon. that embodies these techniques.

But simply waiting can lead to rushing to adopt the technology later. which is itself risky. Instead. this article presents a staged approach based on identifying two broad categories of aspects: development aspects facilitate tasks such as debugging. testing. and performance tuning of applications; production aspects implement functionality intended to be included in shipping applications. These categories are informal. and this ordering is not the only way to adopt AspectJ. Some developers will want to use a production aspect right away. but experience with current AspectJ users has shown this ordering allows developers to derive benefits from AOP technology quickly. while also minimizing risk.,True,yx0wJlIAAAAJ:a0OBvERweLwC,858,https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/383845.383858,12798651474447713063,/scholar?cites=12798651474447713063,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.3892&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Toronto. Canada,To our knowledge. no studies have evaluated whether weight loss can be promoted in overweight adults through the use of an intervention that is largely based on daily SMS (Short Message Service: text) and MMS (Multimedia Message Service: small picture) messages transmitted via mobile phones. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a text message–based intervention designed to help individuals lose or maintain weight over 4 months. The study was a randomized controlled trial. with participants being exposed to one of the following two conditions. lasting 16 weeks: (1) receipt of monthly printed materials about weight control; (2) an intervention that included personalized SMS and MMS messages sent two to five times daily. printed materials. and brief monthly phone calls from a health counselor. The primary outcome was weight at the end of the intervention.

We need better explanatory and prescriptive models of the nature and value of information hiding. We evaluate the potential of a new theory---developed to account for the influence of modularity on the evolution of the computer industry---to inform software design. The theory uses design structure matrices to model designs and real options techniques to value them. To test the potential utility of the theory for software we apply it to Parnas's KWIC designs. We contribute an extension to design structure matrices. and we show that the options results are consistent with Parnas's conclusions.

Some dependencies between source code. such as those between source code written in different languages. are difficult to determine using existing static and dynamic analyses. To augment existing analyses and to help developers identify relevant source code during a modification task. we have developed an approach that applies data mining techniques to determine change patterns - sets of files that were changed together frequently in the past - from the change history of the code base. Our hypothesis is that the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially relevant source code to a developer performing a modification task.

This forces the implementation of those design decisions to be scattered throughout the code. resulting in “tangled” code that is excessively difficult to develop and maintain. We present an analysis of why certain design decisions have been so difficult to clearly capture in actual code. We call the properties these decisions address aspects. and show that the reason they have been hard to capture is that they cross-cut the system's basic functionality.

There is fomenting in software development process. system structure. programming. quality assurance. and maintenance. Software is about building computational models of some part of the elements or information flow of the world. For all but the most trivial software systems. conquering the engineering of the system requires (perhaps recursively) dividing the system into chunks that can be (by and large) separately created and managed. The last decade of the twentieth century saw the rise (and perhaps dominance) of the object-oriented perspective on system modularization. Object-orientation focuses on selecting objects as the primary unit of modularity and associating with these objects all the system's behavior. Objects are typically elements of the domain or of the computational process. Object-orientation is reaching its limits. Many things one cares about in creating a software system (concerns) are not neatly localized to the behavior of specific"" things.""

To cope with the complexity of today's distributed systems. however. we think that high-level linguistic mechanisms are needed to effectively structure. abstract and reuse object interactions. For example. the conventional object-oriented model does not provide high-level language mechanisms to model layered system architectures. Moreover. we consider the message passing model of the conventional object-oriented model as being too low-level because it can only specify object interactions that involve two partner objects at a time and its semantics cannot be extended easily.

A technological space is a working context with a set of associated concepts. body of knowledge. tools. required skills. and possibilities. It is often associated to a given user community with shared know-how. educational support. common literature and even workshop and conference regular meetings. Although it is difficult to give a precise definition. some TSs can be easily identified. eg the XML TS. the DBMS TS. the abstract syntax TS. the meta-model (OMG/MDA) TS. etc. The purpose of our work is not to define an abstract theory of technological spaces. but to figure out how to work more efficiently by using the best possibilities of each technology. To do so. we need a basic understanding of the similarities and differences between various TSs. and also of the possible operational bridges that will allow transferring the results obtained in one TS to other TS. We hope that the presented industrial vision may help us putting forward the idea that there could be more cooperation than competition among alternative technologies.

First of the several notable characteristics of this field is its very rapid growth. There were early harbingers of the field's subject matter [1]—the use of mi-croeconomic analysis to evaluate the economic efficiency of the common law rules of property. contract. and tort and various topics in civil and criminal procedure. substantive criminal law. the law of corporations. and so on—and isolated but seminal articles by Ronald Coase and others in the 1950s and 1960s. But I think that it is fair to say that law and economics was born and brought to adolescence in the course of a single decade. the 1970s. Very few innovations in economic or legal scholarship of the recent past have grown so rapidly. Second. the field of law and economics has had a profound impact on legal scholarship.

The production rates of three-jet events in the data decrease significantly with increasing centre of mass energy.

To address this we have advocated distributed development of specifications from multiple perspectives. However. this leads to problems of identifying and handling inconsistencies between such perspectives. Maintaining absolute consistency is not always possible. Often this is not even desirable since this can unnecessarily constrain the development process. and can lead to the loss of important information. Indeed since the real-world forces us to work with inconsistencies. we should formalize some of the usually informal or extra-logical ways of responding to them.

1275635,GUI ripping: Reverse engineering of graphical user interfaces for testing,2003,Atif Memon and Ishan Banerjee and Adithya Nagarajan,,,,260-269,IEEE,Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are important parts of today’s software and their correct execution is required to ensure the correctness of the overall software. A popular technique to detect defects in GUIs is to test them by executing test cases and checking the execution results. Test cases may either be created manually or generated automatically from a model of the GUI. While manual testing is unacceptably slow for many applications. our experience with GUI testing has shown that creating a model that can be used for automated test case generation is difficult. We describe a new approach to reverse engineer a model represented as structures called a GUI forest. event-flow graphs and an integration tree directly from the executable GUI. We describe “GUI Ripping”. a dynamic process in which the software’s GUI is automatically “traversed” by opening all its windows and extracting all their widgets (GUI objects). properties. and values. The extracted information is then verified by the test designer and used to automatically generate test cases.

Ltd.,The current study investigated memory conformity effects between individuals who witness and then discuss a criminal event. employing a novel procedure whereby each member of a dyad watches a different video of the same event. Each video contained unique items that were thus seen only by one witness. Dyads in one condition were encouraged to discuss the event before each witness (individually) performed a recall test. while in a control condition dyads were not allowed to discuss the event prior to recall. A significant proportion (71%) of witnesses who had discussed the event went on to mistakenly recall items acquired during the discussion. There were no age‐related differences in susceptibility to these memory conformity effects in younger (18–30 years) as compared to older (60–80 years) participants.

With the growing complexity come challenges in testing the correctness of a GUI and its underlying software. We present a new technique to automatically generate test cases for GUIs that exploits planning. a well-developed and used technique in artificial intelligence. Given a set of operators. an initial state. and a goal state. a planner produces a sequence of the operators that will transform the initial state to the goal state. Our test case generation technique enables efficient application of planning by first creating a hierarchical model of a GUI based on its structure. The GUI model consists of hierarchical planning operators representing the possible events in the GUI. The test designer defines the preconditions and effects of the hierarchical operators. which are input into a plan-generation system …,True,jJPSj0IAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,418,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/908959/,14152768032883984415,/scholar?cites=14152768032883984415,,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are by far the most popular means used to interact with today's software. The functional correctness of a GUI is required to ensure the safety. robustness and usability of an entire software system. GUI testing techniques used in practice are resource intensive; model‐based automated techniques are rarely employed. A key reason for the reluctance in the adoption of model‐based solutions proposed by researchers is their limited applicability; moreover. the models are expensive to create. Over the past few years. the present author has been developing different models for various aspects of GUI testing. This paper consolidates all of the models into one scalable event‐flow model and outlines algorithms to semi‐automatically reverse‐engineer the model from an implementation.

GUIs have characteristics different from traditional software. and conventional testing techniques do not directly apply to GUIs. This paper's focus is on coverage critieria for GUIs. important rules that provide an objective measure of test quality. We present new coverage criteria to help determine whether a GUI has been adequately tested. These coverage criteria use events and event sequences to specify a measure of test adequacy. Since the total number of permutations of event sequences in any non-trivial GUI is extremely large. the GUI's hierarchical structure is exploited to identify the important event sequences to be tested. A GUI is decomposed into GUI components. each of which is used as a basic unit of testing.

One problem with high-level models is that they are almost always inaccurate with respect to the system’s source code. We have developed an approach that helps an engineer use a high-level model of the structure of an existing software system as a lens through which to see a model of that system’s source code.

Using our tool we extracted clone genealogy information for two Java open source projects and analyzed their evolution.Our study contradicts some conventional wisdom about clones.

Heidelberg,Software engineering is not only about technical solutions. It is to a large extent also concerned with organizational issues. project management and human behaviour. For a discipline like software engineering. empirical methods are crucial. since they allow for incorporating human behaviour into the research approach taken. Empirical methods are common practice in many other disciplines. This chapter provides a motivation for the use of empirical methods in software engineering research. The main motivation is that it is needed from an engineering perspective to allow for informed and well-grounded decision. The chapter continues with a brief introduction to four research methods: controlled experiments. case studies. surveys and post-mortem analyses. These methods are then put into an improvement context.

When examining feature diagrams in the literature and from industry. we observed that the same modelling concepts are used for documenting two different kinds of variability: (1) product line variability. which reflects decisions of product management on how the systems that belong to the product line should vary. and (2) software variability. which reflects the ability of the reusable product line artefacts to be customized or configured. To disambiguate the documentation of variability. we follow previous suggestions to relate orthogonal variability models (OVMs) to feature diagrams.

Variability empowers constructive reuse and facilitates the derivation of different. customer specific products from the product family. If many customer specific requirements can be realised by exploiting the product family variability. the reuse achieved is obviously high. If not. the reuse is low. It is thus important that the variability of the product family is adequately considered when eliciting requirements from the customer.In this paper we sketch the challenges for requirements engineering for product family applications. More precisely we elaborate on the need to communicate the variability of the product family to the customer.

1275681,Handling obstacles in goal-oriented requirements engineering,2000,Axel Van Lamsweerde and Emmanuel Letier,26,IEEE Transactions on software engineering,10,978-1005,IEEE,Requirements engineering is concerned with the elicitation of high-level goals to be achieved by the envisioned system. the refinement of such goals and their operationalization into specifications of services and constraints and the assignment of responsibilities for the resulting requirements to agents such as humans. devices and software. Requirements engineering processes often result in goals. requirements. and assumptions about agent behavior that are too ideal; some of them are likely not to be satisfied from time to time in the running system due to unexpected agent behavior. The lack of anticipation of exceptional behaviors results in unrealistic. unachievable. and/or incomplete requirements. As a consequence. the software developed from those requirements will not be robust enough and will inevitably result in poor performance or failures. sometimes with critical consequences on the environment.

Resolving such inconsistencies sooner or later in the process is a necessary condition for successful development of the software implementing those requirements. The paper first reviews the main types of inconsistency that can arise during requirements elaboration. defining them in an integrated framework and exploring their interrelationships. It then concentrates on the specific case of conflicting formulations of goals and requirements among different stakeholder viewpoints or within a single viewpoint. A frequent. weaker form of conflict called divergence is introduced and studied in depth. Formal techniques and heuristics are proposed for detecting conflicts and divergences from specifications of goals/requirements and of domain properties.

However. it is not yet very clear how to achieve this systematically through the various stages of the requirements engineering process. The paper presents a constructive approach to the modeling. specification and analysis of application-specific security requirements. The method is based on a goal-oriented framework for generating and resolving obstacles to goal satisfaction. The extended framework addresses malicious obstacles (called anti-goals) set up by attackers to threaten security goals. Threat trees are built systematically through anti-goal refinement until leaf nodes are derived that are either software vulnerabilities observable by the attacker or anti-requirements implementable by this attacker. New security requirements are then obtained as countermeasures by application of threat …,True,KhZnymAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,545,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1317437/,6982434748571072415,/scholar?cites=6982434748571072415,,,http://handouts.secappdev.org/handouts/2008/Elaborating%20Security%20Requirements%20by%20Construction%20of%20Intentional%20Anti-Models.pdf,0,0,0

1275703,An exploratory study of the pull-based software development model,2014,Georgios Gousios and Martin Pinzger and Arie van Deursen,,,,345-355,,The advent of distributed version control systems has led to the development of a new paradigm for distributed software development; instead of pushing changes to a central repository. developers pull them from other repositories and merge them locally. Various code hosting sites. notably Github. have tapped on the opportunity to facilitate pull-based development by offering workflow support tools. such as code reviewing systems and integrated issue trackers. In this work. we explore how pull-based software development works. first on the GHTorrent corpus and then on a carefully selected sample of 291 projects. We find that the pull request model offers fast turnaround. increased opportunities for community engagement and decreased time to incorporate contributions.

Given the fact that the ideal test code/production code ratio approaches 1: 1. it is not surprising that unit tests are being refactored. We found that refactoring test code is different from refactoring production code in two ways:(1) there is a distinct set of bad smells involved. and (2) improving test code involves additional test-specific refactorings.

At the same time. such techniques---collectively known as Ajax---shatter the concept of webpages with unique URLs. on which traditional Web crawlers are based. This article describes a novel technique for crawling Ajax-based applications through automatic dynamic analysis of user-interface-state changes in Web browsers. Our algorithm scans the DOM tree. spots candidate elements that are capable of changing the state. fires events on those candidate elements. and incrementally infers a state machine that models the various navigational paths and states within an Ajax application.

Unfortunately. legacy data structures tend to grow over time. and may contain many unrelated fields at the time of migration. We propose a method for identifying objects by semi-automatically restructuring the legacy data structures. Issues involved include the selection of record fields of interest. the identification of procedures actually dealing with such fields. and the construction of coherent groups of fields and procedures into candidate classes. We explore the use of cluster and concept analysis for the purpose of object identification. and we illustrate their effect on a 100.000 LOC Cobol system.

To address this we have advocated distributed development of specifications from multiple perspectives. However. this leads to problems of identifying and handling inconsistencies between such perspectives. Maintaining absolute consistency is not always possible. Often this is not even desirable since this can unnecessarily constrain the development process. and can lead to the loss of important information. Indeed since the real-world forces us to work with inconsistencies. we should formalize some of the usually informal or extra-logical ways of responding to them. This is not necessarily done by eradicating inconsistencies but rather by supplying logical rules specifying how we should act on them.

Alternatively. this process creates systems with constrained architectures that restrict users and handicap developers by resisting inevitable and desirable changes in requirements. The spiral life-cycle model addresses many drawbacks of a waterfall model by providing an incremental development process. in which developers repeatedly evaluate changing project risks to manage unstable requirements and funding.

The satisfaction argument consists of two parts: a formal argument that the system can meet its security requirements and a structured informal argument supporting the assumptions expressed in the formal argument.

In an evolving specification. multiple development participants often hold multiple inconsistent views on the system being developed. and considerable effort is spent handling recurrent inconsistencies. Detecting and resolving inconsistencies is only part of the problem; a resolved inconsistency might not stay resolved as a specification evolves. Frameworks in which inconsistency is tolerated help by allowing resolution to be delayed. However. the evolution of a specification may affect both resolved and unresolved inconsistencies. A framework is presented and elaborated in which software development knowledge is partitioned into multiple views called ViewPoints. Inconsistencies between ViewPoints are managed by explicitly representing relationships between them. and recording both resolved and unresolved inconsistencies.

To support this. we used classical logic to represent partial specifications and to identify inconsistencies between them. We now present an adaptation of classical logic. which we term quasi-classical (QC) logic. that allows continued reasoning in the presence of inconsistency. The adaptation is a weakening of classical logic that prohibits all trivial derivations. but still allows all resolvants of the assumptions to be derived. Furthermore. the connectives behave in a classical manner. We then present a development called labeled QC logic that records and tracks assumptions used in reasoning. This facilitates a logical analysis of inconsistent information. We discuss that  application of labeled QC logic in the analysis of multiperspective specifications.

1275726,AVIO: detecting atomicity violations via access interleaving invariants,2006,Shan Lu and Joseph Tucek and Feng Qin and Yuanyuan Zhou,40,ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review,5,37-48,ACM,Concurrency bugs are among the most difficult to test and diagnose of all software bugs. The multicore technology trend worsens this problem. Most previous concurrency bug detection work focuses on one bug subclass. data races. and neglects many other important ones such as atomicity violations. which will soon become increasingly important due to the emerging trend of transactional memory models.This paper proposes an innovative. comprehensive. invariantbased approach called AVIO to detect atomicity violations. Our idea is based on a novel observation called access interleaving invariant. which is a good indication of programmers' assumptions about the atomicity of certain code regions. By automatically extracting such invariants and detecting violations of these invariants at run time. AVIO can detect a variety of atomicity violations.Based on this idea. we have designed and built two implementations …,True,rWl0U0oAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,488,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1168917.1168864,7496113157976911162,/scholar?cites=7496113157976911162,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30604254/10.1.1.91.1388.pdf,0,0,0

Unfortunately. software failures greatly reduce system availability. Prior work on surviving software failures suffers from one or more of the following limitations: Required application restructuring. inability to address deterministic software bugs. unsafe speculation on program execution. and long recovery time. This paper proposes an innovative safe technique. called Rx. which can quickly recover programs from many types of software bugs. both deterministic and non-deterministic. Our idea. inspired from allergy treatment in real life. is to rollback the program to a recent checkpoint upon a software failure. and then to re-execute the program in a modified environment.

As they occupy a layer below the entire software stack. malicious circuits can bypass traditional defensive techniques. Yet current work on trojan circuits considers only simple attacks against the hardware itself. and straightforward defenses. More complex designs that attack the software are unexplored. as are the countermeasures an attacker may take to bypass proposed defenses.We present the design and implementation of Illinois Malicious Processors (IMPs). There is a substantial design space in malicious circuitry; we show that an attacker. rather than designing one specific attack. can instead design hardware to support attacks. Such flexible hardware allows powerful. general purpose attacks. while remaining surprisingly low in the amount of additional hardware. We show two such hardware designs. and implement them in a real system. Further. we show three powerful attacks using this hardware. including a login backdoor that gives an attacker complete and highlevel access to the machine. This login attack requires only 1341 additional gates: gates that can be used for other attacks as well.

However. the determinants of AR overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show that retinoic acid receptor–related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors. and that ROR-γ drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR-γ recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3. also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an AR–ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. ROR-γ antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and its variant AR-V7 in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR-γ antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding.

Much of the difficulty in creating information technology systems that truly meet people's needs lies in the problem of pinning down system requirements. This book offers a new approach to the requirements challenge. based on modeling and analyzing the relationships among stakeholders. Although the importance of the system-environment relationship has long been recognized in the requirements engineering field. most requirements modeling techniques express the relationship in mechanistic and behavioral terms. This book describes a modeling approach (called the i* framework) that conceives of software-based information systems as being situated in environments in which social actors relate to each other in terms of goals to be achieved. tasks to be performed. and resources to be furnished. Social perspectives on computing have provided much insight for many years. The i* framework aims to offer a modeling approach to the relationships embedded in computer systems that is part of an engineering method that offers systematic techniques and tools providing smooth linkages to the rest of the system development process. including system design and implementation.

We have improved an artifact management system with a traceability recovery tool based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). an information retrieval technique. We have assessed LSI to identify strengths and limitations of using information retrieval techniques for traceability recovery and devised the need for an incremental approach. The method and the tool have been evaluated during the development of seventeen software projects involving about 150 students. We observed that although tools based on information retrieval provide a useful support for the identification of traceability links during software development. they are still far to support a complete semi-automatic recovery of all links.

1275768,Conditioned program slicing,1998,Gerardo Canfora and Aniello Cimitile and Andrea De Lucia,40,Information and Software Technology,11-12,595-607,Elsevier,Slicing is a technique to decompose programs based on the analysis of the control and data flow. In the original Weiser's definition. a slice consists of any subset of program statements preserving the behaviour of the original program with respect to a program point and a subset of the program variables (slicing criterion). for any execution path. We present conditioned slicing. a general slicing model based on statement deletion. A conditioned slice consists of a subset of program statements which preserves the behaviour of the original program with respect to a slicing criterion for a given set of execution paths. The set of initial states of the program that characterise these paths is specified in the form of a first order logic formula on the input variables. We also show how slices deriving from other statement deletion based slicing models can be defined as conditioned slices.

In all these approaches. topic models have been used on software artifacts in a similar manner as they were used on natural language documents (e.g.. using the same settings and parameters) because the underlying assumption was that source code and natural language documents are similar. However. applying topic models on software data using the same settings as for natural language text did not always produce the expected results. Recent research investigated this assumption and showed that source code is much more repetitive and predictable as compared to the natural language text.

There are several factors that contribute to technical debt. One of these is represented by code bad smells. i.e.. Symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. While the repercussions of smells on code quality have been empirically assessed. there is still only anecdotal evidence on when and why bad smells are introduced. To fill this gap. we conducted a large empirical study over the change history of 200 open source projects from different software ecosystems and investigated when bad smells are introduced by developers. and the circumstances and reasons behind their introduction.

Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is a pre-treatment technique. which is being used widely to reduce and control the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission from diesel engines. EGR controls the NOx because it lowers oxygen concentration and flame temperature of the working fluid in the combustion chamber. However. the use of EGR leads to a trade-off in terms of soot emissions. Higher soot generated by EGR leads to long-term usage problems inside the engines such as higher carbon deposits. lubricating oil degradation and enhanced engine wear.

NOx formation is a highly temperature-dependent phenomenon and takes place when the temperature in the combustion chamber exceeds 2000 K. Therefore. in order to reduce NOx emissions in the exhaust. it is necessary to keep peak combustion temperatures under control.One simple way of reducing the NOx emission of a diesel engine is by late injection of fuel into the combustion chamber. This technique is effective but increases fuel consumption by 10–15%. which necessitates the use of more effective NOx reduction techniques like exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Re-circulating part of the exhaust gas helps in reducing NOx. but appreciable paniculate emissions are observed at high loads. hence there is a trade-off between NOx and smoke emission. To get maximum benefit from this trade-off. a paniculate trap may be used to reduce the amount of unburnt particulates in …,True,Z38tq2QAAAAJ:8rj-XRKUtKYC,171,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02703777,1062980041537522661,/scholar?cites=1062980041537522661,,,https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Volumes/sadh/029/03/0275-0284.pdf,0,0,0

We argue that simpler natural animals already exhibit most of the properties required by an autonomous agent. and suggest that designers of autonomous agents should draw directly upon the neural basis of behavior in these animals. The relevant behavioral and neurobiological literature is briefly reviewed. An artificial nervous system for controlling the behavior of a simulated insect is then developed.

1275805,Learning and classification of monotonic ordinal concepts,1989,Arie Ben‐David and Leon Sterling and Yoh‐Han Pao,5,Computational Intelligence,1,45-49,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Ordinal reasoning plays a major role in human cognition. This paper identifies an important class of classification problems of patterns taken from ordinal domains and presents efficient. incremental algorithms for learning the classification rules from examples. We show that by adopting a monotonicity assumption of the output with respect to the input. inconsistencies among examples can be easily detected and the number of possible classification rules substantially reduced. By adopting a conservative classification criterion. the required number of rules further decreases.

Locating the source code files that need to be changed in order to fix the bugs is a challenging task. Once a bug report is received. it is desirable to automatically point out to the files that developers should change in order to fix the bug. In this paper. we propose BugLocator. an information retrieval based method for locating the relevant files for fixing a bug. BugLocator ranks all files based on the textual similarity between the initial bug report and the source code using a revised Vector Space Model (rVSM). taking into consideration information about similar bugs that have been fixed before. We perform large-scale experiments on four open source projects to localize more than 3.000 bugs. The results show that BugLocator can effectively locate the files where the bugs should be fixed.

1275828,Fitness-guided path exploration in dynamic symbolic execution,2009,Tao Xie and Nikolai Tillmann and Jonathan de Halleux and Wolfram Schulte,,,,359-368,IEEE,Dynamic symbolic execution is a structural testing technique that systematically explores feasible paths of the program under test by running the program with different test inputs to improve code coverage. To address the space-explosion issue in path exploration. we propose a novel approach called Fitnex. a search strategy that uses state-dependent fitness values (computed through a fitness function) to guide path exploration. The fitness function measures how close an already discovered feasible path is to a particular test target (e.g.. covering a not-yet-covered branch). Our new fitness-guided search strategy is integrated with other strategies that are effective for exploration problems where the fitness heuristic fails. We implemented the new approach in Pex. an automated structural testing tool developed at Microsoft Research. We evaluated our new approach by comparing it with existing search strategies.

Since current approaches focus their analyses on the types of security-sensitive resources being accessed (e.g.. network). these evasive techniques in malware make differentiating between malicious and benign app behaviors a difficult task during app analysis.

The performance of the FCM algorithm depends on the selection of the initial cluster center and/or the initial membership value. If a good initial cluster center that is close to the actual final cluster center can be found. the FCM algorithm will converge very quickly and the processing time can be drastically reduced. The authors propose a novel algorithm for efficient clustering. This algorithm is a modified FCM called the psFCM algorithm. which significantly reduces the computation time required to partition a dataset into desired clusters. We find the actual cluster center by using a simplified set of the original complete dataset. It refines the initial value of the FCM algorithm to speed up the convergence time.

However. most k-means methods require expensive distance calculations of centroids to achieve convergence. In this paper. we present an efficient algorithm to implement a k-means clustering that produces clusters comparable to slower methods. In our algorithm. we partition the original dataset into blocks; each block unit. called a unit block (UB). contains at least one pattern. We can locate the centroid of a unit block (CUB) by using a simple calculation. All the computed CUBs form a reduced dataset that represents the original dataset. The reduced dataset is then used to compute the final centroid of the original dataset. We only need to examine each UB on the boundary of candidate clusters to find the closest final centroid for every pattern in the UB. In this way. we can dramatically reduce the time for calculating final converged centroids.

In this paper. we propose a general framework based on the decision tree for mining and processing image data. Pixel-wised image features were extracted and transformed into a database-like table which allows various data mining algorithms to make explorations on it. Each tuple of the transformed table has a feature descriptor formed by a set of features in conjunction with the target label of a particular pixel. With the label feature. we can adopt the decision tree induction to realize relationships between attributes and the target label from image pixels. and to construct a model for pixel-wised image processing according to a given training image dataset. Both experimental and theoretical analyses were performed in this study. Their results show that the proposed model can be very efficient and effective for image processing and image mining. It is anticipated that by using the proposed model. various existing data mining and image processing methods could be worked on together in different ways.

This is because each processor can render images locally without communicating with other processors. However. in the compositing phase. a processor has to exchange local images with other processors. When the number of processors exceeds a threshold. the image compositing time becomes a bottleneck.

Unfortunately. mainstream programming languages do not provide mechanisms that enable software entities to adapt their behavior dynamically to the current execution context. This leads developers to adopt convoluted designs to achieve the necessary runtime flexibility. We propose a new programming technique called Context-oriented Programming (COP) which addresses this problem. COP treats context explicitly. and provides mechanisms to dynamically adapt behavior in reaction to changes in context. even after system deployment at runtime.

Reverse engineering is an integral part of any successful software system. because changing requirements lead to implementations that drift from their original design.

We model developer expertise using the vocabulary found in their source code contributions and compare this vocabulary to the vocabulary of bug reports. We evaluate our approach by comparing the suggested experts to the persons who eventually worked on the bug. Using eight years of Eclipse development as a case study. we achieve 33.6% top-1 precision and 71.0% top-10 recall.,True,Yi00hUYAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,273,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5069491/,4777685979298849821,/scholar?cites=4777685979298849821,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.150.2317&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1275896,Path feasibility analysis for string-manipulating programs,2009,Nikolaj Bjørner and Nikolai Tillmann and Andrei Voronkov,,,,307-321,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,We discuss the problem of path feasibility for programs manipulating strings using a collection of standard string library functions. We prove results on the complexity of this problem. including its undecidability in the general case and decidability of some special cases. In the context of test-case generation. we are interested in an efficient finite model finding method for string constraints. To this end we develop a two-tier finite model finding procedure. First. an integer abstraction of string constraints are passed to an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. The abstraction is either unsatisfiable. or the solver produces a model that fixes lengths of enough strings to reduce the entire problem to be finite domain. The resulting fixed-length string constraints are then solved in a second phase. We implemented the procedure in a symbolic execution framework. report on the encouraging results and discuss …,True,kja6dIzH9GwJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,209,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-00768-2_27,1513351559906471101,/scholar?cites=1513351559906471101,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-00768-2_27.pdf,0,0,0

This suite takes into account the different 00 design mechanisms provided by the C++ language (eg. friendship between classes. specialization. and aggregation) but it can be tailored to other 00 languages. The different measures in our suite thus reflect different hypotheses about the different mechanisms of coupling in 00 systems. Based on actual project defect data. the hypotheses underlying our coupling measures are empirically validated by analyzing their relationship with the probability of fault detection across classes. The results demonstrate that some of these coupling measures may be useful early quality indicators of the design'of 00 systems.

We examine the relationship between different ownership measures and software failures in two large software projects: Windows Vista and Windows 7. We find that in all cases. measures of ownership such as the number of low-expertise developers. and the proportion of ownership for the top owner have a relationship with both pre-release faults and post-release failures. We also empirically identify reasons that low-expertise developers make changes to components and show that the removal of low-expertise contributions dramatically decreases the performance of contribution based defect prediction.

DSCMs facilitate a style of collaboration in which work output can flow sideways (and privately) between collaborators. rather than always up and down (and publicly) via a central repository. Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git. a very popular DSCM used in high-profile projects.

1275931,The object-oriented systems life cycle,1990,Brian Henderson-Sellers and Julian M Edwards,33,Communications of the ACM,9,142-159,ACM,In software engineering. the traditional description of the software life cycle is based on an underlying model. commonly referred to as the “waterfall” model (e.g.. [4]). This model initially attempts to discretize the identifiable activities within the software development process as a linear series of actions. each of which must be completed before the next is commenced. Further refinements to this model appreciate that such completion is seldom absolute and that iteration back to a previous stage is likely. Various authors' descriptions of this model relate to the detailed level at which the software building process is viewed. At the most general level. three phases to the life cycle are generally agreed upon: 1) analysis. 2) design and 3) construction/implementation (e.g.. [36]. p. 262; [42]) (Figure 1(a)).

As a result. each relevant and major UML construct becomes more precisely defined in terms of the phenomena in and aspects of the problem domain it represents. The analysis and evaluation shows that many of the central UML constructs are well matched with the BWW-model. but also suggests several concrete improvements to the UML-metamodel.

1275941,Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap,2007,Robert France and Bernhard Rumpe,,,,37-54,IEEE,The term model-driven engineering (MDE) is typically used to describe software development approaches in which abstract models of software systems are created and systematically transformed to concrete implementations. In this paper we give an overview of current research in MDE and discuss some of the major challenges that must be tackled in order to realize the MDE vision of software development. We argue that full realizations of the MDE vision may not be possible in the near to medium-term primarily because of the wicked problems involved. On the other hand. attempting to realize the vision will provide insights that can be used to significantly reduce the gap between evolving software complexity and the technologies used to manage complexity.,True,nED1C7QAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1503,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4221611/,13058879282461552308,/scholar?cites=13058879282461552308,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6620,0,0,0

1275944,The UML as a formal modeling notation,1998,Andy Evans and Robert France and Kevin Lano and Bernhard Rumpe,,,,336-348,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is rapidly emerging as a de-facto standard for modelling OO systems. Given this role. it is imperative that the UML needs a well-defined. fully explored semantics. Such semantics is required in order to ensure that UML concepts are precisely stated and defined. In this paper we motivate an approach to formalizing UML in which formal specification techniques are used to gain insight into the semantics of UML notations and diagrams and describe a roadmap for this approach. The authors initiated the Precise UML (PUML) group in order to develop a precise semantic model for UML diagrams. The semantic model is to be used as the basis for a set of diagrammatical transformation rules. which enable formal deductions to be made about UML diagrams. A small example shows how these rules can be used to verify whether one class diagram is a valid deduction of …,True,nED1C7QAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,353,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-48480-6_26,6939218738268119391,/scholar?cites=6939218738268119391,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6919,0,0,0

Particularly relevant is the case of the recently standardized UML. which we refer to quite extensively as we proceed. Our intention is to discuss and clarify the notions involved in de ning modeling languages. The main theme is the distinction between syntax and semantics. the nature and purpose of each. their usage and style. and the various means for de ning and dealing with them. Underlying the exposition are the dichotomies of textual vs. visual languages. structural vs. behavioral speci cation. and requirements vs. system models.

1275946,Assumptions underlying agile software-development processes,2005,Daniel Turk and France Robert and Bernhard Rumpe,16,,4,62-87,IGI Global,Agile processes focus on the early facilitation and fast production of working code. and are based on software-development process models that support iterative. incremental development of software. Although agile methods have existed for a number of years now. answers to questions concerning the suitability of agile processes to particular software-development environments are still often based on anecdotal accounts of experiences. An appreciation of the (often unstated) assumptions underlying agile processes can lead to a better understanding of the applicability of agile processes to particular situations. Agile processes are less likely to be applicable in situations in which core assumptions do not hold. This article examines the principles and advocated practices of agile processes to identify underlying assumptions. It also identifies limitations that may arise from these assumptions and outlines how the …,True,nED1C7QAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,300,https://www.igi-global.com/article/journal-database-management-jdm/3342,3812037948672695750,/scholar?cites=3812037948672695750,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.6610,0,0,0

It consists of a set of notations for modeling systems from a variety of views and at varying levels of abstraction. While the UML reflects some of the best OO modeling experiences available. it suffers from a lack of precise semantics that is necessary if one is to use the notations to precisely model systems and to rigorously reason about the models. In this paper we discuss some of the problems with the current UML semantic document and present the approach that the precise UML group (pUML) group is using to develop a precise semantics for the UML. The approach utilizes mathematical techniques to explore and gain insights into appropriate semantics for UML modeling concepts. The insights and formal expressions will then be used to develop a UML semantics document written in …,True,nED1C7QAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,244,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920548998000208,1026838878779223888,/scholar?cites=1026838878779223888,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.5.4898&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Coping with complex language definitions. evolving them in a structured way. and ensuring their error freeness are the main challenges of DSL design and implementation. The use of modular language definitions and composition operators are therefore inevitable in the independent development of language components. In this article. we discuss these arising issues by describing a framework for the compositional development of textual DSLs and their supporting tools. We use a redundance-free definition of a readable concrete syntax and a comprehensible abstract syntax as both representations significantly overlap in their structure. For enhancing the usability of the abstract syntax. we added concepts like associations and inheritance to a grammar-based definition in order to build up arbitrary graphs (as known from metamodeling).

In this framework. a context of use is decomposed into three facets: the end users of the interactive system. the hardware and software computing platform with which the users have to carry out their interactive tasks and the physical environment where they are working. Therefore. a context-sensitive user interface is a user interface that exhibits some capability to be aware of the context (context awareness) and to react to changes of this context.

We define a context of use as the set of values of variables that characterize the computational device (s) used for interacting with the system as well as the physical and social environment where the interaction takes place. A UI is plastic if it is able to adapt to context changes while preserving usability. In this paper we present a reference process for the engineering of plastic user interfaces.

One of the major problems in applying these tools to industrial-size systems is the huge memory-usage for the exploration of the state-space of a network (or product) of timed automata. as the model-checkers must keep information on not only the control structure of the automata but also the clock values specified by clock constraints. In this paper. we present a compact data structure for representing clock constraints. The data structure is based on an O(n/sup 3/) algorithm which. given a constraint system over real-valued variables consisting of bounds on differences. constructs an equivalent system with a minimal number of constraints.

For late-binding to be effective in the case of composite services. a QoS-aware composition mechanism is needed. This means determining the set of services that. once composed. not only will perform the required functionality. but also will best contribute to achieve the level of QoS promised in service level agreements (SLAs). However. QoS-aware composition relies on estimated QoS values and workflow execution paths previously obtained using a monitoring mechanism. At run-time. the actual QoS values may deviate from the estimations. or the execution path may not be the one foreseen.

Thanks to their flexibility. they have been extended and modified in several ways in order to match the requirements of specific application areas. In particular. since Petri nets easily model control flow. some extensions have been proposed to deal with functional aspects while others have taken timing issues into account. Unfortunately. so far little has been done to integrate these aspects. that are crucial in the case of time-critical systems. In this paper. we introduce a high-level Petri net formalism (ER nets) which can be used to specify control. function. and timing issues. In particular. we discuss how time can be modeled via ER nets by providing a suitable axiomatization.

To build such models. one must rely on numerical estimates of various parameters provided by domain experts or extracted by other similar systems. Unfortunately. estimates are seldom correct. In addition. in dynamic environments. the value of parameters may change over time.

Studies of historic data from legacy software systems have identified three specific causes of this change: adding new features; correcting faults; and restructuring code to accommodate future changes.

Also. we expect that difficulty. size. and interval would vary strongly across different types of changes. To test these hypotheses we have designed a program which automatically classifies maintenance activity based on a textual description of changes.

This selection is performed by identifying. and then eliminating. the redundant and obsolete test cases in the test suite. The representative set replaces the original test suite and thus. potentially produces a smaller test suite. The representative set can also be used to identify those test cases that should be rerun to test the program after it has been changed. Our technique is independent of the testing methodology and only requires an association between a testing requirement and the test cases that satisfy the requirement. We illustrate the technique using the data flow testing methodology. The reduction that is possible with our technique is illustrated by experimental results.,True,6P4bGWAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,923,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/152388.152391,6869715091518218981,/scholar?cites=6869715091518218981,,,http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~soffa/Soffa_Pubs_all/Journals/Methodology.Harrold.1993.pdf,0,0,0
1276019,An approach to regression testing using slicing,1992,Rajiv Gupta and Mary Jean Harrold and Mary Lou Soffa,92,ICSM,,299-308,,After changes are made to a previously tested program. a goal of regression testing is to perform retesting based on the modifications while maintaining the same testing coverage as completely retesting the program. We present a novel approach to data flow based regression testing that uses slicing algorithms to explicitly detect definition-use associations that are affected by a program change. An important benefit of our slicing technique is that. unlike previous techniques. neither data flow history nor recomputation of data flow for the entire program is required to detect affected definition-use associations. The program changes drive the recomputation of the required partial data flow through slicing. Another advantage is that our technique achieves the same testing coverage with respect to the affected definition-use associations as a complete retest of the program without maintaining a test suite. Thus. the overhead of maintaining and updating a test suite is eliminated.,True,6P4bGWAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,343,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.25.6155&rep=rep1&type=pdf,10793683809640181675,/scholar?cites=10793683809640181675,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.25.6155&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1276020,Locating faults through automated predicate switching,2006,Xiangyu Zhang and Neelam Gupta and Rajiv Gupta,,,,272-281,ACM,Typically debugging begins when during a program execution a point is reached at which an obviously incorrect value is observed. A general and powerful approach to automated debugging can be based upon identifying modifications to the program state that will bring the execution to a successful conclusion. However. searching for arbitrary changes to the program state is difficult due to the extremely large search space. In this paper we demonstrate that by forcibly switching a predicate's outcome at runtime and altering the control flow. the program state can not only be inexpensively modified. but in addition it is often possible to bring the program execution to a successful completion (ie. program produces the desired output). By examining the switched predicate. also called the critical predicate. the cause of the bug can then be identified.

Because array-bounds checks may raise exceptions. they block code motion of instructions with side effects. thus preventing many useful code optimizations. such as partial redundancy elimination or instruction scheduling of memory operations.

In this paper we present the design and evaluation of three precise dynamic slicing algorithms called the full preprocessing (FP). no preprocessing (NP) and limited preprocessing (LP) algorithms. The algorithms differ in the relative timing of constructing the dynamic data dependence graph and its traversal for computing requested dynamic slices. Our experiments show that the LP algorithm is a fast and practical precise slicing algorithm.

In this paper. we present a new approach that integrates the potential of delta debugging algorithm with the benefit of forward and backward dynamic program slicing to narrow down the search for faulty code. Our approach is to use delta debugging algorithm to identify a minimal failure-inducing input. use this input to compute a forward dynamic slice and then intersect the statements in this forward dynamic slice with the statements in the backward dynamic slice of the erroneous output to compute a failure-inducing chop.

In these six programs ten distinct values occupy over 50% of all memory locations and on an average account for nearly 50% of all memory accesses during program execution. This observation holds for smaller blocks of consecutive memory locations and the set of frequent values remains quite stable over the execution of the program.In the six benchmarks with frequent value locality. on an average 50% of all cache misses occur during the reading or writing of the ten most frequently accessed values.

1276026,The fuzzy barrier: a mechanism for high speed synchronization of processors,1989,Rajiv Gupta,17,ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News,2,54-63,ACM,Parallel programs are commonly written using barriers to synchronize parallel processes. Upon reaching a barrier. a processor must stall until all participating processors reach the barrier. A software implementation of the barrier mechanism using shared variables has two major drawbacks. Firstly. the execution of the barrier may be slow as it may not only require execution of several instructions and but also result in hot-spot accesses. Secondly. processors that are stalled waiting for other processors to reach the barrier are essentially idling and cannot do any useful work. In this paper. the notion of the fuzzy barrier is presented. that avoids the above drawbacks. The first problem is avoided by implementing the mechanism in hardware. The second problem is solved by extending the barrier concept to include a region of statements that can be executed by a processor while it awaits synchronization.

The high compute power provided by SIMT architecture presents an opportunity for accelerating these algorithms using GPUs.

These cytotoxic pathways are dependent on induction of Fas expression by cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ or by signals generated after TCR engagement. Although much of our knowledge of the Fas death pathway has been generated from murine studies. little is known about regulatory mechanisms important for murine Fas expression. To this end. we have molecularly cloned a region of the murine Fas promoter that is responsible for mediating TNF-α and PMA/PHA-induced expression. We demonstrate here that induction of Fas expression by both stimuli is critically dependent on two sites that associate with RelA-containing NF-κB complexes.

Software projects were being delivered far behind schedule. quality was poor. and maintenance was expensive. And as more complex software applications were found. programmers fell further behind the demand and their results were of poorer quality. The high demand and comparatively low productivity drove software costs up. In the US in 1980. software cost approximately $40 billion. or two percent of the gross na-tional product. I Dolotta estimates that by the year 1985. the cost of software will be approximately 8.5 percent of the GNP. 2 while Steel points to 13 percent by 1990.3 And in recognition of the importance of software engineering. the Department of Defense began a software initiative and has plans for establishing a software engi-neering institute.

Nine independent inspection teams were given this URD with instructions to locate as many faults as possible using the N-fold requirements inspection technique developed by the authors.

Unfortunately. these systems provide only insufficient support for a detailed analysis of software evolution aspects. We address this problem and introduce an approach for populating a release history database that combines version data with bug tracking data and adds missing data not covered by version control systems such as merge points. Then simple queries can be applied to the structured data to obtain meaningful views showing the evolution of a software project. Such views enable more accurate reasoning of evolutionary aspects and facilitate the anticipation of software evolution.

However. this is rarely the case for new software projects and for many companies. So far. only a few have studies focused on transferring prediction models from one project to another. In this paper. we study cross-project defect prediction models on a large scale. For 12 real-world applications. we ran 622 cross-project predictions. Our results indicate that cross-project prediction is a serious challenge. ie. simply using models from projects in the same domain or with the same process does not lead to accurate predictions. To help software engineers choose models wisely. we identified factors that do influence the success of cross-project predictions.

We present change distilling. a tree differencing algorithm for fine-grained source code change extraction. For that. we have improved the existing algorithm by Chawathe et al. for extracting changes in hierarchically structured data. Our algorithm extracts changes by finding both a match between the nodes of the compared two abstract syntax trees and a minimum edit script that can transform one tree into the other given the computed matching. As a result. we can identify fine-grained change types between program versions according to our taxonomy of source code changes.

But dealing with large systems-those consisting of several millions of lines-at the code level faces many problems. An alternative approach is to concentrate on the system's building blocks such as programs or modules as the unit of examination. We present an approach that uses information in a release history of a system to uncover logical dependencies and change patterns among modules. We have developed the approach by working with 20 releases of a large Telecommunications Switching System.

We examine the relationship between different ownership measures and software failures in two large software projects: Windows Vista and Windows 7. We find that in all cases. measures of ownership such as the number of low-expertise developers. and the proportion of ownership for the top owner have a relationship with both pre-release faults and post-release failures.

Prior literature on distributed development in software engineering and other fields discuss various challenges. including cultural barriers. expertise transfer difficulties. and communication and coordination overhead.

Therefore. changes are not related to particular source code entities such as classes or methods but rather to text lines added and/or removed. For analyzing whether some change coupling between source code entities is significant or only minor textual adjustments have been checked in. it is essential to reflect the changes to the source code entities. We have developed an approach for analyzing and classifying change types based on code revisions.

Although this problem has been studied for several decades. there is a need for a more refined approach in those cases where the original sources maintain their own independent view of the world. In particular. we investigate those situations where there may not be a simple one-to-one mapping between the individuals in the domains of the various Information Sources.Since Description Logics have already served successfully in information integration and as ontology languages. we extend this formalism with the ability to handle complex mappings between domains. through the use of so-called “bridge rules”.

Such a mechanism facilitates the development and maintenance of more flexible software systems by supporting the abstraction of details concerning special or abnormal occurrences. The type constraints imposed by the schema as well as various semantic integrity assertions are considered to be normalcy conditions. and the key contribution of this work is to allow exceptions to these constraints to persist. To achieve this. solutions are proposed to a range of problems. including sharing and computing with exceptional information. exception handling by users. the logic of constraints with exceptions. and implementation issues. The use of exception handling in dealing with null values. estimates. and measurement is also illustrated.,True,S5AaMfgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,321,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/4879.4995,16524586547505694329,/scholar?cites=16524586547505694329,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.45.4980&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Using ideas from natural evolution. GP starts from an ooze of random computer programs. and progressively refines them through processes of mutation and sexual recombination. until high-fitness solutions emerge. All this without the user having to know or specify the form or structure of solutions in advance. GP has generated a plethora of human-competitive results and applications. including novel scientific discoveries and patentable inventions.

The second volume of Advances in Genetic Programming highlights many of the most recent technical advances in this increasingly popular field. The twenty-three contributions are divided into four parts: Variations on the Genetic Programming Theme; Hierarchical. Recursive. and Pruning Genetic Programs; Analysis and Implementation Issues; and New Environments for Genetic Programming. The first part extends the core concepts of genetic programming through the addition of new evolutionary techniques--adaptive and self-adaptive crossover methods. hill climbing operators. and the inclusion of introns into the representation. Creating more concise executable structures is a long-term research topic in genetic programming. The second part describes the field's most recent efforts. including the dynamic manipulation of automatically defined functions. evolving logic programs that generate recursive structures. and using minimum description length heuristics to determine when and how to prune evolving structures. The third part takes up the many implementation and analysis issues associated with evolving programs.

1276087,Genetic programming and data structures: genetic programming+ data structures= automatic programming!,2012,William B Langdon,1,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Computers thatprogram themselves' has long been an aim of computer scientists. Recently genetic programming (GP) has started to show its promise by automatically evolving programs. Indeed in a small number of problems GP has evolved programs whose performance is similar to or even slightly better than that of programs written by people. The main thrust of GP has been to automatically create functions. While these can be of great use they contain no memory and relatively little work has addressed automatic creation of program code including stored data. This issue is the main focus of Genetic Programming. and Data Structures: Genetic Programming+ Data Structures= Automatic Programming!. This book is motivated by the observation from software engineering that data abstraction (eg. via abstract data types) is essential in programs created by human programmers. This book shows that abstract data types can be similarly beneficial to the automatic production of programs using GP. Genetic Programming and Data Structures: Genetic Programming+ Data Structures= Automatic Programming! shows how abstract data types (stacks. queues and lists) can be evolved using genetic programming. demonstrates how GP can evolve general programs which solve the nested brackets problem. recognises a Dyck context free language. and implements a simple four function calculator. In these cases. an appropriate data structure is beneficial compared to simple indexed memory.

We call this operator one-point crossover because of its similarity with the corresponding operator in genetic algorithms. One-point crossover presents very interesting properties from the theory point of view. In this paper we describe this form of crossover as well as a new variant called strict one-point crossover highlighting their useful theoretical and practical features.

1276089,Fitness Causes Bloat,1997,WB Langdon and R Poli,,,,13-22,Springer-Verlag,The problem of evolving an artificial ant to follow the Santa Fe trail is used to study the well known genetic programming feature of growth in solution length. Known variously as “bloat”. “fluff” and increasing “structural complexity”. this is often described in terms of increasing “redundancy” in the code caused by “introns”.Comparison between runs with and without fitness selection pressure. backed by Price’s Theorem. shows the tendency for solutions to grow in size is caused by fitness based selection. We argue that such growth is inherent in using a fixed evaluation function with a discrete but variable length representation. With simple static evaluation search converges to mainly finding trial solutions with the same fitness as existing trial solutions. In general variable length allows many more long representations of a given solution than short ones.

In a variety of experiments and static analysis we test the standard protective code explanation and find it to be incomplete. We suggest bloat is primarily due to distribution of fitness in the space of possible programs and because of this. in the absence of bias. it is in general inherent in any search technique using a variable length representation. We investigate the fitness landscape produced by program tree-based genetic operators when acting upon points in the search space. We show bloat in common operators is primarily due to the exponential shape of the underlying search space. Nevertheless we demonstrate new operators with considerably reduced bloating characteristics. We also describe mechanisms whereby bloat arises and relate these back to the shape of the search space.

Analysis of shorter solutions shows they have many of the characteristics often ascribed to manually coded programs. Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search space and random sampling characterise it as rugged with many multiple plateaus split by deep valleys and many local and global optima. This suggests it is di cult for hill climbing algorithms. Analysis of the program search space in terms of xed length schema suggests it is highly deceptive and that for the simplest solutions large building blocks must be assembled before they have above average tness. In some cases we show solutions cannot be assembled using a xed representation from small building blocks of above average tness.

For each technical term. it uses a fuzzy set to represent the developers who are capable/competent of fixing the bugs relevant to the corresponding aspect. The fixing correlation of a developer toward a technical term is represented by his/her membership score toward the corresponding fuzzy set. The score is calculated based on the bug reports that (s) he has fixed. and is updated as the newly fixed bug reports are available. For a new bug report. Bugzie combines the fuzzy sets corresponding to its …,True,l4QhOVoAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC,173,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2025113.2025163,3296166142994418692,/scholar?cites=3296166142994418692,,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3217&context=etd,0,0,0

Previous research has reported that as in traditional code-based development. cloning also occurs in MDE. However. there has been little work on clone detection in models with the limitations on detection precision and completeness. This paper presents ModelCD. a novel clone detection tool for Matlab/Simulink models. that is able to efficiently and accurately detect both exactly matched and approximate model clones. The core of ModelCD is two novel graph-based clone detection algorithms that are able to systematically and incrementally discover clones with a high degree of completeness. accuracy. and scalability.

Analyzing such fixes manually. we found that a large percentage of them occurs in code peers. the classes/methods having the similar roles in the systems. such as providing similar functions and/or participating in similar object interactions. Based on graph-based representation of object usages. we have developed several techniques to identify code peers. recognize recurring bug fixes. and recommend changes for code units from the bug fixes of their peers. The empirical evaluation on several open-source projects shows that our prototype.

1276104,Graph-based statistical language model for code,2015,Anh Tuan Nguyen and Tien N Nguyen,1,,,858-868,IEEE,n-gram statistical language model has been successfully applied to capture programming patterns to support code completion and suggestion. However. the approaches using n-gram face challenges in capturing the patterns at higher levels of abstraction due to the mismatch between the sequence nature in n-grams and the structure nature of syntax and semantics in source code. This paper presents GraLan. a graph-based statistical language model and its application in code suggestion. GraLan can learn from a source code corpus and compute the appearance probabilities of any graphs given the observed (sub)graphs. We use GraLan to develop an API suggestion engine and an AST-based language model. ASTLan.

1276105,Combining deep learning with information retrieval to localize buggy files for bug reports (n),2015,An Ngoc Lam and Anh Tuan Nguyen and Hoan Anh Nguyen and Tien N Nguyen,,,,476-481,IEEE,Bug localization refers to the automated process of locating the potential buggy files for a given bug report. To help developers focus their attention to those files is crucial. Several existing automated approaches for bug localization from a bug report face a key challenge. called lexical mismatch. in which the terms used in bug reports to describe a bug are different from the terms and code tokens used in source files. This paper presents a novel approach that uses deep neural network (DNN) in combination with rVSM. an information retrieval (IR) technique. rVSM collects the feature on the textual similarity between bug reports and source files. DNN is used to learn to relate the terms in bug reports to potentially different code tokens and terms in source files and documentation if they appear frequently enough in the pairs of reports and buggy files.

By examining a class/family of related systems and the commonality underlying those systems. it is possible to obtain a set of reference models. i.e.. software architectures and components needed for implementing applications in the class. FORM (Feature-;Oriented Reuse Method) supports development of such reusable architectures and components (through a process called the “domain engineering”) and development of applications using the domain artifacts produced from the domain engineering. FORM starts with an analysis of commonality among applications in a particular domain in terms of services. operating environments. domain technologies. and implementation techniques.

1276110,Concepts and guidelines of feature modeling for product line software engineering,2002,Kwanwoo Lee and Kyo C Kang and Jaejoon Lee,,,,62-77,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Product line software engineering (PLSE) is an emerging software engineering paradigm. which guides organizations toward the development of products from core assets rather than the development of products one by one from scratch. In order to develop highly reusable core assets. PLSE must have the ability to exploit commonality and manage variability among products from a domain perspective. Feature modeling is one of the most popular domain analysis techniques. which analyzes commonality and variability in a domain to develop highly reusable core assets for a product line. Various attempts have been made to extend and apply it to the development of software product lines. However. feature modeling can be difficult and time-consuming without a precise understanding of the goals of feature modeling and the aid of practical guidelines.

1276111,Issues in requirements elicitation,1992,Michael G Christel and Kyo C Kang,,,,,Carnegie-Mellon Univ Pittsburgh Pa Software Engineering Inst,There are many problems associated with requirements engineering. including problems in defining the system scope. problems in fostering understanding among the different communities affected by the development of a given system. and problems in dealing with the volatile nature of requirements. These problems may lead to poor requirements and the cancellation of system development. or else the development of a system that is later judged unsatisfactory or unacceptable. has high maintenance costs. or undergoes frequent changes. By improving requirements elicitation. the requirements engineering process can be improved. resulting in enhanced system requirements and potentially a much better system. Requirements engineering can be decomposed into the activ-ities of requirements elicitation. specification. and validation. Most of the requirements techniques and tools today focus on specification. ie. the representation of the requirements. This report concentrates instead on elicitation concerns. those problems with requirements engineering that are not adequately addressed by specification techniques. An elicitation methodology is proposed to handle these concerns. This new elicitation methodology strives to incorporate the advantages of existing elicitation techniques while comprehensively addressing the activities performed during requirements elicitation. These activities include fact-finding. requirements gathering. evaluation and rationalization. prioritization. and integration. Taken by themselves. existing elicitation techniques are lacking in one or more of these areas.Descriptors:,True,MEOtZokAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,501,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA258932,9499488604597142988,/scholar?cites=9499488604597142988,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA258932.pdf,0,0,0

1276114,A propositional logic-based method for verification of feature models,2004,Wei Zhang and Haiyan Zhao and Hong Mei,,,,115-130,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,The feature model is a domain/product-line oriented requirements model based on hierarchical structure and explicit variability modeling. and has been adopted by several important software reuse methods. However. with respect to the problem of verification of constraints on features and verification of partially customized feature models. these methods tend to be semi-formal and offer little formal assistance. In this paper. we propose a propositional logic-based method for the verification of feature models at different binding times. The most important characteristic of this method is that it integrates the logical verification with binding times. which makes it can be used to verify any partially customized feature models at any binding time (except run-time). In this method. constraints on features are formalized by logical sentences. Thus. the verification of feature models is converted into satisfaction problems in …,True,MEOtZokAAAAJ:_5tno0g5mFcC,185,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30482-1_16,10088943440247256915,/scholar?cites=10088943440247256915,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei_Zhang111/publication/220744172_A_Propositional_Logic-Based_Method_for_Verification_of_Feature_Models/links/54363dfa0cf2dc341db2e44e/A-Propositional-Logic-Based-Method-for-Verification-of-Feature-Models.pdf,0,0,0
