1144756,The reactivity of slow electrons with molecules at different degrees of aggregation: gas phase. clusters and condensed phase,1996,Oddur Ingólfsson and Fritz Weik and Eugen Illenberger,155,,1-2,1-68,Elsevier,The interaction of free electrons in the energy range between 0 and 15 eV with molecules is reviewed. The studies include beam experiments with gas phase molecules under collision-free conditions and at higher pressures. homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters generated in supersonic beams. and molecules adsorbed and condensed on a cold metallic surface. In single molecules under collision-free conditions the usual relaxation process of a transient negative ion formed by free electron attachment is unimolecular decomposition into stable anionic and neutral fragments (dissociative attachment) with cross-sections exceeding 10−14 cm2. A remarkable exception is C60 which forms metastable anions C60− up to 14 eV electron energy. In clusters. intramolecular stabilization processes lead to the formation of stabilized molecular anions. In addition. intramolecular electron transfer processes can strongly …,True,UBcZzFAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,166,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168117696043923,17924605193366004516,/scholar?cites=17924605193366004516,,,0,0,0
1144757,From isolated molecules through clusters and condensates to the building blocks of life,2008,Ilko Bald and Judith Langer and Petra Tegeder and Oddur Ingólfsson,277,,1-3,4-25,Elsevier,Electron attachment processes in isolated molecules in the gas phase. in clusters and in molecules condensed on surfaces are reviewed. and a special section is dedicated to electron attachment to biologically relevant molecules. For isolated molecules in the gas phase the emphasis is on the comparison between direct dissociation from strongly repulsive σ* states and the more indirect predissociation processes associated with the initial occupation of a π* MO. These processes are discussed with regard to the temperature dependence of the dissociative electron attachment processes and with regard to its high bond selectivity. Specific examples of high bond and site selectivity at particular electron incident energies are discussed in terms of thermo-chemically controlled and state controlled selectivity of the dissociative electron attachment process.

1144758,The role of low-energy electrons in focused electron beam induced deposition: four case studies of representative precursors,2015,Rachel M Thorman and Ragesh Kumar TP and D Howard Fairbrother and Oddur Ingólfsson,6,,1,1904-1926,Beilstein-Institut,Focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) is a single-step. direct-write nanofabrication technique capable of writing three-dimensional metal-containing nanoscale structures on surfaces using electron-induced reactions of organometallic precursors. Currently FEBID is. however. limited in resolution due to deposition outside the area of the primary electron beam and in metal purity due to incomplete precursor decomposition. Both limitations are likely in part caused by reactions of precursor molecules with low-energy (< 100 eV) secondary electrons generated by interactions of the primary beam with the substrate. These low-energy electrons are abundant both inside and outside the area of the primary electron beam and are associated with reactions causing incomplete ligand dissociation from FEBID precursors. As it is not possible to directly study the effects of secondary electrons in situ in FEBID. other means must be used to elucidate their role. In this context. gas phase studies can obtain well-resolved information on low-energy electron-induced reactions with FEBID precursors by studying isolated molecules interacting with single electrons of well-defined energy. In contrast. ultra-high vacuum surface studies on adsorbed precursor molecules can provide information on surface speciation and identify species desorbing from a substrate during electron irradiation under conditions more representative of FEBID. Comparing gas phase and surface science studies allows for insight into the primary deposition mechanisms for individual precursors; ideally. this information can be used to design future FEBID precursors and optimize …,True,UBcZzFAAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,95,https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjnano/content/pdf/2190-4286-6-194.pdf,14776716811379291771,/scholar?cites=14776716811379291771,,https://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjnano/content/pdf/2190-4286-6-194.pdf,0,0,0

Additionally. ab initio calculations of the structures and energies of the anions and neutral fragments have been carried out at G2MP2 and B3LYP levels. Valine and the previously studied aliphatic amino acids glycine and alanine exhibit several common features due to the fact that at low electron energies the formation of the precursor ion can be characterized by occupation of the π* orbital of the carboxyl group. The dominant negative ion (M–H)− (m∕Z=116) is observed at electron energies of 1.12eV. This ion is the dominant reaction product at electron energies below 5eV.

Here we compare the collision cross sections (Ω) of a wide range of different proteins and protein complexes (15–500 kDa) with their corresponding Stokes radii (RS). Using these methods. we find that Ω and RS are well correlated. implying overall preservation of protein structure in the gas phase. Accounting for protein hydration. a scaling term is required to bring Ω and RS into parity. Interestingly. the magnitude of this scaling term agrees almost entirely with the drag factor proposed by Millikan. RS were then compared with various different predicted values of Ω taken from their atomic coordinates.

It was recently established that electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is capable of capturing transient interactions between membrane proteins and their lipid environment. and a detailed understanding of the underlying processes is therefore of high importance. Here. we apply ESI-MS to investigate the factors that govern complex formation in solution and gas phases by comparing nonselective lipid binding with soluble and membrane proteins.

Native mass spectrometry yields spectra of the many states and interactions in the structural ensemble. but its spatial resolution is limited. Conversely. molecular dynamics simulations are innately high-resolution. but have a limited capacity for exploring all structural possibilities. The two techniques hence differ fundamentally in the information they provide. returning data that reflect different length scales and time scales. making them natural bedfellows.

One of the largest difficulties in realizing this goal is the unknown orientation of the individual sample molecules at the time of exposure. Preorientation of the molecules has been identified as a possible solution to this problem. Using molecular dynamics simulations. we identify a range of electric field strengths where proteins become oriented without losing their structure. For a number of experimentally relevant cases we show that structure determination is possible only when orientation information is included in the orientation-recovery process.

Analyses were performed on both a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-tof) and a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. MSn analysis shows that depending on sample preparation the ion at m/z 671 consists of two different ions with the same accurate-mass. It is either the monensin protonated parent ion or a different ion structure derived from the loss of water from the water adduct of monensin. Both ions show different fragmentation patterns. Major fragment ions from the protonated parent ion were produced by Grob-Wharton type fragmentations in addition to various simple neutral losses.

Inc.,Our ability to statistically analyze data has grown significantly with the maturing of computer hardware and software. However. the evolution of our statistics capabilities has taken place without a corresponding evolution in the curriculum for the undergraduate chemistry major. Most faculty understands the need for a statistical educational component. but there is little consensus as to the exact nature of what is to be taught and who should teach it. Because of the large number of courses required for the undergraduate chemistry major. it seems unlikely that requiring a course on statistics will be practical at most institutions. Additionally. it is unlikely that the typical high school education will address the needed statistics or the software training to prepare students for the chemistry courses. Therefore. the chemistry faculty must teach the statistics needed by the majors.

In H. pylori. α-glucosyl cholesterol constitutes more than 25% of cell wall lipids. and it has been suggested that α-glucosyl cholesterol is essential for H. pylori viability. Here. we identified cholesterol α-glucosyltransferase (CHLαGcT) using an expression cloning strategy and showed that this enzyme is distinctively inhibited by mucin-type O-glycans similar to those present in deeper portions of the gastric mucosa. Moreover. inactivation of CHLαGcT by homologous recombination led to H. pylori lethality. These results indicate that H. pylori CHLαGcT is a unique enzyme targeted by a natural antibiotic mucin and constitutes an excellent therapeutic target to prevent H. pylori-induced peptic ulcer. gastric carcinoma. and MALT lymphoma.,True,1j_thIYAAAAJ:rTD5ala9j4wC,49,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X06019760,16568563540845367202,/scholar?cites=16568563540845367202,,,0,0,0

1144993,Colorimetric determination of capsaicin in Capsicum fruits,1980,Krishan L Bajaj,63,Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,6,1314-1316,Oxford University Press,A simple and accurate colorimetric method has been developed for quantitative determination of capsaicin in capsicum fruits. The method does not involve prior isolation of capsaicin from green capsicum fruits. and interference due to pigments is accounted for by determining a blank. Interfering substances are removed from red capsicum fruits by column chromatography using basic alumina as adsorbent. Capsaicin from the ethyl acetate extract of dried fruits is determined by developing a yellow complex with sodium nitrite–sodium molybdate reagent. which is read at 430 nm. Lambert-Beer’s law is obeyed in the concentration range 1.5–33.5 μg capsaicin/mL.

The bimolecular rate constants of quenching of 2-naphthylamine fluorescence by pyridine and 4-cyanopyridine have been determined in various solvents. The bimolecular reaction rate of fluorescence quenching by pyridine is smaller than the diffusion controlled one in many cases and depends considerably upon the dipole moment and the ability of formation of hydrogen bonding chain of solvent.

This review examines the latest reports. including homogeneous and heterogeneous applications. The pivotal step for the cycloaddition reactions is the ring opening of the epoxide following activation by the Lewis acid. Two modes of cleavage (CC versus CO) have been identified depending primarily on the substitution pattern of the epoxide. with lesser influence observed from the Lewis acid employed. The widely studied cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides to afford cyclic carbonates (CO bond cleavage) has been scrutinized in terms of catalytic efficiency and reaction mechanism. showing that unsophisticated complexes of group III–V transition metals are excellent molecular catalysts.

An attractive way to use CO2 in the synthesis of polymers is by the formation of five‐membered cyclic organic carbonate monomers (5CCs). The sustainability of this synthetic approach is increased by using scaffolds prepared from renewable resources. Indeed. recent years have seen the rise of various types of carbonate syntheses and applications. 5CC monomers are often polymerized with diamines to yield polyhydroxyurethanes (PHU).

Hydrodynamic voltammetry showed that the H2 oxidation reaction (HOR) became hindered at positive potentials (>1.0 V).

SnO2 films deposited using this technology contain porous agglomerated structures consisting of nano-size crystallites. Even after annealing at Tan=800 °C. the average size of crystallites does not exceed 6–7 nm. The average size of agglomerates depends on film thickness. and ranges from 20 to 80 nm. These SnO2 films have good gas response especially to ozone and H2. However. the rate of response to these gases is different. The response to ozone is fast. while the response to exposure to reducing gas. such as H2. is slow.

This article focuses on the recent developments in various methods for immobilization of gold nanoparticles on solid surface. Particular attention is given to the synthesis of nanoparticles by Layer-by-Layer method and on the advances in the Successive Ionic Layer Deposition (SILD) methodology. The present review summarizes SILD work in this field to date and contributes a new experimental date for application SILD method in field of electrochemical sensor design. As an example the conditions of synthesis of gold nanoparticles on the surface of indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode are described in this article. It has been shown that the size of synthesized nanostructures can be controlled by formation of intermediated layer. It was found that preliminary SILD synthesis of AuxSnO2.nH2O nanolayer on the ITO surface leads to significant changes in the morphology of subsequently synthesized gold nanoparticles. In this case the same number of cycles provides the formation of significantly smaller (10-20 nm) nanoparticles and greater surface coverage density.

In nature. perhaps the best example of an authentic sustainable system is oxygenic photosynthesis. The biochemistry of this intricate process is empowered by solar radiation influx and performed by hierarchically organized complexes composed by photoreceptors. inorganic catalysts. and enzymes which define specific niches for optimizing light-to-energy conversion. The success of this process relies on its capability to exploit the almost inexhaustible reservoirs of sunlight. water. and carbon dioxide to transform photonic energy into chemical energy such as stored in adenosine triphosphate. Oxygenic photosynthesis is responsible for most of the oxygen. fossil fuels. and biomass on our planet. So. even after a few billion years of evolution. this process unceasingly supports life on earth. and probably soon also in outer-space. and inspires the development of enabling technologies for a sustainable global economy and ecosystem.

The methodologies for peptide synthesis via solution and solid-phase as well as macrocyclization strategies for cyclic peptides. Cyclic peptides' biological activity and the challenges for peptide drug development. Chapter 2. This chapter emphasizes on the design. synthesis and Structural Activity Relationship (SAR) of San A derivatives. Six novel San A derivatives were designed based on the structural features of developed potent San A derivatives. The structural modifications of novel San A derivatives included : 1) D-amino acid incorporation. 2) insertion of N-Me-amino acid. and 3) Aliphatic size chain reduction. The cytotoxicity of synthesized San A derivatives were exanimated against pancreatic cancer cell line PL-45 using 3H-Thymidine incorporation assay. The biological results and SAR studies of six novel San A derivatives were discussed in this chapter. Chapter 3. Histone deacetylase (HDACs) are a class of enyzmes that are responsible for regulating the acetylation state of the histones. In many cancers. overexpression of HDACs is observed resulting hypoacetylation state of histones and improper gene transcriptions. which leads to tumor progression. Thus. the development of novel HDIs is critical for combating cancers. Chapter 3 focuses on the design and synthesis of novel Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDIs) based on two cyclic tetrapeptide natural products: FR235222 and trapoxin B. The biological test results of developed novel HDIs and the discussion of structure-activity relationship are also presented. Chapter 4.

Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins. or adhesins. To date. adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a ‘chemical harpoon’. This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria. including many clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions.

While increasing diversity is beneficial to the drug discovery process and the fight against disease. the unknown modes of action of new lead compounds can hamper drug discovery as. in most cases. the process of lead compound optimization is made difficult due to the unknown nature of the target; blindly changing substituents can prove fruitless due to the inexhaustible number of potential combinations. and it is therefore desirable to rapidly identify the targets of lead compounds developed through phenotypic screening.

C-glycosides can be good drug candidates for inhibitors of carbohydrate processing enzymes. Moreover. C-aryl glycosides have been revealed to be of particular biological importance. with some of them occurring naturally.[1. 2] Although numerous methods exist to prepare C-glycosides.[1–4] the development of convergent and catalytic methods is of the utmost importance.

From the analysis of the phosphorous spectra. it can be concluded that the applied heat treatment removes the organic ligands. Washing and calcination leads to partial oxidation and partial agglomeration of the clusters. Oxidation of the clusters is most likely due to the interaction of the cluster core with the oxygen of the titania surface after removal of ligands. The position of the Au 4f7/2 peak indicates that the size of the agglomerated clusters is still smaller than that of Au101.,True,390hw6oAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,95,https://pubs.rsc.org/--/content/articlehtml/2013/cp/c3cp44005b,7679652484336254120,/scholar?cites=7679652484336254120,,https://pubs.rsc.org/--/content/articlehtml/2013/cp/c3cp44005b,0,0,0

The X2Σ+ ground state of CoC is an unusually good example of Hund’s case (bβS) coupling. Since Co has a nuclear spin I=7/2. each rotational level is split by the Fermi contact interaction into G=3 and G=4 components. where G=I+S; the splitting for N=0 is more than 0.5 cm−1. The X2Σ+ state begins to uncouple toward case (bβJ) with increasing rotation. Transitions to various 2Π excited states occur in the region 13 000–14 500 cm−1; the most prominent of these (for which high resolution spectra have been recorded) lie at 13 079 cm−1 (2Π3/2) and 13 343 cm−1 (2Π1/2). The (bβS) coupling in the ground state produces some unexpected hyperfine intensity patterns. which have been studied in detail.

Two series of samples were produced in the presence (modified samples: PTX) and in the absence of Triton X-100 (unmodified samples: PT) at bath temperatures ranging from 25–100 °C. Higher current efficiencies. mechanical strength and more adhesion to Ti substrates were found for modified samples.

Based on the laboratory evaluations. three modified binders were selected for road tests conducted in cooperation with the Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation. Two 3.000-ft (914.4-m) sections were placed in the outside eastbound lane of US 290 near Waller. Texas. about 35 mi (65 km) from Houston. The section was selected because of a previous history of rutting under heavy truck traffic. The paving was performed in two operations. a 2-in.(5-cm) level-up course in April. 1988 followed by a 1.5-in.(3.8-cm) surface course in October. Another section of 3.300 ft (1006 m) of the most heavily trafficked lane of US 90A in Houston. including two intersections was paved in May and August. 1989. All of the asphalts were blended at the Exxon Company USA Baytown Refinery asphalt terminal and were transported to the job site hot mix plants. Transportation. mixing. placement. and compaction were all conducted with the same standard procedures as used for AC-20 asphalt. The Exxon pavement mechanics computer model.

In this case. the microemulsion particle behaves thermodynamically in a manner similar to a macromolecule so that one can predict that the polymer—microemulsion phase diagram will have qualitative similarities to that exhibited by the polymer—polymer2-solvent case.

The lubricants under consideration have been found to owe their consistency to the presence of the soap in the shape of very thin fibres which are long enough to form a firm tangle or irregular latticework. in the interstices of which the oil is immobilized by capillary forces. The mechanical behavior of the grease could largely be associated with the geometry. ie. the lengthldiameter ratio and the absolute dimension of the soap fibre; the shear stability of a grease could thus be connected with the ability of the soap fibres to withstand continued shear stress and to shred into fragments of sufficient length1 diameter ratio to maintain a finite consistency. The flocculation*** and cementing of the soap fibres at the contact points provide an additional source of strength for the fibre …,True,PK7R5EwAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,7,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/WPC-4628,727799692621690201,/scholar?cites=727799692621690201,,,0,0,0
1145632,The mechanism of boundary lubrication,1940,OW BeeK and I Givens and AE Smith,,Rev Proc. Roy Soc,,9,,If two metal surfaces slide over each other in the presence of a lubricant and under high load. high pressures and temperatures prevail at those isolated spots which actually carry the load. leading to wear and possibly to breakdown. The action of wear preventing agents under these conditions has been studied in detail and it has been found that such agents are effective through their chemical polishing action. by which the load becomes distributed over a larger surface and local pressures and temperatures are decreased. Especially effective are compounds containing phosphorus or other elements of group V of the periodic system. These have been found to form a metal phosphide or homolog on the surface which is able to alloy with the metal surface. lowering its melting point markedly. and by this action aiding greatly in maintaining a polish. The wear experiments were carried out with a highly sensitive and accurate method which uses metal-plated steel balls as its sliding elements. Under the experimental conditions additions of 1.5% triphenyl phosphine or triphenyl arsine in white oil gave wear prevention factors of 7.2 and 12.2 respectively (relative to pure white oil). A further addition of 1% of a long chain polar compound is able to double the wear prevention factor obtained with the polishing agents and wear prevention factors as high as 17.6 have been observed. The specifically physical action of the long-chain polar compounds is discussed in the preceding paper.,True,PK7R5EwAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,7,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1200664284735096962&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1200664284735096962,/scholar?cites=1200664284735096962,,,0,0,0

Coexistence of carrier injection barriers and ion migration in the perovskite films defines the degree of synaptic plasticity. more notable for the larger organic ammonium and formamidinium cations than the inorganic cesium counterpart.

Selective injection of holes through electrochemical anodic bias has allowed us to probe the effect of hole trapping at iodide (0.9 V) and bromide (1.15 V) in mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbBr1.5I1.5) films. Upon trapping holes at the iodide site. the iodide gradually gets expelled from the mixed halide film (as iodine and/or triiodide ion). leaving behind re-formed CH3NH3PbBr3 domains. The weakening of the Pb–I bond following the hole trapping (oxidation of the iodide site) and its expulsion from the lattice in the form of iodine provided further insight into the photoinduced segregation of halide ions in mixed halide perovskite films.

Most of this biomass derives from animals that are associated with bacterial symbionts. which are able to metabolize the chemical resources provided by the seeping fluids. Often these systems also harbor dense accumulations of non-symbiotic megafauna. which can be relevant in exporting chemosynthetically fixed carbon from seeps to the surrounding deep sea. Here we investigated the carbon sources of lithodid crabs (Paralomis sp.) feeding on thiotrophic bacterial mats at an active mud volcano at the Costa Rica subduction zone. To evaluate the dietary carbon source of the crabs. we compared the microbial community in stomach contents with surface sediments covered by microbial mats. The stomach content analyses revealed a dominance of epsilonproteobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences related to the free-living and epibiotic sulfur oxidiser Sulfurovum sp. We also found Sulfurovum sp. as well as members of the genera Arcobacter and Sulfurimonas in mat-covered surface sediments where Epsilonproteobacteria were highly abundant constituting 10% of total cells. Furthermore. we detected substantial amounts of bacterial fatty acids such as i-C15∶0 and C17∶1ω6c with stable carbon isotope compositions as low as −53‰ in the stomach and muscle tissue. These results indicate that the white microbial mats at Mound 12 are comprised of Epsilonproteobacteria and that microbial mat-derived carbon provides an important contribution to the crab's nutrition.

Rio Tinto is considered a good geochemical terrestrial analogue of Mars [2. 3]. A dedicated geophysical characterization of the area selected two drilling sites (4) due to the possible existence of water with high ionic content (low resistivity). Two wells have been drilled in the selected area. BH11 and BH10. of depths of 340 and 620 meters respectively. with recovery of cores and generation of samples in anaerobic and sterile conditions. Preliminary results showed an important alteration of mineral structures associated with the presence of water. with production of expected products from the bacterial oxidation of pyrite (sulfates and ferric iron). Ion chromatography of water soluble compounds from uncontaminated samples showed the existence of putative electron donors (ferrous iron. nitrite in addition of the metal sulfides). electron acceptors (sulfate. nitrate. ferric iron) as well as variable concentration of metabolic organic acids (mainly acetate. formate. propionate and oxalate). which are strong signals of the presence of active subsurface ecosystem associated to the high sulfidic mineral content of the IPB.

1145758,Function and diversity of marine and hypersaline mat forming microbial communities,2007,Enoma Osasuyi Omoregie,,,,,,Archaeal and bacterial communities exert a huge influence over biogeochemical processes on Earth. Microbial mats are the earliest known forms of biological communities. and can offer significant insight into the functioning of past and present element cycling and microbial population interaction. To gain a better understanding of the diversity of microbial processes in marine and hypersaline mats and sediments. the activities and diversity of microbes in several types of ecosystems were examined:(1) Chloroflexus-like bacteria from a hypersaline cyanobacterial mat.(2-3) Methane-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing sediment communities from cold seeps in the Gulf of Cadiz and the Eastern Mediterranean.(4) Sulfide-and ironoxidizing mats from cold seeps in the Eastern Mediterranean. Non-mat-forming sediment communities were included in this work. because they often support mat communities and share similar processes and organisms. especially with regard to anaerobic oxidation of methane. The major themes addressed within this dissertation:(a) Which microbial populations are responsible for the dominant biogeochemical processes in the investigated habitat?(b) How abundant are these key microbes within the microbial community and which other microorganisms are associated with them?(c) How active are the microbes within these communities. and what are their main environmental signatures?1.

This drug has caused rare and idiosyncratic but severe hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms associated with and factors responsible for this toxicity remain unknown. One of the nimesulide metabolites identified in human urine is 4-amino-2-phenoxy-methanesulfonanilide (M1). In the current study. we demonstrate that M1 is a stable metabolite that is highly susceptible to facile oxidation by cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) to form a reactive diiminoquinone intermediate (M2). Direct detection of M2 was difficult by LC-MS. However. its formation was confirmed indirectly by identification of N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) adducts of M2.

As an alternative. hydrogen is widely regarded as a key element for a potential energy solution. However. different from fossil fuels such as oil. gas. and coal. the production of hydrogen requires energy. Alternative and intermittent renewable sources such as solar power. wind power. etc.. present multiple advantages for the production of hydrogen. On one hand. the renewable sources contribute to a remarkable reduction of pollutants released to the air. On the other hand. they significantly enhance the sustainability of energy supply. In addition. the storage of energy in form of hydrogen has a huge potential to balance an effective and synergetic utilization of the renewable energy sources. In this regard. hydrogen storage technology presents a key roadblock towards the practical application of hydrogen as “energy carrier”. Among the methods available to store hydrogen. solid-state storage is the most attractive alternative both from the safety and the volumetric energy density points of view. Because of their appealing hydrogen content. complex hydrides and complex hydride-based systems have attracted considerable attention as potential energy vectors for mobile and stationary applications.

1145830,The etiology of cleft palate formation in BMP7-deficient mice,2013,Thaleia Kouskoura and Anastasiia Kozlova and Maria Alexiou and Susanne Blumer and Vasiliki Zouvelou and Christos Katsaros and Matthias Chiquet and Thimios A Mitsiadis and Daniel Graf,8,PloS one,3,e59463,Public Library of Science,Palatogenesis is a complex process implying growth. elevation and fusion of the two lateral palatal shelves during embryogenesis. This process is tightly controlled by genetic and mechanistic cues that also coordinate the growth of other orofacial structures. Failure at any of these steps can result in cleft palate. which is a frequent craniofacial malformation in humans. To understand the etiology of cleft palate linked to the BMP signaling pathway. we studied palatogenesis in Bmp7-deficient mouse embryos. Bmp7 expression was found in several orofacial structures including the edges of the palatal shelves prior and during their fusion. Bmp7 deletion resulted in a general alteration of oral cavity morphology. unpaired palatal shelf elevation. delayed shelf approximation. and subsequent lack of fusion. Cell proliferation and expression of specific genes involved in palatogenesis were not altered in Bmp7-deficient embryos. Conditional ablation of Bmp7 with Keratin14-Cre or Wnt1-Cre revealed that neither epithelial nor neural crest-specific loss of Bmp7 alone could recapitulate the cleft palate phenotype. Palatal shelves from mutant embryos were able to fuse when cultured in vitro as isolated shelves in proximity. but not when cultured as whole upper jaw explants. Thus. deformations in the oral cavity of Bmp7-deficient embryos such as the shorter and wider mandible were not solely responsible for cleft palate formation. These findings indicate a requirement for Bmp7 for the coordination of both developmental and mechanistic aspects of palatogenesis.,True,5hPtkMMAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,26,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059463,6919484516515482929,/scholar?cites=6919484516515482929,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059463,0,0,0

Yet. the specific role of TAK1 in the myeloid compartment during inflammatory challenges has not been revealed. To address this question. we generated myeloid-specific kinase-dead TAK1 mutant mice. TAK1 deficiency in macrophages results in impaired NF-κB and JNK activation upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover. TAK1-deficient macrophages and neutrophils show an enhanced inflammatory cytokine profile in response to LPS stimulation. Myeloid-specific TAK1 deficiency in mice leads to increased levels of circulating IL-1β. TNF and reduced IL-10 after LPS challenge and sensitizes them to LPS-induced endotoxemia.

1145851,Chromate leaching from inhibited primers: Part II: Modelling of leaching,2006,SA Furman and FH Scholes and AE Hughes and Deborah Lau,56,,1,33-38,Elsevier,Leaching profiles for two chromate-inhibited epoxy polyamide primers have been analysed and non-Fickian diffusion kinetics have been observed. The time dependence was found to be t0.25 instead of the standard Fickian t0.5. The t0.25 time dependence was consistent for different pH values (1. 3. 5 and 7) even though the overall release rates increased with decreasing pH. Abrading the primer surface increased the overall leaching rate but did not change the t0.25 dependence. The unusual release kinetics cannot be explained by a decreasing effective diffusion coefficient (via changes in porosity and tortuosity or a fractal structure) or pH-dependent chemical reactions. The leaching rates have been modelled using a simple power law. a polynomial. and the shrinking core model. The polynomial model produced the best fit to leaching data and provides some insight into the source of the non-Fickian leaching …,True,RcbiRYsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,54,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300944006000270,6222648781522831454,/scholar?cites=6222648781522831454,,,0,0,0

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) and porous polymer networks (PPNs) are important categories of APMs. By unravelling their structure-property relationships and employing the principles of group theory and topochemistry. this dissertation will focus on the rational design of these APMs with anticipated structures. porosities and properties. The vast majority of this dissertation will rely on the utilization of the tetrahedral building blocks in the construction of MOFs and PPNs. A few representative examples of MOMs with biomimetic features will also be presented.  The first part of this dissertation introduces background knowledge for the chemistry of APMs. In addition to their definition and potential applications. it provides a systematic overview of different methods for the rational design of APMs.  The second part illustrates the structures and gas storage applications of a series of MOFs constructed from a synthetically-accessible tetrahedral ligand.  The study of symmetry-guided design of MOFs includes further exploration of tetrahedral ligands. The third part elucidates how the employment of topochemistry can lead to the discovery of a MOF with the largest porosity among all MOFs made from tetrahedral linkers.  The symmetry-guided strategy can also be applied to the synthesis of PPNs.

1145879,NMR in chiral and achiral smectic phases: Structure. orientational order and dynamics,2007,Valentina Domenici and Marco Geppi and Carlo Alberto Veracini,50,,1,1-50,Pergamon,The smectic state of matter (smectic from the Greek rlgcla= soap) can be defined as a liquid crystalline state of matter with a layered. onion-like structure. Molecules in the smectic phase show actually. in addition to orientational order. a degree of translational order not present in nematics. In the smectic phases the molecules. or rather their centers of gravity. stay in layers. the so-called smectic planes. The spacing of the layers. around 40 A. is usually close to the molecular length although notable exceptions are possible (for instance. in frustrated and interdigitated phases). In smectics. at lower temperatures. molecular motions tend to be restricted to these planes. The interactions between planes are normally weak so that planes can flow. sliding over each other. The increased order means that the smectic state is more ‘‘solid-like’’than the nematic: in liquid crystals showing polymorphism. smectics normally occur at lower temperatures with respect to nematic phases. A variety of molecular arrangements is possible within the layers giving rise. in conjunction with the occurrence of defects. to a variety of macroscopic textures recognizable by microscopic observation. The simplest smectic phase is the smectic A (SmA) phase. in which the orientational order of molecules (defined by a director. ñÞ is coincident with the layer normal. k. In smectic C (SmC) liquid crystals. the director adopts a temperature-dependent tilt angle h with respect to k. and directors in consecutive layers are oriented in the same direction (synclinic orientation).

1145925,Synthesis of (-)-Quinocarcin by Directed Condensation of r-Amino Aldehydes,,Soojin Kwon and Andrew G Myers,,,,,,(-)-Quinocarcin is a pentacyclic alkaloid with antiproliferative effects. 1. 2 It is structurally similar to the saframycins3 and ecteinascidins4 in the A-. B-. and C-rings. but differs from these molecules in the D-ring. which is five-membered rather than six-membered. We sought to extend to the synthesis of quinocarcin an approach we had earlier used to prepare (-)-saframycin A. involving the directed condensation of C-and N-protected R-amino aldehyde derivatives. 5 To achieve this it was necessary to devise chemistry to synthesize the five-membered D-ring of quinocarcin that was compatible with the planned condensation-based approach. and to determine an effective sequence for its implementation. We describe here the realization of these objectives in a synthetic route to (-)-quinocarcin. 6 The major bond formations were achieved using simple condensation reactions of R-amino aldehyde derivatives. The synthetic sequence to (-)-quinocarcin developed is illustrated in Scheme 1 and employs as starting materials the N-protected R-amino aldehyde component 1. comprising the A-and B-rings of the target and synthesized in eight steps from (R. R)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide7 (19% yield. see Supporting Information). and the C-protected R-amino aldehyde component 2. also synthesized from (R.

Although many fast pyrolysis processes have been developed and tested. few were reported to be successful on commercial scale due to problems including poor tar quality and system plugging. It is. therefore. important to exam the reactivity of the fast pyrolysis tars particularly at temperatures they may experience upon releasing from the coal surface. Four coals of different ranks were pyrolyzed to study the reactivity of the tars. It is found that the tars contain high concentrations of radicals and are highly reactive at temperatures higher than 623 K to generate more radicals and form coke.

The conversion of xylose to methyl xylosides protected the C1 hydroxyl group of xylose. which stabilized xylose and suppressed the formation of sugar oligomers and polymerization reactions. In comparison. the conversion of furfural to DOF protected the carbonyl group of furfural.

1146058,Green Pesticides: Essential Oils as Biopesticides in Insect-pest Management,2016,Abdel-Tawab H. Mossa,9,Journal of Environmental Science and Technology,5,,science alert,The long-term applications of synthetic insecticides have resulted in residues accumulating in different environmental components. They have adverse effects on non-target organisms. ecosystems and human health. Therefore. bio-insecticides “Green pesticides” have posted as an alternative to synthetic insecticides in agriculture and public health sectors. The study presented here focuses on the prospects of essential oils (EOs) as bio-insecticides for insect pest management. In fact. many EOs have insecticidal. fumigant. antifeedant. attractive and repellent activities against a broad spectrum of insects with some selectivity. The EOs are a complex of chemical compounds with multiple modes of action that enhances their activity due to the synergistic action between constituents. Due to their volatility in nature. EOs are used as a fumigant against agriculture and storage food insects. Consequently. EO-based insecticides are very important for control stored insects because they are active against a variety of insects. fast penetrating and no toxic residues in the treated products. In contrast. some problems (eg. volatility. solubility and oxidation) of EO-based insecticides were recorded. which plays an important role in the EOs activity. application and persistent. For this reason. new formulations with nanotechnology “Nanoformulation” can resolve these problems and offer numerous advantages. So. encapsulating the EOs has a considerable perspective as commercial insecticide products. Finally. EOs-based insecticides are low toxic. environmental persistence and eco-friendly.

The question here is. are all natural insecticides safe. Therefore. the review presented here focuses on the safety of natural insecticides. Natural insecticides contain chemical. mineral. and biological materials and some products are available commercially. e.g.. pyrethrum. neem. spinosad. rotenone. abamectin. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). garlic. cinnamon. pepper. and essential oil products. It can induce hepatotoxicity. renal toxicity. hematotoxicity. reproductive toxicity. neurotoxicity. and oxidative stress. It can induce mutagenicity. genotoxicity. and carcinogenicity in mammals. Some natural insecticides and active compounds from essential oils are classified in categories Ib (Highly hazardous) to U (unlikely toxic). Therefore. the selectivity and safety of natural insecticides not absolute and some natural compounds are toxic and induce adverse effects to experimental animals.

1146072,Antihepatotoxic activity of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) essential oil against chlorpyrifos-induced liver injury in rats,2011,Sameeh A Mansour and Tarek M Heikal and Amal A Refaie and AH Mossa,1,Glob J Environ Sci Technol,10,,,This study was undertaken to investigate chlorpyrifos (CPF) hepatotoxicity and to assess the hepatoprotective effect of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) essential oil (FEO) on male rats. The oil was extracted from seeds and analyzed by GC/MS. The two doses of oil (0.3 and 0.5 mlkg-1 b. wt.). either with or without CPF (1/10 LD50). were administered orally for 28 days. Administration of CPF caused an increase in hepatic cytochrome P450. lipid peroxidation (LPO) and alteration in several serum biomarkers (eg alanine aminotransferase (ALT). acid phosphatase (AcP). cholinesterase (ChE). γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). albumin and total protein). Compared to control values. body weight decreased. while relative liver weight increased. Furthermore. CPF-group showed degenerative changes. mononuclear cell infiltration and focal necrotic cells in the liver. In fennel oil-CPF groups. the aforementioned alterations were alleviated. especially with the higher dose. The antihepatotoxic activity of FEO may be due to its antioxidant activity. ability to scavenge free radical generated by CPF and inhibition of cytochrome P450 and oxon formation.

The UV/Vis absorption spectrum and the electrochemical properties clearly reveal that this dyad exhibits a strong electronic coupling in the ground state as evidenced by shifted redox potentials and the appearance of an intense chargetransfer band localized at l= 739 nm in dichloromethane. A spectroelectrochemical study of the dyad along with the parent homometallic system (ie. ZnP–ZnP and AuP–AuP) was undertaken to determine the spectra of the reduced and oxidized porphyrin units. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopic analysis showed that the photoexcitation of the heterometallic dyad leads to an ultrafast formation of a charge-separated state (+ ZnP–AuPC) that displays a particularly long lifetime (t= 4ns in toluene) for such a short separation distance. The molecular orbitals of the dyad were determined byDFT quantum-chemical calculations. This theoretical study confirms that the observed intense band at l= 739 nm corresponds to an interporphyrin charge-transfer transition from the HOMO orbital localized on the zinc porphyrin to LUMO orbitals localized on the gold porphyrin.

A property common to all of the substituents which cause this positive shift in frequency isthat they are electrophilic in nature. ie. they tend to deplete the aromatic nucleus of-electronic charge. These experimental observations are consistent with the theory of orbital following during molecular vibrations. The depletion of-electron density of the aromatic nucleus by electrophilic substituents leads to a decreased ability of the carbon bonding orbitals to follow the out-of-plane movement of the hydrogen atoms. This results in higher bending vibration frequencies because the vibrations occur with greater difficulty as orbital overlap decreases. Applications of this theory to other spectral anomalies are also discussed.Various …,True,FCjlPK4AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,153,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja01588a019,6021420702378105265,/scholar?cites=6021420702378105265,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4383677,0,0,0

Introduction The existence of molecular complexes between nitro-substituted benzenes and aromatic hydro-carbons has long been recognized. Many theories have been advanced to explain the nature of these complexes but only recently has one been proposed which is completely acceptable. This theory is found in a series of papers by Mulliken3 whose gen-eral quantum-mechanical treatment of molecular complexes encompassed all of the precedingmajor. classical theories. 3· 4 Mulliken suggested that the formation of molecular complexes from two aro-matic molecules can arise from the transfer of an electron from a-molecular orbital of a Lewis base to a vacant-molecular orbital of a Lewis acid. with resonance between this dative structure and the no-bond structure stabilizing the complex.

We report supramolecular polymers that can fold into protein-like topologies. Our approach is based on curvature-forming supramolecular rosettes. which affords kinetic control over the extent of helical folding in the resulting supramolecular fibers by changing the cooling rate for polymerization. When using a slow cooling rate. we obtained misfolded fibers containing a minor amount of helical domains that folded on a time scale of days into unique topologies reminiscent of the protein tertiary structures. Thermodynamic analysis of fibers with varying degrees of folding revealed that the folding is accompanied by a large enthalpic gain.

To better understand this process. techniques capable of probing the solvated state are consequently required. Small‐angle scattering (SAS) has a proven ability to detect and characterize solutions. but it is rarely applied to more complex assembly shapes. Here. small‐angle X‐ray and neutron scattering are applied to observe toroidal assemblies in solution. Combined analysis confirms that the toroids have a core–shell structure. with a π‐conjugated core and an alkyl shell into which solvent penetrates. The dimensions determined by SAS agree well with those obtained by (dried‐state) atomic force microscopy. Increasing the number of naphthalene units in the molecular building block yields greater rigidity. as evidenced by a larger toroid and a reduction in solvent penetration into the shell.

However. agglomeration and uniform dispersion remains an Achilles' heel (even an elephant in the room). hampering the optimization of this material for practical applications. Chemical functionalization of graphene can overcome these hurdles but is often rather disruptive to the extended pi-conjugation. altering the desired physical and electronic properties. Employing surfactants as stabilizing agents in latex technology circumvents the need for chemical modification allowing for the formation of nanocomposites with retained graphene properties.

A suite of laboratory assays was used to quantitatively characterize mosquito responses to toxic. contact irritant. and non-contact spatial repellent actions of standard insecticides. Highly replicated tests of these compounds over a range of concentrations proved that all were toxic. some were contact irritants. and even fewer were non-contact repellents. Of many chemicals tested. three were selected for testing in experimental huts to confirm that chemical actions documented in laboratory tests are also expressed in the field. The laboratory tests showed the primary action of DDT is repellent. alphacypermethrin is irritant. and dieldrin is only toxic. These tests were followed with hut studies in Thailand against marked-released populations. DDT exhibited a highly protective level of repellency that kept mosquitoes outside of huts. Alphacypermethrin did not keep mosquitoes out. but its strong irritant action caused them to prematurely exit the treated house. Dieldrin was highly toxic but showed no irritant or repellent action. Based on the combination of laboratory and confirmatory field data. we propose a new paradigm for classifying chemicals used for vector control according to how the chemicals actually function to prevent disease transmission inside houses.

We describe the molecular effects of 10 insect repellents and a pyrethroid insecticide with known repellent activity on two highly specific Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) ORs. AaOR2 + AaOR7 and AaOR8 + AaOR7. exquisitely sensitive to key mosquito attractants indole and (R)‐(−)‐1‐octen‐3‐ol. expressed in oocytes of Xenopus (Anura: Pipidae).

The “golden rule” of crystal engineering is that one has to assume that the architecture within crystals. and therefore the space group in which a given compound crystallizes. is determined solely by the strength and directionality of intermolecular or interionic interactions. In other words. most crystal structures can be regarded as de facto manifestations of self-assembly.

These are the best LASL data available and. as revisions are made. new or better data will be added. The volume is divided into two major parts for the user's convenience. Part I presents in one place the properties of explosives by explosive and summarizes all the property data and the results of various tests generally used to characterize ex-plosives. It covers only pure explosives and explosive formulations that have been well characterized. However. for many of these materials there are some properties or test results that have not been determined and in those cases the section normal-ly used to list the property or test result has been omitted.

Mex.(USA),A phenomenological study of the dependence of steady detonation velocity on charge radius (the''diameter effect'') in cylindrical configuration is described. Consideration is mainly given to high-density heterogeneous solid explosives cast or pressed to greater than 94 percent of theoretical maximum density. The work centers around a new fitting form which fits data for both homogeneous and heterogeneous explosives quite well. Some success is achieved in correlating the parameters of the fit with measured quantities. The effect of joints in rate sticks and of boosting on steady detonation velocity is examined experimentally. A significant joint effect is resolved. Finally. front-curvature measurements on a plastic bonded TATB are used to deduce the reaction-zone length for this explosive.

To do this theoretical results obtained from the Euler equations of compressible flow are combined with experimental data on steady‐state detonation shock‐wave speed and shape as a function of the explosive charge size. The theoretical results. constrained by the experiments. define an inverse problem for the chemical heat‐release function in the reaction zone which follows the shock wave; this problem is solved. The heterogeneous explosive is made from the homogeneous one by adding small quantities of other materials. Because of this. the two explosives were closely related in many respects.

The failure diameter of an ex-plosive is. bydefinition. the diameter of the smallest right circular cylinder of the explosive in which it is possible to propagate a steady detonation wave. These earlier workers thought that this increased sensitivity was due toproduction of methylnitrite (CH3ONO. 3 and 4 of Figure 1) by the UV light.

1146397,Chemical dimerization of crystalline anthracene produced by transient high pressure,1994,Ray Engelke and Normand C Blais,101,,12,10961-10972,American Institute of Physics,We report the production of a chemically bound dimer of anthracene produced by the shock compression of crystalline anthracene. The experimental probe used to detect the dimer structure was time‐of‐flight (TOF) mass spectrometry. The principal method used to produce the shock compression was the impact of electrically accelerated flyers (‘‘slappers’’) with the surface of the anthracene crystals. Our work correlates well with earlier experimental and theoretical work concerning chemical processes that can occur in pressurized anthracene and other aromatic materials. We briefly review the earlier work. The anthracene crystals were shocked to various pressures in the interval 9 to 22 GPa. Also various crystal thicknesses were employed; this allowed us to control the time interval over which various anthracene ‘‘particles’’ in the crystal were held at high pressure and temperature. At a pressure of ∼22.1 GPa we …,True,Mz5kEKQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,32,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.467846,1744013571172107373,/scholar?cites=1744013571172107373,,http://www.gammaexplorer.com/lanlreports/lanl1_a/lib-www/la-pubs/00406876.pdf#page=134,0,0,0

It utilizes theoretical results obtained from the Euler equations of fluid mechanics and experimental detonation data. which consist of steady‐state shock shapes and detonation velocities measured as a function of charge size. We determine Arrhenius parameters for detonating commercial‐grade nitromethane. The sensitivity of the method to various uncertainties in the input is tested.

1146399,Effect of a physical inhomogeneity on steady‐state detonation velocity,1979,Ray Engelke,22,The Physics of Fluids,9,1623-1630,American Institute of Physics,A set of experiments has been performed which demonstrate that ’’hot spots’’ in an explosive control some aspects of the steady‐state detonation process. It is known. from experiments. that the relationship between explosive charge size and steady‐state detonation velocity (the ’’diameter‐effect curve’’) is qualitatively different for homogeneous and heterogeneous explosives. The experiments to be described strongly indicate that this qualitative difference is due to localized hot regions arising from flow modifications due to the presence of physical inhomogeneities. These local hot regions apparently produce an effective chemical reaction rate which allows a stable steady‐state flow at a much smaller charge size than is possible in an analogous homogeneous material. Detonation‐velocity measurements were carried out on cylindrical rate sticks at a number of radii thus generating diameter‐effect curves.

A key fingerprint of this reduced dimensionality is the effect of weak charge-carrier localization that we observe at low temperatures. The disks’ resistivity measured as a function of magnetic field changes its shape from parabolic at room temperature to linear at a temperature of 2.7 K indicating further this type of two-dimensional transport. Compared to Bernal stacked graphite. turbostratic graphene is mechanically much more robust. and it exhibits almost negligible variations of the electrical properties between samples.

We investigated the requirements for the localization of nesprin-3α at the outer nuclear membrane and show that the mechanism by which its localization is mediated is similar to that reported for the localization of nesprin-1 and nesprin-2: the last four amino acids of the nesprin-3α KASH domain are essential for its interaction with Sun1 and Sun2. Moreover. deletion of these amino acids or knockdown of the Sun proteins results in a redistribution of nesprin-3α away from the nuclear envelope and into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). where it becomes colocalized with the cytoskeletal crosslinker protein plectin.

However. it is not clear as yet whether α6β4 participates in cell signaling by serving as a substrate for tyrosine kinases and as an adaptor for their associated signaling proteins or whether its role in cellular processes is passive. involving regulation of the assembly and disassembly of HDs.

Critical for the mechanical stability of the HD is the interaction between integrin α6β4 and plectin. which is destabilized when HD disassembly is required. for instance. to allow keratinocyte migration during wound healing. Growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) can trigger HD disassembly and induce phosphorylation of the β4 intracellular domain. Whereas tyrosine phosphorylation appears to mediate cooperation with growth factor signaling pathways and invasion in carcinoma cells. serine phosphorylation seems the predominant mechanism for regulating HD destabilization.

I-R injury can induce lung dysfunction whether the I-R occurs in the lung or in a remote organ. Recently. evidence has emerged that receptors and pathways of the innate immune system are involved in recognizing sterile inflammation and overlap considerably with those involved in the recognition of and response to pathogens.The authors used a mouse surgical model of transient unilateral left pulmonary artery occlusion without bronchial involvement to create ventilated lung I-R injury.

Since most studies on the role of this phosphatase family have relied on the use of generic PP2A inhibitors. the contribution of individual PP2A holoenzyme complexes in PP2A-controlled signaling pathways is largely unclear. To gain insight into this. we have constructed a set of shRNA vectors targeting the individual PP2A regulatory subunits for suppression by RNA interference. Here. we identify PR55γ and PR55δ as inhibitors of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by UV irradiation. We show that PR55γ binds c-SRC and modulates the phosphorylation of serine 12 of c-SRC. a residue we demonstrate to be required for JNK activation by c-SRC.

An important interaction between these two proteins occurs between the actin-binding domain (ABD) of plectin and the first pair of fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains and a small part of the connecting segment of β4. Previously. a few amino acids. critical for this interaction. were identified in both plectin and β4 and mapped on the crystal structures of the ABD of plectin and the first pair of FNIII domains of β4. In the present study. we used this biochemical information and protein-protein docking calculations to construct a model of the binary complex between these two protein domains.

1146475,Quantitative in vitro assay to measure neutrophil adhesion to activated primary human microvascular endothelial cells under static conditions,2013,Kevin Wilhelmsen and Katherine Farrar and Judith Hellman,,Journal of visualized experiments: JoVE,78,,MyJoVE Corporation,The vascular endothelium plays an integral part in the inflammatory response. During the acute phase of inflammation. endothelial cells (ECs) are activated by host mediators or directly by conserved microbial components or host-derived danger molecules. Activated ECs express cytokines. chemokines and adhesion molecules that mobilize. activate and retain leukocytes at the site of infection or injury. Neutrophils are the first leukocytes to arrive. and adhere to the endothelium through a variety of adhesion molecules present on the surfaces of both cells. The main functions of neutrophils are to directly eliminate microbial threats. promote the recruitment of other leukocytes through the release of additional factors. and initiate wound repair. Therefore. their recruitment and attachment to the endothelium is a critical step in the initiation of the inflammatory response.

NADA is also an agonist of cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2. We have reported that NADA reduces the activation of cultured human endothelial cells by LPS and TNF-α. Thus far. in vivo studies using NADA have focused on its neurologic and behavioral roles. In this article. we show that NADA potently decreases in vivo systemic inflammatory responses and levels of the coagulation intermediary plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in three mouse models of inflammation: LPS. bacterial lipopeptide. and polymicrobial intra-abdominal sepsis. We also found that the administration of NADA increases survival in endotoxemic mice. Additionally.

According to the myristoyl-electrostatic switch model the co-operation between the myristoyl moiety and the positively charged effector domain (ED) is an essential mechanism by which proteins bind to membranes. Loss of the electrostatic interaction between the ED and phospholipids. such as Ptdins(4.5)P2. results in the translocation of such proteins to the cytoplasm. While this model has been extensively tested for the binding of MARCKS far less is known about the mechanisms regulating MRP localization. We demonstrate that after phosphorylation. MRP is relocated to the intracellular membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes. MRP binds to all membranes via its myristoyl moiety. but for its localization at the plasma membrane the ED is also required …,True,JO8duaMAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482707004053,15965382681601223507,/scholar?cites=15965382681601223507,,,0,0,0

They act through cellular signaling proteins that bind to specific autophosphorylation sites. To find out whether these autophosphorylation sites can be used to identify downstream signaling proteins. synthetic peptides based on an autophosphorylation site in the colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor were linked to agarose beads and incubated with lysates from macrophages. Bound proteins were analyzed by MS. leading to the identification of both known and novel CSF-1 receptor-interacting proteins.

Menadione metabolism was also associated with a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of glutathione reductase. impairing the regeneration of GSH from GSSG produced during menadione-induced oxidative stress. Inhibition of glutathione reductase by pretreatment of hepatocytes with 1.3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) greatly potentiated both GSH depletion and GSSG formation during the metabolism of low concentrations of menadione.Concomitant with GSH oxidation. mixed disulfides between glutathione and protein thiols were formed.

Our initial studies showed the high tendency of these materials to aggregate and form nanoassemblies in different media. Nile Red experiments and DLS measurements allowed us to determine the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) and the size of the aggregates. which have also been used to stabilize small gold nanoparticles. The nanoparticles influence the assembly and optical properties of the dendrimer molecules and lead to strong quenching of their intrinsic fluorescence. Nevertheless. these gold particles will be very useful as biomarkers in living cells by means of electron microscopy because of their high electron contrast.,True,ggjBuL8AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,21,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma401505k,11863123966468988239,/scholar?cites=11863123966468988239,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maria_Sanchez-Verdu/publication/257537418_PPV-PAMAM_Hybrid_Dendrimers_Self-Assembly_and_Stabilization_of_Gold_Nanoparticles/links/5a145b080f7e9b925cd5080f/PPV-PAMAM-Hybrid-Dendrimers-Self-Assembly-and-Stabilization-of-Gold-Nanoparticles.pdf,0,0,0

SPR is label-free and capable of measuring real-time quantitative binding affinities and kinetics for membrane proteins interacting with ligand molecules using relatively small quantities of materials and has potential to be medium-throughput. The conventional SPR technique requires one binding component to be immobilised on a sensor chip whilst the other binding component in solution is flowed over the sensor surface; a binding interaction is detected using an optical method that measures small changes in refractive index at the sensor surface.

To date. the major functions of selenium can be attributed to its antioxidative properties and its role in the regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism. cell growth and eicosanoid biosynthesis. The unusual feature of selenoprotein synthesis is that selenocysteine insertion is specified by the stop UGA codon. A number of selenocysteine-specific gene products and a stem-loop structure in the 3′ untranslated region are required for selenocysteine biosynthesis and the decoding of UGA codons in the open reading frame of the mRNA. The major biological functions of selenium are achieved through its redox activity when present as selenocysteine at the active sites of selenoproteins and these proteins are selenium-dependent since replacement with the sulphur analogue cysteine causes loss of enzyme activity.

GLUT1 has widespread expression and catalyses the energyindependent facilitated diffusion of glucose down its concentration gradient across red blood cell membranes. blood-brain and blood-tissue barriers and membranes of some oragnelles. Import is usually the prevailing direction of transport for providing metabolic fuel. especially in proliferating cells. PET imaging using 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose ([18F] FDG) measures the uptake of [18F] FDG into cells and tissues as a marker of glucose transport and glycolytic activity. Diseases can alter glycolytic activity in localised regions of tissues or organs. which can be visualised using [18F] FDG PET. Expression and/or activity levels of GLUT1 contribute to the pattern and intensity of [18F] FDG.[18F] FDG PET imaging is used in diagnosing and monitoring a range of human diseases and in analysing their response to treatments. Proliferating cancer cells display overexpression of GLUT1 and a vastly higher rate of glycolysis for satisfying their increased nutrient demands. Tumours therefore have significantly enhanced [18F] FDG uptake compared with normal cells. so [18F] FDG PET is routinely used in diagnosing and monitoring cancers.[18F] FDG PET imaging of the brain allows identification of distinct patterns of hypometabolism and/or hypermetabolism associated with neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease.

One technique that is highly dependent on detergents for solubilization of membrane proteins is solution-state NMR spectroscopy. where detergent micelles often serve as the best membrane mimetic for achieving particle sizes that tumble fast enough to produce high-resolution and high-sensitivity spectra. although not necessarily the best mimetic for a biomembrane. For achieving the best quality NMR spectra. detergents with partial or complete deuteration can be used. which eliminate interfering proton signals coming from the detergent itself and also eliminate potential proton relaxation pathways and strong dipole-dipole interactions that contribute line broadening effects.

To explore metal ion binding to membrane transport proteins we have used cadmium-113 as a solid state NMR probe of the Escherichia coli zinc exporter ZitB present in native membrane preparations.

Metal ion uptake studies were also performed using ZitB-reconstituted into proteoliposomes for a well established fluorescence assay.

We investigated this phenomenon using calculations on simplified active site models. A recent paper suggested that several aspects of the analysis required further exploration. In this paper we: (i) review the results of our crystallographic study; (ii) report molecular dynamics studies which investigate the effect of protein movement; (iii) report ONIOM calculations which trace the reaction coordinate for an oxyanion hole reaction in the presence of a complete enzyme active site. These results show that the limitations of gas phase calculations on simplified models do not invalidate our comparison of competing active site geometries.

Our results are consistent with the experimental enantioselectivity. but more importantly. reveal that the Z vs E preference depends on the influence of the catalyst upon the geometry of the allenyl enolate formed in the addition step. These intermediates show an innate preference for a (Z)-configuration. although this can be suppressed by steric interactions due to a catalyst. This leads to two distinct mechanisms in which the kinetic basis for (E) or (Z)-stereoselectivity is determined by a different step.

The receptors combine a double H-bond donor pattern that resembles the oxyanion hole in natural enzymes. with a sulfone or sulfoxide that acts as a proton-transfer group. Since these compounds cannot be obtained enantiomerically pure from natural sources. chiral resolution was necessary to study their enantioselectivity.

The PM bilayer is highly asymmetric. and this asymmetry is considered crucial in cell function. In a typical mammalian cell. the inner leaflet of the PM is enriched in phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and contains minor populations of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and PI(4.5)P2. There is strong evidence that efficient binding of HIV-1 Gag to membranes is sensitive not only to lipid composition and net negative charge. but also to the hydrophobic character of the acyl chains.

Its capsular polysaccharide is essential for systemic virulence. Over 90 serologically distinct pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (serotypes) are recognized. but they are unequal in prevalence. Because antibodies against the capsule are protective. polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. which are constructed against the most prevalent serotypes. have caused great reductions in pneumococcal disease caused by these serotypes. In response. however. the relative prevalences of serotypes have shifted. Certain previously rare serotypes. such as serotype 35B. are increasing in prevalence.

During the late phase of the HIV-1 infection. Gag polyproteins are transported to the plasma membrane (PM) for assembly. In the past two decades. in vivo. in vitro and structural studies have shown that Gag trafficking and targeting to the PM are orchestrated events that are dependent on multiple factors including cellular proteins and specific membrane lipids. The matrix (MA) domain of Gag has been the focus of these studies as it appears to be engaged in multiple intracellular interactions that are suggested to be critical for virus assembly and replication. The interaction between Gag and the PM is perhaps the most understood. It is now established that the ultimate localization of Gag on punctate sites on the PM is mediated by specific interactions between the MA domain of Gag and phosphatidylinositol-4.5-bisphosphate (PI(4.5)P2). a minor lipid localized on the inner leaflet of the PM. Structure-based studies revealed that binding of PI(4.5)P2 to MA induces minor conformational changes. leading to exposure of the myristyl (myr) group. Exposure of the myr group is also triggered by binding of calmodulin. enhanced by factors that promote protein self-association like the capsid domain of Gag. and is modulated by pH.

Posttranslational attachment of fatty acids such as myristate occurs on a variety of viral and cellular proteins. High-resolution information about the nature of lipidated proteins is remarkably sparse. often because of solubility problems caused by the exposed fatty acids. Reverse micelle encapsulation is used here to study two myristoylated proteins in their lipid-extruded states: myristoylated recoverin. which is a switch in the Ca2+ signaling pathway in vision. and the myristoylated HIV-1 matrix protein. which is postulated to be targeted to the plasma membrane through its binding to phosphatidylinositol-4.5-bisphosphate.

SaPI1 is normally stably integrated into the host genome but can become mobilized by “helper” bacteriophage 80α. leading to the packaging of SaPI1 genomes into phage-like transducing particles that are composed of structural proteins supplied by the helper phage but having smaller capsids. We show that the SaPI1-encoded protein gp6 is necessary for efficient formation of small capsids. The NMR structure of gp6 reveals a dimeric protein with a helix–loop–helix motif similar to that of bacteriophage scaffolding proteins.

1146760,Modelling biosensor responses,2008,PN Bartlett and CS Toh and EJ Calvo and V Flexer,,,,267-325,Wiley: Chichester. England,The purpose of a kinetic model of a biosensor is to identify the key experimental factors (such as the rates of reactions. rates of mass transport. loading of the bio-recognition component. etc.) which determine the response. or output. of the sensor and to then provide a link between these key experimental factors. the concentration of the analyte and the sensor response. A model provides a mathematical description of the physical processes occurring within the system. Once we have a robust kinetic model for a particular enzyme electrode or biosensor. we can use this model in a number of advantageous ways. It is clear that several different kinetic processes are involved in the overall operation of any amperometric enzyme electrode or biosensor. These will include the reactions between the enzyme and its substrate. between the enzyme and a redox mediator. and between the redox mediator and electrode. In addition. the various mass transport processes which bring reactants to the electrode and take products away will also play a role. On its own. any single measurement of electrode response cannot give any insight into the relative significance of the different kinetic steps. If. however. a set of data from the enzyme electrode. obtained under a sufficiently wide range of conditions. can be analyzed and compared to a kinetic model for the electrode this will yield a more intimate knowledge of the system. the way in which it works. and the features which control its performance.

Only a few studies have previously investigated the relationship between altmetrics and assessments by peers.

In the second step. we test the relationship between the dimensions and quality of papers (as measured by the post-publication peer-review system of F1000Prime assessments)–using regression analysis. The results of the PCA and FA show that altmetrics operate along different dimensions. whereas Mendeley counts are related to citation counts. and tweets form a separate dimension. The results of the regression analysis indicate that citation-based metrics and readership counts are significantly more related to quality. than tweets.

An important source of altmetrics is Twitter. which is a popular microblogging service. In bibliometrics. it is standard to normalize citations for cross-field comparisons. This study deals with the normalization of Twitter counts (TC). The problem with Twitter data is that many papers receive zero tweets or only one tweet.

Corrections for higher excitations and core/core-valence correlation effects are accounted for in separate calculations. In this manner. suitable reference values are obtained with a mean deviation of −0.75 kJ/mol and a standard deviation of 1.06 kJ/mol with respect to the active thermochemical tables. Often. in the literature. new approximate methods (e.g.. in the area of density functional theory) are compared to. or fitted to. experimental heats of formation of the G2/97 test set.

1146776,Normalization of Mendeley reader counts for impact assessment,2016,Robin Haunschild and Lutz Bornmann,10,Journal of informetrics,1,62-73,Elsevier,A different number of citations can be expected for publications appearing in different subject categories and publication years. For this reason. the citation-based normalized indicator Mean Normalized Citation Score (MNCS) is used in bibliometrics. Mendeley is one of the most important sources of altmetrics data. Mendeley reader counts reflect the impact of publications in terms of readership. Since a significant influence of publication year and discipline has also been observed in the case of Mendeley reader counts. reader impact should not be estimated without normalization. In this study. all articles and reviews of the Web of Science core collection with a publication year of 2012 (and a DOI) are used to normalize their Mendeley reader counts. A new indicator that determines the normalized reader impact is obtained –the Mean Normalized Reader Score (MNRS) – and compared with the MNCS.

Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films were prepared using the sol–gel dip coating method and the effects of film thickness (230–480 nm). heating temperature (400–600 °C) and atmosphere (air/argon) on the system structural and opto-electronic performances were investigated. The results show that highly c-axis oriented crystals could be easily formed in GZO coatings. which origins from a preferred nucleation and gets fully developed during the structure evolution. The increase of film thickness prolongs the sol–gel preheating process and promotes nucleation. resulting in a more crystalline film.

Mg–CS powder was incorporated into PCL. and we fabricated the 3D scaffolds using laser sintering technology. These scaffolds had high porosity and interconnected-design macropores and structures. As compared to pure PCL scaffolds without an Mg–CS powder. the hydrophilic properties and degradation rate are also improved. For scaffolds with more than 20% Mg–CS content. the specimens become completely covered by a dense bone-like apatite layer after soaking in simulated body fluid for 1 day. In vitro analyses were directed using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on all scaffolds that were shown to be biocompatible and supported cell adhesion and proliferation. Increased focal adhesion kinase and promoted cell adhesion behavior were observed after an increase in Mg–CS content. In addition. the results indicate that the Mg–CS quantity in the composite is higher than 10%. and the quantity of cells and osteogenesis-related protein of hMSCs is stimulated by the Si ions released from the Mg–CS/PCL scaffolds when compared to PCL scaffolds.

1146842,Thin films for advanced glazing applications,2016,Ann-Louise Anderson and Shuqun Chen and Luz Romero and Işıl Top and Russell Binions,6,,3,37,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Functional thin films provide many opportunities for advanced glazing systems. This can be achieved by adding additional functionalities such as self-cleaning or power generation. or alternately by providing energy demand reduction through the management or modulation of solar heat gain or blackbody radiation using spectrally selective films or chromogenic materials. Self-cleaning materials have been generating increasing interest for the past two decades. They may be based on hydrophobic or hydrophilic systems and are often inspired by nature. for example hydrophobic systems based on mimicking the lotus leaf. These materials help to maintain the aesthetic properties of the building. help to maintain a comfortable working environment and in the case of photocatalytic materials. may provide external pollutant remediation. Power generation through window coatings is a relatively new idea and is based around the use of semi-transparent solar cells as windows. In this fashion. energy can be generated whilst also absorbing some solar heat. There is also the possibility. in the case of dye sensitized solar cells. to tune the coloration of the window that provides unheralded external aesthetic possibilities. Materials and coatings for energy demand reduction is highly desirable in an increasingly energy intensive world. We discuss new developments with low emissivity coatings as the need to replace scarce indium becomes more apparent. We go on to discuss thermochromic systems based on vanadium dioxide films.

While studying marine biofilms. we observed that supernatant produced by a marine isolate of Bacillus licheniformis was capable of dispersing bacterial biofilms. We investigated the source of this activity and identified the active compound as an extracellular DNase (NucB). We have shown that this enzyme rapidly breaks up the biofilms of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We demonstrate that bacteria can use secreted nucleases as an elegant strategy to disperse established biofilms and to prevent de novo formation of biofilms of competitors.

It was found that when the free surface of the n-butanol solution was located far (L=39.5 cm) from the point of bubble formation. the average lifetimes of bubbles were shorter than those of bubbles on the solution surface located close (L=4 cm) to the point of bubble formation. According to theoretical predictions. the motion of a bubble through a surfactant solution leads to a non-uniform surfactant distribution over the bubble surface with substantially lowered adsorption coverage on its upstream part. When the solution surface was far. the distance travelled by the bubble was long enough for such a non-uniform distribution to develop and so a non-symmetrical foam film with its lower interface depleted of surfactant was formed at the solution …,True,kLso7SAAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927775798003823,653487158022137610,/scholar?cites=653487158022137610,,,0,0,0

The production of biopolymers through biotechnological means attracted the keen attention of researchers due to wide range of their applications. Microbial cellulose is homopolysaccharide having wide industrial applications and it could be Biotechnology's next high-value product. Microfibrilar structure of microbial cellulose is responsible for most of its properties such as high tensile strength. higher degree of polymerization and high crystallinity index. Fibrils of bacterial cellulose are about several times thinner than that of plant cellulose making it a highly porous material. which allows transfer of antibiotics or other medicines into the wound while at the same time serving as an efficient physical barrier against any external infection. It is therefore used extensively in wound healing. It is produced by a variety of organisms ranging from unicellular and multicellular.

Concerns over human exposure to and risk from these particles have resulted in increased interest in novel strategies to detect AgNPs. This study investigated the feasibility of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a method for the detection and quantification of AgNPs in antimicrobial products. By using ferbam (ferric dimethyl-dithiocarbamate) as an indicator molecule that binds strongly onto the nanoparticles. AgNPs detection and discrimination were achieved based on the signature SERS response of AgNPs-ferbam complexes.

This is processed via sequential grafting. the principle of which is based on retention or partial displacement of the templating surfactant. The latter provides the patterning from mutual electrostatic repulsion during the grafting of the first function; here chloropropyldimethylsilyl (CPDMS) or trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups. Then. the second functionalisation step is performed with removal of the remaining surfactant leading to an overall full coverage.

1147069,Understanding the enantioselectivity of a heterogeneous catalyst: the influence of ligand loading and of silica passivation,2005,Dalit Rechavi and Belén Albela and Laurent Bonneviot and Marc Lemaire,61,Tetrahedron,29,6976-6981,Pergamon,One of the major drawbacks of heterogeneous catalysts is an inferior catalytic performance relative to their homogeneous counterparts. This is often attributed to high local concentration of the catalyst. and in certain cases to various active groups of the heterogeneous support and to its steric effects. We tested the influence of these factors in the case of a silica-grafted bis(oxazoline) catalyst used in the Diels–Alder reaction. by varying the ligand loading and the degrees of passivation of the silica. We show that. in the present case. the enantioselectivity of the catalyst is linearly correlated with the passivation of the silica. and high ligand loadings can be used without damaging the performance of the catalyst. This is. to the best of our knowledge. the first example of a correlation between silica passivation and the enantioselectivity of a heterogeneous catalyst.,True,TDCqamEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040402005008069,678811694232267126,/scholar?cites=678811694232267126,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44382387/Understanding_the_enantioselectivity_of_20160404-826-crfbbx.pdf,0,0,0

CH3NH(CH2)nNHCH3 (C2DA. C3DA and C6DA for n = 2. 3 and 6. respectively) or NH2(CH2)nNH2 (C4DA and C5DA for n = 4 and 5. respectively). The outcome of the reactions was closely related to the spacing of the surface bromopropyl groups. Amount of bromine that remained after the reaction decreased linearly with the amount of C2DA. and it disappeared completely when C2DA : Br = 1 : 1 in the initial reactant mixture. This result indicates the complete conversion of C2DA and Br by a one-to-one substitution (i.e. formation of a linear species). By contrast. the rate of decrease of Br was twice as fast during substitutions with amines other than C2DA when diamine/Br < 0.5 (in the initial mixture). suggesting a one-to-two substitution and the formation of a bridge …,True,TDCqamEAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,25,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2007/jm/b708084k,16657724674347123622,/scholar?cites=16657724674347123622,,,0,0,0

The main drawbacks for a real application were identified to be related to the nature of the reaction products: SO2 is toxic. corrosive and malodorous. and SO42− accumulates on the photocatalyst surface leading to deactivation. In order to face this challenge. supported photocatalysts with different properties were synthesised to investigate several strategies according to the photocatalyst selectivity.

Recent results are in agreement with one of the conflicting views on this problem. according to which triboelectricity in polymers is triggered by mechanochemical and wear or mass transfer phenomena. These results also challenge the widely accepted paradigm of one-way charge transfer that is the basis of the triboelectric series. Experimental results from powerful analytical techniques coupled to surface charge mapping support the following hypothesis: charge-bearing species are ionic polymer fragments formed through mechanical action.

Wild et al. have shown by 31P NMR experiments that the H/D exchange between PHMePh and PDEtPh is negligible in highly purified acetonitrile in the presence of sodium acetylacetonate as a proton scavenger. showing that the resolution of secondary phosphanes may be feasible under mildly basic conditions.[3] When the phosphane is attached to metal ions. a borane or chalcogens by means of the lone pair the racemization does not occur and some diastereomers containing coordinated secondary phosphanes have been separated.[3. 4] However. with the exception of the remarkable results described by Wild et al. with menthylmesitylphosphane.[2] recovery of the free optically pure ligand has not been accomplished.Here we report the synthesis and separation of some diastereomers of compounds [PdCl (C10H6CHMeNH2)-(PHPhR)](R Me and PhCH2) and the isolation of the free secondary phosphanes by the action of 1. 2-bis (diphenylphosphanyl …,True,-GHABkQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,29,https://www.academia.edu/download/46039741/_28sici_291099-0682_28200006_292000_3A6_3C1283_3A_3Aaid-ejic1283_3E3.0.co_3B2-c20160529-24921-184nke1.pdf,4972597441708564213,/scholar?cites=4972597441708564213,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46039741/_28sici_291099-0682_28200006_292000_3A6_3C1283_3A_3Aaid-ejic1283_3E3.0.co_3B2-c20160529-24921-184nke1.pdf,0,0,0

In this contribution we report measurements of near infrared (NIR) absorption spectra. Required high sensitivity is achieved by combining liquid nitrogen cooled plasma with the technique of NIR cavity ringdown absorption spectroscopy. The measured transition frequencies are then used for exciting cold ions stored in a low-temperature 22-pole radiofrequency ion trap. Absorption of a photon by the stored ion is detected by using the laser-induced reactions technique.

In reality. the models presented to describe the structures of crystals are only approximations of reality. since any given crystal must have a surface where terminating groups differ from the bulk interior. even for the most well-ordered and carefully grown crystals. However. far from being problematic. structural defects in solids have a well-established role in enhancing and controlling the properties of materials. most notably in heterogeneous catalysis and band-gap tuning of semiconductors. 1–5 Unfortunately. by their very nature defects are typified by disorder and low concentration compared to the bulk of a material. so studying them is a challenging undertaking. Given the effect they can have on the properties of a material however. their characterization is necessary in order to be able to manipulate and rationalize material design towards a given application.There are a number of different classifications of crystallographic defects that have been identified. based on their dimensionality. The first set. known as point defects. are located at a single site as opposed to being extended in any direction–in other words. they are 0-dimensional. These can be as a result of a vacancy. where an atom or molecule in an otherwise ordered array is simply not present. and is known as a Schottky defect.

However. well-known arenecoordinating reagents failed to form the expected hexahapto derivatives. and these notions were swept aside by the synthesis and structure determination of Pt (PPh3) 2 (η2-C60). in which the C60 ligand is coordinated as a dihaptoalkene. 3 Subsequent metal π-complex chemistry4 as well as related developments in derivative chemistry involving both metal-containing5 and purely organic6 reagents have reinforced the idea that C60 reacts primarily as a moderately electronegative alkene.

With the designed electrodeposition method. the metal of interest (e.g. Au. Cu. Fe or Pd) is deposited in a controlled way on the original electrode pair. on a chip for MCBJ or on the STM tip. to make the metallic contact. Then. various metal atomic wires and molecular junctions can be fabricated and characterized systematically.

Based on the lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa) and brine shrimp (Artemia salina). the lowest toxicity level was achieved in 5 min of electrolysis time. Due to the remaining high toxicity level above 30 min of electrolysis time. the EC process is not adequate to be used in a single effluent treatment. suggesting that this electrochemical process of up to 5 min could be used as part of a complete effluent treatment system.,True,sqvjREgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,91,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438940901125X,10780007676589091341,/scholar?cites=10780007676589091341,,,0,0,0
