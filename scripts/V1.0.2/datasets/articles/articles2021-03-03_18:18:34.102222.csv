This distribution has fueled debate concerning whether. in sites where it has recently been found. the pathogen was introduced or is endemic. In this study. we addressed the molecular population genetics of a global collection of fungal strains from both declining and healthy amphibian populations using DNA sequence variation from 17 nuclear loci and a large fragment from the mitochondrial genome. We found a low rate of DNA polymorphism. with only two sequence alleles detected at each locus. but a high diversity of diploid genotypes. Half of the loci displayed an excess of heterozygous genotypes. consistent with a primarily clonal mode of reproduction. Despite the absence of obvious sex. genotypic diversity was high (44 unique genotypes out of 59 strains). We provide evidence that the observed genotypic variation can be generated by loss of heterozygosity through mitotic recombination. One strain isolated from a bullfrog possessed as much allelic diversity as the entire global sample. suggesting the current epidemic can be traced back to the outbreak of a single clonal lineage. These data are consistent with the current chytridiomycosis epidemic resulting from a novel pathogen undergoing a rapid and recent range expansion.

Determining key factors that influence veterinarians’ antimicrobial prescribing behaviours can bridge the gap between prescribing guidelines and clinical usage. Veterinarians practicing in Australia were surveyed on their frequency in prescribing different antibiotics; factors influencing their antibiotic prescribing behaviours; and their perceptions of current drivers of AMR. Antibiotics were prescribed in a third of consultations with key differences in the frequency of use of specific antibiotics by small companion animal (SCA). equine and livestock veterinarians. which broadly aligned with antibiotic registration restrictions in Australia. SCA veterinarians reported prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics of higher importance to human health more frequently than livestock veterinarians.

Usually the loss due to disease results from incremental and often unapparent effects of endemic disease on animal thrift or reproduction. rather than the potentially devastating effects of epidemic diseases. Outbreaks of the major viral diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease are not covered here: they are either subject to regulatory measures to prevent their introduction. or where established. vaccination and movement controls are usually in place to contain their spread and impact. This chapter covers common diseases that require surveillance and management intervention to limit their effects under routine sheep raising conditions and places them in perspective. rather than providing a detailed description of all sheep diseases (available in various texts in the References).The costs of disease to national sheep industries are usually underestimated. In Australia. a recent estimate of annual disease cost was over a billion dollars (Sackett et al.. 2006). mainly due to parasites and factors affecting lamb survival. Much of this loss is known to be preventable through the use of routine management programs and appropriate chemical intervention. In particular. the provision of optimal nutrition to sheep at seasonal or age-related periods of vulnerability is the key to reducing the occurrence and impact of many diseases.

1190036,Occurrence of Terranova larval types (Nematoda: Anisakidae) in Australian marine fish with comments on their specific identities,2016,Shokoofeh Shamsi and Jaydipbhai Suthar,4,PeerJ,,e1722,PeerJ Inc.,Pseudoterranovosis is a well-known human disease caused by anisakid larvae belonging to the genus Pseudoterranova. Human infection occurs after consuming infected fish. Hence the presence of Pseudoterranova larvae in the flesh of the fish can cause serious losses and problems for the seafood. fishing and fisheries industries. The accurate identification of Pseudoterranova larvae in fish is important. but challenging because the larval stages of a number of different genera. including Pseudoterranova. Terranova and Pulchrascaris. look similar and cannot be differentiated from each other using morphological criteria. hence they are all referred to as Terranova larval type. Given that Terranova larval types in seafood are not necessarily Pseudoterranova and may not be dangerous. the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of Terranova larval types in Australian marine fish and to determine their specific identity.

1190040,Seafood-borne parasitic diseases: A “one-health” approach is needed,2019,Shokoofeh Shamsi,4,,1,9,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Global consumption of seafood is steadily increasing. as is the variety of seafood. including dishes with raw or undercooked fish. leading to an increased risk of seafood-borne parasitic diseases. To address today’s challenges to understand the biology and ecology of these parasites in an ever-changing environment and to tackle their pathogenicity. multidisciplinary research is needed. In addition. the gap between research and stakeholders must be bridged to decrease the risk these parasites pose to public health. A “One-Health” approach to research is necessary to ensure that consumers. aquatic animals. and environmental health questions are assessed in an integrated and holistic manner. resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the issues associated with seafood-borne parasitic diseases and potential solutions. However. when it comes to seafood-borne parasitic diseases. there is limited guidance available for a “One-Health” approach since these diseases can be less known. In this article. the focus is on parasitic diseases caused by seafood. which have been less studied even in some developed countries where seafood is popular. A brief overview of some of the seafood-borne parasitic diseases is provided followed by the significance of the awareness among various stakeholders in a country. In this article. it is argued that researchers and stakeholders are closely connected and a knowledge gap in one can result in a gap in knowledge and awareness in the other. causing an inability to accurately estimate the issues caused by these parasites.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was used for the analysis of sequence variation in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene among 179 specimens of P. festiva (identified based on morphology and predilection site in the host) from 13 different host species. followed by selective DNA sequencing. Fifty-three distinct sequence types (haplotypes) representing all specimens were defined.

Detailed health monitoring and the small population size (<300 individuals) of this critically endangered bird provided an opportunity to longitudinally track viral replication and mutation events occurring in a circular. single-stranded DNA virus over a period of four years within a novel bottleneck population. Optimized PCR was used with different combinations of primers. primer walking. direct amplicon sequencing and sequencing of cloned amplicons to analyze BFDV genome variants. Analysis of complete viral genomes (n = 16) and Rep gene sequences (n = 35) revealed that the outbreak was associated with mutations in functionally important regions of the normally conserved Rep gene and immunogenic capsid (Cap) gene with a high evolutionary rate (3.41×10−3 subs/site/year) approaching that for RNA viruses; simultaneously we observed significant evidence of recombination hotspots between two distinct progenitor genotypes within orange-bellied parrots indicating early cross-transmission of BFDV in the population.

1190059,The importance of wildlife disease monitoring as part of global surveillance for zoonotic diseases: the role of Australia,2019,Rupert Woods and Andrea Reiss and Keren Cox-Witton and Tiggy Grillo and Andrew Peters,4,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,1,29,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Australia has a comprehensive system of capabilities and functions to prepare. detect and respond to health security threats. Strong cooperative links and coordination mechanisms exist between the human (public health) and animal arms of the health system in Australia. Wildlife is included in this system. Recent reviews of both the animal and human health sectors have highlighted Australia’s relative strengths in the detection and management of emerging zoonotic diseases. However. the risks to Australia posed by diseases with wildlife as part of their epidemiology will almost certainly become greater with changing land use and climate change and as societal attitudes bring wildlife. livestock and people into closer contact. These risks are not isolated to Australia but are global. A greater emphasis on wildlife disease surveillance to assist in the detection of emerging infectious diseases and integration of wildlife health into One Health policy will be critical in better preparing Australia and other countries in their efforts to recognize and manage the adverse impacts of zoonotic diseases on human health.

Sudden blindness. icterus and subsequent mass mortalities of Eastern Grey Kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) occurred in the Wagga Wagga region of New South Wales in April 2014. Preliminary differential diagnoses of Wallal/Warrego virus. macropod herpes virus or facial dermatitis were ruled out. The animals had various severities and phases of hepatopathy with lesions ranging from acute damage to chronic regeneration. Animals presented with marked corneal oedema with a ventral to dorsal progression in animals showing progressive stages of disease. This syndrome was suspected to be a plant toxicosis resulting in hepatogenous photosensitisation. Clinical pathology investigation of the cases provides evidence for a difference in the sensitivity of enzymes used to assess cholestasis in macropods. Histopathology of the livers of the affected animals demonstrated intrabiliary acicular clefts. indicating possible saponin crystal formation. resulting in structural damage to the bile ducts and hepatocytes. An analysis of pasture proportion and species indicated the areas where kangaroos were feeding in the evenings and early night contained a high proportion of the suspect toxic plant species Panicum gilvum when compared to a control location.

It is viewed as a target for both inundative and classical biological control. As fungal biological control agents are often specific in terms of their host range. the genetic variation within the host may be important in their successful deployment. The detection of genetic variation in populations of C. lanatus from New South Wales was studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based. intersimple sequence repeats (ISSR) analysis.

Genomics can aid the successful commercialization of biopesticides by identification of key genes differentiating closely related species. selection of virulent microbial isolates which are amenable to industrial scale production and formulation and through the reduction of phenotypic variability. The genome of Metarhizium isolate ARSEF23 was recently published as a model for M. anisopliae. however phylogenetic analysis has since re-classified this isolate as M. robertsii. We present a new annotated genome sequence of M. anisopliae (isolate Ma69) and whole genome comparison to M. robertsii (ARSEF23) and M. acridum (CQMa 102). Whole genome analysis of M. anisopliae indicates significant macrosynteny with M. robertsii but with some large genomic inversions. In comparison to M. acridum. the genome of M. anisopliae shares lower sequence homology.

Numerous outbreaks of LYDs of coconut have been recorded in the Caribbean and Africa since the late 19th century and have caused the death of millions of palms across several continents during the 20th century. Despite the severity of economic losses. it was only in the 1970s that the causes of LYDs were identified as phytoplasmas. a group of insect-transmitted bacteria associated with diseases in many other economically important crop species. Since the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. knowledge of LYDs epidemiology. ecology and vectors has grown rapidly. There is no economically viable treatment for LYDs and vector-based management is hampered by the fact that vectors have been positively identified in very few cases despite many attempted transmission trials. Some varieties and hybrids of coconut palm are known to be less susceptible to LYD but none are completely resistant. Optimal and current management of LYD is through strict quarantine. prompt detection and destruction of symptomatic palms. and replanting with less susceptible varieties or crop species. Advances in technology such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for detection and tracking of phytoplasma DNA in plants and insects. remote sensing for identifying symptomatic palms. and the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based tools for gene editing and plant breeding are likely to allow rapid progress in taxonomy as well as understanding …,True,4hw-N08AAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,49,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01521/full,14232367275375900279,/scholar?cites=14232367275375900279,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01521/full,0,0,0

A disease survey revealed that both diseases are already well distributed within the Australian rice growing areas and that disease severity can be relatively important in some crops. Epidemiological studies showed that under Australian conditions. both Rhizoctonia oryzae and R. oryzae-sativae could overwinter as mycelium on straw debris. regardless of whether the straw is left on the ground or buried. Mycelium of R. oryzae-sativae present on rice straw was also found to be able to produce sclerotia. as a saprophyte. during the overwintering period.

From a soil organic matter perspective. the build-up of carbon (%C) requires an accumulation of nitrogen (%N). and the build-up of %C and %N fertility comes at the cost of soil acidity. Rotation. tillage. and stubble practices combine to alter the quantity. quality (C : N). and the depth distribution of organic matter in a soil. but the three soil chemical properties reported here seem to also be in quasi-equilibrium at the three long-term sites.

Genomics can aid the successful commercialization of biopesticides by identification of key genes differentiating closely related species. selection of virulent microbial isolates which are amenable to industrial scale production and formulation and through the reduction of phenotypic variability. The genome of Metarhizium isolate ARSEF23 was recently published as a model for M. anisopliae. however phylogenetic analysis has since re-classified this isolate as M. robertsii. We present a new annotated genome sequence of M. anisopliae (isolate Ma69) and whole genome comparison to M. robertsii (ARSEF23) and M. acridum (CQMa 102). Whole genome analysis of M. anisopliae indicates significant macrosynteny with M. robertsii but with some large genomic inversions. In comparison to M. acridum. the genome of M. anisopliae shares lower sequence homology. While alignments overall are co-linear. the genome of M. acridum is not contiguous enough to conclusively observe macrosynteny.

This paper reports on the endophytic growth of a rifampicin‐marked strain of the seedborne rice pathogen Pseudomonas fuscovaginae. The bacterium was found in most tested seeds indicating that. even without visible discolouration. seed transmission is possible. Crushed discoloured seeds contained more bacterial cells than did non‐crushed discoloured seeds. These bacteria were released during seed soaking. contaminating clean seed and lowering seed germination. Cells of a rifampicin‐resistant strain of P. fuscovaginae. which had been inoculated onto rice seeds. were subsequently recovered from different growth stages and from different rice tissues. thereby indicating endophytic colonization.

The MHC is the most gene-dense region of the mammalian genome and is critical to immunity and reproductive success. The marsupial MHC bridges the phylogenetic gap between the complex MHC of eutherian mammals and the minimal essential MHC of birds. Here we show that the opossum MHC is gene dense and complex. as in humans. but shares more organizational features with non-mammals. The Class I genes have amplified within the Class II region. resulting in a unique Class I/II region.

Decreases in population size simultaneously lead to reductions in genetic diversity. ultimately reducing the ability of populations to adapt to a changing environment. In this way. loss of genetic polymorphism is linked with extinction risk. Recent advances in sequencing technologies mean that obtaining measures of genetic diversity at functionally important genes is within reach for conservation programs. A key region of the genome that should be targeted for population genetic studies is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). MHC genes. found in all jawed vertebrates. are the most polymorphic genes in vertebrate genomes. They play key roles in immune function via immune-recognition and-surveillance and host-parasite interaction. Therefore. measuring levels of polymorphism at these genes can provide indirect measures of the immunological fitness of populations. The MHC has also been linked with mate-choice and pregnancy outcomes and has application for improving mating success in captive breeding programs. The recent discovery that genetic diversity at MHC genes may protect against the spread of contagious cancers provides an added impetus for managing and protecting MHC diversity in wild populations. Here we review the field and focus on the successful applications of MHC-typing for conservation management.

Naturally occurring animal antibiotics are an obvious place to start. The recently sequenced genomes of mammals that are divergent from human and mouse. including the tammar wallaby and the platypus. provide an opportunity to discover novel antimicrobials. Marsupials and monotremes are ideal potential sources of new antimicrobials because they give birth to underdeveloped immunologically naïve young that develop outside the sterile confines of a uterus in harsh pathogen-laden environments. While their adaptive immune system develops innate immune factors produced either by the mother or by the young must play a key role in protecting the immune-compromised young. In this study we focus on the cathelicidins. a key family of antimicrobial peptide genes.   Principal Finding We identified 14 cathelicidin genes in the tammar wallaby genome and 8 in the platypus genome. The tammar genes were expressed in the mammary gland during early lactation before the adaptive immune system of the young develops. as well as in the skin of the pouch young.

1190144,Allorecognition in the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii). an endangered marsupial species with limited genetic diversity,2011,Alexandre Kreiss and Yuanyuan Cheng and Frank Kimble and Barrie Wells and Shaun Donovan and Katherine Belov and Gregory M Woods,6,PLoS one,7,e22402,Public Library of Science,Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) are on the verge of extinction due to a transmissible cancer. devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). This tumour is an allograft that is transmitted between individuals without immune recognition of the tumour cells. The mechanism to explain this lack of immune recognition and acceptance is not well understood. It has been hypothesized that lack of genetic diversity at the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) allowed the tumour cells to grow in genetically similar hosts without evoking an immune response to alloantigens. We conducted mixed lymphocyte reactions and skin grafts to measure functional MHC diversity in the Tasmanian devil population. The limited MHC diversity was sufficient to produce measurable mixed lymphocyte reactions. There was a wide range of responses. from low or no reaction to relatively strong responses. The highest responses occurred when lymphocytes from devils from the east of Tasmania were mixed with lymphocytes from devils from the west of Tasmania. All of the five successful skin allografts were rejected within 14 days after surgery. even though little or no MHC I and II mismatches were found. Extensive T-cell infiltration characterised the immune rejection. We conclude that Tasmanian devils are capable of allogeneic rejection. Consequently. a lack of functional allorecognition mechanisms in the devil population does not explain the transmission of a contagious cancer.,True,bAdn-rEAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,66,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022402,11208064633897548506,/scholar?cites=11208064633897548506,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022402,0,0,0

At the outlet of reburning instillations in Porto Velho 292 µg/m 3. and in nearby streets 3.2 µg/m 3. atmospheric mercury concentrations were measured. At other places atmospheric concentrations were not higher than in Rio de Janeiro. In water. suspended particles. and bottom sediments higher concentrations were measured in forest streams adjacent to the river than in Madeira River itself. Thus the mean±smallcapSsmallcapD values in forest streams were 3.05±4.5 µg/l water. 1.21 µg/g dry weight in suspended particles (only 3 values). and 10.2±30.3 µg/g dry weight in bottom sediment; in the river these values were 1.56±2.9 µg/l. 0.50±0.13 µg/g and 0.13±0.11 µg/g respectively.[Although these values are high. they are very much lower than in the sediments of Minamata Bay.

Although it is widely hypothesized that increased Hg load to aquatic ecosystems leads to increases in MeHg in fish. there is limited quantitative data to test this hypothesis. Here we examine the available evidence from a range of sources: studies of ecosystems contaminated by industrial discharges. observations of fish MeHg responses to changes in atmospheric load. studies over space and environmental gradients. and experimental manipulations. A summary of the current understanding of the main processes involved in the transport and transformation from Hg load to MeHg in fish is provided.

Four Franciscana Management Areas (FMA). proposed based on biology. demography. morphology and genetic data. were incorporated into management planning and in the delineation of research efforts. We re-evaluated that proposal through the analysis of control region sequences from franciscanas throughout their distribution range (N = 162). including novel sequences from the northern limit of the species and two other previously unsampled localities in Brazil. A deep evolutionary break was observed between franciscanas from the northern and southern portions of the species distribution. indicating that they must be managed as two Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESU).

Two species and four subspecies are currently accepted. but recent molecular data have challenged this view. In this study we investigated the molecular taxonomy of common dolphins through analyses of cytochrome b sequences of 297 individuals from most of their distribution. We included 37 novel sequences from the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. a region where the short- and long-beaked morphotypes occur in sympatry. but which had not been well sampled before. Skulls of individuals from the Southwestern Atlantic were measured to test the validity of the rostral index as a diagnostic character and confirmed the presence of the two morphotypes in our genetic sample. Our genetic results show that all common dolphins in the Atlantic Ocean belong to a single species. Delphinus delphis. According to genetic data. the species Delphinus capensis is invalid. Long-beaked common dolphins from the Northeastern Pacific Ocean may constitute a different species.

In this study the behaviour of several pharmaceutical products in different therapeutic categories (analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. lipid regulators. antibiotics. etc.) was monitored during treatment of wastewater in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The results were compared with removal in a conventional activated-sludge (CAS) process in a wastewater-treatment facility.

Diurnal activities of marine tucuxis were dominated by behaviour related to feeding/foraging (58% of all recorded time). Dolphins spent more time in feeding/foraging activities in the morning with a secondary peak in late afternoon. Dolphins were seen in waters of 2 to 35 m (11.63±6.05; median= 12.0). Depths used by S. guianensis groups significantly differed from depths available in GB (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; Z= 5.72; P< 0.001). Most groups (69.8%) were sighted in depths between 5.1 and 15.0 m.

Reports on by-catch in shark gillnet fisheries off Uruguay date back to the early forties (Van Erp. 1969). Although gillneting in Argentina and southern Brazil also emerged in the forties as a consequence of Second World War demands for cheap protein and vitamins (De Buen. 1950. 1952; Popovici and Angelescu. 1954; Crespo et al.. 1994; Haimovici et al.. 1997). no record of by-catch exists for those areas. Gillnet fisheries for bottomdwelling fish became the major conservation concern for franciscana in both countries only in the eighties. Nowadays. by-catch has been reported from all main fishing villages along most of the species geographical distribution (eg Corcuera. 1994; Crespo et al.. 1994; Pinedo. 1994a; Siciliano. 1994; Praderi. 1997; Secchi et al.. 1997; Zanelatto. 1997; Di Beneditto et al.. 1998; Ott. 1998).

São Paulo State. southeastern Brazil. was monitored between August 1998 and June 2001 through interviews with fishermen and onboard observations. The objective was to describe the fleet. the gear and the fishing activities. and to monitor the bycatch of small cetaceans. The Praia Grande fishing community has 20 fishermen who operate five aluminum and one wooden open boat. Seven types of gillnet and one beach seine net are used. Nets are made of nylon monofilament; net length and height range from 60-1800m and 1.5-10m. respectively. Mesh sizes vary from 7-30cm. Each type of net is set up according to target species and weather conditions. Fish of the families Sciaenidae. Carangidae. Carcharhinidae. Trichiuridae and Ariidae are the main species captured. The incidental mortality of 31 franciscanas was recorded. Thirteen specimens were collected: 8 males (106-122cm) and 5 females (71-134cm). Captures took place in depths of up to 20m and along 31km of the coast. Catch per unit of effort for the period July 1999-June 2001 indicated a higher mortality in autumn and in gillnets with 14cm stretched mesh size ('malha 14') Three franciscanas were captured and released alive from beach seine nets. Several fishing communities with similar operational methods along the southeastern coast of Brazil remain unmonitored.

The areas studied were Espírito Santo (ES)(18 30'S-19 40'S). northern Rio de Janeiro (NRJ)(21 35'S-22 25'S) and São Paulo (SP)(23 30'S-25 30'S). Franciscanas from NRJ and SP presented significant sexual dimorphism. with the means for the metric characters larger for females than for males. Sexual dimorphism for franciscanas from ES was not examined due to limited sample size. The growth pattern for body and skull did not indicate clinal variation. The asymptotic values obtained for franciscanas from SP were smaller than the values obtained for franciscanas from NRJ and ES. Canonical discriminant analysis of the cranial metric characters indicated significant differences among the three geographic areas. Differences between areas ES and NRJ accounted for 85%; of the variation (axis 1). The remaining 15%;(axis 2) was due to difference between the area SP from the others. The geographic variation supports the hypothesis stock division in southeast Brazil; allopatry might be present. Therefore. three franciscana stocks from the southeastern coast of Brazil should be considered distinct for conservation and management actions.,True,OmMrcd0AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,40,http://lajamjournal.org/index.php/lajam/article/view/161,17245365905989541083,/scholar?cites=17245365905989541083,,http://lajamjournal.org/index.php/lajam/article/download/161/113,0,0,0
