Depression further deteriorates QOL and is associated with poor treatment outcomes and lowered glycemic control in diabetes. We analysed the QOL and depression among the people living with diabetes in Nepal.   Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among a random sample of 157 diabetic patients visiting diabetes clinic at a major teaching hospital in Kathmandu. Nepal. We administered the Nepali version of WHO-BREF for face to face interviews to obtain data on QOL scores. The Nepali version of Patient Health Questionnaire-9was also used to record responses on depression items.   Results More than half of the respondents (54.1%) experienced depression with mean PHQ-9 score of 6.15 ± 5.01 on a scale of 0–27. On a scale of 0 to 100. highest QOL mean score was reported in social relationship domain (57.32 ± 11.83). followed by environment domain (54.71 ± 7.74). psychological health (53.25 ± 10.32) and physical health (50.74 ± 11.83).

We investigated the availability and prices of essential medicines in the Boston area. Using the WHO/HAI methodology. availability and undiscounted price data for both originator brand (OB) and lowest price generic (LPG) equivalent versions of 25 essential medicines (14 prescription; 11 over-the-counter (OTC)) were obtained from 17 private pharmacies. The inclusion and prices of 26 essential medicines in seven pharmacy discount programs were also studied. The medicine prices were compared with international reference prices (IRPs). In surveyed pharmacies. the OB medicines were less available as compared to the generics. The OB and LPG versions of OTC medicines were 21.33 and 11.53 times the IRP. respectively. The median prices of prescription medicines were higher. with OB and LPG versions at 158.14 and 38.03 times the IRP. respectively. In studied pharmacy discount programs. the price ratios of surveyed medicines varied from 4.4–13.9. While noting the WHO target that consumers should pay no more than four times the IRPs. medicine prices were considerably higher in the Boston area. The prices for medicines included in the pharmacy discount programs were closest to WHO’s target. Consumers should shop around. as medicine inclusion and prices vary across discount programs.

We used the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics (UN Comtrade) database to analyse exports of various health commodities from India to Nepal from January 2011–September 2016. We used time-series regressions of trading volume vs. unit price to ask how well Nepal’s trading history with India prior to the earthquake and blockade was able to predict unit prices of health commodities imported into Nepal during and after the earthquake and the blockade. Regression residuals were used to quantify the extent to which the blockade impacted the price of healthcare commodities crossing into Nepal. During the blockade period (September 2015-early February 2016). the volume of all retail medicines traded across the India-Nepal border was reduced by 46.5% compared to same months in 2014–2015. For medical dressings. large volumes were exported from India to Nepal during and shortly after the earthquakes (May–June 2015). but decreased soon thereafter. During the earthquake. the difference between observed and predicted values of unit price (residuals) for all commodities show no statistical outliers. However. during the border blockade. Nepal paid USD 22.3 million more for retail medicines than one would have predicted based on its prior trading history with India. enough to provide healthcare to nearly half of Kathmandu’s citizens for 1 year.

These interactions encourage me to share the criteria for making tenure in the Stanford Chemistry Department where I was Chairman of the Department for the past six years. In the American university system we hire faculty and then must decide within seven years whether we want them permanently to remain with us. namely. are they given ‘tenure’or not. It is always a difficult decision as those faculty we tenure determine the quality. characteristics and reputation of our Department. I am not necessarily advocating here that India adopt the US tenure system. but I do think that a careful study of its criteria might help. I am mindful of the arrogance that outsiders often display who do not know a culture. Still. let me dare to offer some advice. Many Indian academics that I know have been trained in the US and have benefited from such criteria in the way in which faculty are hired in the US. I am pleased to say that 3 of our 22 faculty members in my Department were born in India.In the Stanford Chemistry Department I tell the young faculty we hire that they must meet three criteria to achieve tenure.

Ltd,Objectives: To entrap methotrexate (MTX) in thermosensitive liposomes. to characterise liposomes for different physicochemical properties and to investigate the potential of liposome entrapped MTX and localised hyperthermia (HT) in management of melanoma B16F1. Methods: Thermosensitive liposomes. made of synthetic lipids (distearoylphosphatidylcholine. DSPC and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. DPPC) showing gel to liquid phase transition at 41 C. were used for encapsulation of methotrexate. The liposomes were prepared by reverse phase evaporation method. The entrapment efficiency of the drug within the liposomes was determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 column. The in vitro release studies of the vesicles were conducted by incubating the drug encapsulated liposomes in saline at various temperatures for 15 min. The vesicle stability was assessed by storage at room temperature. 37 C and under refrigeration (4 C) for a period of three months. The MTX containing liposomes were administered intravenously to C57BL/6J mice bearing melanoma B16F1 tumour at 12 mg kg-1 dose. Immediately after the drug administration. localised hyperthermia treatment was applied by placing the tumours in water bath at 43 C either for 30 min. or 1 hr. The volume doubling time and growth delay of the tumour were taken as parameters to assess the antitumour efficacy. Results: The thermosensitive liposomes encapsulated about 52% of the MTX.

Aluminium. a neurotoxic agent in humans. has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study. we examined the behavioral and biochemical effects of aluminium in rats with special emphasis on memory centres. namely. hippocampus and frontal cortex. Further. the effect of simvastatin treatment on aluminium intoxication was evaluated. Methods. Rats were exposed to aluminium chloride (AlCl3) for 60 days. Simvastatin (10 mg/kg/p.o.) and rivastigmine (1 mg/kg/p.o.) were administered daily prior to AlCl3. Behavioral parameters were assessed using Morris water maze test and actophotometer followed by biochemical investigations. namely. acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. TNF-α level. antioxidant enzymes (GSH. catalase). lipid peroxidation. and nitrite level in hippocampus and frontal cortex. Triglycerides. total cholesterol. LDL. and HDL levels in serum were also determined. Key Findings. Simvastatin treatment improved cognitive function and locomotor activity in rats. Simvastatin reversed hyperlipidemia and significantly rectified the deleterious effect of AlCl3 on AChE activity. Further. in hippocampus and frontal cortex. aluminium-induced elevation in nitrite and TNF-α and reduction in antioxidant enzymes were inhibited by simvastatin. Conclusion. To conclude. the present study suggests that simvastatin per se protects the neurons in hippocampus and frontal cortex from AlCl3. an environmental toxin.,True,36bltlMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,65,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bn/2015/210169/abs/,2166708100966128397,/scholar?cites=2166708100966128397,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bn/2015/210169/abs/,0,0,0

The pathophysiology of RI is interlinked with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. infarction. organ transplantation and sepsis. The mechanism of RI injury depends on various factors such as inflammatory response. oxidative stress and apoptosis. In this review. we evaluate the role of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase in modulating the process of ischemic renal injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a literature review of articles published on PubMed and Web of Science in English. RESULTS: RI is characterized by an inflammatory response and oxidative stress. which are further worsened by the metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway.CONCLUSIONS: RI results from a vigorous process involving inflammation and some mediators in a multifaceted interaction.

The extent of inhibition depends on the period of preincubation of phycocyanin with COX-2. but without any effect on the period of preincubation with COX-1. The IC50 value obtained for the inhibition of COX-2 by phycocyanin is much lower (180 nM) as compared to those of celecoxib (255 nM) and rofecoxib (401 nM). the well-known selective COX-2 inhibitors. In the human whole blood assay. phycocyanin very efficiently inhibited COX-2 with an IC50 value of 80 nM.

Lipoxygenases (EC 1.13. 11. 12) are a group of closely related enzymes that appear to be widely distributed in plants and mammalian tissues. One of the most physiologically important lipoxygenases and the subject of greater interest in recent years is 5-lipoxygenase. which catalyzes the first committed step in leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis. Information on the mechanistic details of this enzyme-catalyzed reaction is scant because of limitations in obtaining sufficient quantity of the purified enzyme in stable form from mammalian sources. Therefore. potato tubers are frequently employed as the source of large amounts of 5-1ipoxygenase.

There is a reciprocal relation between the Akt phosphorylation and mTOR complexes. Akt phosphorylated at T308 activates mTORC1 by inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2). where as mTORC2 is recognized as the kinase that phosphorylates Akt at S473. Recent developments in the research on regulatory mechanisms of autophagy places mTORC1 mediated inhibition of autophagy at the central position in activation of proliferation and survival pathways in cells. Autophagy is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling pathway and the downstream effectors of Wnt signaling pathway. cyclin D1 and the c-Myc. are the key players in initiation of cell cycle and regulation of the G1-S transition in cancer cells. Production of reaction oxygen species (ROS). a common feature of a cancer cell metabolism. activates several downstream targets like the transcription factors FoxO. which play key roles in promoting the progression of cell cycle.

As an essential component of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GSH-Px). Se is involved in cellular antioxidant defense by reducing semistable hydroperoxides to less reactive alcohols. 8-’o On the other hand. vitamin E. as an integral part of cell membranes. functions to scavenge the free radicals that promote peroxidative chain reactions.”-” Thus. they both control cellular lipid peroxide levels by related but independent mechanisms.In addition to their general antioxidant defense role. vitamin E and Se-GSH-Px could play the more specific role of modulating the enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid by way of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. This hypothesis arises from the mechanistic similarities between the nonenzymatic and enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid. The potential roles that vitamin E and Se-GSH-Px could play in modulating the arachidonic acid cascade appears schematically in FIGURE 2. The immediate oxygenation products of the enzymatic and nonenzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid include hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETE) and cyclic endoperoxides.

Material and method: The bark powder of W. tinctoria was extracted with 95% ethanol by continuous heat extraction and was subjected for phytochemical investigation and screened for wound healing activity in the incision. excision and dead space wound models in rats. A supportive study made on granuloma tissue to estimate the hydroxyproline content and histopathological examination to determine the pattern of lay-down for collagen using Masson Trichrome stain. Results: Triterpenoids. steroids and saponins were found to be present in ethanol extract of the barks of W. tinctoria. In resutured incision wound model. ethanol extract showed significant breaking strength (P< 0.01) compared to control. The ethanol extract promotes better wound healing by increasing the percentage wound closure and decreasing epithelization time (P< 0.001) compared to control. Statistically significant increase (P< 0.001) was observed in breaking strength and hydroxyproline content of ten day old granuloma of drug treated animals compared to control animals in dead space wound model. Conclusion: The results of the present study reveal that ethanol extract of bark of W. tinctoria have significant wound healing activity.

Biol,2,1-9,,Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (GADD) 45 and GADD153 proteins have been implicated in DNA repair. cell cycle regulation and growth arrest along with numerous other cellular mechanisms. In recent years. evidence has emerged that proteins encoded by these genes play pivotal roles in tumor suppression and apoptotic cell death. Thus. compounds altering the expression of these genes are likely to be of interest in cancer prevention and/or treatment. Protocatechualdehyde is isolated from Phellinus gilvus and has been investigated as a promising cancer preventive agent because of its medicinal properties. This mushroom belongs to Hymenochaetaceae Basidiomycetes. and has advantages over many Phellinus species due to short growth period (3 months). making production cost-effective. The exact molecular mechanisms of protocatechualdehyde are not clearly understood. Based on studies of pro-apoptotic activity of protocatechualdehyde in T-cells and colorectal cancer cells. we examined the relationship between the expression of GADD45 and GADD153 and apoptosis induction in human lung cancer cell line PC-9. We report ap 53-independent increase in GADD45 and GADD153 expression by protocatechualdehyde. Likewise. the proliferation of PC-9 cells is inhibited via a G1/S arrest of the cell-cycle stimulating apoptosis. Further. induction of apoptosis was inhibited in PC-9 cells knocked down for GADD45 and GADD153.

Mexican. Latina and Turkish women termed twalèt déba (vaginal cleanliness). and the human papilloma virus (HPV) leading to cervical cancer. A necessary debate warrants further analysis because the factors leading to HPV were not fully explored by previous research endeavors; and the connection between the practice and cervical cancer is not clearly exposed. The cultural and health behavior determinants are not easily framed for a deep understanding of the epidemiological and on ecological tentacles of this feminine practice. There are also elements of socio-economic disparities seen as barriers to HPV testing.

However. to some group of people. the answer may seem much more complicated. This is because some people are found to be intermediate between the two genders. Such people are referred to as “intersex” which can be perceived as sex developmental defect. This article gives a review of the real meaning of intersex as well as social and psychological issues associated with it. Several factors have been identified by scientists in classifying human gender. Biological sex may be ascertained based on certain characteristics which include external genitalia. internal reproductive anatomy. sex chromosomes as well as the type of gonads present (testis or ovaries)[1].As University of Oregon professor and intersex expert Elizabeth Reis writes in her book Bodies in Doubt.“In the United States and most other places. humans are men or they are women; they may not be neither or both. Yet not all bodies are clearly male or female.” That may suggest that a child has typical female chromosomes and ovaries but external bodies parts of a male [2]. The Council of Europe. in an explanatory memorandum to resolution (1952) on children’s right to physical integrity explains intersex as atypical and or external anatomical characteristics where features usually regarded as male or female may be mixed to some degree. This was however stated as a naturally occurring variation in human and not necessarily a medical condition. It is worthy of note that such variation may cause ambiguity of genitalia. and combinations of phenotype and genotype other than XY male and XX female …,True,uByZPSsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Satyajit_Patra4/publication/283810253_Intersex_and_gender_controversies/links/574f018808aef199238c3297.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Satyajit_Patra4/publication/283810253_Intersex_and_gender_controversies/links/574f018808aef199238c3297.pdf,0,0,0

Aluminium. a neurotoxic agent in humans. has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study. we examined the behavioral and biochemical effects of aluminium in rats with special emphasis on memory centres. namely. hippocampus and frontal cortex. Further. the effect of simvastatin treatment on aluminium intoxication was evaluated. Methods. Rats were exposed to aluminium chloride (AlCl3) for 60 days. Simvastatin (10 mg/kg/p.o.) and rivastigmine (1 mg/kg/p.o.) were administered daily prior to AlCl3. Behavioral parameters were assessed using Morris water maze test and actophotometer followed by biochemical investigations. namely. acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. TNF-α level. antioxidant enzymes (GSH. catalase). lipid peroxidation. and nitrite level in hippocampus and frontal cortex. Triglycerides. total cholesterol. LDL. and HDL levels in serum were also determined. Key Findings. Simvastatin treatment improved cognitive function and locomotor activity in rats. Simvastatin reversed hyperlipidemia and significantly rectified the deleterious effect of AlCl3 on AChE activity.

Recently. a few published reports on insulin in different cell lines support the antiapoptotic effect of insulin. But the reports fail to explain the role of insulin in modulating glutamate-mediated neuronal cell death through excitotoxicity. Thus. we examined the neuroprotective effect of insulin on glutamate-induced toxicity on differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells. Changes in cell viability were measured by 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) based assay. while apoptotic damage was detected by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Hoechst staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and morphological alterations were also measured.

India,Cancer is a complex disease characterized by a loss in the normal cell regulatory mechanisms that govern cell survival. proliferation. and differentiation. Current chemotherapeutics. as anticancer agents. are developing resistance to single drug and also to treatment therapies involving multiple drugs. Cross resistance associated with the specificity and selectivity of existing drugs has restricted the application of chemotherapy. Alternatively. these limitations have given better insight in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of various stages in cancer. In the light of this. continuous efforts are being made in order to identify and validate newer anticancer targets. This review presents some of the important targets that have been already reported. such as aromatase. farnesyl transferase. histone deacetylase. tyrosine kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase. A few molecules designed against these targets have successfully reached clinical trials. However. only limited marketed drugs are available from these classes. Besides. the review also highlights some of the other important targets and strategies that have also drawn considerable attention in the area of anticancer drug development such as. cancer stem cells and monoclonal antibodies. Further. the integration of the tools in molecular biology with the results from preclinical and clinical trials would strengthen the effectiveness of treatment regimens in cancer patients.

Here. we evaluated many different protocols from the literature on ostrich cortical bone and moa cortical bone to evaluate their yield and relative purity using the identification of antibody-antigen complexes on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel electrophoresis. Moa bone provided an ancient comparison for the effectiveness of bone extraction protocols tested on ostrich bone. For the immunological part of this study. we focused on collagen I. osteocalcin. and hemoglobin because collagen and osteocalcin are the most abundant proteins in the mineralized extracellular matrix and hemoglobin is common in the vasculature. Most of these procedures demineralize the bone first. and then the remaining organics are chemically extracted. We found that the use of hydrochloric acid. rather than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. for demineralization resulted in the cleanest extractions because the acid was easily removed. In contrast. the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid resulted in smearing upon electrophoretic separation. possibly indicating these samples were not as pure. The denaturing agents sodium dodecyl sulfate. urea. and guanidine HCl have been used extensively for the solubilization of proteins in non-biomineralized tissue. but only the latter has been used on bone.

Most paleoproteomic studies have relied on in-solution digestion with the inclusion of filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) as effective methods to detect the proteome. However. neither of these are optimal because few proteins have been detected utilizing only in-solution digestion and the molecular weight cutoff of FASP may miss remaining fragments of proteins in fossil bone. The recently developed single-pot. solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) overcomes these issues by not relying on molecular weight while still controlling where the proteins are digested.

Two popular diceCT stains. iodine-potassium iodide (I2KI) dissolved in water and elemental iodine (I2) dissolved in 100% ethanol (EtOH). yield striking results. Despite the widespread use of these stains in clinical and biological fields. the molecular mechanisms that result in color change and radiopacity attributed to iodine staining are poorly understood. Requests to apply these stains to anatomical specimens preserved in natural history museums are increasing. yet curators have little information about the potential for degradation of treated specimens. To assess the molecular effects of iodine staining on typical museum specimens. we compared the two popular stains and two relatively unexplored stains (I2KI in 70% EtOH. I2 in 70% EtOH). House sparrows (Passer domesticus) were collected and preserved under uniform conditions following standard museum protocols. and each was then subjected to one of the stains. Results show that the three ethanol-based stains worked equally well (producing fully stained. life-like. publication quality scans) but in different timeframes (five. six. or eight weeks). The specimen in I2KI in water became degraded in physical condition. including developing flexible. demineralized bones.

Seismological studies extend this process to the lower mantle. and geochemical observations indicate return of oceanic crust to the upper mantle in plumes. There has been no direct petrologic evidence. however. of the return of subducted oceanic crustal components from the lower mantle. We analyzed superdeep diamonds from Juina-5 kimberlite. Brazil. which host inclusions with compositions comprising the entire phase assemblage expected to crystallize from basalt under lower-mantle conditions. The inclusion mineralogies require exhumation from the lower to upper mantle. Because the diamond hosts have carbon isotope signatures consistent with surface-derived carbon. we conclude that the deep carbon cycle extends into the lower mantle.,True,fWQcsY8AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,296,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6052/54.abstract,9672565196039834135,/scholar?cites=9672565196039834135,,,0,0,0

We find that modern humans spend an order of magnitude less time feeding than predicted by phylogeny and body mass (4.7% vs. predicted 48% of daily activity). This result suggests that a substantial evolutionary rate change in feeding time occurred along the human branch after the human–chimpanzee split.

The fossil record tends to support an early Cenozoic origin of crown-group rodents. In contrast. most molecular studies place the origin and initial diversification of crown-Rodentia deep in the Cretaceous. although some molecular analyses have recovered estimated divergence times that are more compatible with the fossil record. Here we attempt to resolve this conflict by carrying out a molecular clock investigation based on a nine-gene sequence dataset and a novel set of seven fossil constraints. including two new rodent records (the earliest known representatives of Cardiocraniinae and Dipodinae). Our results indicate that rodents originated around 61.7–62.4 Ma. shortly after the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary. and diversified at the intraordinal level around 57.7–58.9 Ma. These estimates are broadly consistent with the paleontological record. but challenge previous molecular studies that place the origin and early diversification of rodents in the Cretaceous. This study demonstrates that. with reliable fossil constraints. the incompatibility between paleontological and molecular estimates of rodent divergence times can be eliminated using currently available tools and genetic markers. Similar conflicts between molecular and paleontological evidence bedevil attempts to establish the origination times of other placental groups.

Primitive bird tails underwent significant alteration. most notably reduction of the number of caudal vertebrae and fusion of the distal caudal vertebrae into an ossified pygostyle. These changes. among others. occurred over a very short evolutionary interval. which brings into focus the underlying mechanisms behind those changes. Despite the wealth of studies delving into avian evolution. virtually nothing is understood about the genetic and developmental events responsible for the emergence of short. fused tails. In this review. we summarize the current understanding of the signaling pathways and morphological events that contribute to tail extension and termination and examine how mutations affecting the genes that control these pathways might influence the evolution of the avian tail. To generate a list of candidate genes that may have been modulated in the transition to short-tailed birds. we analyzed a comprehensive set of mouse mutants. Interestingly. a prevalent pleiotropic effect of mutations that cause fused caudal vertebral bodies (as in the pygostyles of birds) is tail truncation. We identified 23 mutations in this class. and these were primarily restricted to genes involved in axial extension. At least half of the mutations that cause short. fused tails lie in the Notch/Wnt pathway of somite boundary formation or differentiation. leading to changes in somite number or size. Several of the mutations also cause additional bone fusions in the trunk skeleton. reminiscent of those observed in primitive and modern birds.

For the most part. they have been considered to be simple anguilliform swimmers – i.e.. their propulsive force was generated by means of lateral undulations incorporating the greater part of the body – with unremarkable. dorsoventrally narrow tails and long. lizard-like bodies. Convergence with the specialized fusiform body shape and inferred carangiform locomotory style (in which only a portion of the posterior body participates in the thrust-producing flexure) of ichthyosaurs and metriorhynchid crocodyliform reptiles. along with cetaceans. has so far only been recognized in Plotosaurus. the most highly derived member of the Mosasauridae.

Our study demonstrates that a streamlined body plan and crescent-shaped caudal fin were already well established in Platecarpus. a taxon that preceded Plotosaurus by 20 million years.

However. direct spectroscopic characterization of isolated fibrous bone tissues. a crucial test of hypotheses of biomolecular preservation over deep time. has not been performed. Here. we demonstrate that endogenous proteinaceous molecules are retained in a humerus from a Late Cretaceous mosasaur (an extinct giant marine lizard). In situ immunofluorescence of demineralized bone extracts shows reactivity to antibodies raised against type I collagen. and amino acid analyses of soluble proteins extracted from the bone exhibit a composition indicative of structural proteins or their breakdown products. These data are corroborated by synchrotron radiation-based infrared microspectroscopic studies demonstrating that amino acid containing matter is located in bone matrix fibrils that express imprints of the characteristic 67 nm D-periodicity typical of collagen. Moreover. the fibrils differ significantly in spectral signature from those of potential modern bacterial contaminants. such as biofilms and collagen-like proteins.

Argentina) quarried a site within the continental deposits of the Maastrichtian Lecho Formation (Bonaparte et al.. 1977; Bonaparte and Powell. 1980). on lands of the Estancia El Brete. in the northwestern Argentine province of Salta. These excavations resulted in a collection of different dinosaurian taxa. including the armored titanosaurid sauropod Saltasaurus loricatus (Bonaparte and Powell. 1980). As the remains of Saltasaurus were being collected and prepared. a series of small and mostly disarticulated bones was found. These bones. originally identified as avian by JF Bonaparte (Bonaparte et al.. 1977; Bonaparte and Powell. 1980). formed the collection that led Walker (1981) to recognize a monophyletic ensemble of early avians: Enantiornithes. Subsequent studies of Mesozoic birds demonstrated that other Cretaceous taxa discovered earlier could be allocated within the supraspecific taxon that Walker (1981) had recognized. Walker (1981) pointed out characters shared by the bones from El Brete and those of Alexornis antecedens from the Late Cretaceous of Mexico (Brodkorb. 1976). Alexornis was consequently assigned to Enantiornithes by Martin (1983). who also included within this taxon the Late Cretaceous Gobipteryx minuta (Elzanowski. 1974) from the Mongolian Gobi Desert. Later discoveries. primarily in the 1990s. showed that Enantiornithes embodied a diverse monophyletic group of birds evolving throughout the Cretaceous (Chiappe. 1991. 1993. 1995a. 1997; Zhou et al.. 1992; Chiappe and Calvo. 1994; Martin. 1995; Sanz et al.. 1995 …,True,joTkhO0AAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C,226,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=GMQkDQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA240&dq=info:8d1P99OLsG4J:scholar.google.com&ots=yPqHOeK2IG&sig=ikoUM7ICKgzQZ0pY-d4BQGDKcoY,7976028682576715249,/scholar?cites=7976028682576715249,,,0,0,0
1187488,Mesozoic birds: above the heads of dinosaurs,2002,Luis M Chiappe Lawrence M Witmer,,,,,Univ of California Press,Our knowledge of the origin and early evolution of birds has exploded in the past ten to fifteen years. In the 1990s alone. scientists became aware of approximately three times more species of early birds than were previously known. marking the first 85 million years of avian development as a period of remarkable species diversity. Assembling work by an international group of renowned scientists. Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs is the most authoritative and up-to-date source on early avian evolution currently available. This unique resource provides a comprehensive examination of the known fossil record and is also an unparalleled guide to the fast-paced developments in current research. Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs covers a wide range of topics. including discussions of avian origins. the fossil record of feathers and footprints. bone histology. and locomotor evolution. Controversial taxa such as Protoavis. Caudipteryx. and Mononykus receive special treatment. But the heart of the volume presents the anatomy. relationships. and paleobiology of the undisputed Mesozoic aviary. Some of the book's most exciting features are the new definitive descriptions and illustrations of taxa that previously have received only brief notice. such as the alvarezsaurid Shuvuuia; the enantiornithines Sinornis; Eoalulavis. Vorona. and Patagopteryx; and the hesperornithiform Enaliornis. The origin of birds and their relationship to dinosaurs continue to be hotly debated among paleontologists. ornithologists. and evolutionary biologists.

1187497,Basal bird phylogeny,2002,Luis M Chiappe,,Mesozoic birds: above the heads of dinosaurs,,448-472,University of California Press,Although more than half of the evolution of birds occurred during the Mesozoic era (Chiappe. 1995a). our understanding of this long history focused on the spectacular specimens of the Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx lithographica and the more derived Late Cretaceous hesperornithiforms and ichthyornithiforms for more than a century of paleontological research. In the past decade. however. a tremendous burst of new evidence—perhaps unparalleled in the field of vertebrate paleontology—has been uncovered. Indeed. the number of species of early birds described during the 1990s nearly tripled the number of taxa discovered during the previous 130 years. since the discovery of Archaeopteryx in the mid-1800s (Chiappe. 1997a; Padian and Chiappe. 1998). While this new evidence has offered an unprecedented opportunity for better understanding the evolutionary transformations of several remarkable biological attributes of birds (eg. feathers. uninterrupted growth. active flight). it has also made obsolete the previous phylogenetic analyses of basal birds. which had been based on far fewer taxa (eg. Cracraft. 1986; Chiappe and Calvo. 1994; Sanz et al.. 1995; Chiappe et al.. 1996). Clearly. a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis of the new diversity of basal avians is needed before the evolutionary history of these attributes can be fully explained.

Feathers. toothless beaks. hollow bones. perching feet. wishbones. deep breastbones and stumplike tailbones are only part of the combination of skeletal features that no other living animal has in common with them. How birds evolved feathers and flight was even more imponderable.

The definition of a good sample is itself interesting: the required sampling density varies locally. rigorously capturing the intuitive notion that featureless areas can be reconstructed from fewer samples. The output mesh interpolates. rather than approximates. the input points. Our algorithm is based on the three-dimensional Voronoi diagram.

However. such interaction is difficult because targets become occluded. and because fingers and thumbs have low input resolution. Recent research has addressed occlusion through visual techniques.

We hypothesised that the latter effect will be more pronounced when DHA/EPA is supplemented as phospholipids rather than as triglycerides.   Methodology/Principal Findings In a ‘prevention study’. C57BL/6J mice were fed for 9 weeks on either a corn oil-based high-fat obesogenic diet (cHF; lipids ∼35% wt/wt). or cHF-based diets in which corn oil was partially replaced by DHA/EPA. admixed either as phospholipids or triglycerides from marine fish. The reversal of obesity was studied in mice subjected to the preceding cHF-feeding for 4 months. DHA/EPA administered as phospholipids prevented glucose intolerance and tended to reduce obesity better than triglycerides. Lipemia and hepatosteatosis were suppressed more in response to dietary phospholipids. in correlation with better bioavailability of DHA and EPA. and a higher DHA accumulation in the liver. white adipose tissue (WAT). and muscle phospholipids. In dietary obese mice. both DHA/EPA concentrates prevented a further weight gain. reduced plasma lipid levels to a similar extent. and tended to improve glucose tolerance. Importantly. only the phospholipid form reduced plasma insulin and adipocyte hypertrophy. while being more effective in reducing hepatic steatosis and low-grade inflammation of WAT.

It is suggested that the potassium promotion effect is a very local one and that formation of a K-02 surface complex is the first step in graphite oxidation. The strongly preferred adsorption site for 02 on a K-covered surface is on top of a potassium atom with no interaction to the graphite layer. From there the dioxygen molecule can dissociate into oxygen atoms. The stabilizing K-02 interaction can be traced to a localized sp-hybrid available for bonding to 02 and the fact that the graphite ir system is not distorted upon chemisorption of 02 via the potassium spacer.

The results indicate that the O2 dissociation involves sequential population of a physisorbed and a chemisorbed precursor state at low translational energies and direct molecular chemisorption at high energies. No direct dissociation was observed. A strong angular dependence in the sticking coefficient at high translational energies suggests considerable corrugation in the activation barrier for molecular chemisorption. An observed enhancement in the sticking with increasing substrate temperature is consistent with a reduction in this corrugation.,True,zlAXIesAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,49,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261497012931,3068657463468922559,/scholar?cites=3068657463468922559,,,0,0,0

Little quantitative information is available as to how changes in surface topography on the micron and submicron scale affect the strength of bacterial attachment to substrata. A novel method is described using the atomic force microscope where a varying shear/lateral force (in nanonewtons) is used to detach individual bacterial cells from various substrata of different surface topographies. Lateral changes of 0.1 μm in the surface topography are sufficient to affect the strength of bacterial attachment. An increase in applied force from 4 to 8 nN was necessary to move bacteria retained in surface defects of approximately 1 μm wide and 0.2 μm deep compared with cells attached on smooth surfaces. ,True,JTJzgCkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,158,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la011142p,5608831040202456156,/scholar?cites=5608831040202456156,,,0,0,0

However. the recalcitrant genetics. cryptic expression. and unculturability of these fungi prevent scientists from systematically exploiting these gene clusters and harvesting their products. As heterologous expression of fungal BGCs is largely limited to the expression of single or partial clusters. we established a scalable process for the expression of large numbers of full-length gene clusters. called FAC-MS. Using fungal artificial chromosomes (FACs) and metabolomic scoring (MS). we screened 56 secondary metabolite BGCs from diverse fungal species for expression in Aspergillus nidulans.

Here. we demonstrate that endogenous proteinaceous molecules are retained in a humerus from a Late Cretaceous mosasaur (an extinct giant marine lizard). In situ immunofluorescence of demineralized bone extracts shows reactivity to antibodies raised against type I collagen. and amino acid analyses of soluble proteins extracted from the bone exhibit a composition indicative of structural proteins or their breakdown products. These data are corroborated by synchrotron radiation-based infrared microspectroscopic studies demonstrating that amino acid containing matter is located in bone matrix fibrils that express imprints of the characteristic 67 nm D-periodicity typical of collagen. Moreover. the fibrils differ significantly in spectral signature from those of potential modern bacterial contaminants. such as biofilms and collagen-like proteins.

Its existence and infrared spectrum were established in matrix isolation experiments by Pimentel and Rochkind3 and by Arkell and Schwager. 4 The study by Arkell and Schwager was particularly thoroughand used several methods to prepare the radical and involved the use of 160 and180 to establish its structure. Johnston and co-workers5 used modulation spectroscopy to study the ClOO radical in the gas phase. They could observe both its UV absorption spectrum and the 0-0 stretching band in the infrared spectrum. and they also obtained an estimate of its UV absorption cross section.

While prior works often make a simplifying assumption that resources assigned to different users are non-sharable. this assumption does not hold for storage resources. where users interested in services (e.g.. data analytics) based on the same set of data/code can share storage resource. Meanwhile. serving each user request also consumes non-sharable resources (e.g.. CPU cycles. bandwidth). We study the optimal provisioning of edge services with non-trivial demands of both sharable (storage) and non-sharable (communication. computation) resources via joint service placement and request scheduling.

Attempts to obtain molecular information from this record by analysis of nucleic acids found within fossils of extreme age have been unsuccessful or called into question. However. previous studies have demonstrated the long-term persistence of peptides within fossils and have used antibodies to extant proteins to demonstrate antigenic material. In this study we address two questions: Do immunogenic/antigenic materials persist in fossils? and; Can fossil material be used to raise antibodies that will cross-react with extant proteins? We have used material extracted from a well-preserved 100.000–300.000-year-old mammoth skull to produce antisera. The specificity of the antisera was tested by ELISA. western blotting. and immunohistochemistry.

Ltd., 1. This paper reports on an extension to the use of Fluvial Audit survey to include a subjective and adaptive multi‐criteria assessment (MCA) process that integrates scientific literature and observational data to develop three reach‐scale indices of: (a) channel modification; (b) channel function (sediment store or source); and (c) naturalness. These indices are nested within an overall conceptual model of channel evolution and used to underpin catchment scale river restoration.  2. The approach is described and applied to a small groundwater dominated river in the UK. The results show that over 48% of the total main river was in a degraded state relative to a conceptual model of a natural reference state. Only 23% of the river was in a near‐natural state.  3.

By contrast. thermally homogeneous environments preclude behavioural thermoregulation. and ectotherms inhabiting these environments (particularly fish in which branchial respiration requires body temperature to follow water temperature) modify their biochemical capacities in response to long-term seasonal temperature fluctuations. Reptiles may also be active at seasonally varying body temperatures and could. therefore. gain selective advantages from regulating biochemical capacities.

While there is evidence that some crocodile populations may conform to this expectation. there is no compelling evidence that American alligator populations are female biased anywhere in the species' range. Previous data had indicated that some populations of juvenile and/or adult alligators were significantly male biased. However. these studies were criticized for sampling errors. Adult males typically occupy a different habitat from that of females. and males frequent areas where they are more likely to be caught. In contrast. in juveniles. both sexes occupy the same habitat.

In eukaryotic organisms. proteins are present as multiple isoforms as the result of variations in genetic code. alternative splicing. post-translational modification and other processing events. Understanding the identities and biological functions of these isoforms and how their concentrations vary across different states is the central goal of proteomics. To date. the bulk of proteomics research utilizes a “bottom-up” approach. digesting proteins into their more manageable constitutive peptides. but sacrificing information about the specific isoform and combinations of post-translational modifications present on the protein.

Trophoblasts can terminally differentiate to either extravillous trophoblasts or syncytiotrophoblasts. The signaling pathways that govern the terminal fate of these trophoblasts are not understood. We show that activin/nodal signaling switches the terminal fate of these hESC-derived trophoblasts.

Seattle, WA, USA",,,,Comprehensive proteomic analysis of tissues is only possible when the total protein constituency of cells and extracellular matrices is effectively isolated. The efficiency of sample preparation is therefore a critical component of the analytical process and is essential to reliable proteomic analyses. Cortical bone is extensively calcified osseous tissue and represents a specific challenge in sample preparation. Historically. bone requires prolonged acid demineralization over several days to enable complete penetration of histochemical reagents to cellular components. Ostrich tibia was used as a model for the release of protein and peptide from compact bone. Several acids (formic. acetic. and hydrochloric acid) were evaluated as demineralization reagents prior to the extraction of proteins from bone by pressure cycling technology (PCT). Bone samples were rapidly cycled 80 times between 35.000 psi and atmospheric pressure in a Barocycler. Differences in proteins and peptides released during demineralization with different acids were analyzed by protein assay and electrophoresis and compared to those released by the downstream PCT process. Without prior acid demineralization. PCT yielded more protein than demineralized samples. The ability to extract proteins from bone without prior demineralization offers an important advantage in time savings. Moreover. when working with fossil tissues. it may be assumed that protein remnants will be fragmented. highly cross-linked. or extensive demineralization of the bone has occurred. These conditions may have contributed to molecular damage. loss. or modification of proteins.

Historically. the largest count has been attributed to the iconic Elasmosaurus platyurus from the Late Cretaceous of Kansas. but estimates for the total neck series in this taxon have varied between published reports. Accurately determining the number of vertebral centra vis-à-vis the maximum length of the neck in plesiosaurians has significant implications for phylogenetic character designations. as well as the inconsistent terminology applied to some osteological structures. With these issues in mind. we reassessed the holotype of E. platyurus as a model for standardizing the debated cervical-dorsal transition in plesiosaurians. and during this procedure. documented a “lost” cervical centrum. Our revision also advocates retention of the term “pectorals” to describe the usually three or more distinctive vertebrae close to the cranial margin of the forelimb girdle that bear a functional rib facet transected by the neurocentral suture. and thus conjointly formed by both the parapophysis on the centrum body and diapophysis from the neural arch (irrespective of rib length). This morphology is unambiguously distinguishable from standard cervicals. in which the functional rib facet is borne exclusively on the centrum. and dorsals in which the rib articulation is situated above the neurocentral suture and functionally borne only by the transverse process of the neural arch.

Great disparity persists between the pattern suggested by the fossil record and that estimated by molecular clocks. especially for plants. animals. fungi. and the deepest branches of the eukaryote tree. Here. we used all available protein sequence data and molecular clock methods to place constraints on the increase in complexity through time. Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that (i) animals are more closely related to fungi than to plants. (ii) red algae are closer to plants than to animals or fungi. (iii) choanoflagellates are closer to animals than to fungi or plants. (iv) diplomonads. euglenozoans. and alveolates each are basal to plants+animals+fungi. and (v) diplomonads are basal to other eukaryotes (including alveolates and euglenozoans).

1187804,The number of replications needed for accurate estimation of the bootstrap P value in phylogenetic studies.,1992,S Blair Hedges,9,Molecular Biology and Evolution,2,366-369,,The bootstrap is a statistical method for obtaining a nonparametric estimate of error (Efron 1979. 1982). Felsenstein (1985) was the first to apply this method to phylogeny estimation. and his approach is now widely used. Taxa are held constant. and the characters (for sequence data. nucleotide or amino acid sites) are resampled randomly with replacement. A phylogeny is constructed from each replication of the data. and the frequency of appearance of particular phylogenetic groups (groups of alleles or taxa) among all of the trees constructed by this resampling is the bootstrap confidence limit. or bootstrap P value (BP). The BPS of different nodes within a tree can be used to assess the relative stability of those phylogenetic groups or. if applied strictly. to test their statistical significance (eg. at the 95% or 99% level). The application of bootstrapping to phylogeny estimation is a tradeoff between the maximum number of replications that can be performed by the researcher in a reasonable amount of time and the minimum number of replications needed for accurate estimation of the BP. The purpose of the present report is to explore the variance (and hence the accuracy) of the phylogenetic BP and to establish guidelines for efficient bootstrap sampling.BP is the proportion of trees containing a particular phylogenetic group. It therefore follows the binomial distribution. which has a variance of o2=[P (1-P)/n]. where P is the BP and II is the number of replications.

1187807,The timetree of life,2009,S Blair Hedges and Sudhir Kumar,,,,,OUP Oxford,The evolutionary history of life includes two primary components: phylogeny and timescale. Phylogeny refers to the branching order (relationships) of species or other taxa within a group and is crucial for understanding the inheritance of traits and for erecting classifications. However. a timescale is equally important because it provides a way to compare phylogeny directly with the evolution of other organisms and with planetary history such as geology. climate. extraterrestrial impacts. and other features. The Timetree of Life is the first reference book to synthesize the wealth of information relating to the temporal component of phylogenetic trees. In the past. biologists have relied exclusively upon the fossil record to infer an evolutionary timescale. However. recent revolutionary advances in molecular biology have made it possible to not only estimate the relationships of many groups of organisms. but also to estimate their times of divergence with molecular clocks. The routine estimation and utilization of these so-called'time-trees' could add exciting new dimensions to biology including enhanced opportunities to integrate large molecular data sets with fossil and biogeographic evidence (and thereby foster greater communication between molecular and traditional systematists). They could help estimate not only ancestral character states but also evolutionary rates in numerous categories of organismal phenotype; establish more reliable associations between causal historical processes and biological outcomes; develop a universally standardized scheme for biological classifications; and generally promote novel avenues of thought in many arenas …,True,tIpAgQkAAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC,436,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=9rt1c1hl49MC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:06Ap8nAUPnIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=PW-INcftCo&sig=U3SZ8siQJjWNgFNe1lfuR6pwDYM,8232039644211552467,/scholar?cites=8232039644211552467,,,0,0,0

It is unclear how to integrate data from many genes. each potentially evolving under a different model of substitution and at a different rate.

This inequity reflects the fact that feces generated by diets of flesh and bone (and other skeletal materials) contain chemical constituents that may precipitate out under certain conditions as permineralizing phosphates. Thus. although coprolites are usually less common than fossil bones. they provide a significant source of information about ancient patterns of predation. The identity of a coprolite producer often remains unresolved. but fossil feces can provide new perspectives on prey selection patterns. digestive efficiency. and the occurrence of previously unknown taxa in a paleoecosystem.

Over 130 fossil snails representing at least seven different taxa have been found on or within herbivorous dinosaur coprolites from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The terrestrial snail Megomphix is the most common taxon. but three other terrestrial taxa (Prograngerella. Hendersonia and Polygyrella) and three aquatic snails (Lioplacodes. ?Viviparus and a physid) also occur in coprolites. At least 46% of the shells in the faeces are whole or nearly so. indicating that most (if not all) of the snails were not ingested by dinosaurs. but were post‐depositional visitors to the dung pats.

Here we report the discovery of in situ terrestrial fossil burrows from just above the impact-defined Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary in southwestern North Dakota. The crisscrossing networks of horizontal burrows occur at the interface of a lignitic coal and silty sandstone. and reveal intense faunal activity within centimeters of the boundary clay. Estimated rates of sedimentation and coal formation suggest that the burrows were made less than ten thousand years after the end-Cretaceous impact. The burrow characteristics are most consistent with burrows of extant earthworms. Moreover. the burrowing and detritivorous habits of these annelids fit models that predict the trophic and sheltering lifestyles of terrestrial animals that survived the K/Pg extinction event. In turn. such detritus-eaters would have played a critical role in supporting secondary consumers.

With its glycosaminoglycuronan chain. it is responsible for stabilizing inter-fibrillar organization. Type I collagen is the predominant member of the fibrillar collagen family. fulfilling both organizational and structural roles in animal ECMs. In this study. interactions between decoron (the decorin core protein) and binding sites in the d and e1 bands of the type I collagen fibril were investigated through molecular modeling of their respective X-ray diffraction structures. Previously. it was proposed that a model-based. highly curved concave decoron interacts with a single collagen molecule. which would form extensive van der Waals contacts and give rise to strong non-specific binding. However. the large well-ordered aggregate that is the collagen fibril places significant restraints on modes of ligand binding and necessitates multi-collagen molecular contacts. We present here a relatively high-resolution model of the decoron-fibril collagen complex. We find that the respective crystal structures complement each other well. although it is the monomeric form of decoron that shows the most appropriate shape complementarity with the fibril surface and favorable calculated energies of interaction. One molecule of decoron interacts with four to six collagen molecules. and the binding specificity relies on a large number of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. primarily with the collagen motifs KXGDRGE and AKGDRGE (d and e1 bands).

The scaffolds consist of one of the pure self-assembling peptide scaffolds RADA16 through direct coupling to short biologically active motifs. The motifs are 2-unit RGD binding sequence PRG (PRGDSGYRGDS) and laminin cell adhesion motif PDS (PDSGR). RGD and laminin have been previously shown to promote specific biological activities including periodontal ligament fibroblasts adhesion. proliferation and protein production. Compared to the pure RADA16 peptide scaffold. we here show that these designer peptide scaffolds significantly promote human periodontal ligament fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate into the scaffolds (for ∼300 µm/two weeks).

The dinosaur peptides localized to fibril regions protected by the close packing of collagen molecules. and contained few acidic amino acids. Four peptides mapped to collagen regions crucial for cell-collagen interactions and tissue development. Dinosaur peptides were not represented in more exposed parts of the collagen fibril or regions mediating intermolecular cross-linking. Thus functionally significant regions of collagen fibrils that are physically shielded within the fibril may be preferentially preserved in fossils. These results show empirically that structure-function relationships at the molecular level could contribute to selective preservation in fossilized vertebrate remains across geological time. suggest a ‘preservation motif’. and bolster current concepts linking collagen structure to biological function.

Here we report a novel approach to measure the longitudinal component of the elastic moduli of biological fibers under conditions close to those found in vivo and apply it to type I collagen from rat tail tendon. This approach combines optical tweezers. atomic force microscopy. and exploits Euler-Bernoulli elasticity theory for data analysis. This approach also avoids drying for measurements or visualization. since samples are freshly extracted. Importantly. strains are kept below 0.5%. which appear consistent with the linear elastic regime. We find. surprisingly. that the longitudinal elastic modulus of type I collagen cannot be represented by a single quantity but rather is a distribution that is broader than the uncertainty of our experimental technique. The longitudinal component of the single-fiber elastic modulus is between 100 MPa and 360 MPa for samples extracted from different rats and/or different parts of a single tail. Variations are also observed in the fibril-bundle / fibril diameter with an average of 325±40 nm. Since bending forces depend on the diameter to the fourth power. this variation in diameter is important for estimating the range of elastic moduli. The remaining variations in the modulus may be due to differences in composition of the fibril-bundles. or the extent of the proteoglycans constituting fibril-bundles. or that some single fibrils may be of fibril-bundle size.,True,awVUJCMAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,59,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145711,18025231622650489475,/scholar?cites=18025231622650489475,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145711,0,0,0

There has been a particularly productive period recently. during which much progress has been made in better describing all aspects of collagen structure. However. there remain some questions regarding its helical symmetry and its persistence within the triple-helix. Previous considerations of this symmetry have sometimes confused the picture by not fully recognizing that collagen structure is a highly complex and large hierarchical entity. and this affects and is effected by the super-coiled molecules that make it. Nevertheless. the symmetry question is not trite. but of some significance as it relates to extracellular matrix organization and cellular integration. The correlation between helical structure in the context of the molecular packing arrangement determines which parts of the amino acid sequence of the collagen fibril are buried or accessible to the extracellular matrix or the cell. In this study. we concentrate primarily on the triple-helical structure of fibrillar collagens I and II. the two most predominant types. By comparing X-ray diffraction data collected from type I and type II containing tissues. we point to evidence for a range of triple-helical symmetries being extant in the molecules native environment.

Normal healthy joints maintain a balance between the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and the proteolytic degradation of damaged ones. In the case of RA. this balance is shifted toward matrix destruction due to increased production of cleavage enzymes and the presence of (autoimmune) immunoglobulins resulting from an inflammation induced immune response. Herein we demonstrate that a polyclonal antibody against the proteoglycan biglycan (BG) causes tissue destruction that may be analogous to that of RA affected tissues. The effect of the antibody is more potent than harsh chemical and/or enzymatic treatments designed to mimic arthritis-like fibril de-polymerization. In RA cases. the immune response to inflammation causes synovial fibroblasts. monocytes and macrophages to produce cytokines and secrete matrix remodeling enzymes. whereas B cells are stimulated to produce immunoglobulins. The specific antigen that causes the RA immune response has not yet been identified. although possible candidates have been proposed. including collagen types I and II. and proteoglycans (PG's) such as biglycan.

This is due in part to a poor understanding of how species respond to natural variation in environmental conditions within primary forest and how these conditions alter following anthropogenic disturbance. Within this context. the main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the gap and shade preferences of fruit‐feeding butterflies in primary forest in northern Borneo can be used to predict species’ responses to selective logging and thus explain changes in diversity and geographical distinctness in relation to habitat disturbance.  2 Overall. there was little difference in butterfly diversity between primary forest and forest that had been selectively logged 10–12 years previously.

While dispersal behaviour of many orders of winged insects has received a great deal of attention. the dispersal characteristics of odonates have been poorly documented.

To evaluate hypotheses that have been put forward to explain interspecific variation in the mimetic fidelity of Palearctic Syrphidae we use a comparative approach. We show that the most plausible explanation is that predators impose less selection for mimetic fidelity on smaller hoverfly species because they are less profitable prey items.

When cryptic forms of defended and undefended species were similar in appearance but their conspicuous forms were not. defended prey became conspicuous while undefended prey remained cryptic.

Two simulation models are presented which predict the impact of local and episodic applications of pesticide on the dynamics of invertebrate metapopulations. Both models assume that invertebrates disperse at particular rates over a matrix of fields and that each field experiences a specific pesticide regime. Model 1 investigates the population dynamics of a polyphagous predator which experiences direct mortality from pesticide exposure but is unaffected by the availability of the targeted pest. Model 2 investigates a similar system but also considers the dynamics of the pest. which is influenced both by predation and by pesticide exposure. 2. Using stability diagrams and isocline portraits we characterize the likely long-term effects of factors such as the frequency and extent of spraying. factors which have hitherto not been widely considered in general pesticide models.

Müller’s hypothesis was that unpalatable species evolve a similar appearance to reduce the mortality involved in training predators to avoid them. and he backed up his arguments with a mathematical model in which predators attack a fixed number (n) of each distinct unpalatable type in a given season before avoiding them. Here. I review what has since been discovered about Müllerian mimicry and consider in particular its relationship to other forms of mimicry. Müller’s specific model of associative learning involving a “fixed n” in a given season has not been supported. and several experiments now suggest that two distinct unpalatable prey types may be just as easy to learn to avoid as one.

To develop my case I consider how warning signals might coevolve in a system containing a number of predators. whose foraging behaviour is also subject to selection.

Here. we consider another explanation for sexual differences in coloration within species of the damselfly family Coenagrionidae (Odonata: Zygoptera). In many of these species. males are more brightly coloured than females and have different patterns. Yet they are nonterritorial and do not engage in displays: indeed. male competition for mates often resembles a scramble. We therefore argue that even if females show a degree of mate choice. then it is unlikely to be based on colour or pattern.

Conversely. a well‐fed predator might be expected to avoid attacking prey items that have a chance of being defended. particularly if there is an abundance of familiar palatable prey to support it. To further understand the implications of optimal state‐dependent foraging behaviour by predators in systems that contain defended prey. I developed a stochastic dynamic programming model. This state‐dependent approach formally accounts for the trade‐off between avoiding starvation and minimising harm from attacking defended prey. It predicts that the mean attack probability of predators on defended models and their undefended mimics should decline in a sigmoidal fashion with increasing availability of alternative undefended prey. and that the foraging decisions of predators should in general be relatively …,True,05Uw_XEAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,76,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12576.x,18184491146047355808,/scholar?cites=18184491146047355808,,,0,0,0
1187894,Living in groups,2002,Jens Krause and Graeme D Ruxton and Graeme Ruxton and Ibls Graeme Ruxton,,,,,Oxford University Press,Group Living is a widespread phenomenon within the animal kingdom and has attracted considerable attention in a number of different contexts. This book is focused on the unifying concepts regarding group behaviour that have been developed over the last two decades. The authors set out to discuss the mechanisms that govern the evolution and maintenance of grouping behaviour throughout the animal kingdom. and the ecological factors that control observed group size and group composition in particular situations. Although the book's emphasis is on the elaboration of a conceptual framework. extensive examples and case studies illustrate the diversity of grouping phemonema across taxonomic boundaries. and demonstrate the general applicability of the concepts involved.

We reveal the existence of major group-level behavioural transitions related to minor changes in individual-level interactions. Further. we present the first evidence for collective memory in such animal groups (where the previous history of group structure influences the collective behaviour exhibited as individual interactions change) during the transition of a group from one type of collective behaviour to another. The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure. and how individuals employing simple. local rules of thumb. can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre. the front. or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within …,True,pKpP5toAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1853,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519302930651,11433136721320958146,/scholar?cites=11433136721320958146,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.307.6742&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Importantly. circular variables are periodic in nature and the origin. or zero point. such as the beginning of a new year. is defined arbitrarily rather than necessarily emerging naturally from the system. This book will be of value both to those new to circular data analysis as well as those more familiar with the field. For beginners. the authors start by considering the fundamental graphical and numerical summaries used to represent circular data before introducing distributions that might be used to model them.

In this study. we investigated how the relative importance of these costs and benefits changes with increasing body length. This is of particular interest in animals such as fish. which show continuous growth throughout their lives. Our results suggest that larger fish are subject to lower predation risks and are less affected by food deprivation than small fish. with fish decreasing their responses to food–deprivation treatments more strongly with increasing body length than to predation treatments. This may explain our observation that large fish emerged later from a refuge than small ones and spent shorter times outside the refuge.

We use an energetic modelling approach to explore the constraints imposed by an obligate scavenging lifestyle. and to ask whether obligate scavengers must always be avian and generally large-bodied users of soaring flight. Our model found that aerial scavengers always out-competed postulated terrestrial ones. mainly because flight allows area to be searched much more rapidly for carrion. Soaring was favoured over flapping flight because the reduction in flight speed (and so rate of area search) was more than compensated for by the decrease in the costs of transport. Large individual size is selected for if carrion is available in large packages. when obligate scavenger feed only infrequently. and so must be able to survive on body reserves in the periods between discovering food falls.

1187914,Plant-animal communication,2011,H Martin Schaefer and Graeme D Ruxton,,,,,OUP Oxford,Communication is an essential factor underpinning the interactions between species and the structure of their communities. Plant-animal interactions are particularly diverse due to the complex nature of their mutualistic and antagonistic relationships. However the evolution of communication and the underlying mechanisms responsible remain poorly understood. Plant-Animal Communication is a timely summary of the latest research and ideas on the ecological and evolutionary foundations of communication between plants and animals. including discussions of fundamental concepts such as deception. reliability. and camouflage. It introduces how the sensory world of animals shapes the various modes of communication employed. laying out the basics of vision. scent. acoustic. and gustatory communication. Subsequent chapters discuss how plants communicate in these sensory modes to attract animals to facilitate seed dispersal. pollination. and carnivory. and how they communicate to defend themselves against herbivores. Potential avenues for productive theoretical and empirical research are clearly identified. and suggestions for novel empirical approaches to the study of communication in general are outlined.,True,pKpP5toAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC,172,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=4AU8HZ3Ib1cC&oi=fnd&pg=PT1&dq=info:tz2EMyM2SX0J:scholar.google.com&ots=gJWvGB_kLL&sig=PEVvi_4zJluQ8RhAnH2UCDZo3ls,9027806452856929719,/scholar?cites=9027806452856929719,,,0,0,0

The gambit of the group (GoG) is a simple and useful assumption for accumulating the data necessary for a network analysis. The gambit of the group implies that each animal in a group is associating with every other individual in that group. Sampling is an important issue for networks in wild populations collected assuming GoG. Due to time. effort. and resource constraints and the difficulty of tracking animals. sampled data are usually a subset of the actual network. Ecologists often use association indexes to calculate the frequency of associations between individuals. These indexes are often transformed by applying a filter to produce a binary network.

We study the dynamic effects of interference in the context of a structured population model and show that the stabilising effect of interference against paradox of enrichment cycles is unaffected by age-structure.

This approach highlighted the potential importance of glacial refugia in the extinction process. Even model refugia the size of the Italian peninsula did not guarantee persistence of a population over a 1000 yr time span. illustrating the role of chance in survival in such a refugium. An area the size of the largest Mediterranean island was unable to support a big cat population for a period of 1000 yr.

These factors will have impacted on both the distribution and dispersal patterns of large mammals (including hominins) within Iberia. and are considered in detail in this paper. There are two routes of mammalian dispersal into Iberia: across the Pyrenees and across the Gibraltar Strait.

1187933,The missing mushrooms: searching for fungi in ancient human dietary analysis,2016,Hannah J O'Regan and Angela L Lamb and David M Wilkinson,75,Journal of Archaeological Science,,139-143,Academic Press,Fungi are a common part of modern human diets. but are rarely discussed in an archaeological context. Power et al. (2015) published data on bolete spores in human tooth calculus. suggesting that Upper Palaeolithic peoples ate mushrooms. Here we briefly consider the likelihood of mushroom consumption in the past. and examine whether or not stable isotopes may provide a way of seeing this in archaeological populations. We also consider the complexities of fungal stable isotopes using our own data and that from the literature. We conclude that fungi are highly variable isotopically. and are an additional dietary factor that should be considered when trying to interpret ‘terrestrial’ carbon isotope signatures combined with relatively high nitrogen isotope values in humans and other animals. Substantial mushroom ingestion could. in some cases. result in isotope values that may be interpreted as considerable meat …,True,wX0JJxIAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,23,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440316301455,1630776606711183395,/scholar?cites=1630776606711183395,,http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/4735/3/The%20missing%20mushrooms%20searching%20for%20fungi%20in%20ancient%20human%20dietary%20analysis.pdf,0,0,0

South Africa.,2011,Hannah J O’Regan and Kathleen Kuman and Ronald J Clarke,9,Journal of Taphonomy,2,69-87,,The Cape porcupine. Hystrix africaeaustralis. is an acknowledged accumulator of bones in southern Africa. Here we examine porcupine accumulated material from five localities in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. including a re-analysis of the Nossob lair published by Brain (1981). These results are then compared to a Mid-Late Pleistocene assemblage (L/63) from Post-Member 6 at Sterkfontein. The taphonomic analyses indicate that porcupines are indiscriminate collectors of bones and other items. Unlike many other vertebrate bone accumulators porcupines do not appear to have a collection size bias. as the species represented in the assemblages range in body mass from> 0.14 kg to< 940kg. Not all bones collected had been gnawed. and we propose a threshold of> 60% gnawed bones is needed to establish that material has been collected by Cape porcupines rather than as a result of a number of other sources. Of the macrovertebrate component of the L/63 fossil assemblage. only 149 specimens exhibited porcupine gnawing (11%). while that number rose to 263 (6.97%) of the total NISP and fragment count (n= 3775).

The newly proposed method exhibits the following two attractive features. First. the switching gain is only required to be designed greater than the bound of the disturbance estimation error rather than that of the disturbance; thus. the chattering problem is substantially alleviated. Second. the proposed method retains its nominal performance. which means the proposed method acts the same as the baseline sliding-mode controller in the absence of uncertainties.

It is noticed that systems with nonintegral-chain form and mismatched uncertainties are more general and widely exist in practical engineering systems. where the standard ESOBC method is no longer available. To this end. it is imperative to explore new ESOBC approach for these systems to extend its applicability.

In this review. we address the phenyl-pyrazole fipronil together with neonicotinoids because of similarities in their toxicity. physicochemical profiles. and presence in the environment. Neonicotinoids and fipronil currently account for approximately one third of the world insecticide market; the annual world production of the archetype neonicotinoid. imidacloprid. was estimated to be ca. 20.000 tonnes active substance in 2010.

Neonicotinoids and fipronil are among the most widely used pesticides in the world. Their popularity is largely due to their high toxicity to invertebrates. the ease and flexibility with which they can be applied. their long persistence. and their systemic nature. which ensures that they spread to all parts of the target crop. However. these properties also increase the probability of environmental contamination and exposure of nontarget organisms. Environmental contamination occurs via a number of routes including dust generated during drilling of dressed seeds. contamination and accumulation in arable soils and soil water. runoff into waterways. and uptake of pesticides by nontarget plants via their roots or dust deposition on leaves.

The genus Sphagnum is one of the most important groups of plant species sequestrating carbon in temperate and northern bog ecosystems. because of the low decomposability of the dead material it produces. The effects of raised CO2 and increased atmospheric N deposition on growth of Sphagnum and other plants were studied in bogs at four sites across Western Europe. Contrary to expectations. elevated CO2 did not significantly affect Sphagnum biomass growth.

Despite this general rule. the amount of existing data on species distribution patterns is scarce. Testate amoebae (Protozoa; Rhizopoda) are an important component of soil microbial communities and are increasingly used in ecological and paleoecological studies of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. but data on the spatial structure of communities are completely lacking. This is an important aspect since quantitative models used for paleoecological reconstruction and monitoring are based on species assemblages.

We argue that this view is a relict of early classification schemes that lumped all amoebae together inside the ‘lower’ protozoa. separated from the ‘higher’ plants. animals and fungi. This artificial classification allowed microbial eukaryotes. including amoebae. to be dismissed as primitive. and implied that the biological rules and theories developed for macro-organisms need not apply to microbes. Eukaryotic diversity is made up of 70+ lineages. most of which are microbial. Plants. animals and fungi are nested among these microbial lineages.

There is some experimental evidence for differential preservation of some testate amoeba shell types over others. but it is unclear what. if any impact this has on palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. To investigate this issue we looked at palaeoecological evidence for the preservation of different shell types. We then investigated the possible impact of selective preservation on quantitative palaeoenvironmental inference. We first used existing palaeoecological data sets to assess the vertical patterns of relative abundance in four testate amoeba shell types: (1) shells made of secreted biosilica plates (idiosomes. e.g. Euglypha).

A fundamental criterion for evaluating geoengineering options is their climate cooling effectiveness. which we quantify here in terms of radiative forcing potential. We use a simple analytical approach. based on energy balance considerations and pulse response functions for the decay of CO2 perturbations. This aids transparency compared to calculations with complex numerical models. but is not intended to be definitive. It allows us to compare the relative effectiveness of a range of proposals. We consider geoengineering options as additional to large reductions in CO2 emissions.

The largest was the 2.8-ton browsing Diprotodon optatum. whereas the ∼100- to 130-kg marsupial lion. Thylacoleo carnifex. the world’s most specialized mammalian carnivore. and Varanus priscus. the largest lizard known. were formidable predators. Explanations for these extinctions have centered on climatic change or human activities. Here. we review the evidence and arguments for both. Human involvement in the disappearance of some species remains possible but unproven.

Here. we review the main historic drivers of extinctions on islands. patterns in extinction chronologies between islands. and the potential for restoring ecosystems through reintroducing extirpated species. While some extinctions have been caused by climatic and environmental change. most have been caused by anthropogenic impacts. We propose a general model to describe patterns in these anthropogenic island extinctions. Hunting. habitat loss and the introduction of invasive predators accompanied prehistoric settlement and caused declines of endemic island species. Later settlement by European colonists brought further land development. a different suite of predators and new drivers. leading to more extinctions. Extinctions alter ecological networks. causing ripple effects for islands through the loss of ecosystem processes. functions and interactions between species. Reintroduction of extirpated species can help restore ecosystem function and processes. and can be guided by palaeoecology.

Australia inferred from stable isotopes of marsupial tooth enamel,2013,Shaena Montanari and Julien Louys and Gilbert J Price,8,PLoS One,6,e66221,Public Library of Science,The Chinchilla Local Fauna is a diverse assemblage of both terrestrial and aquatic Pliocene vertebrates from the fluviatile Chinchilla Sand deposits of southeastern Queensland. Australia. It represents one of Australia's few but exceptionally rich Pliocene vertebrate localities. and as such is an important source of paleoecological data concerning Pliocene environmental changes and its effects on ecosystems. Prior inferences about the paleoenvironment of this locality made on the basis of qualitative observations have ranged from grassland to open woodland to wetland. Examination of the carbon and oxygen isotopes in the tooth enamel of marsupials from this site represents a quantitative method for inferring the paleoenvironments and paleoecology of the fossil fauna. Results from Chinchilla show that Protemnodon sp. indet. consumed both C3 and C4 photosynthesis plant types (mean δ13C = −14.5±2.0‰). and therefore probably occupied a mixed vegetation environment. Macropus sp. indet. from Chinchilla also consumed a mixed diet of both C3 and C4 plants. with more of a tendency for C4 plant consumption (mean δ13C = −10.3±2.3‰). Interestingly. their isotopic dietary signature is more consistent with tropical and temperate kangaroo communities than the sub-tropical communities found around Chinchilla today. Other genera sampled in this study include the extinct kangaroo Troposodon sp. indet. and the fossil diprotodontid Euryzygoma dunense each of which appear to have occupied distinct dietary niches.

To address the problem of the current lack of broad-scale cost-effective tools for land cover monitoring in complex savannah environments. we use a multi-scale approach to quantifying vegetation change in Kruger National Park (KNP). South Africa. We test whether medium spatial resolution satellite data (Landsat. existing back to the 1970s). which have pixel sizes larger than typical vegetation patches. can nevertheless capture the thematic detail required to detect woody encroachment in savannahs. We quantify vegetation change over a 13-year period in KNP. examine the changes that have occurred. assess the drivers of these changes. and compare appropriate remote sensing data sources for monitoring change. We generate land cover maps for three areas of southern KNP using very high resolution (VHR) and medium resolution satellite sensor imagery from February 2001 to 2014.

Examination of exclosure areas and potential environmental driver data suggests two mechanisms: elephant herbivory removing trees and at least one separate mechanism responsible for conversion of grassland to shrubs. theorised to be increasing atmospheric CO 2.

The structure of interaction networks for natural phage–bacteria communities offers insight into their coevolutionary origin. At small phylogenetic scales. observed communities typically show a nested structure. in which both hosts and phages can be ranked by their range of resistance and infectivity. respectively. A qualitatively different multi-scale structure is seen at larger phylogenetic scales; a natural assemblage sampled from the Atlantic Ocean displays large-scale modularity and local nestedness within each module.

1188082,Phage-induced diversification improves host evolvability,2013,Hywel TP Williams,13,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-17,BioMed Central,Bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria) are of key importance in ecological processes at scales from biofilms to biogeochemical cycles. Close interaction can lead to antagonistic coevolution of phage and their hosts. Selection pressures imposed by phage are often frequency-dependent. such that rare phenotypes are favoured; this occurs when infection depends on some form of genetic matching. Also. resistance to phage often affects host fitness by pleiotropy (whereby mutations conferring resistance affect the function of other traits) and/or direct costs of resistance mechanisms. Here a simple model of bacteria and bacteriophage coevolving in a resource-limited chemostat is used to study the effect of coevolving phage on the evolution of bacterial hosts. Density-dependent mortality from phage predation limits the density of any single bacterial strain. preventing competitive exclusion by faster-growing strains. Thus multiple strains can coexist by partitioning resources and stable high diversity is created by negative frequency-dependent selection from phage. Standing bacterial diversity promotes adaptation in dynamic environments. since it increases the likelihood of a pre-existing genotype being suited to altered conditions. In addition. frequency-dependent selection for resistance creates transient local trade-offs between growth rate and resistance that allow bacterial strains to adapt across fitness valleys.

In the absence of a population of competing biospheres. it has proved hard to find a robust evolutionary mechanism that would generate environmental regulation. It has been suggested that regulation must require altruistic environmental alterations by organisms and. therefore. would be evolutionarily unstable. This need not be the case if organisms alter the environment as a selectively neutral by-product of their metabolism. as in the majority of biogeochemical reactions. but a question then arises: Why should the combined by-product effects of the biota have a stabilizing. rather than destabilizing. influence on the environment?

Here we consider the use of social sensing for observing natural hazards. In particular. we present a case study that uses data from a popular social media platform (Twitter) to detect and locate flood events in the UK. In order to improve data quality we apply a number of filters (timezone. simple text filters and a naive Bayes ‘relevance’ filter) to the data. We then use place names in the user profile and message text to infer the location of the tweets. These two steps remove most of the irrelevant tweets and yield orders of magnitude more located tweets than we have by relying on geo-tagged data.

We measure VLE activity for students enrolled in 38 different credit-bearing modules. each of which are compulsory components of six degree programmes. Overall we find that high VLE activity is associated with high grades. but low activity does not necessarily imply low grades. Analysis of individual modules shows a wide range of relationships between the two quantities. Grouping module-level relationships by programme suggests that science-based subjects have a higher dependency on VLE activity. Considering learning design (LD). we find that VLE usage is more important in modules that adopt an instruction-based learning style.

However. node saturation effects in these networks can leave them insensitive to input and stop signals from propagating. Node saturation is related to the problems of hyper-excitation and quiescence in biological nervous systems. which are thought to be avoided through the existence of homeostatic plastic mechanisms. Analogous mechanisms are here implemented in a variety of CTRNN architectures and are shown to increase node sensitivity and improve signal propagation. with implications for robotics.

Natural selection can produce nutrient recycling at local scales and regulation of heterogeneous environmental variables at ecosystem scales. However. global-scale environmental regulation involves a temporal and spatial decoupling of effects from actors that makes conventional evolutionary explanations problematic. Instead. global regulation can emerge by a process of ‘sequential selection’ in which systems that destabilize their environment are short-lived and result in extinctions and reorganizations until a stable attractor is found. Such persistence-enhancing properties can in turn increase the likelihood of acquiring further persistence-enhancing properties through ‘selection by survival alone’. Thus.

Extreme and repeated founder effects raised genetic relatedness – and therefore the influence of kin selection on the individuals within a group. This was permissive for the evolution of some highly costly altruistic traits. including those for macroscopic differentiation. In some eukaryotic species. the harsh and fluctuating abiotic conditions made a macroscopic physiology advantageous. perhaps necessary. for collective survival.

The flask is seeded with a clonal population of ‘microbes’ that are subject to mutation on genetic loci that determine their nutrient uptake patterns. release patterns. and their effects on. and response to. other environmental variables. In contrast to existing models of life‐environment interaction. notably Daisyworld. what benefits the individual organisms is decoupled from their ‘global’ (system‐level) effects. A robust property of the model is the emergence of ecosystems that tend toward a state where nutrients are efficiently utilised and differentially recycled. with a correlated increase in total population.

However. information on the social impacts of natural hazards is often lacking.

We analyse social media posts associated with wildfires over several time periods and compare them with wildfire occurrence data derived from satellite-based remote sensing data and on-the-ground observations. For the whole of the contiguous United States. we find significant temporal correlations between wildfire-related social media activity and wildfire occurrence. but also that there is substantial variation in the strength of this relationship at smaller spatial scales (states and counties). We then explore the utility of social media for location of wildfire events. finding good evidence to support further development of such methods.

1188095,Homeostatic adaptive networks,2006,Hywel Thomas Parker Williams,,,,,,Homeostasis is constancy in the face of perturbation. The concept was originally developed to describe the fixed internal environment of an organism and this descriptive view of homeostasis has been prevalent in literature. However. homeostasis cal also be seen as the dynamic process of self-regulation and as such it is an organising principle by which systems adapt their behaviour over time. In this thesis we adopt this casual view of homeostasis and develop a theory of homeostatic adaptive systems.  We study homeostatic adaptive networks by looking at specific examples of homeo-static systems: the Homeostat. homeostatic plasticity in neural networks. and homeostatic regulation of the environment by the biota. Investigation of these cases studies forms the basis for the development of a generalised theory of homeostatic adaptive systems.   The Homeostat was an electromechanical device designed by W.A. Ross Ashby to demonstrate the principle of ultra stability. where the stability of a system requires homeostasis of essential variables. Ashby put forward a theory of mammalian learning as a process of homeostatic adaptation that was based on the idea of the ultra stable system. Here we develop a simulated Homeostat and explore its properties as a homeostatic adaptive system. looking at its ultra stable nature and its ability to adapt to external perturbations.

Here we consider whether evolutionary adaptations within ecosystems can trigger similar transitions. We use an individual‐based. evolutionary model of interconnected ecosystems to analyze nonlinear changes in global state resulting from local adaptations. Transitions between periods of stability occur when new traits arise that allow exploitation of under‐utilized resources. Subsequent rapid growth of the population carrying the new trait causes abrupt environmental change that drives incumbent species extinct. We call these transitions ‘evolutionary regime shifts’.

Planet habitability models traditionally focus on abiotic processes and neglect a biotic response to changing conditions on an inhabited planet. The Gaia hypothesis postulates that life influences the Earth's feedback mechanisms to form a self-regulating system. and hence that life can maintain habitable conditions on its host planet. If life has a strong influence. it will have a role in determining a planet's habitability over time. We present the ExoGaia model – a model of simple ‘planets’ host to evolving microbial biospheres.

We show that the testate amoeba communities of forested and open bog are markedly different with a very abrupt boundary at. or near. the vegetation ecotone. Changes along our transects suggest that tree encroachment may reduce the trophic level of testate amoeba communities and reduce the contribution of mixotrophic testate amoebae to primary production.

In this study we used conventional (microscopy-based) methods to characterise the diversity and estimate protist population sizes in soils from a variety of distinct habitats within Mere Sands Wood nature reserve in NW England.

Jagiellonian University and Polish Society of Cell Biology,This essay introduces the special issue of this journal on the ecology of soil protists. This issue marks approximately the first 100 years of soil protistology as a discipline as some of the first studies to show that protozoa were an important part of soil ecology took place at Rothamsted. in southern England. towards the end of the first decade of the twentieth century. Much of the work on soil protists-and indeed the papers in this special issue-concentrate on traditional protozoa. In addition it is now realised that slime molds (eumycetozoans) can potentially make an important contribution to the numbers and diversity of soil amoebae. We also argue that diatoms and other algae are likely important in soils and in need of more detailed study. By its nature microbiology (including soil protist ecology) is a science limited by technology-for example the subject could not really exist before the invention of the microscope.

Research on testate amoebae has increased dramatically in recent years but there are still large parts of the world which have seen very little research. Here we consider testate amoeba communities of the West Siberian Lowland. the world’s largest peatland region and therefore one of the largest potential habitats for testate amoebae. Extensive sampling identified 89 taxa and showed that testate amoeba communities are structured by their physical and biological environment. We identified significant relationships between amoeba communities and both moisture content and vegetation composition. Despite the assemblages containing many widely-distributed species. some taxa considered typical of peatlands (eg Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio) were comparatively rare or absent. paralleling findings further south in Asia. We suggest that testate amoebae in this region deserve further study and may have useful applications in palaeoecological reconstruction and as bioindicators of the impacts of oil and gas extraction.,True,QCDb9YoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,4,https://www.ejournals.eu/pliki/art/9996/pl,1376749965332346693,/scholar?cites=1376749965332346693,,https://www.ejournals.eu/pliki/art/9996/pl,0,0,0

Using Testate amoebae and Diatoms as model organisms. this study aimed at expanding the Wildlife Trust’s knowledge of biodiversity at its Mere Sands Wood Nature Reserve by describing and quantifying microbial diversity and distribution using traditional protist taxonomy based on morphology. The methods employed were similar to that adopted in the studies of macroscopic organisms. allowing for a comparison between the diversity of microscopic and previously studied macroscopic organisms.The results of this study highlighted the dramatic increase in species richness estimates by incorporating just two groups of eukaryotic microorganisms. Species richness was a useful measure of diversity and these results were largely consistent with diversity indices. Terrestrial soil and lake sediment microhabitats supported distinct assemblages of testate amoebae and diatom communities which enabled inferences to be made about the potential factors influencing microbial diversity and distribution in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Lower microbial diversity was found in lake sediment associated with invasive aquatic plants and native monocultures. Taxon richness and diversity varied between different microhabitats and also at the replicate scale within a 1m2 quadrat. further highlighting the small-scale variability in microbial communities. The lack of correlation between different microbial groups demonstrated the complexities in understanding the structure of microbial communities.

1188111,Microbial controls on carbon fluxes in forest-to-bog restoration,2020,Angela Creevy,,,,,,Northern temperate peatlands are globally efficient terrestrial carbon stores subject to large-scale afforestation in the 20th century. Afforestation of open peatland compromises their ability to function as a net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) and may become sources of CO₂ and other greenhouse gases (GHGs). Microorganisms control GHG fluxes through both direct (e.g. decomposition) and indirect (e.g. predation) and some are responsible for the fixation of atmospheric carbon. Forest-to-bog restoration aims to recover key ecosystem functions. however. there is little evidence to show whether restoration can recover microbial community structure and the carbon balance. Key knowledge gaps exist calling for further investigation from a range of different restoration techniques. sites and peatland types. This study provides empirical evidence on the balance between carbon uptake through photosynthesis and soil respiration. because this will essentially determine the C sink potential and inform policy and future management of these ecosystems. This project is highly applied. contributes novel data on the important role of microorganisms in forest-to-bog restoration and presents an annual gaseous C budget over a chronosequence of forest-to-bog restoration areas. This study is the first to highlight the potential of testate amoeba communities and functional traits as bioindicators of the progress of forest-to-bog restoration in both blanket and raised bog. Using a space for time substitution approach. findings here suggest forest-to-bog restoration can be beneficial for the carbon balance over timescales of around ten to fifteen years.

Fruits are among the most antioxidant-rich foods in nature and thus can be important dietary sources for combating oxidative stress in animals and humans. 2. Because fruits are pigmented by important plant antioxidants such as anthocyanins and carotenoids. frugivores may be able to gauge the antioxidant value of a fruit by its colour. However. although the importance of dietary antioxidants and oxidative stress is increasingly being acknowledged in evolutionary ecology. it is unknown whether animals can use visual signals to detect the presence of antioxidants in their food.3. We studied the colour and pigment content of 60 bird-dispersed fruits and used an avian eye model to assess the ability of birds to visually discriminate carotenoid and anthocyanin contents of fruits. We then tested whether the frugivorous European blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) preferentially consumes food containing anthocyanins.,True,uGQKfpkAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,149,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01363.x@10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435.ANTOX_2010,9927557526349509752,/scholar?cites=9927557526349509752,,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01363.x%4010.1111/%28ISSN%291365-2435.ANTOX_2010,0,0,0

Hypotheses based on innate consumer preferences have been tested and rejected. Though colour itself plays an important role in animal foraging. it is only one component of signals. Another major component are colour contrasts against background achieving the conspicuousness of signals. In order to evaluate which signal component determines consumers behaviour. we measured fruit colour and colour contrasts of 43 species against their natural background under ambient light conditions. Red and black fruits exhibit stronger contrasts and are therefore more conspicuous to consumers than fruits of other colours.

Species' morphology should therefore determine species' functional roles in ecological processes mediated by mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. We tested this assumption for Neotropical plant–bird mutualisms. We used a new analytical framework that assesses a species's functional role based on the analysis of the traits of its interaction partners in a multidimensional trait space.

A Wiley Company,Two recent hypotheses have proposed that non‐green plant colouration evolved as a defence against herbivores. either as protective colouration promoting handicap signals indicating plant fitness or by undermining their crypsis. The handicap hypothesis posits a co‐evolutionary process between plants and herbivores. whereas the anti‐crypsis hypothesis suggests that an arms race between insects and plants is the evolutionary mechanism. Both explanations assume that insects are the evolutionary origin causing plants' colouration. Here. we propose a different hypothesis. termed the “Defence Indication hypothesis”.

The detectability of visual signals increases with increasing contrasts between target and background. Contrasts consist of a chromatic aspect (color) and an achromatic aspect (light intensity). which are perceived separately by animals. To evaluate the relative importance of fruits’ chromatic and achromatic contrasts for the detection by avian fruit consumers we conducted an experiment with artificial fruits of four different colors in a tropical forest. We displayed the fruits against two different backgrounds. an artificial background and a natural one. because they differed in achromatic properties.

We tested two alternative models of the chemical defence of fruits for the contents of nutrients. phenols. and condensed tannins and the nutrient content pypothesis stating that nutrient rich fruits are preferably removed. The defence trade‐off hypothesis assumes that the retention of deterrent secondary metabolites in ripe fruits reflects a trade‐off between defence against pests and attraction of dispersers. The removal‐rate model of this hypothesis predicts a negative relationship of nutrients and levels of secondary compounds due to short persistence and thus low infection risk of fruits.

Plants can increase signal efficacy by enhancing chromatic (wavelength related) and/or achromatic (intensity related) contrasts between fruit and background. To assess how these contrasts determine the detectability of fruit signals. we conducted 2 experiments with free-flying crows (Corvus ossifragus) under seminatural conditions in a 2025 m2 aviary. Crows searched first for artificial red and black fruits and detected red fruits from a larger distance. Because artificial red fruits had higher chromatic and lower achromatic contrasts against foliage than artificial black fruits. crows apparently prioritized chromatic contrasts.

This book summarizes recent work to explore and understand the climate of the planet through a research program under the auspices of the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern. Switzerland. Some of the unique elements that are discussed are the anomalies with Venus’ surface temperature (the huge greenhouse effect causes the surface to rise to 460° C. without which would plummet as low as-40° C). its unusual lack of solar radiation (despite being closer to the Sun. Venus receives less solar radiation than Earth due to its dense cloud cover reflecting 76% back) and the juxtaposition of its atmosphere and planetary rotation (wind speeds can climb up to 200 m/s. much faster than Venus’ sidereal day of 243 Earth-days).,True,qkpOv1UAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,16,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=3LEvFw_GIvoC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:GwxPHR8c7yMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9TkEBtRJqW&sig=qp5UEd-UUEsiMfHE4NIgnIfXfGs,2589319230722608155,/scholar?cites=2589319230722608155,,,0,0,0
1188145,Can a global model reproduce observed trends in summertime surface ozone levels?,2012,Symeon Koumoutsaris and Isabelle Bey,12,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,15,6983-6998,Copernicus GmbH, Quantifying trends in surface ozone concentrations is critical for assessing pollution control strategies. Here we use observations and results from a global chemical transport model to examine the trends (1991–2005) in daily maximum 8-h average concentrations in summertime surface ozone at rural sites in Europe and the United States (US). We find a decrease in observed ozone concentrations at the high end of the probability distribution at many of the sites in both regions. The model attributes these trends to a decrease in local anthropogenic ozone precursors. although simulated decreasing trends are overestimated in comparison with observed ones. The low end of observed distribution show small upward trends over Europe and the western US and downward trends in Eastern US. The model cannot reproduce these observed trends. especially over Europe and the western US. In particular. simulated changes between the low and high end of the distributions in these two regions are not significant. Sensitivity simulations indicate that emissions from far away source regions do not affect significantly summer ozone trends at both ends of the distribution in both Europe and US. Possible reasons for discrepancies between observed and simulated trends are discussed.,True,qkpOv1UAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,15,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/12/6983/2012/,12680351165394715660,/scholar?cites=12680351165394715660,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/12/6983/2012/acp-12-6983-2012.pdf,0,0,0

The net radiation to space for the present climate agrees well with data from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) over the northern polar region but shows an underestimation in planetary albedo for the southern polar region. This suggests there are systematic errors in the atmospheric circulation or in the net surface energy fluxes in the southern polar region. The simulation of the future climate is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B scenario.

These ‘short-term’ feedbacks correspond to both external changes in the forcing [from greenhouse gases (GHGs). aerosols etc.] and internal climate variations [mostly due to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)]. They differ from the ‘long-term’ (century scale. mainly due to GHG warming) feedbacks both in magnitude (by 24% on the global average) and geographical distribution. according to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 multi-model dataset. In addition. the inter-model spread of the short-term feedbacks is larger than the long-term ones even for the models with the best ENSO performance. which indicates that important aspects of the ENSO variability are still poorly understood and/or simulated.

Since the middle of the 19th century there has been an increase of sea level height by 20-25 cm. Some 10 cm of this is due to net losses from glaciers. the remainder being due to mass losses from land ice and thermal expansion of the oceans. The mean sea level rise is slowly accelerating; at present it is some 3 mm/year. Recent space observations made by the GRACE satellite combined with ocean temperature and volume measurements have enabled the separate contributions to sea level rise from melting ice and from thermal expansion to be better estimated. The estimation of mean sea level change is complicated by changes in land level due to tectonic effects and to ongoing changes following the most recent major glaciation.

1188149,A hazard model of sub-freezing temperatures in the United Kingdom using vine copulas,2019,Symeon Koumoutsaris,19,Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,3,489-506,Copernicus GmbH, Extreme cold weather events. such as the winter of 1962/63. the third coldest winter ever recorded in the Central England Temperature record. or more recently the winter of 2010/11. have significant consequences for the society and economy. This paper assesses the probability of such extreme cold weather across the United Kingdom (UK). as part of a probabilistic catastrophe model for insured losses caused by the bursting of pipes. A statistical model is developed in order to model the extremes of the Air Freezing Index (AFI). which is a common measure of the magnitude and duration of freezing temperatures. A novel approach in the modelling of the spatial dependence of the hazard has been followed which takes advantage of the vine copula methodology. The method allows complex dependencies to be modelled. especially between the tails of the AFI distributions. which is important to assess the extreme behaviour of such events. The influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation and of anthropogenic climate change on the frequency of UK cold winters has also been taken into account. According to the model. the occurrence of extreme cold events. such as the 1962/63 winter. has decreased approximately 2 times during the course of the 20th century as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore. the model predicts that such an event is expected to become more uncommon. about 2 times less frequent. by the year 2030. Extreme cold spells in the UK have been found to be heavily modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as well. A cold event is estimated to be ≈3–4 times more likely to occur during its negative phase …,True,qkpOv1UAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/19/489/2019/,,,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/19/489/2019/,0,0,0

1188157,Interannual variability in tropospheric ozone and its precursors,2008,Symeon Koumoutsaris,,,THESIS,,EPFL,Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a harmful pollutant and an increasingly important green-house gas. Tropospheric O3 distributions are determined by complex and non-linear interactions between photochemistry and transport processes. The first objective of this thesis is to examine the factors that contribute to the interannual variation (IAV) of tropospheric O3 and related compounds. such as carbon monoxide (CO). for a period of 19 years (1987-2005). with a focus over the northern mid-latitudes. A series of long-term measurements. including ozonesondes. groud-based sites and satellites. are interpreted with a global chemical-transport model (GEOS-Chem) and a number of sensitivity simulations are performed to quantitatively assess the relative contribution of individual processes to the IAV of O3 and CO. We first assess the capability of the model to reproduce O3 and CO IAV. We find that the model is able to reproduce reasonably well many of the observed features of the O3 and CO IAV. The model however. fails to reproduce the observed variation in O3 in the northern mid-latitudes during the first half of the 1990s (negative anomaly in 1991-1993 followed by an upward trend in 1993-1996) which is likely due to an inadequate representation of stratospheric dynamics and stratospheric O3 concentrations in the model. This study has demonstrated that the principal drivers of O3 and CO IAV are meteorology and emissions. We examine in particular the 1998-1999 period. A large anomaly in O3 was observed at several sites over Europe and is fairly well reproduced by the model. Different processes are found to contribute to this long-lasting anomaly …,True,qkpOv1UAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/115108,,,,,0,0,0

Lines 5–7:“The uncertainty intervals in the historical data are computed as the 5th and 95th quantile of the probability density function (Folland and Anderson. 2002)”). The probability distribution function is the integral of the probability density function (if it exists).

The two approaches used have been based on using 1) hyperaccumulator species. such as Thlaspi caerulescens (Pb. Zn. Cd. Ni). Alyssum spp. (Ni.

Until we have advanced much more along the pathway of genetic isolation and transfer of hyperaccumulator traits into productive plants. there is a high risk in marketing either approach as a technology or stand-alone solution to clean up contaminated land.

L. and Dickinson. N.M. Toxicity of copper to Quercus robur (English Oak) seedlings. ––Acorns were germinated after collection from a mature Q. robur woodland at an historic copper mine site in Cheshire. England. and from an uncontaminated reference site. Hydroponic screening trials of seedlings using 0.5 mg Cu l−1 in 25% Hoagland's solution found no growth differences between sites of origin that indicated tolerance. Copper accumulated in the roots. with restricted transport to foliage. Prolonged exposure caused gross perturbations of root morphology. reduced root and shoot growth. and leaf chlorosis. Pre-exposure of seedlings to low levels of copper and repeated exposure provided little evidence for acclimation to the metal.

Temporarily flooded habitats are an unpredictable environment for plants. and for some species the only chance they have of surviving is the formation of persistent seed banks. Astragalus contortuplicatus is an annual species of periodically flooded habitats and is considered an endangered species in Hungary. Altogether 1993 seeds of this species were tested in a germination experiment: 1200 were freshly harvested and 793 were collected from herbarium specimens of various ages. Seed viability was tested using the germination method. The freshly harvested seeds were used for selecting the best out of seven frequently used dormancy-breaking methods for this species. The highest percentage of germination was recorded for the combined treatment of scarification and light. Thus. this method was used to test the viability of the seeds collected from herbarium specimens. The oldest seeds that germinated were 131 years old. Until now there are no records of seeds of herbaceous legumes germinating that are more than 100 years old. This record is the 9th oldest of all the literature records of viable seeds originating from biological collections.

Astragalus contortuplicatus (Fabaceae),2015,Ádám Lovas-Kiss and Judit Sonkoly and Orsolya Vincze and Andy J Green and Attila Takács and AV Molnár,84,Acta Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae,3,,-,It was proposed previously that passive dispersal by migratory aquatic birds explain the widespread distribution of many wetland organisms. Several experimental studies have shown that many widespread wetland plant species can be readily dispersed within the guts of Anatidae. However. it is unclear whether plants with a more restricted distribution are able to disperse via waterbirds. This paper addresses the dispersal ability and germination ecology of the little-known Hungarian milkvetch Astragalus contortuplicatus. which occurs on banks of continental rivers and has a limited and unpredictable distribution. To test whether limited capacity for endozoochory by waterfowl could explain the sporadic appearance of this species. we force-fed ten captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with 100 milkvetch seeds each. Droppings were collected for up to 45 h after feeding. Intact and viable seeds were found in the droppings of each mallard. and altogether 24.7% of seeds fed were recovered intact. The proportion of retrieved seeds that germinated (27.0%) was significantly higher than that of untreated control seeds (0.5%). but significantly lower than that of mechanically scarified seeds (96.0%). Retrieved seeds that germinated developed into healthy mature plants. Given the average flight velocity of mallards. seeds of A. contortuplicatus may travel up to 1600 km inside the digestive tract of migrating individuals. Our results suggest that avian vectors may be more important for the dispersal of rare higher plants (especially those with a hard seed-coat) than hitherto considered.

Their highly fragmented remnants are often preserved in man-made or human-influenced habitats (eg. kurgans. roadside verges or cemeteries). In recent decades the significance of cemeteries as suitable habitats for preserving native and rare species has been repeatedly emphasized. However. the effect of modern management practices on long-term persistence of grassland species has remained largely unexplored. Sternbergia colchiciflora Waldst. & Kit. is one of the very few threatened dry grassland specialists whose occurrence in the cemeteries of the Pannonian Basin has been known for more than a century. This hysteranthous. myrmecochorous geophyte is considered rare or sporadic within its whole distribution range. In a systematic botanical survey we investigated 154 cemeteries in the Pannonian part of its distribution area. Despite modern management of cemeteries. characterised by frequent and intensive motorised lawn mowing. we found populations of S. colchiciflora at 27 Hungarian localities and confirmed three formerly known occurrences in Serbia. To study the effect of regular mowing on the long-term survival prospects of S. colchiciflora populations. we quantified the species’ seed production (capsular seed number) in 9 mown and 15 unmown sites (290 and 235 specimens. respectively).

1188203,Beyond scatter-hoarding and frugivory: European corvids as overlooked vectors for a broad range of plants,2019,Andy J Green and Johan Elmberg and Ádám Lovas-Kiss,7,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,,133,Frontiers,It is well known that some members of the crow family (Corvidae) are important for seed dispersal either via frugivory (e.g. when feeding on berries) or by scatter hoarding (e.g. of nuts). Dispersal via gut passage of seeds within a fleshy fruit can be considered “classical endozoochory”. However. corvids are rarely recognized as vectors of plants lacking a fleshy fruit. or a large nut (such as plants with a dry achene. capsule or caryopsis). Dispersal of such seeds via gut passage can be considered “non-classical endozoochory”. A century ago. Heintze (1917a.b. 1918) reported on extensive field studies of seed dispersal by 11 species of European Corvidae. His work is overlooked in contemporary reviews of corvid biology. We resurrect his work. which suggests that contemporary views about seed dispersal by corvids are too narrow. Heintze identified 157 plant taxa from 42 families which were dispersed by corvids by endozoochory. as well as another nine taxa only dispersed by synzoochory (which includes scatter-hoarding). Most (54%) of the plant species dispersed by endozoochory lack a fleshy fruit and have previously been assigned to other dispersal syndromes. mainly associated with wind (10%). self-dispersal (22%) or epizoochory (18%). Plants lacking a fleshy fruit were particularly well represented from the Caryophyllaceae (12 species). Poaceae (14 species) and Polygonaceae (8 species). Of 27 taxa germinated by Heintze from seeds extracted from corvid pellets or faeces (71% of those tested). 20 lack a fleshy fruit.

Mallards were introduced to New Zealand in the late 1800s. and today they are the most abundant and widespread waterfowl in the country. To assess seed dispersal. we radiomarked 284 female mallards from two study sites during the pre-breeding (June–August) and breeding (August–December) periods in 2014–2015. and examined movements that occurred within 24. 48 or 72 h when seed dispersal by endozoochory is considered likely. During June and July 2015. we collected 29 faecal samples from individual female mallards during radiomarking and 24 samples from mallard flocks. We recovered 69 intact seeds from the faecal samples and identified 12 plant taxa. Of the plant seeds identified and dispersed by mallards in this study. 40% were members of the Asteraceae family. nine plant species were alien to New Zealand. and the indigenous-status of three unidentified taxa could not be determined. Two taxa (and 9% of seeds) were germinated following gut passage: an unidentified Asteraceae and Solanum nigrum. During the pre-breeding and breeding periods. movement of females within 24 h averaged 394 m (SD = 706 m) and 222 m (SD = 605 m) respectively. with maximum distances of 3.970 m and 8.028 m.

This syndrome has led diaspore fleshiness to be emphasized as the exclusive indicator of endozoochory in much of the ecology and biogeography research. Crucially. however. endozoochory in nature is not limited to frugivory. and diaspores without “external flesh” are commonly dispersed. often over long distances. via birds and mammals by granivory. A key question is: are such diaspores somehow less prepared from an architectural point of view to survive gut passage than fleshy diaspores? To answer this question. we selected 11 European angiosperm taxa that fall outside the classical endozoochory syndrome yet are known to be dispersed via endozoochory. We studied their seed coat/pericarp morphology and anatomy both before and after gut passage through granivorous waterfowl. and determined their seed survival and germinability. We found no fundamental differences in the mechanical architecture of the seed coat and pericarp between these plants dispersed by granivory and others dispersed by frugivory. Neither diaspore traits per se. nor dormancy type. were strong predictors of diaspore survival or degree of damage during gut passage through granivores. or of the influence of gut passage on germinability. Among our 11 taxa. survival of gut passage is enabled by the thick cuticle of the exotesta or epicarp; one or several lignified cell layers; and diverse combinations of other architectural elements.

The biotic connection through dispersal mechanisms among wetlands is of primary importance to wetland management and policies. However. traditional wetland conservation approaches are based on the preservation of isolated sites considered to be of special importance (typically owing to their importance for concentrations of migratory waterbirds). Research linking local species richness and bird migration suggests that the effect of wetland loss on regional diversity might be much larger than what would be expected from direct habitat loss. Since the biotic connection among wetlands serviced by waterbirds appears to be more efficient within a limited range. the distribution of wetlands in space is a key aspect determining wetland connectedness even in the absence of direct hydrologic links …,True,wTg9HCcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,317,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X02011529,5263491872410462895,/scholar?cites=5263491872410462895,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/43044/3/actoecamezaga02.doc.txt,0,0,0

1188231,Positive allometry is likely with mate choice. competitive display and other functions,1992,Andy J Green,43,Animal Behaviour,1,170-172,Academic Press,Petrie (1988) argued that structures important in displaying competitive ability between individuals should be developed in a positively allometric manner in species where large animals usually win fights. with larger animals developing relatively larger structures. as with the frontal shield of the moorhen. Gallinula chloropus. Petrie’s reasoning is that animals of low competitive ability have little to gain from paying the costs of developing a large structure because any structure advertising low ability will do little to reduce the number and! or intensity of contests. In contrast. characters important in mate choice are considered unlikely to be positively allometric. Referring to moorhen shields. Petrie said ‘If shields were important in mate choice it is hard to see why they should be positively allometric. since it would pay all individ uals to invest maximally in structures that advertise their quality as mates. and this would result in shields being isometric.’In my view. positive allometry will often occur in characters used in mate choice or with various other functions. and is therefore not evidence that a character is used to display competitive ability. As animals grow. they will partition investment into both bodies and characters so that bigger animals have bigger characters. How much bigger they are will depend on both the costs and benefits of a larger body size. and the costs and benefits of a larger character. The key question is. as an animal acquires more resources to invest in growth. how much should it invest in the character and how much in body size? Positive allometry will result if the net benefit of larger characters increases faster than the net benefit of …,True,wTg9HCcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,177,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/45270/1/animbeh92.doc,8717836864916677577,/scholar?cites=8717836864916677577,,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/45270/1/animbeh92.doc,0,0,0

We studied the gut contents of 42 teals Anas crecca collected in the Camargue. southern France. and found intact seeds of 16 species. There was no relationship between the probability that a given seed species was found intact in the lower gut. and the seed hardness or size. The number of seeds found in the oesophagus and gizzard (a measure of ingestion rate) was the only significant predictor of the occurrence of intact seeds in the lower gut. so studies of waterfowl diet can be used as surrogates of dispersal potential.

While the structure of carotenoids. especially the conjugated double bond system. gives rise to many of the fundamental properties of these molecules. it also affects how these molecules are incorporated into biological membranes. This. in turn. alters the way these molecules interact with reactive oxygen species. so that the in vivo behavior may be quite different from that seen in solution. The effectiveness of carotenoids as antioxidants is also dependent upon their interaction with other coantioxidants. especially vitamins E and C.

It is proposed that in excess light the decrease in the thylakoid lumen pH causes an increase in aggregation of the light harvesting complexes of photosystem II resulting in formation of an efficient pathway for non-radiative dissipation of excitation energy. The aggregation is potentiated by the conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin.

1188244,The photoprotective role of carotenoids in higher plants,1991,Andrew John Young,83,Physiologia Plantarum,4,702-708,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Carotenoids have two important roles in photosynthetic organisms. First. they act as accessory light‐harvesting pigments. effectively extending the range of light absorbed by the photosynthetic apparatus. Secondly. they perform an essential photoprotective role by quenching triplet state chlorophyll molecules and scavenging singlet oxygen and other toxic oxygen species formed within the chloroplast. Only recently an additional. novel. protective role has been proposed for the carotenoid zeaxanthin. involving the dissipation of harmful excess excitation energy under stress conditions. Zeaxanthin may be formed through de novo synthesis in response to long‐term environmental stress. and through the rapid enzymic de‐epoxidation of the carotenoid violaxanthin (the xanthophyll cycle) in response to short‐term alterations in the plant's light environment.

Under conditions of low light intensity violaxanthin. a carotenoid possessing nine conjugated double bonds. functions as an antenna pigment by transferring energy from its lowest excited singlet state to that of chlorophylla within light-harvesting proteins. When the light intensity increases. violaxanthin is biochemically transformed into zeaxanthin. a carotenoid that possesses eleven conjugated double bonds. The results presented here show that extension of the ⧄ conjugation of the polyene lowers the energy of the lowest excited singlet state of the carotenoid below that of chlorophylla. As a consequence zeaxanthin can act as a trap for the excess excitation energy on chlorophylla pigments within the protein. thus regulating the flow of energy within photosynthetic light-harvesting proteins.,True,jos5eNsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,455,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02183041,887086720606532693,/scholar?cites=887086720606532693,,,0,0,0

A method is described whereby the saturated capacity for rapidly reversible non‐photochemical quenching can be compared between plant species. This method was applied to 22 common British plant species whose habitat was quantified using an index that describes shade tolerance.

The cycle is thought to be one of the main avenues for safely dissipating excitation energy absorbed by plants in excess of that needed for photosynthesis. One of the key factors needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the potentially damaging excess energy is dissipated is the energy of the lowest excited singlet (S1) state of the xanthophyll pigments.

This is observed as the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. which has been suggested to result from an alteration in the structure and function of the chlorophyll a/b light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II (LHCII) due to the combined effects of protonation and the de-epoxidation of bound violaxanthin to form zeaxanthin. In agreement with this hypothesis. it is shown that the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins purified from spinach leaves exhibit pH-stimulated quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence; this quenching shares all the key features observed for the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence in vivo.

The ways in which agricultural biodiversity may be increased to favour pest management are examined. At the simplest level. the structure within a monoculture may be altered by changing management practices to benefit natural enemies. At the other extreme. annual and perennial non-crop vegetation may be integrated with cropping. and biodiversity increased at the landscape level. 2. The existence of a hierarchy for the types of benefits of increased biodiversity is discussed. Vegetational diversity can lead to suppression of pests via ‘top-down’ enhancement of natural enemy populations and by resource concentration and other ‘bottom-up’ effects acting directly on pests.

Ecologists and conservationists often appreciate the contribution of natural habitat to biodiversity and potential ecosystem services such as biological pest control. whereas many farmers see habitat remnants as a waste of cropland or source of pests. While natural habitat has been shown to increase pest control in many systems. we here identify five hypotheses for when and why natural habitat can fail to support biological pest control. and illustrate each with case studies from the literature: (1) pest populations have no effective natural enemies in the region. (2) natural habitat is a greater source of pests than natural enemies. (3) crops provide more resources for natural enemies than does natural habitat.

While general. review texts are readily available in other fields. recent publications in Ecology have tended for the most part to be small. specialised works on single aspects of the subject. Such general texts as are available are often rather too detailed and. in addition. tend to be somewhat biased towards one aspect of the discipline or another and are thus not truly balanced syntheses of current knowledge. Ecology is. in addition. a rapidly developing subject: new information is being gathered all the time on a variety of key questions; new approaches and techniques open up whole new areas of research and establish new principles. Already things have changed radically since the early'70s and we feel there is a need for an up to date student text that will include some of this newer material. We have tried. therefore. to create a text that will review all the major principles and tenets within the whole field of Ecology. presenting the generally accepted theories and fundamentals and reviewing carefully the evidence on which such principles have been founded. While recent developments in ecological thought are emphasised. we hope that these will not dominate the material to the extent where the older-established principles are ignored or overlooked.,True,Ro2MVGIAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C,281,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MTPpCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA14&dq=info:eNr8x4RqcnQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=uGGcQhrwcC&sig=95msQa1MNFiksvm1B7e_Hv9rFmU,8390886174268119672,/scholar?cites=8390886174268119672,,,0,0,0

Here. we detail three large well-preserved zooarchaeological assemblages from Kanjera South. Kenya. The assemblages date to ∼2.0 Ma. pre-dating all previously published archaeofaunas of appreciable size. At Kanjera. there is clear evidence that Oldowan hominins acquired and processed numerous. relatively complete. small ungulate carcasses. Moreover. they had at least occasional access to the fleshed remains of larger. wildebeest-sized animals. The overall record of hominin activities is consistent through the stratified sequence – spanning hundreds to thousands of years – and provides the earliest archaeological evidence of sustained hominin involvement with fleshed animal remains (i.e.. persistent carnivory). a foraging adaptation central to many models of hominin evolution.,True,JKuZZ98AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,165,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062174,2220980027084907344,/scholar?cites=2220980027084907344,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062174,0,0,0

Whereas the deep sea record of global climatic change provides indirect evidence for an increase in C4 vegetation with a shift towards a cooler. drier and more variable global climatic regime beginning approximately 3 million years ago (Ma). evidence for grassland-dominated ecosystems in continental Africa and hominin activities within such ecosystems have been lacking.  Methodology/Principal Findings We report stable isotopic analyses of pedogenic carbonates and ungulate enamel. as well as faunal data from ∼2.0 Ma archeological occurrences at Kanjera South. Kenya. These document repeated hominin activities within a grassland-dominated ecosystem.  Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate what hitherto had been speculated based on indirect evidence: that grassland-dominated ecosystems did in fact exist during the Plio-Pleistocene. and that early Homo was active in open settings. Comparison with other Oldowan occurrences indicates that by 2.0 Ma hominins. almost certainly of the genus Homo. used a broad spectrum of habitats in East Africa. from open grassland to riparian forest.

Kenya,1996,Sally McBrearty and Laura Bishop and John Kingston,30,Journal of Human Evolution,6,563-580,Academic Press,New research in the Kapthurin Formation. Kenya. suggests a greater degree of variability in hominid behavior during the late Middle Pleistocene than has previously been suspected. The Middle Pleistocene commences with the shift from reversed to normal magnetic polarity at about 780 ka. and ends at the beginning of the last interglacial. at approximately 130 ka (Butzer & Isaac. 1975; Imbrie & Imbrie. 1980; Berger et al.. 1984; Martinson et al.. 1987; Cande & Kent. 1992; Baksi et al.. 1992). Homo erectus was replaced in Africa around 500 ka by hominids termed archaic Homo sapiens. Anatomically modern H. sapiens is represented by fossil evidence dating to ca. 130 ka from East Africa and by fossils dating to at least 90 ka from South Africa (Day & Stringer. 1982; Stringer & Andrews. 1988; Grün & Stringer. 1991; Foley & Lahr. 1992; Deacon. 1993). Statistical principles suggest that known age range is in part a function of sample size. and it has been empirically demonstrated that expanded sample sizes can affect first and last appearance data for both vertebrate and invertebrate fossil taxa. including hominoids (Strauss & Sadler. 1989; Marshall. 1990; Springer. 1990; Hill. 1987; Flynn et al.. 1995). Due to the extremely small size of the early anatomically modern H. sapiens sample. it is unlikely that the dates of 130 ka or 90 ka represent the true first appearance of modern humans in Africa. Evidence for the processes leading to the last major event in human evolution. the origin of modern humans. must therefore be sought in the late Middle Pleistocene.A conspicuous late Middle Pleistocene archaeological event in Africa is the end of the Earlier …,True,JKuZZ98AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,76,https://www.academia.edu/download/51386537/McBrearty_S._Bishop_L._C.__Kingston_J._V20170116-14390-17ixloz.pdf,11042287199620541979,/scholar?cites=11042287199620541979,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51386537/McBrearty_S._Bishop_L._C.__Kingston_J._V20170116-14390-17ixloz.pdf,0,0,0

We show how active tectonics can produce dynamic landscapes with geomorphological and topographic features that may be critical to long-term patterns of hominin land use. but which are not typically addressed in landscape reconstructions based on existing geological and paleoenvironmental principles. We describe methods of representing topography at a range of scales using measures of roughness based on digital elevation data. and combine the resulting maps with satellite imagery and ground observations to reconstruct features of the wider landscape as they existed at the time of hominin occupation and activity.

1188331,Stat-tracks and mediotypes: powerful tools for modern ichnology based on 3D models,2018,Matteo Belvedere and Matthew R Bennett and Daniel Marty and Marcin Budka and Sally C Reynolds and Rashid Bakirov,6,PeerJ,,e4247,PeerJ Inc.,Vertebrate tracks are subject to a wide distribution of morphological types. A single trackmaker may be associated with a range of tracks reflecting individual pedal anatomy and behavioural kinematics mediated through substrate properties which may vary both in space and time. Accordingly. the same trackmaker can leave substantially different morphotypes something which must be considered in creating ichnotaxa. In modern practice this is often captured by the collection of a series of 3D track models. We introduce two concepts to help integrate these 3D models into ichnological analysis procedures. The mediotype is based on the idea of using statistically-generated three-dimensional track models (median or mean) of the type specimens to create a composite track to support formal recognition of a ichno type. A representative track (mean and/or median) is created from a set of individual reference tracks or from multiple examples from one or more trackways. In contrast. stat-tracks refer to other digitally generated tracks which may explore variance. For example. they are useful in: understanding the preservation variability of a given track sample; identifying characteristics or unusual track features; or simply as a quantitative comparison tool. Both concepts assist in making ichnotaxonomical interpretations and we argue that they should become part of the standard procedure when instituting new ichnotaxa. As three-dimensional models start to become a standard in publications on vertebrate ichnology. the mediotype and stat-track concepts have the potential to help guiding a revolution in the study of vertebrate ichnology and ichnotaxonomy.,True,C4k_mFkAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,21,https://peerj.com/articles/4247,614529501921537862,/scholar?cites=614529501921537862,,https://peerj.com/articles/4247,0,0,0

Nyctereutes procyonoides. is found in eastern Asia and parts of Europe. In southern Africa. only one fossil species of raccoon dog has been identified - Nyctereutes terblanchei. N. terblanchei is recognised from a handful of Plio-Pleistocene sites in South Africa: Kromdraai. Kromdraai-Coopers and Sterkfontein in Gauteng. as well as Elandsfontein in the Western Cape Province. The validity of this species identification was questioned on the basis of the rarity of southern African fossils assigned to Nyctereutes. that is. fewer than 10 specimens have been identified as Nyctereutes. This study examined this fossil sample of the raccoon dog from the Gauteng sites and compared dental and cranial metrics of the fossil with samples of modern canids and published data. Morphological traits used to distinguish Nyctereutes. such as the pronounced subangular lobe on the mandible and the relatively large size of the lower molars. were observed to be variable in all samples. Analysis showed that the size of the dentition of the southern African fossil samples was larger than that of living raccoon dogs. but fell well within the range of that of African jackals. These results suggest that fossil Nyctereutes cannot be distinguished from other canid species based on metric data alone. and may only be diagnosable using combinations of non-metric traits of the dentition and skull.

1188338,Edaphic and topographic constraints on exploitation of the Central Kenya Rift by large mammals and early Hominins,2016,Simon Kübler and Stephen Rucina and Sally Reynolds and Peter Owenga and Geoff Bailey and Geoffrey King,,Open Quaternary,,1-18,York,Our aim in this paper is to create a large-scale palaeoenvironmental and spatio-temporal framework for interpreting human land use and exploitation of large mammals in the Central Kenya Rift over the past 2 million years. with particular reference to the Nakuru-Elmenteita-Naivasha basin and its adjacent rift flanks on the Kinangop Plateau and Mau escarpment. We pay particular attention to the tectonic and volcanic history of the region. and to the system of lakes that have undergone periodic expansion and contraction during the Pleistocene in response to climatic and tectonic controls. We use this information to reconstruct topographic features as they would have existed at different periods of the past and their likely influence on patterns of large-mammal movements. In addition we present a systematic mapping of variations in the mineral nutrients of soils – soil edaphics – based on 150 analyses of trace elements in modern soil and vegetation samples. Soil edaphics play an important role in animal and human health today. with serious deficiencies in some areas. and would have exerted an important constraint on animal distributions and movements in the past. We show how soil-edaphic properties vary across the region and demonstrate a close relationship between them and the underlying geology and sediments. which allows us to project patterns back into the past and extrapolate them over larger areas. Using this combination of variables. we construct maps that help to place archaeological sites into their wider regional setting.

Maternal deposition to avian eggs. such as hormones. antibodies and antioxidants. critically affect development of the offspring. with long-lasting effects on the phenotype and fitness. Little is however known about large-scale geographical patterns of variation in maternal deposition to eggs. We studied geographical variation in egg components of a passerine bird. the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). by collecting samples from 16 populations and measuring egg and yolk mass. albumen lysozyme activity. yolk immunoglobulins. yolk androgens and yolk total carotenoids. We found significant variation among populations in most egg components. but ca. 90% of the variation was among individuals within populations. Population however explained 40% of the variation in carotenoid levels. In contrast to our hypothesis. we found geographical trends only in carotenoids. but not in any of the other egg components. Our results thus suggest high within-population variation and leave little scope for local adaptation and genetic differentiation in deposition of different egg components.

The mean size of males in amplexus is greater than the mean size of the male population due to the ability of larger males to displace smaller males already in amplexus.Davies and Halliday (1977) found no significant correlation between male and female lengths in amplexus before spawning although this correlation was significant at spawning which is the reverse of the situation found in this investigation possibly due to more male …,True,-tH265MAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,29,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222938000770561,5444783515603678332,/scholar?cites=5444783515603678332,,,0,0,0

However. ecological models typically disregard this variation and focus instead on trait means and total population density. Under what situations is this simplification appropriate?

Compelling intuitive arguments suggest that individual variation may provide a previously unrecognised route to diversity maintenance by blurring species‐level competitive differences or substituting for species‐level niche differences. These arguments. which are motivating a large body of empirical work. have rarely been evaluated with quantitative theory. Here we incorporate intraspecific variation into a common model of competition and identify three pathways by which this variation affects coexistence: (1) changes in competitive dynamics because of nonlinear averaging.

Designation of effective restocking sites requires careful attention to metapopulation dynamics; populations in the metapopulation can differ dramatically in demography and connectivity. and the sites they occupy can vary in habitat quality. Source populations. which are optimal for restocking. can be distinct geographically and may be a small percentage of the metapopulation.

Both biotic interactions and environmental fluctuations are key factors that can facilitate or disrupt coexistence. To better understand this interplay between these deterministic and stochastic forces. we develop a mathematical theory extending the nonlinear theory of permanence for deterministic systems to stochastic difference and differential equations.

The rudiments of the behavior and physiology of resource acquisition and conversion are incorporated as functional and numerical response models. The tritrophic model is used to examine the effects of trophic position on bottom—up—top—down regulation of populations in theory and in practice. The zero growth isoclines of the interacting populations are used to examine the dynamics of the tritrophic system. The herbivore (M2) and predator (M3) but not the plant (M1) isoclines can be solved explicitly.

Working under the general assumption that the process stays in a compact set. we detail a possible construction of the process and characterize its support. in terms of the solutions set of a differential inclusion. We establish results on the long time behaviour of the process. in relation to a certain set of accessible points. which is shown to be strongly linked to the support of invariant measures. Under Hörmander-type bracket conditions. we prove that there exists a unique invariant measure and that the processes converges to equilibrium in total variation.

Cyclical parthenogenesis (CP). in which organisms undergo several rounds of clonal reproduction followed by a sexual event. is one such life cycle. Many species. including crop pests (aphids). human parasites (trematodes) or models used in evolutionary science (Daphnia). are cyclical parthenogens. It is therefore crucial to understand the impact of such a life cycle on neutral genetic diversity.

1188423,Evolutionary game theory,1997,Jörgen W Weibull,,,,,MIT press,Introduces current evolutionary game theory--where ideas from evolutionary biology and rationalistic economics meet--emphasizing the links between static and dynamic approaches and noncooperative game theory. This text introduces current evolutionary game theory--where ideas from evolutionary biology and rationalistic economics meet--emphasizing the links between static and dynamic approaches and noncooperative game theory. Much of the text is devoted to the key concepts of evolutionary stability and replicator dynamics. The former highlights the role of mutations and the latter the mechanisms of selection. Moreover. set-valued static and dynamic stability concepts. as well as processes of social evolution. are discussed. Separate background chapters are devoted to noncooperative game theory and the theory of ordinary differential equations. There are examples throughout as well as individual chapter summaries. Because evolutionary game theory is a fast-moving field that is itself branching out and rapidly evolving. Jörgen Weibull has judiciously focused on clarifying and explaining core elements of the theory in an up-to-date. comprehensive. and self-contained treatment. The result is a text for second-year graduate students in economic theory. other social sciences. and evolutionary biology.

Equilibrium is unique in the present model. and a sufficient condition for existence is given. requiring that there be enough ‘stochastic heterogeneity’ with respect to party preferences in the electorate. The validity of Hotelling's ‘principle of minimum differentiation’. and of ‘Director's Law’. are examined under alternative hypotheses concerning administrative costs of redistributions. and voter's possibilities both of abstaining from voting and of becoming campaign activists for one of the parties.

In a theoretical part some crucial assumptions of such models are analyzed and it is shown that the models may be considerably generalized if the state spaces of macro and micro information are properly discerned from each other. A probabilistic argument is used to derive an extended entropy measure for treating a priori information. based on the notion that there is generally a sufficiently fine grain micro state space to exhaust the available information. thus motivating the assumption that all such micro states. consistent with any macro information. are equally probable.

We call individuals with such preferences homo moralis. At one end of the spectrum is homo oeconomicus. who acts so as to maximize his or her own payoff. At the opposite end is homo kantiensis. who does what would be “the right thing to do.” in terms of payoffs. if all others would do likewise.

We introduce a general framework to model social norms arguing that norms stem from agents’ desire for. or peer pressure towards. social efficiency. In a simple model of team production we examine the interplay of three types of contracts with social norms.

The siblings exert effort to produce output under uncertainty. and they may transfer output to each other. With equally altruistic siblings. their equilibrium effort is nonmonotonic in the common degree of altruism. and it depends on the harshness of the environment. We define a notion of local evolutionary stability of degrees of sibling altruism and show that this degree is lower than the kinship-relatedness factor.

We generalize the cheap-talk approach to pre-play communication by way of introducing a meaning correspondence between messages and actions. and by postulating two axioms met by natural languages. Players have a lexicographic preference. second to material payoffs. against deviating from the meaning correspondence. Under two-sided communication in generic and symmetric n × n-coordination games. a Nash equilibrium component in such a lexicographic communication game is evolutionarily stable if and only if it results in the unique Pareto efficient outcome of the underlying game.

1188451,A robust reputation system for mobile ad-hoc networks,2003,Sonja Buchegger and Jean-Yves Le Boudec,,,REP_WORK,,,Reputation systems in mobile ad-hoc networks can be tricked by the spreading of false reputation ratings. be it false accusations or false praise. Simple solutions such as exclusively relying on one’s own direct observations have drawbacks. as they do not make use of all the information available. We propose a fully distributed reputation system that can cope with false disseminated information. In our approach. everyone maintains a reputation rating and a trust rating about everyone else that they care about. From time to time first-hand reputation information is exchanged with others; using a modified Bayesian approach we designed and present in this paper. only second-hand reputation information that is not incompatible with the current reputation rating is accepted. Thus. reputation ratings are slightly modified by accepted information. Trust ratings are updated based on the compatibility of second-hand reputation information with prior reputation ratings. Data is entirely distributed: someone’s reputation and trust is the collection of ratings maintained by others. We enable node redemption and prevent the sudden exploitation of good reputation built over time by introducing re-evaluation and reputation fading. We present the application of our generic reputation system to the context of neighborhood watch in mobile ad-hoc networks. specifically to the CONFIDANT [3] protocol for the detection and isolation of nodes exhibiting routing or forwarding misbehavior.

With network coding. intermediate nodes may send out packets that are linear combinations of previously received information. There are two main benefits of this approach: potential throughput improvements and a high degree of robustness. Robustness translates into loss resilience and facilitates the design of simple distributed algorithms that perform well. even if decisions are based only on partial information.

Up to this value. the distribution in many cases follows a power law. as shown in recent work. This power law finding was previously used to support the hypothesis that intercontact time has a power law tail. and that common mobility models are not adequate. However. we observe that the timescale of interest for opportunistic forwarding may be of the same order as the characteristic time. and thus. the exponential tail is important.

As a response to these issues. a number of Location-Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed during the last decade.

In every case where it is used. there is a proof of existence and one or several algorithms for computing it; in most. but not all cases. they are based on the notion of bottlenecks. In spite of this wide applicability. there are still examples. arising in the context of wireless or peer-to-peer networks. where the existing theories do not seem to apply directly. In this paper. we give a unifying treatment of max-min fairness. which encompasses all existing results in a simplifying framework. and extend its applicability to new examples.

1188470,On designing incentive-compatible routing and forwarding protocols in wireless ad-hoc networks,2007,Sheng Zhong and Li Erran Li and Yanbin Grace Liu and Yang Richard Yang,13,Wireless networks,6,799-816,Springer US,In many applications. wireless ad-hoc networks are formed by devices belonging to independent users. Therefore. a challenging problem is how to provide incentives to stimulate cooperation. In this paper. we study ad-hoc games—the routing and packet forwarding games in wireless ad-hoc networks. Unlike previous work which focuses either on routing or on forwarding. this paper investigates both routing and forwarding. We first uncover an impossibility result—there does not exist a protocol such that following the protocol to always forward others' traffic is a dominant action. Then we define a novel solution concept called cooperation-optimal protocols. We present Corsac. a cooperation-optimal protocol which consists of a routing protocol and a forwarding protocol. The routing protocol of Corsac integrates VCG with a novel cryptographic technique to address the challenge in wireless ad-hoc networks …,True,hLj70l8AAAAJ:1paMEeroeoQC,339,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-006-9855-1,11668109538431489540,/scholar?cites=11668109538431489540,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1080829.1080841,0,0,0

We focus on maximizing rates under battery-lifetime and power constraints. Commonly used metrics are total capacity (in the case of cellular networks) and transport capacity (in the case of ad hoc networks). However. it is known in traditional wired networking that maximizing total capacity conflicts with fairness. and this is why fairness-oriented rate allocations. such as max-min fairness. are often used. We review this issue for wireless ad hoc networks. Indeed. the mathematical model for wireless networks has a specificity that makes some of the findings different. It has been reported in the literature on ultra wide band that gross unfairness occurs when maximizing total capacity or transport capacity. and we confirm by a theoretical analysis that this is a fundamental …,True,hLj70l8AAAAJ:zLWjf1WUPmwC,283,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1347098/,7139897170507669224,/scholar?cites=7139897170507669224,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/30087/files/BL04.pdf,0,0,0

1188476,Two competing models of how people learn in games,2002,Ed Hopkins,70,Econometrica,6,2141-2166,Blackwell Publishers Ltd,Reinforcement learning and stochastic fictitious play are apparent rivals as models of human learning. They embody quite different assumptions about the processing of information and optimization. This paper compares their properties and finds that they are far more similar than were thought. In particular. the expected motion of stochastic fictitious play and reinforcement learning with experimentation can both be written as a perturbed form of the evolutionary replicator dynamics. Therefore they will in many cases have the same asymptotic behavior. In particular. local stability of mixed equilibria under stochastic fictitious play implies local stability under perturbed reinforcement learning. The main identifiable difference between the two models is speed: stochastic fictitious play gives rise to faster learning.,True,yxNvjAEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,235,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2002.00436.x,11927178824288654199,/scholar?cites=11927178824288654199,,http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/5889655/stim7.pdf,0,0,0

Models of inequity aversion in common use in experimental economics imply a negative relation between inequality and happiness. In contrast. empirical studies on happiness typically employ models of relative concerns that assume that increases in others’ income always have a negative effect on own happiness. However. in these latter models. the relation between inequality and happiness can be positive. One possible solution is a rivalry model where a distinction is made between endowment and reward inequality which have respectively a negative and positive effect on happiness. These different models and their contrasting results may clarify why the empirical relationship between inequality and happiness has been difficult to establish.,True,yxNvjAEAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,127,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10888-008-9081-4,8872043036870059433,/scholar?cites=8872043036870059433,,http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/20037383/ineq_survey.pdf,0,0,0

Signals allow assortative matching in which the highest-quality workers send the highest signals and are hired by the best firms. Matching is considered both when wages are rigid (nontransferable utility) and when they are fully flexible (transferable utility). In both cases. equilibrium strategies and payoffs depend on the distributions of worker and firm types. This is in contrast to separating equilibria of the standard model. which do not respond to changes in supply or demand. With sticky wages. despite incomplete information. equilibrium investment in education by low-ability workers can be inefficiently low. and this distortion can become worse in a more competitive environment. In contrast. with flexible wages. greater competition improves efficiency.,True,yxNvjAEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,125,https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article-abstract/10/2/290/2298441,15580933402979773928,/scholar?cites=15580933402979773928,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7280469.pdf,0,0,0

We introduce a new methodology to compare the behavior of agents that occupy the same rank in the two different income distributions but typically have different levels of incomes. Here. an increase in incomes of the least endowed improves their welfare. yet it also increases social competition. making those in the middle to be worse off—even if they have higher incomes as well. As social competition can be lowered by spreading agents apart in income space. we find that an increase in incomes for all. augmented by (weakly) increased income dispersion. constitutes a sufficient condition for Pareto-improvement.

We show that. when society allocates resources via tournaments. these two types of inequality have opposing effects on equilibrium behavior and well-being. Greater inequality of rewards hurts most people—both the middle class and the poor—who are forced into greater effort. Conversely. greater inequality of endowments benefits the middle class.

However. as we show. when such points are on the boundary of the state space. for example. pure strategy equilibria. standard results from the theory of stochastic approximation do not apply. We offer what we believe to be the correct treatment of boundary points. and provide a new and more general result: this model of learning converges with zero probability to fixed points which are unstable under the Maynard Smith or adjusted version of the evolutionary replicator dynamics.

In all pay auctions. bidders with low values will respond to a stochastically higher (in the sense of likelihood ratio dominance) distribution of types by playing less aggressively while high value bidders bid more. In the first price auction. a similar change results in all types playing more aggressively. Furthermore. we show that a decrease in dispersion of values. in the sense of a refinement of second order stochastic dominance. although also associated with an increase in competitiveness. may in addition result in less aggressive play by bidders with high values in both auction forms.

Differently from other social learning studies. subjects must choose between receiving a private. noisy signal about the current state or observing the past guesses of other subjects in the prior period. The design varies the persistence of the state across time. which determines whether choosing social or private information is optimal. enabling us to separate subjects who choose optimally from those who excessively use either social information (“herd animals”) or private information (“lone wolves”).

Another is based on sexual selection: altruism is a costly signal of good genes. This paper shows that these two arguments are stronger together in that altruists who can mentalize have a greater advantage over nonaltruists when they can signal their type. even though these signals are costly. when such signaling allows better matching opportunities.

By requiring subjects to make this information choice at different points in the sequence. our within-subject design allows us to separate biased from optimal information choices.

The second component is discrete and its jump rates may depend on the position of the whole process. Under regularity assumptions on the jump rates and Wasserstein contraction conditions for the underlying dynamics. we provide a concrete criterion for the convergence to equilibrium in terms of Wasserstein distance. The proof is based on a coupling argument and a weak form of the Harris theorem. In particular. we obtain exponential ergodicity in situations which do not verify any hypoellipticity assumption. but are not uniformly contracting either.

General conditions are given ensuring the convergence of this measure to the quasi-stationary distribution of the chain.

In this paper. we propose efficient algorithms for computing matrix profile for a general class of Euclidean distances. We first propose a simple but efficient algorithm called AAMP for computing matrix profile with the"" pure""(non-normalized) Euclidean distance. Then. we extend our algorithm for the p-norm distance. We also propose an algorithm. called ACAMP. that uses the same principle as AAMP. but for the case of z-normalized Euclidean distance. We implemented our algorithms. and evaluated their performance through experimentation. The experiments show excellent performance results. For example. they show that AAMP is very efficient for computing matrix profile for non-normalized Euclidean distances. The results also show that the ACAMP algorithm is significantly faster than SCRIMP++(the state of the art matrix profile algorithm) for the case of z-normalized Euclidean distance.",True,a5UA9fwAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05708,873994249878856852,/scholar?cites=873994249878856852,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05708,0,0,0
1188519,Optimal stopping for measure-valued piecewise deterministic Markov processes,2020,Bertrand Cloez and Benoite De Saporta and Maud Joubaud,57,Journal of Applied Probability,2,497-512,Cambridge University Press,This paper investigates the random horizon optimal stopping problem for measure-valued piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). This is motivated by population dynamics applications. when one wants to monitor some characteristics of the individuals in a small population. The population and its individual characteristics can be represented by a point measure. We first define a PDMP on a space of locally finite measures. Then we define a sequence of random horizon optimal stopping problems for such processes. We prove that the value function of the problems can be obtained by iterating some dynamic programming operator. Finally we prove via a simple counter-example that controlling the whole population is not equivalent to controlling a random lineage.,True,a5UA9fwAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,3,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-applied-probability/article/optimal-stopping-for-measurevalued-piecewise-deterministic-markov-processes/37EBBE16049A145A81A7DFBA8853B26F,1815684771319411246,/scholar?cites=1815684771319411246,,,0,0,0
1188520,Gaussian approximations for chemostat models in finite and infinite dimensions,2017,Bertrand Cloez and Coralie Fritsch,75,Journal of mathematical biology,4,805-843,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,In a chemostat. bacteria live in a growth container of constant volume in which liquid is injected continuously. Recently. Campillo and Fritsch introduced a mass-structured individual-based model to represent this dynamics and proved its convergence to a more classic partial differential equation. In this work. we are interested in the convergence of the fluctuation process. We consider this process in some Sobolev spaces and use central limit theorems on Hilbert space to prove its convergence in law to an infinite-dimensional Gaussian process. As a consequence. we obtain a two-dimensional Gaussian approximation of the Crump–Young model for which the long time behavior is relatively misunderstood. For this approximation. we derive the invariant distribution and the convergence to it. We also present numerical simulations illustrating our results.,True,a5UA9fwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-017-1097-6,14732565132563807945,/scholar?cites=14732565132563807945,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.07951,0,0,0
1188521,Comportement asymptotique de processus avec sauts et applications pour des modèles avec branchement,2013,Bertrand Cloez,,,,,,L'objectif de ce travail est d'étudier le comportement en temps long d'un modèle de particules avec une interaction de type branchement. Plus précisément. les particules se déplacent indépendamment suivant une dynamique markovienne jusqu'au temps de branchement. où elles donnent naissance à de nouvelles particules dont la position dépend de celle de leur mère et de son nombre d'enfants. Dans la première partie de ce mémoire nous omettons le branchement et nous étudions le comportement d'une seule lignée. Celle-ci est modélisée via un processus de Markov qui peut admettre des sauts. des parties diffusives ou déterministes par morceaux. Nous quantifions la convergence de ce processus hybride à l'aide de la courbure de Wasserstein. aussi nommée courbure grossière de Ricci. Cette notion de courbure. introduite récemment par Joulin. Ollivier. et Sammer correspond mieux à l'étude des processus avec sauts. Nous établissons une expression du gradient du semigroupe des processus de Markov stochastiquement monotone. qui nous permet d'expliciter facilement leur courbure. D'autres bornes fines de convergence en distance de Wasserstein et en variation totale sont aussi établies. Dans le même contexte. nous démontrons qu'un processus de Markov. qui change de dynamique suivant un processus discret. converge rapidement vers un équilibre. lorsque la moyenne des courbures des dynamiques sous-jacentes est strictement positive.

We show that the process exhibits a Malthusian behavior; that is that the global population size grows exponentially fast and that the trait distribution of individuals converges to some stable distribution. The proof is based on a generalization of Lyapunov function techniques for non-conservative semi-groups. We then investigate the fluctuations of the growth rate with respect to the parameters guiding asymmetry. In particular. we exhibit that. under some special assumptions. asymmetric division is optimal in a Darwinian sense.,True,a5UA9fwAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08797,6030090731552844228,/scholar?cites=6030090731552844228,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08797,0,0,0

Its evolution is like the matrix population model where offspring numbers are random. Extinction probability. extinction time. abundance are well known and given by explicit formulas. In contrast with the deterministic model. it can be applied to small populations. 3 Parameters of this model can be estimated through the Bayesian inference framework. This enables to consider non-arbitrary scenarios. 4 We show how coupling Bayesian inference with the Galton-Watson model provides several features: i) a flexible modelling approach with easily understandable parameters ii) compatibility with the classical matrix population model (Leslie type model) iii) A non-computational approach which then leads to more information with less computing iv) a non-arbitrary choice for scenarios. parameters... It can be seen to go one step further than the classical matrix population model for the viability problem. 5 To illustrate these features. we provide analysis details for two examples whose one of which is a real life example.,True,a5UA9fwAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09562,9918707905096476860,/scholar?cites=9918707905096476860,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09562,0,0,0

To this end. we use the coding process introduced by Lambert. We show that. in our situation. this process is no longer a L {é} vy process but remains a Feller process and we give a complete characterization of its generator. This allows us to study the model through well-known Markov processes techniques. On one hand. introducing a scale function for such processes allows us to get necessary and sufficient conditions for extinction or non-extinction and to characterize the law of such trees conditioned on these events. On the other hand. using Lyapounov drift techniques. we get another set of. easily checkable. sufficient criteria for extinction or non-extinction and some tail estimates for the tree length. Finally. we also study scaling limits of such random trees and observe that the Bessel tree appears naturally.,True,a5UA9fwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03284,13136887938842416923,/scholar?cites=13136887938842416923,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03284,0,0,0

Coupled hydrodynamic-ecological models are valuable tools to reach a deeper understanding of the key factors triggering events such as cyanobacterial blooms. However. their calibration and validation is often a challenging task. In situ data available for calibration are usually sparse in space and time and the high number of variables and interactions in the biogeochemical cycle is often reflected in models with a high number of parameters to be estimated. High-frequency in situ data can help overcome these issues as they make it possible to perform the calibration on a shorter period for which the simulation time is not too long.

1188526,Optimal stopping for measure-valued piecewise deterministic Markov processes-Application to population dynamics,2018,Bertrand Cloez and Benoîte de Saporta and Maud Joubaud,,,,,,In our work. we study an optimal stopping problem for specific Markov processes: Piecewise Determinis-tic Markov Processes (PMDP). Those time-continuous processes were formalized by Davis in [2]. The only source of randomness in those Markov processes comes from the jumps. The jump times are drawn in a Poisson-like fashion. Between jumps. the process follows a deterministic trajectory. given by the flow of some differential equation. In Davis' work. the state space of PDMP is in R d for some integers d. We extend this vision to measure-valued processes. We introduce such measure-valued processes in order to model population dynamics problems. when the population size is small. The population characteristics can be described as follows: let n be the size of the population at some time t. Let x i be a real number. representing some biological trait of the i − th individual. It can be the size. the weight. the concentration of some protein... So. at this time t. information about the population can be summarized with a locally finite measure µ := n i=1 δ xi. The process. at time t. takes this value µ. It is related to a growth fragmentation model [1]. We investigate an optimal stopping problem for measure-valued PDMPs. The purpose is to select a stopping time τ in order to maximize some mean reward g of the PDMP (X t) t : sup τ E[g(X τ)]. To solve our optimal stopping problem. we imitate the technique from the paper [4]. This paper considers the specific case of R d-valued processes. The optimal performance is called the value function of the optimal stopping problem. We prove that this value function can be recursively constructed by iterating a …,True,a5UA9fwAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01815558/,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01815558/file/F1-4044092-abstracttemplate%281%29.pdf,0,0,0
1188527,Taxation base in developing countries,2005,Emmanuelle Auriol and Michael Warlters,89,Journal of Public Economics,4,625-646,North-Holland,Informal sectors are larger in developing countries than in rich countries. This is a result of higher fixed costs of entry into the formal economy in developing countries. We show that raising barriers to entry is consistent with a deliberate government policy for raising tax revenue. By generating market power. and hence rents. for the permitted entrants. market entry fees foster the emergence of large taxpayers. The rents can be readily confiscated by the government through entry fees and taxes on profits at a low administrative cost. The relevance of the theory is assessed with a sample of 64 countries.

The duplication of fixed costs incurred in a duopoly structure may be socially justified in a static model by three effects: the sampling effect. the yardstick competition effect. and the increasing marginal cost effect.We show that in general. asymmetric information favors duopoly when the market structure is decided before firms discovers their cost characteristics (a common situation in dual sourcing for procurement). and favors monopoly when the market structure is decided after firms discover their cost characteristics (the case of split‐award auctions).,True,70LailMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,214,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1430-9134.1992.00507.x,10080722126074011891,/scholar?cites=10080722126074011891,,http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/2406/1/Auriol_2406.pdf,0,0,0

It shows that capture yields a dead-weight loss while extortion does not. Based on the calibration of the model. the total cost of capture is between 1.2 and 2.88 times the amount of the bribes. The theoretical analysis focuses on capture fight. The legal framework that emerges from the normative analysis involves open tender for larger purchases and no monitoring for the smaller ones. The rule is independent of a country's characteristics. Large public purchases should hence be ruled by international legislation. For markets of medium range. national legislation differs.

Costs of certification. sunk in order to achieve credibility. play a key role in producing an oligopolistic market. leading to high prices that form a barrier for consumers in the South.

We develop a simple general equilibrium model that can handle taxes on five major tax classes. and can be calibrated with little more than national accounts data.

Focusing on the lowest cost tax instruments in each country. commonly the VAT but not always. the average MCF is 1.1. Finally extending the tax base to include sections of the informal economy by removing some tax exemptions offers the potential for a low MCF source of public funds. and a lowering of MCFs on other tax instruments.,True,70LailMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,180,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438781100006X,3537363151292507094,/scholar?cites=3537363151292507094,,http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/3306/1/wp_dev_110_2009.pdf,0,0,0

1190796,The performance of plant species in removing nutrients from stormwater in biofiltration systems in Cape Town,2012,SG Milandri and KJ Winter and SBM Chimphango and NP Armitage and DN Mbui and GE Jackson and V Liebau,38,Water SA,5,655-662,,In 2009. the City of Cape Town (CoCT) adopted a stormwater policy which mandates that new and existing developments should reduce the concentration of phosphorus and suspended solids in stormwater runoff by 45% and 80%. respectively. but offered no explicit guidance about how these water quality targets might be achieved. This study aims to contribute to the limited knowledge that exists about the performance of local plant species to treat stormwater. A large nursery-based study was conducted to investigate the performance of 9 locally-occurring plant species to remove orthophosphate (PO4-3). ammonia (NH3) and nitrate (NO3-) found in urban stormwater. Synthetic stormwater was applied to each species as well as a control consisting only of soil (Malmesbury shale). The discharge was collected from a drainage pipe at the base of each of the 150 containers. The results show that all species (excluding Ficinia) reduced the average concentrations of PO4-3 by 81% and NH3 by 90%. By contrast. NO3-was reduced by an average of 69%(excluding by Elegia and Phragmites) with 8 of the 9 species removing significantly more than the control. The species that performed well for all three nutrients include Agapanthus and turf grasses. Stenotaphrum and Pennisetum. The results of the study highlight three important factors in the design of biofilters: that a substantial proportion of nutrients can be captured or absorbed by plants; that the soil medium is an important factor in the removal of PO4-3 and NH3; and that plant choice is essential in the removal of NO3-.

Given their greater allocation of resources above ground to growth and reproduction. seeders are likely to have a higher nutrient requirement than resprouters. This may result in discernable differences in habitat nutrition and leaf morphology. These differences are probably accentuated in Cape legumes given their poor adaptation to low-P soils. It was hypothesized that legume seeders occupy habitats with greater fertility and possess larger. less sclerophyllous leaves than resprouters.

South Africa,2018,Meshack Nkosinathi Dludlu and Samson Chimphango and Charles H Stirton and A Muthama Muasya,9,Genes,1,2,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Over 760 legume species occur in the ecologically-heterogeneous Core Cape Subregion (CCR) of South Africa. This study tested whether the main symbionts of CCR legumes (Burkholderia and Mesorhizobium) are phylogenetically structured by altitude. pH and soil types. Rhizobial strains were isolated from field nodules of diverse CCR legumes and sequenced for 16S ribosomic RNA (rRNA). recombinase A (recA) and N-acyltransferase (nodA). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Bayesian and maximum likelihood techniques. Phylogenetic signals were determined using the D statistic for soil types and Pagel’s λ for altitude and pH. Phylogenetic relationships between symbionts of the narrowly-distributed Indigofera superba and those of some widespread CCR legumes were also determined. Results showed that Burkholderia is restricted to acidic soils. while Mesorhizobium occurs in both acidic and alkaline soils. Both genera showed significant phylogenetic clustering for pH and most soil types. but not for altitude. Therefore. pH and soil types influence the distribution of Burkholderia and Mesorhizobium in the CCR. All strains of Indigofera superba were identified as Burkholderia. and they were nested within various clades containing strains from outside its distribution range. It is. therefore. hypothesized that I. superba does not exhibit rhizobial specificity at the intragenic level. Implications for CCR legume distributions are discussed.

Research for identifying heat tolerance markers for potential chickpea genotype selection is imperative. The study assessed the response of four chickpea genotypes to a natural temperature gradient in the field using chlorophyll fluorescence. non-structural carbohydrate. chlorophyll concentrations. gas exchange and grain yield. Field experiments were carried out in two winter seasons at three locations with known differences in temperature in NE South Africa.

Rewardless flowers of the orchid Erycina pusilla have an enlarged median sepal and incised median petal (‘lip’) to attract oil-collecting bees. These bees also forage on similar looking but rewarding Malpighiaceae flowers that have five unequally sized petals and gland-carrying sepals. The lip of E. pusilla has a ‘callus’ that. together with winged ‘stelidia’. mimics these glands. Different hypotheses exist about the evolutionary origin of the median sepal. callus and stelidia of orchid flowers. The evolutionary origin of these organs was investigated using a combination of morphological. molecular and phylogenetic techniques to a developmental series of floral buds of E. pusilla. The vascular bundle of the median sepal indicates it is a first whorl organ but its convex epidermal cells reflect convergence of petaloid features. Expression of AGL6 EpMADS4 and APETALA3 EpMADS14 is low in the median sepal. possibly correlating with its petaloid appearance. A vascular bundle indicating second whorl derivation leads to the lip. AGL6 EpMADS5 and APETALA3 EpMADS13 are most highly expressed in lip and callus. consistent with current models for lip identity. Six vascular bundles. indicating a stamen-derived origin. lead to the callus. stelidia and stamen. AGAMOUS is not expressed in the callus. consistent with its sterilization.

Currently. various disciplines of science contribute to unravel evolution at all levels of life. from individual organisms to species and higher ranks. using different approaches and specific terminologies.

The early classifications and generic circumscriptions of Lindley (1830-1840). Bentham and Hooker (1883) and Schlechter (1927) relied mainly on morphological characters. especially floral features. The problem with such reliance on floral features at higher levels of classification is that floral morphology is extremely plastic in evolutionary terms. so that unrelated species may have developed similar structures in response to similar selection. particularly pollinator pressures. Such parallelisms are rife in Orchidaceae. so it is necessary to apply more objective criteria and character choices in trying to unravel the complexities of the family's history. Robert L. Dressler's (Phylogeny and Classification of the Orchid Family. Cambridge University Press. 1993) classification introduced characters from pollen. seeds. and anatomy to supplement traditional characters. The recent surge in molecular approaches. especially multigene analyses. combined with several other types of new data. had not only contradicted key elements of Dressler's concepts at higher levels but will result in the recircumscription of many genera.

As a tool for future comparative studies. we compiled a supertree of angiosperm families from published phylogenetic studies. Sequence data from the plastid rbcL gene were used to estimate relative timing of branching events. calibrated by using robust fossil dates. The frequency of shifts in diversification rate is largely constant among time windows but with an apparent increase in diversification rates within the more recent time frames. Analyses of species numbers among families revealed that diversification rate is a labile attribute of lineages at all levels of the tree. An examination of the top 10 major shifts in diversification rates indicates they cannot easily be attributed to the action of a few key innovations but instead are consistent with a more complex process of diversification …,True,hVLMjrkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,625,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/7/1904.short,3203716557609818860,/scholar?cites=3203716557609818860,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/7/1904.full.pdf,0,0,0

Additionally. transpiration has been ascribed the functions of cooling leaves. driving root to shoot xylem transport and mass flow of nutrients through the soil to the rhizosphere. As a consequence of the link between nutrient mass flow and transpiration. nutrient availability. particularly that of NO3 −. partially regulates plant water flux. Nutrient regulation of transpiration may function through the concerted regulation of: (1) root hydraulic conductance through control of aquaporins by NO3 −. (2) shoot stomatal conductance (g s) through NO production. and (3) pH and phytohormone regulation of g s.

Historical treatments working towards this goal have employed a variety of approaches and grouping criteria. For example. where Weimarck (1941) studied the phytogeographical affinities of endemic and near-endemic taxa. Campbell et al.(1981) used structural and family-level floristic data to classify the montane vegetation of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). Similarly. where Acocks (1953) and Rutherford and Westfall (1986) employed ecological grouping criteria. Goldblatt (1978) followed earlier workers in defining the Cape flora geographically. rather than on the basis of floristics or ecology. A second feature of existing classifications of Cape vegetation is a general absence of structured analysis. most treatments representing syntheses of floristic data. phytochorology. expert opinion. and selected ecological information. especially substrate data (eg Taylor 1978; Moll and Bossi 1984; Moll et al. 1984; Hilton-Taylor 1996; Low and Rebelo 1996). More recently. the development of GIS software has led to an increasingly spatial approach to vegetation mapping (eg Vlok et al. 2003; Mucina and Rutherford 2006). The multiplicity of approaches has resulted in a diversity of contrasting vegetation classifications.

USA,South Africa's fynbos region has intrigued biologists for centuries. It has achieved iconic status as a locus of megadiversity and therefore a place to study the ecological underpinnings of massive evolutionary radiations. Researchers have made great advances over the past two decades in unravelling the complexities of fynbos ecology and evolution. and the region has contributed significant insights into the adaptive radiations of large lineages. conservation science. pollination biology. invasive plant biology. and palaeoanthropology. Lessons from the fynbos offer much of value for understanding the origin. maintenance. and conservation of diversity anywhere in the world. This book provides the first synthesis of the field for 20 years. bringing together the latest ecological and evolutionary research on the South African global biodiversity hotspots of the Greater Cape Floristic Region-the iconic fynbos and succulent karoo. It explores the historical and modern physical and biological environment of this region. the circumstances and processes which have fostered its remarkable biodiversity. and the role this diversity has played in the emergence of modern humans.

Unlocking genetic data from the typically highly degraded DNA obtained from herbarium specimens was difficult until the arrival of high-throughput sequencing approaches. which can be applied to low quantities of severely fragmented DNA. Target enrichment involves using short molecular probes that hybridise and capture genomic regions of interest for high-throughput sequencing. In this study on herbariomics. we used this targeted sequencing approach and the Angiosperms353 universal probe set to recover up to 351 nuclear genes from 435 herbarium specimens that are up to 204 years old and span the breadth of angiosperm diversity. We show that on average 207 genes were successfully retrieved from herbarium specimens. although the mean number of genes retrieved and target enrichment efficiency is significantly higher for silica gel-dried specimens. Forty-seven target nuclear genes were recovered from a herbarium specimen of the critically endangered St Helena boxwood. Mellissia begoniifolia. collected in 1815. Herbarium specimens yield significantly less high molecular weight DNA than silica gel-dried specimens. and genomic DNA quality declines with sample age which is negatively correlated with target enrichment efficiency.

The large amount of genomic data now available and statistical tools to analyze them provide unprecedented power for phylogenetic inference. Targeted sequencing has emerged as a strong tool for estimating species trees in the face of rapid radiations. lineage sorting and introgression. Evolutionary relationships in Cyperaceae have been studied mostly using Sanger sequencing until recently. Despite ample taxon sampling. relationships in many genera remain poorly understood. hampered by diversification rates that outpace mutation rates in the loci used. The C4 Cyperus Clade of the genus Cyperus has been particularly difficult to resolve. Previous studies based on a limited set of markers resolved relationships among Cyperus species using the C3 photosynthetic pathway. but not among C4 Cyperus Clade taxa. We test the ability of two targeted sequencing kits to resolve relationships in the C4 Cyperus Clade. the universal Angiosperms-353 kit and a Cyperaceae-specific kit. Sequences of the targeted loci were recovered from data generated with both kits and used to investigate overlap in data between kits and relative efficiency of the general and custom approaches. The power to resolve shallow-level relationships was tested using a summary species tree method and a concatenated maximum likelihood approach. High resolution and support are obtained using both approaches. but high levels of missing data disproportionately impact the latter.

The frequency of shifts in diversification rate is largely constant among time windows but with an apparent increase in diversification rates within the more recent time frames. Analyses of species numbers among families revealed that diversification rate is a labile attribute of lineages at all levels of the tree.

We find that host relatedness is the best overall predictor of whether two host species share the same pathogens.

Patterns in extinction risk reflect both biological differences among mammalian lineages and differences in threat intensity among regions. Phylogenetic comparative analyses indicate that for small-bodied mammals. extinction risk is governed mostly by where the species live and the intensity of the threats. whereas for large-bodied mammals. ecological differences also play an important role.

Although phylogeny can provide a significant contribution to the ongoing debate. its use has been precluded by the lack of comprehensive DNA data. Here. we focus on the ‘underground trees’ (=geoxyles) of southern Africa. one of the most distinctive growth forms characteristic of fire‐prone savannas. We placed geoxyles within the most comprehensive dated phylogeny for the regional flora comprising over 1400 woody species. Using this phylogeny. we tested whether African geoxyles evolved concomitantly with those of the South American cerrado and used their phylogenetic position to date the appearance of humid savannas. We found multiple independent origins of the geoxyle life‐form mostly from the Pliocene. a period consistent with the origin of cerrado. with the majority of divergences occurring within the last 2 million yr.

Over the last 30 years spatial ecology has developed as an integrative. multidisciplinary science that has improved our understanding of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation and loss. We argue that accelerating climate change – the effective manipulation of time by humans – has generated a current need to build an equivalent framework for temporal ecology. Climate change has at once pressed ecologists to understand and predict ecological dynamics in non‐stationary environments. while also challenged fundamental assumptions of many concepts. models and approaches.

The ability of a species to track. via shifts in phenological events. the abiotic environment through time might dictate its vulnerability to future climate change. Understanding the predictors and drivers of phenological change is therefore critical. Here. we evaluated evidence for phylogenetic conservatism – the tendency for closely related species to share similar ecological and biological attributes – in phenological traits across flowering plants.

Regionally. PD frequently covaries closely with species richness; however. variation in speciation and extinction rates and/or the biogeographic history of lineages can result in significant deviation. Locally. these differences may be pronounced. Rapid recent speciation or high temporal turnover of lineages can result in low PD but high richness. In contrast. rare dispersal events. for example. between biomes. can elevate PD but have only small impact on richness. To date. environmental predictors of species richness have been well studied but global models explaining variation in PD are lacking.

Relative diversification rates increased towards the equator. suggesting that differences in per‐lineage net diversification may be an important component of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The amplitude of Quaternary climate oscillations experienced by families explained variation in diversification equally well compared to contemporary energy measures. and energy and climate change measures were intercorrelated. making it difficult to reject either as a causal mechanism. Many putative mechanisms linking diversification to energy availability do not apply to plants. whereas the climate change mechanism has more support.

Although significant progress has been made through efforts such as DNA barcoding. transcriptome sequencing. and whole-plastid sequencing. the community current lacks a cost efficient methodology for collecting nuclear phylogenomic data across all angiosperms. Here. we leverage genomic resources from 43 angiosperm species to develop enrichment probes useful for collecting ~500 loci from non-model taxa across the diversity of angiosperms. By taking an anchored phylogenomics approach. in which probes are designed to represent sequence diversity across the group. we are able to efficiently target loci with sufficient phylogenetic signal to resolve deep. intermediate. and shallow angiosperm relationships. After demonstrating the utility of this resource. we present a method that generates a heat map for each node on a phylogeny that reveals the sensitivity of support for the node across analysis conditions. as well as different locus. site. and taxon schemes. Focusing on the effect of locus and site sampling. we use this approach to statistically evaluate relative support for the alternative relationships among eudicots. monocots. and magnoliids.

Here. we employed both methods to construct phylogenetic trees of all genera of palms (Arecaceae/Palmae). an iconic angiosperm family of great economic importance. We assembled a supermatrix consisting of 16 partitions. comprising DNA sequence data. plastid restriction fragment length polymorphism data. and morphological data for all genera. from which a highly resolved and well-supported phylogenetic tree was built despite abundant missing data.

However. the development of quantitative measures that can assist our quest for new medicinal plants has not greatly advanced in recent years. Phylogenetic tools have entered many scientific fields in the last two decades to provide explanatory power. but have been overlooked in ethnomedicinal studies. Several studies show that medicinal properties are not randomly distributed in plant phylogenies. suggesting that phylogeny shapes ethnobotanical use. Nevertheless. empirical studies that explicitly combine ethnobotanical and phylogenetic information are scarce.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. we borrowed tools from community ecology phylogenetics to quantify significance of phylogenetic signal in medicinal properties in plants and identify nodes on phylogenies with high bioscreening potential. To do this. we produced an ethnomedicinal review from extensive literature research and a multi-locus phylogenetic hypothesis for the pantropical genus Pterocarpus (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae). We demonstrate that species used to treat a certain conditions. such as malaria. are significantly phylogenetically clumped and we highlight nodes in the phylogeny that are significantly overabundant in species used to treat certain conditions. These cross-cultural patterns in ethnomedicinal usage in Pterocarpus are interpreted in the light of phylogenetic relationships.

Much of the cost of developing targeted sequencing approaches is associated with the generation of preliminary data needed for the identification of orthologous loci for probe design. In plants. identifying orthologous loci has proven difficult due to a large number of whole-genome duplication events. especially in the angiosperms (flowering plants).

However. mangrove species are increasingly threatened and experiencing range contraction across the globe that requires urgent conservation action. Here. we assess the spatial distribution of mangrove species richness and evolutionary diversity. and evaluate potential predictors of global declines and risk of extinction. We found that human pressure. measured as the number of different uses associated with mangroves. correlated strongly. but negatively. with extinction probability. whereas species ages were the best predictor of global decline. explaining 15% of variation in extinction risk. Although the majority of mangrove species are categorised by the IUCN as Least Concern. our finding that the more threatened species also tend to be those that are more evolutionarily unique is of concern because their extinction would result in a greater loss of phylogenetic diversity.

Phylogenetic methods are increasingly being recognised as providing a useful framework for predicting future losses. and guiding efforts for pre-emptive conservation actions. In this study. we used a reconstructed phylogenetic tree of angiosperm species of the Eastern Arc Mountains – an important African biodiversity hotspot – and described the distribution of extinction risk across taxonomic ranks and phylogeny. We provide evidence for both taxonomic and phylogenetic selectivity in extinction risk. However. we found that selectivity varies with IUCN extinction risk category. Vulnerable species are more closely related than expected by chance. whereas endangered and critically endangered species are not significantly clustered on the phylogeny. We suggest that the general observation for taxonomic and phylogenetic selectivity (i.e. phylogenetic signal. the tendency of closely related species to share similar traits) in extinction risks is therefore largely driven by vulnerable species. and not necessarily the most highly threatened. We also used information on altitudinal distribution and climate to generate a predictive model of at-risk species richness. and found that greater threatened species richness is found at higher altitude. allowing for more informed conservation decision making.

In this study. we investigated the evolutionary diversification history of the genus Encephalartos. a monophyletic cycad endemic to Africa. We found an antisigmoidal pattern with a plateau and punctual explosive radiation. This pattern is typical of a constant radiation with mass extinction. The rate shift that we found may therefore be a result of a rapid recolonization of niches that have been emptied owing to mass extinction. Because the explosive radiation occurred during the transition Pliocene–Pleistocene. we argued that the processes might have been climatically mediated.,True,I8fP-c4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,20,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.880,6024880510905130469,/scholar?cites=6024880510905130469,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ece3.880,0,0,0

1191052,Phyloclimatic modeling: combining phylogenetics and bioclimatic modeling,2006,C Yesson and A Culham,55,Systematic Biology,5,785-802,Oxford University Press,We investigate the impact of past climates on plant diversification by tracking the “footprint” of climate change on a phylogenetic tree. Diversity within the cosmopolitan carnivorous plant genus Drosera (Droseraceae) is focused within Mediterranean climate regions. We explore whether this diversity is temporally linked to Mediterranean-type climatic shifts of the mid-Miocene and whether climate preferences are conservative over phylogenetic timescales. Phyloclimatic modeling combines environmental niche (bioclimatic) modeling with phylogenetics in order to study evolutionary patterns in relation to climate change. We present the largest and most complete such example to date using Drosera. The bioclimatic models of extant species demonstrate clear phylogenetic patterns; this is particularly evident for the tuberous sundews from southwestern Australia (subgenus Ergaleium).

1191055,Taxonomy based on science is necessary for global conservation,2018,,16,PLoS Biology,3,e2005075,PLOS,Taxonomy is a scientific discipline that has provided the universal naming and classification system of biodiversity for centuries and continues effectively to accommodate new knowledge. A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects. They also assert that the lack of governance of taxonomy damages conservation efforts. harms the credibility of science. and is costly to society. Despite its fairly recent release. Garnett and Christidis’ proposition has already been rejected by a number of colleagues [2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8]. Herein. we contribute to the conversation between taxonomists and conservation biologists aiming to clarify some misunderstandings and issues in the proposition by Garnett and Christidis. Placing governance over the science of taxonomy blurs the distinction between taxonomy and nomenclature. Garnett and Christidis’s proposal is far-reaching but represents a narrow perspective of taxonomy. as utilized by conservation. and reflects an increasingly broad misunderstanding throughout biology of the scientific basis of taxonomy. formalized nomenclature. and the relationship …,True,ptBTOJMAAAAJ:PpfTWA6RG0gC,119,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005075,9850461464319876347,/scholar?cites=9850461464319876347,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005075,0,0,0

The novel species status was confirmed using morphological characters. sequencing of the ribosomal 5.8S RNA gene and the flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS). the β-tubulin gene. and the high mobility group (HMG) of the MAT2 mating type gene. Cylindrocladium buxicola is proposed as a new name. Fifteen isolates from the UK and one isolate from New Zealand were paired in all combinations but no fertile perithecia were obtained suggesting that C. buxicola is heterothallic and all isolates belonged to one mating type. AFLP analysis showed that the isolates collected in the UK and New Zealand are genetically homogenous.

Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae). a group which demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of garden plants?

Support for the monophyly of the Panicoideae and its sister relationship to the Centothecoideae was found. The tribe Andropogoneae is clearly monophyletic but its relationship to the rest of the Panicoideae is ambiguous. Accordingly. the tribe Paniceae can be interpreted either as monophyletic or paraphyletic. Within the Paniceae. two major clades were identified: one formed by American native taxa with x= 10. and the other formed by Pantropical taxa with x= 9.
