Rev.,,1847,,Americans long ago dedicated themselves to the removal of social and economic barriers that unfairly burdened racial and ethnic minorities. women. and older people. Discrimination against individuals on the basis of their membership in artificially defined groups was rejected. The current crisis in health care expenditures. however. may be reviving some old prejudices and creating new ones. particularly against older people. Questions have been raised about older Americans. their place in society. and their rightful claim on resources such as health care.

88455,Roundabout crash prediction models,2009,SA Turner and Aaron P Roozenburg and AW Smith,,New Zealand Transport Agency Research Report,386,,,The management of speed is considered an important safety issue at roundabouts. The approach speed and negotiating speed through roundabouts depends on the geometric design of the roundabout and sight distance. In New Zealand and in Australia. the design standards recommend long approach sight distances and provision of relatively high design speeds. This is in contrast to European roundabouts. where visibility is normally restricted and the geometric design encourages slow approach and negotiation speeds. This work. undertaken in 2006. extends previous research by the authors developing crash prediction models at roundabouts to include sight distance. intersection layout and observed speed variables. Models have been produced for the major motor vehicles only. pedestrians versus motor vehicles and cyclists versus motor vehicle crash types. Flow-only models have also been produced for roundabouts on roads with high speed limits. The models produced indicate that roundabouts with lower speeds (observed and speed limit). fewer approach lanes and reduced visibilities have lower crash rates.(a),True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:QI7uKX5mnFEC,32,https://trid.trb.org/view/914540,9556651759194684897,/scholar?cites=9556651759194684897,,,0,0,0

The WOx films used as anodes also contained Pt ‘micro’-centers. Comparative oxidation studies were also carried out using antimony doped SnO2 anodes. More rapid (COOH)2 oxidation rates were observed for the WOx based anodes than for the antimony doped SnO2 anodes. The (COOH)2 oxidation reaction studied under the conditions used in this work was shown to be activation rather than mass transport controlled. The (COOH)2 oxidation rate constant was found to be independent of the applied potential using the WOx based anodes. This likely suggests that a chemical reaction is involved in the (COOH)2 oxidation reaction.

Water. Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA) commissioned the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research (ARIER) to undertake research to evaluate detection methods and sampling designs used to determine the abundance of feral cats (Felis catus) that have established wild populations in Australia. Stage one of the project. undertaken at Anglesea in Victoria in September 2007. investigated the detection probability of cage traps. leghold traps. a DNA sampling device. heat-in-motion activated digital cameras and sand plots (Robley et al. 2008). This required the capture of feral cats. fitting GPS data-logging collars. mapping their areas of activity and monitoring their encounter with the various devices. Digital cameras provided the most robust detection data for feral cats. Modelling of control efficacy determined that the probability of correctly concluding that a cat population had decreased was highest for the highest level of monitoring (49 cameras for 20 nights. set at one camera per 2 km2).,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:H_jBuBxbQIAC,27,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Robley/publication/275155842_Evaluation_of_camera_trap_sampling_designs_used_to_determine_change_in_occupancy_rate_and_abundance_of_feral_cats/links/55dbb9b508ae9d6594936883/Evaluation-of-camera-trap-sampling-designs-used-to-determine-change-in-occupancy-rate-and-abundance-of-feral-cats.pdf,9670327622172929149,/scholar?cites=9670327622172929149,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Robley/publication/275155842_Evaluation_of_camera_trap_sampling_designs_used_to_determine_change_in_occupancy_rate_and_abundance_of_feral_cats/links/55dbb9b508ae9d6594936883/Evaluation-of-camera-trap-sampling-designs-used-to-determine-change-in-occupancy-rate-and-abundance-of-feral-cats.pdf,0,0,0

To determine whether cocaine has any effect on uptake during pregnancy. we evaluated the ability of the term pregnant human uterus to take up [3H]-norepinephrine (9 x 10 (-8) mol/L) and the ability of cocaine (10 (-6)-10 (-8) mol/L) to block this uptake. Because d-propranolol has been shown to block the direct effects of cocaine on the pregnant rabbit uterus. we also evaluated the ability of d-propranolol (2 x 10 (-6) mol/L) to block the effect of cocaine on catecholamine uptake. The ability of the Uptake 2 inhibitor hydrocortisone (2 x 10 (-5) mol/L) to block catecholamine uptake was also studied. We found that [3H]-norepinephrine was taken up by both the pregnant myometrium and endometrium. and that cocaine blocked this uptake by up to 55% at concentrations as low as 10 (-7) mol/L. D-propranolol had no effect on the ability of cocaine to block catecholamine uptake. Hydrocortisone blocked uptake by the endometrium by 15% but did not block uptake by the myometrium. We conclude that the pregnant human uterus at term retains the ability to take up catecholamines and that cocaine blocks this extraneuronal uptake. This may explain. in part. the association of cocaine use with premature labor.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC,26,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2067771,9765321225592682384,/scholar?cites=9765321225592682384,,,0,0,0

As such additional dimensions are incorporated into a constitutive model. it becomes progressively more complex and challenging to fit uniquely without invoking unrealistic numbers of fitting attempts starting from myriad sets of trial parameters. For 8-parameter constitutive equations similar to the ones investigated here. the literature reports fitting with 28 (256) starting sets of trial parameters. requiring 256 nonlinear optimizations using special programming. thus making such procedures impractical for many applications.

Dorsiflexion of the ankle. external rotation of the leg. or a combination of both can disrupt the syndesmotic ligament complex. including the anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments. Diagnostic maneuvers. such as the squeeze test and the external rotation test. plus radiographic findings help make the diagnosis. Less severe sprains can be treated nonoperatively with protected weight bearing. but grade 3 sprains require surgical anatomic reduction of the syndesmotic joint. If misdiagnosed or managed incorrectly. syndesmotic injuries can lead to unfavorable late sequelae.

They contain six known species of Mabuya skinks. Phylogeographical relationships within and among the relatively widespread taxa M. stangeri. M. spinalis and M. delalandii were inferred. based on ≈ 1 kbp of the cytochrome b gene (mitochondrial DNA). Reciprocal monophyly of M. spinalis and M. stangeri was established. which may have arisen from an early Pliocene/late Miocene cladogenetic event. Considerable between‐island sequence divergence was detected among M. spinalis. which appears to have colonized the older islands (Sal and Boavista) first. Much lower sequence divergence was found in M. delalandii. indicating a more recent range expansion. Here. evidence points to colonization of the younger islands of Brava and Fogo soon after appearance.

88553,Landmark-defense and scramble competition mating systems in two Australian tachinid flies (Diptera),1995,John Alcock and Andrew P Smith,,Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society,,85-94,Kansas Entomological Society,"Two species of Australian tachinid flies exhibit distinctly different mate-locating tactics. Males of Microtopesa sinuata Donovan engage in landmark-territoriality with individuals defending small perching areas at local ""hilltops"" along a ridgeline. Territory ownership is established through ritualized aerial contests. Different populations of males rank perch sites similarly. Some males exhibit strong fidelity to a given site over a period of as much as 2 wk.

88554,Parental perceptions of information about medication prescribed for their children.,1993,AM Counsell and DC Geddis and AR Smith,106,The New Zealand Medical Journal,956,205-206,,AIMS: The study aimed to examine parents' perceptions of the information provided to them on prescribed medication; how it might be improved and; parental level of knowledge of medication administration. METHODS: 245 parents completed a questionnaire at a preschool health day. The questionnaire covered parental opinion on whether the doctor provided enough information about illness and medication. recall of pharmacist's instructions on medication. parental general knowledge of medication and what parents wanted to know about medication for their children. RESULTS: The findings indicated there was an overall lack of information from the doctor on side effects and what to do if problems occurred with medication. Furthermore. half (49%) of the parents did not recall receiving any information from the pharmacist. Parents appeared to understand the basics of medication administration. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that improvements should be made regarding the information given to parents on prescribed medication. This may improve satisfaction with the service received from health professionals. such as doctors and pharmacists. and increase patient compliance with treatment regimes.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:pk6FPx6l9xIC,15,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8341440,15358906961458688391,/scholar?cites=15358906961458688391,,,0,0,0

The literature tends to frame informal learning. formal learning and non-formal learning as discrete activities and such a view fails to take into account the interconnections between them. Web 2.0 virtual social learning systems offer ways in which opportunities for informal learning can occur. often as a means of supporting formal education. With social constructivism being widely accepted as a theory for teaching and learning it is surprising how little is understood about learning in virtual social learning systems.In this paper four case studies are presented to illuminate the power of virtual social learning environments in supporting informal learning and peer learning and challenges associated with its use in formal education. Although tentative because of the scale of the study. data from this research points to an inverse correlation between the opportunities for face-to-face communication and use of the virtual social environment.

The lower limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 8.697 x 10-3 µg/ml and limit of quantification (LOQ) was found to be 26.355 x 10-3 µg/ml in formulation. The different experimental parameters affecting the fluorescence intensity were carefully studied and optimized. Common excipients used as additives in pharmaceutical preparations which do not interfere in the proposed method. The proposed method was applied successfully for determination of flutamide in the pharmaceutical preparation. The percentage recovery was found to be 99.53±0.5283.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:9VeumLvkZSQC,13,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.526.6991,3905327858528199886,/scholar?cites=3905327858528199886,,,0,0,0

Twelve low bloat (402 ± 12 kg liveweight. LW) and 12 high bloat (334 ± 13 kg LW) Friesian × Jersey mixed age (2–4 years old) non-lactating and non-pregnant female cattle were used in a late autumn (June) grazing experiment involving two periods (P1 and P2). Methane emissions were measured during 5 (P1) or 4 (P2) consecutive days using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique. In P1 only. titanium dioxide (TiO2) was used for faecal output and feed dry matter intake (DMI) estimations and it was found that the selection lines did not differ in DMI per unit of LW (17.3 ± 1.3 v. 15.4 ± 1.3 g DMI/kg LW.

Research has demonstrated that caffeine has beneficial effects on performance of tasks requiring sustained attention and that these effects are readily observed in low alertness situations (after lunch; at night; when a person has a cold). Although many of the studies of caffeine have used very large single doses. recent studies have demonstrated that beneficial effects can be observed with more realistic doses and drinking regimes that equate to real-life intake.

The experimental arm was exposed to CNTF (0.01-I OOng/mI). NGF (IOOng/ml) or NT-3 (2Ong/ml) for 24 hours prior to radiation. and control and experimental arms radiated using a cobalt 60 irradiator at a dose rate of. 87 Gy/min with doses from 2 Gy to IO Gy. Oligodendrocytes were identified using an 04 antibody. assessed for viability at 5 days using an MTT assay and counted using a phase contrast microscope. Combination studies of CNTF and NT-3 were also performed. BrdU studies were performed to determine if the various neurotrophins induced proliferation. with BrdU added for the 24 hour period prior to radiation only. for the S day period following radiation only. or for both periods combined.Results: The proportion of mature oligodendrocytes surviving 5 days after irradiation was not significantly increased by NGF. and was only modestly increased by NT-3.

B.C.. and was evaluated for its ability to treat the water supply (low‐pH. low‐alkalinity water from a creek source) for corrosion control and to condition it for flocculation. Conducted over two months. detailed testing of the limestone contactor involved evaluating performance when it was open and when it was closed to the atmosphere. at various contact times. and at a wide range of flows. Results show that a limestone contactor is effective in treating Port Simpson water for corrosion control and that performance did not deteriorate during continuous operation for 20 months. Although the raw water samples tested had a limited range of color. results showed that the contactor is effective for conditioning water for flocculation to remove color.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:dY-VugTTHzcC,11,https://awwa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1551-8833.1992.tb07356.x,3009957032023002225,/scholar?cites=3009957032023002225,,,0,0,0
88601,Steam iron,1963,,,,,,,This invention relates to an electrically heated flatiron. especially a steam iron also useful as a dry iron. Electrically heated flatirons normally have a resistance heating element in the soleplate and have a thermostat in conjunction therewith to maintain the Solepiate at the desired temperature. The thermostat is manually ad justable to permit selection of appropriate ironing temper ature for fabrics of various compositions. While the thermostat necessarily is located at or near the Soleplate. the adjusting means preferably is at a cooler location. where it can be manipulated readily by the user of the iron. A temperature scale calibrated according to fabric composition is a customary accompanying feature. Steam irons have. in addition to such provisions for temperature control. certain aparatus features necessitated by the adaptation for steain ironing.

It also presents data pertaining to the relationship of ozone therapy on pelvic adhesion formation. Most data were performed on animals and very few human studies existed in the literature. Results suggested that ozone therapy could have beneficial effect on tubal occlusion. could protect from endometritis and vaginitis. might protect ovaries from ischemia and oocyte loss and finally might lead to less formation of pelvic adhesions.

88666,In silico characterization and homology modeling of a cyanobacterial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase enzyme,2013,Aubrey A Smith and Amanda Caruso,2013,Structural Biology,,,Hindawi,ATP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is a key catabolic enzyme found in various species of bacteria. plants. and yeast. PEPCK may play a role in carbon fixation in aquatic ecosystems consisting of photosynthetic cyanobacteria. RuBisCO-based CO2 fixation is prevalent in cyanobacteria through C3 intermediates; however. a significant amount of carbon flows into C4 acids during cyanobacterial photosynthesis. This indicates that a C4 mechanism for inorganic carbon fixation is prevalent in cyanobacteria with PEPCK as an important β-carboxylation enzyme. Newly available genomic information has confirmed the existence of putative PEPCK genes in a number of cyanobacterial species. This project represents the first structural and physicochemical study of cyanobacterial PEPCKs. Biocomputational analyses of cyanobacterial PEPCKs were performed and a homology model of Cyanothece sp. PCC 7424 PEPCK was generated. The modeled enzyme consists of an N-terminal and C-terminal domains with a mixed α/β topology with the active site located in a deep cleft between the two domains. Active site residues and those involved in metal ion coordination were found to be conserved in the cyanobacterial enzymes. An active site lid which is known to close upon substrate binding was also predicted. Amino acid stretches that are unique to cyanobacterial PEPCKs were also identified.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2013/370820.pdf,8763768063808657756,/scholar?cites=8763768063808657756,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2013/370820.pdf,0,0,0

There will be over 1 million hospitalizations for acutely decompensated heart failure this year. The goals of treatment for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure are to lower cardiac filling pressures. remove fluids and improve symptoms of dyspnea. decrease vascular resistance. and increase cardiac output without activating the RAAS. There are few guidelines for the treatment of individuals with acutely decompensated heart failure and many different agents have been used in patients with this disease. Many of these drugs are not completely effective and may lead to serious adverse events. BNP is a natural protein produced by myocardial cells in response to ventricular distension. and its level is dramatically increased in patients with heart failure.

After reviewing the appropriate clinical literature for each of the problem areas being addressed. the nine raters assessed each site's potential as a psychological resource for those in need. After ratings were completed. raters selected the preferred sites. Three sites from each category are summarized here. The top sites for anxiety disorders exhibited various strengths. ranging from support ideas. to clarity. to evaluation. to encouragement. The three parenting sites were chosen due to their abundance of parenting resources and their many suggestions for obtaining further information. All three sites for eating disorders were rated as having the most complete coverage overall. providing comprehensive surveys of important topics within a search.

Cham,Venous thrombosis is a common complication in cancer patients. and some cancer chemotherapies are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The regulatory mechanisms that control thrombus formation and subsequent resolution in patients with cancer. however. are incompletely understood. and novel treatments for cancer-associated thrombosis may arise from a better understanding of such mechanisms. In this chapter. pathways that regulate cancer-associated thrombus formation are outlined. and the effects of anti-angiogenic cancer chemotherapies on venous thrombus resolution are highlighted.

The alkali picrate extracting ability and selectivity of these free ligands was investigated using a liquid–liquid dichloromethane–water extraction study. Both open-chain oligomer frameworks display unexpectedly high extraction efficiency (EE) values for specific guest ions (EE = 57% Na+ extracted by 1. and EE = 39% Cs+ extracted by 2). These extraction values are comparable to macrocyclic analogues and their ion selectivities follow the ‘same-fit’ concept that has been extensively reported for fixed pocket systems.

Figurative language includes tropes. one of which is metaphor. The research in metaphor has been extensive and vast in disciplines like communication. psychology. philosophy. linguistics. education. and theology. Because metaphor is a critical component in religious discourse and since the sermon is a vital component in the discourse about the relationship between God and the people in the pew. metaphor can be a beneficial study for preaching theorists.The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of metaphors in listener-sensitive homiletics.

And Public Law 94-142 clearly mandates appropriate programming for all handicapped students. Yet. seriously disturbeð children–especially adölescents–are unlikely to be served or are served by agencies outside the public schools. Grosenick (1981) has reported a heavy reliance by school districts upon private schools and other out-of-district placements. Although some public school programs. such as the Madison School Program (Braaten. 1979). exist at the secondary level. few published research reports are available on successful or effective educational programs for the behaviorally disordered adolescent.

Retrieved June",,2013,,By integrating expert analysis of homeland threats. vulnerabilities and the consequences of adverse events. risk assessments play an increasingly important role in supporting US homeland security decision-making and planning. They help inform Department of Homeland Security (DHS) risk management decisions on operational priorities and resource allocations given a broad range of risks that the nation faces from terrorist threats. natural disasters. and other hazards. Such assessments often depend on receiving tailored threat judgments from intelligence analysts and others with expert knowledge about terrorist threats. However. producing useful threat judgments for DHS risk assessments is complicated by basic differences in how the risk analysis and intelligence communities approach such problems.

88814,Computerised Resources for Historical Research: Calendars. Chronology and the Life of Jesus Christ,2008,Alexandra Smith,,"Bridging the Gaps: Sources, Methodology and Approaches to Religion in History",,29-56,,The calendars of ancient and medieval Europe were based on astronomical observations. and although the Julian calendar. the primary calendar of the Middle Ages. was divorced from the phases of the Moon. observations of the celestial sphere still formed the basis for setting the moveable Christian feasts. When establishing chronological sequences. historians do not always find the relevant calendrical dates in the sources. and are forced to look to details such as the timing of the phases of the Moons. or dates of eclipses. to establish a chronology. Despite recent advances in computing. including the development of a variety of programs to compute astronomical events that are relatively easy for non-astronomers to use. many scholars still turn to out of date information. such as the three volumes of FK Ginzel’s Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie. dating between 1906 and 1914. This chapter presents information needed to understand these calendars. and the computerised tools available to manipulate the data. As an example of the information and resources available. the author examines the evidence for the lifetime of Jesus Christ. which includes a mysterious star. two lunar eclipses. a solar eclipse and historical evidence. It demonstrates some of the tools available currently and emphasises the value of using the historical sources in conjunction with up-to-date astronomical data.The computer has brought many significant changes to the way in which we communicate and conduct research.

Many people are sensitive to physical discrimination but do not think about language discrimination. making character judgments based on how something is stated rather than what is stated. Media such as television. film. music. magazines. and newspapers perpetuate such discrimination by exaggerating language stereotypes. Members of the upper-class are usually depicted as speakers of Standard English. while the poor and uneducated are often depicted as speakers of dialects such as Southern. Brooklyn.

The market for products using MAP has grown rapidly because of the benefits that this technique offers. particularly in respect to maintaining the quality of food throughout the extended shelf-life that the application of the method achieves. Estimates of sales indicate that around 1.6 billion modified-atmosphere (MA) packs of food were sold in 1990; this had risen to 2.6 billion by 1997 and is expected to exceed 3.3 billion in 2002.MAP can be described as a food preservation technique in which the composition of the atmosphere surrounding the food. inside its hermetically sealed packaging. is different from the normal composition of air.

88823,Environmental performance indicators: the water industry of england and wales,2001,A Johnston and A Smith,15,Water and environment journal,1,40-45,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Water companies in England and Wales produce reports using environmental performance indicators which have been developed in‐house. However. there is no recognised methodology for the development of these indicators. and an analysis of available guidance led to the proposal of an appropriate model. This model was tested by semi‐structured interviews of water‐company managers. and a questionnaire was completed by managers from other industries. The responses from the interviews supported the inclusive. quality‐driven approach advocated by the model. and indicated a need to examine (a) the style of management. (b) the staffing structure in water companies. (c) the connection between environmental management systems and indicator development. (d) types of objectives and targets. and (e) the use of indicators as public‐relations tools.

Computer programs have been written in the MATLAB environment for the following purposes: automatic retrieval of SAMS data from NASA CDROM disks. computation of power spectral densities for SAMS data and construction of input patterns for the training of a multi-layer neural network (MNN). The MNN has been trained using the backpropagation learning algorithm and the SAMS data collected on the STS-50 Space Shuttle mission for three crew exercise events. It is found that the trained MNN is highly successful in classifying events.

The term"" foundation subjects"" refers to the three core subjects as well as geography. history. technology. art. music. physical education. and modern foreign languages. While each of the foundation subjects is mandated. the method of instruction is not. and it is further recognized that a complete curriculum will go beyond the designated foundation subjects to include other areas. Each of the foundation subjects is articulated in the national curriculum in a series of Attainment Targets (broad objectives). and each Attainment Target is divided into 10 levels of attainment. Each of these is in turn defined by a series of statements of attainment. as demonstrated in examples from the Reading Attainment Target.

With this surge in upper tract endoscopy has come a rise in the variety of medical instruments available to the endourologist. Beginning with rigid instruments that offered only a limited view. technology has advanced both flexible and rigid instruments that allow access to the entire urinary tract for examination and treatment. Lenses have been designed to give a clearer and wider view of the kidney and ureter. and forceps and graspers have been developed to treat the underlying pathologic conditions.

Noise had no effect on the number of items recalled nor did it modify the interaction between day/night and serial position. The difference between day and night did not reflect a change in recall strategy. but noise did influence the order of recall.

Yet. the supply of such opportunities has been slow to materialize despite a proliferation of impact funds and other sustainability-focused funders seeking to direct global capital flows into the sector. This can be explained. in part. by the heterogeneous. multi-layered. and fragmented nature of agricultural production systems and food value chains and the poorly developed knowledge systems available to inform new types of investment.

88861,Study into electrically shaft driven air cycle machines,2018,A Smith and T Childs and R Chen,,,,1-9,,Air Cycle Machines (ACMs) were developed to meet the cabin conditioning requirement onboard gas turbine powered aircraft. Typical ACMs utilise a compressor. heat exchanger and turbine to employ a reverse-Brayton thermodynamic cycle on high pressure. engine bled air. This Environmental Control System (ECS). is implemented in an open loop architecture whereby the processed air is used to manage the thermal loads of the aircrafts subsystem which are typically not re-introduced into the cycle to recover the waste heat energy. As the cycle relies on engine bleed air as a power source. engine fuel efficiency is compromised. The industry drive for increased energy efficiency and more electric aircraft have prompted design advances intended to reduce engine bleed air and power auxiliary systems electrically. This is seen on modern civil aircraft such as the Boeing 787. whose ECS is powered by high pressure air generated from electric driven compressors.This study utilises simulation methods to quantify the performance benefits and determine the feasibility of powering an ECS using an electric motor alone. or injunction with high pressure air to create a hybrid system. The findings suggest that turbomachinery designed to work pneumatically won’t operate under direct electric drive as the corrected mass flow through the electric systems is elevated. Utilising alternative turbomachinery. an ECS driven by motoring the shaft provides an enhanced cooling capability for a given power input when compared to traditional architectures.

88868,Reshaping Health Care Through mHealth: Lessons from the On-Demand Economy,2017,Andrew D Scarffe and Alexander D Smith and David Barrett,,,,23-37,Palgrave Macmillan. London,On-demand economics and mHealth technologies hold tremendous opportunity for health care to digitalize and incorporate itself into individuals’ everyday routines through media. such as mobile applications or online programs. These concepts could potentially change a culture of reactionary and passive consumer use of health systems to one that is preventative. proactive. and empowers the patient. while at the same time returning value to the greater health system. This chapter aims to introduce the concept of the on-demand economy and illustrate how this new model has affected the health-care sector to date. particularly through mHealth innovation. The chapter then introduces a potential future state for health care. highlighting how concepts from the on-demand economy could shape health care to promote shared value across the system.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:654Jc7Ppz2kC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-349-95173-4_2,2233027166570936910,/scholar?cites=2233027166570936910,,,0,0,0

Ideas of responsible leadership practice address how social responsibility and leadership interrelate (Waldman. 2011). This interrelationship is receiving interest against a recent background of economic crisis. concerns for gender equality in leadership roles. and perceptions that business leaders’ decision-making and behavior is often unethical and irresponsible (Voetglin. Patzer & Scherer. 2012). Responsible leadership is also attracting attention in response to and as a means to call into question ‘deficient’leadership theories (Waldman & Galvin. 2008). These include capitalist models of leadership that do not take wider stakeholder needs and claims into account (Maak & Pless. 2006) and focus largely on the internal organization. failing to address the economic and moral implications of globalization (Voetglin et al.. 2012). The growing body of literature on responsible leadership mainly places an emphasis on theorizing with relatively limited attention to models of responsible leadership practice.In this chapter we draw on the experience of a collaborative theory building exercise around women’s leadership experiences as a foundation upon which we propose a model that facilitates and enables dialogue. The model allows for inclusive processes to attend to competing and diverse stakeholder claims. This proposed model emerges from experience and practice in a higher education context. The strength of this setting when working collaboratively is that group …,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:MNNNGtAgD4EC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/53937985/Collaborative_Theory_Building_on_Womens_Leadership_Chapter_2016.pdf,4790431623228248352,/scholar?cites=4790431623228248352,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53937985/Collaborative_Theory_Building_on_Womens_Leadership_Chapter_2016.pdf,0,0,0

Butyrate. a short‐chain fatty acid that is derived from the bacterial fermentation of ingested fiber. inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells at physiologically relevant concentrations. Butyrate serves as the primary energy source for the non‐cancerous colonocyte. In contrast. colorectal cancer cells shift cellular metabolism toward glycolysis and increased glucose uptake and utilization (the Warburg effect). Here. we sought to determine how butyrate oxidation is impacted by the pro‐inflammatory cytokine interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) in colorectal cancer cells. In this study. we used a colon cancer cell line (HCT116 cells) in a substrate‐limited media (1X KHB with 2.5 mM glucose) and butyrate oxidation was measured with or without IL‐1β [1ng/mL] treatment.

The United Kingdom outlines their national strategy in “Every Child Matters” and the United States defines rigorous learning goals within “No Child Left Behind.” Despite almost a decade of work to transform the quality and reach of education. these strategies have proven insufficient to significantly raise citizens' academic performance.The problem is that “top down” strategies themselves are part of the systemic issue.

88888,Maximum of oil output of a treadle-powered peanut oil press,2007,Ravi Mahendra Patel,,,,,,The manual processing of food products has become a substantial part of the daily routine of a typical household in the developing world. Consumption of oil is an essential part of an individual's diet and thus. the production of oil is an essential activity. In many communities. this oil is obtained by manually pressing it from peanuts. In order to more efficiently and easily express oil from peanuts. a design for a treadle-powered peanut oil press was created. My thesis work will attempt to further increase the amount of oil extracted by optimizing the design of this peanut oil press. The press transfers the motion of the treadle to the horizontal motion of a piston that presses the peanuts via a rotating cam. The focus of this thesis will be optimizing the design of the cam with respect to oil yield. The shape of the cam determines the displacement profile of the piston's compression of the peanuts. I will determine the optimal profile by designing and performing experiments on a variety of different displacement profiles and measuring the amount of oil extracted from the pressed peanuts. The results of these experiments will then determine the optimal cam design.,True,8pK0oMgAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC,2,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/40465,8836688467333299255,/scholar?cites=8836688467333299255,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/40465/191747240-MIT.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

88899,Caffeine and fatigue: Mental performance and driving,2000,C Brice and A Smith,,,,,,The majority of studies to date have investigated the behavioural effects of caffeine in laboratory experiments using artificial tasks. It is now important to ask whether similar effects are observed in simulations of real life activities. such as driving. and to consider whether consumption of caffeine can reduce fatigue over long time periods. for instance over the working day. A number of studies show that caffeine can improve driving performance of fatigued drivers. In the current study 3mg/kg caffeine was found to improve steering accuracy in drivers carrying out a one-hour simulated drive. In addition. measures of mood and performance of artificial tasks were recorded in this study and these also showed the benefits of consuming caffeine. These findings suggest that changes in the laboratory may reflect a general benefit of caffeine that is also observed in real-1ife situations. Further evidence from Smith examining the effects of caffeine on performance efficiency over the working day has shown the benefits of caffeine consumption on measures of sustained attention and alertness. Furthermore. this study also provided evidence to suggest that caffeine is often consumed when alertness is low to maximise alertness and performance efficiency. The implications of these findings in terms of road safety are also considered.(a) For the covering entry of this conference. please see ITRD abstract no.

Helsinki (Finlandia), Agosto 2-6, 1999..",,,,El objetivo de esta investigación fue revisar los efectos de la cafeína sobre los humanos adultos. Muchas de las generalizaciones sobre los efectos de la cafeína sobre el comportamiento. se basan en estudios que han usado grandes dosis de cafeína. los sujetos son estudiantes y las pruebas sólo se realizan en la mañana. Este trabajo se realizó para demostrar que pequeñas dosis múltiples a través del día producen el mismo efecto benéfico que una sola dosis en el día. A los participantes se les suministraron 60 mg de cafeína y se les solicitó someterse a diferentes pruebas. Los resultados mostraron que esa dosis de cafeína llevó a un mejor ánimo ya una mejor codificación de nueva información. La literatura reporta que la cafeína aumenta la atención. reduce la fatiga y lleva a un mejor desempeño de tareas de vigilancia y de tareas pequeñas que requieren respuesta sostenida. Los investigadores demostraron que estos efectos son más aparentes cuando la atención es reducida por factores como privación del sueño. trabajo en horas de la noche o prolongado. Los efectos positivos de la cafeína pueden ser observados en poco o no consumidores lo cual sugiere que la abstinencia no es la razón de los efectos. Los efectos negativos se relacionan con altos niveles de consumo y en ciertos individuos. Sin embargo. esto debe diferenciarse de los cambios en el comportamiento observados cuando la cafeína se consume con moderación por la mayoría de la población. Generalmente el consumo de cafeína es bien controlado y el patrón de consumo sugiere que los individuos ingieren cafeína para recuperar la atención.
