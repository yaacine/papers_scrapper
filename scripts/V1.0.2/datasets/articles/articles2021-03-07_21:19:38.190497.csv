Heterochrony—change in the timing or rate of developmental events—has been implicated in the evolution of major vertebrate lineages such as mammals 2. including humans 1. Birds are the most speciose land vertebrates. with more than 10.000 living species 3 representing a bewildering array of ecologies. Their anatomy is radically different from that of other vertebrates. The unique bird skull houses two highly specialized systems: the sophisticated visual and neuromuscular coordination system 4. 5 allows flight coordination and exploitation of diverse visual landscapes. and the astonishing variations of the beak enable a wide range of avian lifestyles.

(ii) the lizard–tuatara clade. or (iii) Diapsida (a clade composed of (i) and (ii)). We reanalysed a recent dataset that allied turtles with the lizard–tuatara clade and found that the inclusion of the stem turtle Proganochelys quenstedti and the ‘parareptile’ Eunotosaurus africanus results in a single overriding morphological signal. with turtles outside Diapsida.

A revision of fossil squamates from the Maastrichtian and Paleocene of North America shows that lizards and snakes suffered a devastating mass extinction coinciding with the Chicxulub asteroid impact. Species-level extinction was 83%. and the K-Pg event resulted in the elimination of many lizard groups and a dramatic decrease in morphological disparity. Survival was associated with small body size and perhaps large geographic range. The recovery was prolonged; diversity did not approach Cretaceous levels until 10 My after the extinction. and resulted in a dramatic change in faunal composition.

The homologies of its approximately 50 bones have been the subject of debate for more than 200 years. Although most of those homologies are now firmly established. the evolutionary origin of the dorsal median nuchal bone of the carapace remains unresolved. We propose a novel hypothesis in which the nuchal is derived from the paired. laterally positioned cleithra—dorsal elements of the ancestral tetrapod pectoral girdle that are otherwise retained among extant tetrapods only in frogs. This hypothesis is supported by origin of the nuchal as paired. mesenchymal condensations likely derived from the neural crest followed by a unique two‐stage pattern of ossification.

Much of bird anatomical variety is expressed in the beak; but the beak itself. largely formed of the premaxillary bone. is set upon a shortened face and a bulbous. enlarged braincase. Here. we use original anatomical observations and reconstructions to describe the overall form of the avian skull in a larger context and to provide a general account of the evolutionary transformation from the early dinosaur skull—the skull of an archosaurian macropredator—to that of modern birds. Facial shortening. the enlargement of the braincase around an enlarged brain (with consequential reduction of circumorbital elements and the adductor chamber). and general thinning and looser articulation of bones are trends.

Although the external cranial anatomy of Rooneyia is well studied. various authors have suggested that Rooneyia is a stem haplorhine. stem strepsirrhine. stem tarsiiform. or stem anthropoid. Here we describe the internal cranial anatomy of the Rooneyia holotype based on micro-computed tomography and discuss the phylogenetic implications of this anatomy. Precise measurements of the natural endocast filling the braincase of the Rooneyia holotype reveal that the genus had a relative brain size comparable to some living callitrichines and strepsirrhines. Rooneyia was thus probably more encephalized than any other known omomyiform. adapiform. or plesiadapiform.

Novel computed tomography datasets reveal broad conservation of the cucullaris in gnathostomes. including coelacanth and caecilian. two sarcopterygians previously thought to lack it. In chicken. lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) adjacent to occipital somites is a recently identified embryonic source of cervical musculature. We fate-map this mesoderm in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). which retains external gills. and demonstrate its contribution to posterior gill-levator muscles and the cucullaris. Accordingly. LPM adjacent to the occipital somites should be regarded as posterior cranial mesoderm.

To identify genes that might regulate retinal development. gene expression in the developing retina was profiled at multiple time points using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). The expression patterns of 1.051 genes that showed developmentally dynamic expression by SAGE were investigated using in situ hybridization. A molecular atlas of gene expression in the developing and mature retina was thereby constructed. along with a taxonomic classification of developmental gene expression patterns. Genes were identified that label both temporal and spatial subsets of mitotic progenitor cells. For each developing and mature major retinal cell type. genes selectively expressed in that cell type were identified. The gene expression profiles of retinal Müller glia and mitotic progenitor cells were found to be highly similar. suggesting that Müller glia might serve to produce multiple retinal cell types under the right conditions. In addition. multiple transcripts that were evolutionarily conserved that did not appear to encode open reading frames of more than 100 amino acids in length (“noncoding RNAs”) were found to be dynamically and specifically expressed in developing and mature retinal cell types.

They are released physiologically under normal conditions but their rate of release is higher under pathological conditions such as tumors. Once released they end up in the systemic circulation and have been found and characterized in all biofluids such as plasma. serum. cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). breast milk. ascites. and urine. Microvesicles represent the status of the donor cell they are released from and they are currently under intense investigation as a potential source for disease biomarkers. Currently. the “gold standard” for isolating microvesicles is ultracentrifugation. although alternative techniques such as affinity purification have been explored. Viscosity is the resistance of a fluid to a deforming force by either shear or tensile stress. The different chemical and molecular compositions of biofluids have an effect on its viscosity and this could affect movements of the particles inside the fluid. In this manuscript we addressed the issue of whether viscosity has an effect on sedimentation efficiency of microvesicles using ultracentrifugation. We used different biofluids and spiked them with polystyrene beads and assessed their recovery using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis.

The potential for clinical translation of strategies to re-express miR-30-5p as a therapeutic approach was further encouraged by the capacity of miR-30c and miR-30 mix to reduce tumor burden and metastatic potential in vivo in …,True,xpe7bloAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,151,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/74/6/1801.short,18122635038879281478,/scholar?cites=18122635038879281478,,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/74/6/1801.full.pdf,0,0,0
1168282,A potential role for intragenic miRNAs on their hosts' interactome,2010,Ludwig Christian G Hinske and Pedro AF Galante and Winston P Kuo and Lucila Ohno-Machado,11,BMC genomics,1,1-13,BioMed Central,"miRNAs are small. non-coding RNA molecules that mainly act as negative regulators of target gene messages. Due to their regulatory functions. they have lately been implicated in several diseases. including malignancies. Roughly half of known miRNA genes are located within previously annotated protein-coding regions (""intragenic miRNAs""). Although a role of intragenic miRNAs as negative feedback regulators has been speculated. to the best of our knowledge there have been no conclusive large-scale studies investigating the relationship between intragenic miRNAs and host genes and their pathways. miRNA-containing host genes were three times longer. contained more introns and had longer 5' introns compared to a randomly sampled gene cohort. These results are consistent with the observation that more than 60% of intronic miRNAs are found within the first five 5' introns. Host gene 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) were 40% longer and contained significantly more adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (AREs) compared to a randomly sampled gene cohort. Coincidentally. recent literature suggests that several components of the miRNA biogenesis pathway are required for the rapid decay of mRNAs containing AREs. A high-confidence set of predicted mRNA targets of intragenic miRNAs also shared many of these features with the host genes. Approximately 20% of intragenic miRNAs were predicted to target their host mRNA transcript. Further. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that 22 of the 74 pathways in which host genes were associated showed significant overrepresentation of proteins encoded by the mRNA targets of …",True,xpe7bloAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,151,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-11-533,6500752162795428684,/scholar?cites=6500752162795428684,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-11-533,0,0,0

Unfortunately. a typical model system for squamates (lizards and snakes) has not yet been developed leaving many fundamental questions about morphological evolution unaddressed. New model systems would ideally include clades. rather than single species. that are amenable to both laboratory studies of development and field‐based analyses of ecology and evolution. Combining an understanding of development with an understanding of ecology and evolution within and between closely related species has the potential to create a seamless understanding of how genetic variation underlies ecologically and evolutionarily relevant variation within populations and between species.

By limiting or directing covariation among component traits. modules are expected to represent evolutionary building blocks and to play an important role in morphological diversification. But how stable are patterns of modularity over macroevolutionary timescales? Comparative analyses are needed to address the macroevolutionary effect of modularity. but to date few have been conducted. We describe patterns of skull diversity and modularity in Caribbean Anolis lizards. We first diagnose the primary axes of variation in skull shape and then examine whether diversification of skull shape is concentrated to changes within modules or whether changes arose across the structure as a whole.

Sexually dimorphic traits tend to be incredibly divergent across taxa. Such diversification must arise through evolutionary modifications to sex differences during development. Nevertheless. few studies of dimorphism have attempted to synthesize evolutionary and developmental perspectives. Using geometric morphometric analysis of head shape for 50 Anolis species. we show that two clades have converged on extreme levels of sexual dimorphism through similar. male‐specific changes in facial morphology.

Our goals were to determine whether habitat‐specific differences in hindlimb and toe morphologies occurred in a population in which perch size was variable but not manipulated. whether locomotor behaviors were associated with these morphologies. and whether habitat‐specific traits …,True,3U8FfU8AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,19,https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jzo.12020,9037588713974626870,/scholar?cites=9037588713974626870,,http://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&context=bio_faculty,0,0,0

Increasing global temperatures. in particular. are affecting all aspects of ectotherm biology and life history. Embryonic development is a thermally sensitive period of the organismal lifecycle. yet the impacts of thermal stress on the early development of ectotherms have significantly lagged behind studies of later stages and adult thermal physiology.

Harvard University,Anolis maynardi is an endemic anole from Little Cayman (Cayman Islands) that is characterized by an extremely elongated rostrum in males. In the 1980s. this species was discovered on the nearby island of Cayman Brac where it was likely introduced. Despite its unusual morphology and endemic status. little is known about the abundance. ecology. or natural history of this species. Our data suggest that animals from the two islands are distinct in their morphology. performance. and ecology: Cayman Brac lizards utilize more open habitats. have relatively longer limbs and shorter heads. but higher bite forces on average.

Recent work has shown that precursor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) provide a major contribution to prenatal cortical neurogenesis. and that the SVZ is significantly thicker in gyrencephalic mammals such as primates than it is in lissencephalic mammals including rodents. Identifying characteristics that are shared by or that distinguish cortical precursor cells across mammalian species will shed light on factors that regulate cortical neurogenesis and may point toward mechanisms that underlie the evolutionary expansion of the neocortex in gyrencephalic mammals. We immunostained sections of the developing cerebral cortex from lissencephalic rats. and from gyrencephalic ferrets and macaques to compare the distribution of precursor cell types in each species. We also performed time-lapse imaging of precursor cells in the developing rat neocortex. We show that the distribution of Pax6+ and Tbr2+ precursor cells is similar in lissencephalic rat and gyrencephalic ferret. and different in the gyrencephalic cortex of macaque. We show that mitotic Pax6+ translocating radial glial cells (tRG) are present in the cerebral cortex of each species during and after neurogenesis. demonstrating that the function of Pax6+ tRG cells is not restricted to neurogenesis. Furthermore. we show that Olig2 expression distinguishes two distinct subtypes of Pax6+ tRG cells.

1168339,Bats: A Model for Mammalian Craniofacial Diversification,2020,Jasmin Camacho,,,,,,Phyllostomids are a diverse family of neotropical bats with approximately 200 described living species. Phyllostomids are united by their distinctive noses. which are shaped like a leaf. hence their common name. the New World leaf-nosed bats. Phyllostomids perform a variety of ecologically important functions as- sociated with their diverse skull morphologies. which remarkably. and perhaps uniquely. span a range encom- passing much of the diversity of eutherian mammals as a whole. Fruit-eating bats. for example. disperse seeds and often have flat. primate-like faces. while nectar-feeding bats pollinate flowers and have elongated faces—among the most elongated of all mammals—whose length is correlated to the stalk length of the flowers they pollinate. Interestingly. these shapes and sizes become specialized during the growth of the same masses of embryonic tissues—the craniofacial prominences. However. the developmental mechanisms connecting the genotype and phenotype in these diverse morphologies remains unknown. In this thesis. I present the first characterization of the developmental and molecular bases for morphological and functional diversity in phyllostomid bat skulls. I explored the patterns of morphology and development across representatives of the family using X-ray micro-computed tomography. 3D geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods. I developed a field research program to obtain embryonic tissues from four different bat species with three biological replicates at similar developmental ages. which enabled me to examine the molecular signatures associated with development and …,True,YWVFFdMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37365962,,,,,0,0,0

In this regard. phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast. phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary. but not sufficient. evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism.

We tested this proposition by examining the evolutionary radiation ofAnolis lizards on the four islands of the Greater Antilles. Morphometric analyses indicate that the same set of habitat specialists. termed ecomorphs. occurs on all four islands. Although these similar assemblages could result from a single evolutionary origin of each ecomorph. followed by dispersal or vicariance. phylogenetic analysis indicates that the ecomorphs originated independently on each island.

Because many islands are young and have relatively few species. evolutionary adaptation and species proliferation are obvious and easy to study.

Nonetheless. recent conceptual and empirical developments in many fields have led to a proliferation of ideas about the relationship between convergence and adaptation. Despite criticism from some systematically minded biologists. I reaffirm that convergence in taxa occupying similar selective environments often is the result of natural selection. However. convergent evolution of a trait in a particular environment can occur for reasons other than selection on that trait in that environment. and species can respond to similar selective pressures by evolving nonconvergent adaptations. For these reasons. studies of convergence should be coupled with other methods—such as direct measurements of selection or investigations of the functional correlates of trait evolution—to test …,True,G4Np3c0AAAAJ:tOudhMTPpwUC,655,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01289.x,10561847461721286062,/scholar?cites=10561847461721286062,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01289.x,0,0,0

Ecological opportunity is usually a prerequisite for adaptive radiation. although in some cases. radiation can occur in the absence of preexisting opportunity. Nonetheless. many clades fail to radiate although seemingly in the presence of ecological opportunity; until methods are developed to identify and quantify ecological opportunity. the concept will have little predictive utility in understanding a priori when a clade might be expected to radiate.

1168360,Phylogenetic comparative methods and the geography of speciation,2003,Jonathan B Losos and Richard E Glor,18,,5,220-227,Elsevier Current Trends,The geography of speciation has long been contentious. In recent years. phylogenetic approaches have been proposed to determine the geographical mode of speciation. If reliable. these methods not only provide a means of settling the debate about the geography of speciation. but also indicate that sympatric speciation is surprisingly common and that peripatric speciation is relatively rare. Similar to any phylogenetic inference. reconstructions of speciation mode are only useful if the underlying assumptions of the method are met. In this case. the key assumption is that the geographical range of both extant and ancestral species at the time of speciation can be inferred from present-day distributions. We discuss whether. and under what circumstances. such assumptions could be met. We conclude that interspecific phylogenies are unable to test alternative hypotheses concerning the geography of speciation …,True,G4Np3c0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,458,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000375,5623339299394283521,/scholar?cites=5623339299394283521,,https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.wustl.edu/dist/6/1127/files/2018/12/Phylogenetic-comparative-methods-and-the-geography-of-speciation.pdf,0,0,0

Our results confirm two predictions; clinging ability is tightly correlated with pad area. even when the effects of body size are removed. and the lizards examined are approximately functionally similar in their clinging capabilities. Nevertheless. despite the tight correlation between pad area and clinging ability. pad area scales with body mass by a lower slope than clinging ability.

We test this prediction using phylogenetic comparative analyses of a wide range of morphological traits in Greater Antillean Anolis lizards. We find that the rate of diversification along two important axes of Anolis radiation—body size and limb dimensions—decreased as opportunity declined. with opportunity quantified either as time elapsed in the radiation or as the diversity of competing anole lineages inferred to have been present on an island at different times in the past. Most previous studies of the ecological opportunity hypothesis have focused on the rate of species diversification; our results provide a complementary perspective. indicating that the rate of phenotypic diversification declines with decreasing opportunity in an adaptive radiation.,True,G4Np3c0AAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC,384,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01026.x,11263221632987340761,/scholar?cites=11263221632987340761,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01026.x,0,0,0

Wilson's The Theory of Island Biogeography. first published by Princeton in 1967. is one of the most influential books on ecology and evolution to appear in the past half century. By developing a general mathematical theory to explain a crucial ecological problem--the regulation of species diversity in island populations--the book transformed the science of biogeography and ecology as a whole. In The Theory of Island Biogeography Revisited. some of today's most prominent biologists assess the continuing impact of MacArthur and Wilson's book four decades after its publication. Following an opening chapter in which Wilson reflects on island biogeography in the 1960s. fifteen chapters evaluate and demonstrate how the field has extended and confirmed--as well as challenged and modified--MacArthur and Wilson's original ideas. Providing a broad picture of the fundamental ways in which the science of island biogeography has been shaped by MacArthur and Wilson's landmark work.

Consequently. the relative importance of niche conservatism versus niche divergence in determining community structure has received little attention 7.

We used four Anolis species which differed in leg length and perch use in nature. We measured maximum sprint speed on rods of several sizes. Longer-legged species ran faster on thick rods. The speed of all species declined on thinner rods. but long-legged species were affected to a greater extent in that all species ran at approximately the same speed on the smallest rod. The short-legged A. valencienni experienced much less difficulty moving on thin rods than did the other species. Variation in leg length among Anolis might thus represent an evolutionary trade-off between maximizing sprint speed and maximizing stability on thin perches.,True,G4Np3c0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,337,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/145/1/23.short,11946739210244210805,/scholar?cites=11946739210244210805,,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/145/1/23.full.pdf,0,0,0

Consequently. historical and ecological studies must be integrated to understand why communities are structured as they are. Examples from CaribbeanAnolis assemblages indicate the unique ecological insight a historical perspective can provide. In the Lesser Antilles. phylogenetic analysis indicates that character displacement probably has occurred. but perhaps only once. and that patterns of size dissimilarity across islands result from ecological size assortment subsequent to the evolutionary change in size. In the Greater Antilles. not only are communities composed of a suite of convergent “ecomorphs.” but the buildup of multispecies communities has followed a very similar trajectory. a …,True,G4Np3c0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,323,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/41/4/403/1667158,3397470710590598592,/scholar?cites=3397470710590598592,,,0,0,0

G. Simpson. one of the chief architects of evolutionary biology’s modern synthesis. proposed that diversification occurs on a macroevolutionary adaptive landscape. but landscape models are seldom used to study adaptive divergence in large radiations.

We then compared these field data with maximal performance under optimal laboratory conditions to answer three questions: (1) Has maximal (i.e.. laboratory) sprinting and jumping performance coevolved with field performance among species? (2) What proportion of their maximum capabilities do anoles sprint and jump in different ecological contexts? (3) Does a relationship exist between maximal sprinting and jumping ability and the proportion of maximal performance used in these contexts?

We raised hatchling A. sagrei in terraria provided with only broad or only narrow surfaces. At the end of the experiment. lizards in the broad treatment had relatively longer hindlimbs than lizards in the narrow treatment. These results indicate that not only is hindlimb length a plastic trait in these lizards. but that this plasticity leads to the production of phenotypes appropriate to particular environments. Comparison to hindlimb lengths of other Anolis species indicates that the range of plasticity is limited compared to the diversity shown throughout the anole radiation.

NY: American Museum of Natural History,"""The articulated postcranial skeleton of an oviraptorid dinosaur (Theropoda. Coelurosauria) from the late Cretaceous Djadokhta Formation of Ukhaa Tolgod. Mongolia. is preserved overlying a nest. The eggs are similar in size. shape. and ornamentation to another egg from this locality in which an oviraptorid embryo is preserved. suggesting that the nest is of the same species as the adult skeleton overlying it and was parented by the adult. The lack of a skull precludes specific identification. but in several features the specimen is more similar to Oviraptor than to other oviraptorids. The ventral part of the thorax is exceptionally well preserved and provides evidence for other avian features that were previously unreported in oviraptorids. including the articulation of the first three thoracic ribs with the costal margin of the sternum and the presence of a single. ossified ventral segment in each rib as well as ossified uncinate processes associated with the thoracic ribs. Remnants of keratinous sheaths are preserved with four of the manal claws. and the bony and keratinous claws were as strongly curved as the manal claws of Archaeopteryx and the pedal claws of modern climbing birds. The skeleton is positioned over the center of the nest. with its limbs arranged symmetrically on either side and its arms spread out around the nest perimeter. This is one of four known oviraptorid skeletons preserved on nests of this type of egg. comprising 23.5% of the 17 oviraptorid skeletons collected from the Djadokhta Formation before 1996. The lack of disturbance to the nest and skeleton indicate that the specimen is preserved in the position in which the adult died.

In addition to their well-known role in generating propulsive forces. actin networks can also sustain substantial pulling loads thanks to their persistent attachment to the surface from which they grow. The simultaneous network elongation and surface attachment inevitably generate a force that opposes network growth.

However. it is unclear how information about the mechanical state of the wall is relayed to the molecular processes building it. thereby enabling the coordination of cell wall expansion and assembly during morphogenesis. Combining theoretical and experimental approaches. we show that a mechanical feedback coordinating cell wall assembly and expansion is essential to sustain mating projection growth in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Our theoretical results indicate that the mechanical feedback provided by the Cell Wall Integrity pathway. with cell wall stress sensors Wsc1 and Mid2 increasingly activating membrane-localized cell wall synthases Fks1/2 upon faster cell wall expansion. stabilizes mating projection growth without affecting cell shape. Experimental perturbation of the osmotic pressure and cell wall mechanics. as well as compromising the mechanical feedback through genetic deletion of the stress sensors. leads to cellular phenotypes that support the theoretical predictions. Our results indicate that while the existence of mechanical feedback is essential to stabilize mating projection growth. the shape and size of the cell are insensitive to the feedback.,True,hdRBVjwAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,15,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005940&rev=1,13940689763255456597,/scholar?cites=13940689763255456597,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005940&rev=1,0,0,0

While there are many existing mathematical models of polarization. for both budding and mating. there are still many aspects of this process that are not well understood. In this paper we set out to elucidate the effect that the geometry of the cell can have on the dynamics of certain models of polarization. Specifically. we look at several spatial stochastic models of Cdc42 polarization that have been adapted from published models. on a variety of tip-shaped geometries. to replicate the shape change that occurs during the growth of the mating projection. We show here that there is a complex interplay between the dynamics of polarization and the shape of the cell. Our results show that while models of polarization can generate a stable polarization cap. its localization at the tip of mating projections is unstable. with the polarization cap drifting away from the tip of the projection in a geometry dependent manner. We also compare predictions from our computational results to experiments that observe cells with projections of varying lengths. and track the stability of the polarization cap. Lastly. we examine one model of actin polarization and show that it is unlikely. at least for the models studied here. that actin dynamics and vesicle traffic are able to overcome this effect of geometry.,True,hdRBVjwAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,13,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006241,3071625197350873524,/scholar?cites=3071625197350873524,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006241,0,0,0

Although honeycreepers were once placed in their own family (Coerebidae). these species did not form a monophyletic group in any of the phylogenies in this study. Thus. our results indicate that nectar‐feeding evolved independently multiple times among these birds. The Neotropical honeycreepers are best considered disparate members of a larger radiation of tanagers and finches. in which bill size and shape. and associated feeding behaviors have changed frequently to fill a variety of niches.

Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the Wnt1 promoter as a transgene. Significantly. Wnt1 transgene expression is limited to the migrating neural crest cells that are derived from the dorsal CNS. The second mouse line. the ROSA26 conditional reporter (R26R). serves as a substrate for the Cre-mediated recombination.

In an earlier report. we described a fusion protein between Cre and a mutated form of the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor (Cre-ERTM) that renders Cre activity tamoxifen (TM) inducible. allowing for conditional modification of gene activity in the mammalian neural tube in utero. In the current work. we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which Cre-ERTM is ubiquitously expressed to permit temporally regulated Cre-mediated recombination in diverse tissues of the mouse at embryonic and adult stages. We demonstrate that a single. intraperitoneal injection of TM into a pregnant mouse at 8.5 days postcoitum leads to detectable recombination in the developing embryo within 6 h of injection and efficient recombination of a reporter gene in derivatives …,True,kWP8_qEAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,1338,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001216060290597X,2828202677523885078,/scholar?cites=2828202677523885078,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001216060290597X/pdf?md5=041b30345eb58a323e7161907d8970f3&pid=1-s2.0-S001216060290597X-main.pdf,0,0,0

The signalling molecule Wnt-4 is crucial for female sexual development. At birth. sexual development in males with a mutation in Wnt-4 appears to be normal; however.

In recent years. several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful. these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation. but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred.

A previous method based on a cross-population composite likelihood ratio (XP-CLR) uses an outgroup population to detect departures from neutrality that could be compatible with hard or soft sweeps. at linked sites near a beneficial allele. However. this method is most sensitive to recent selection and may miss selective events that happened a long time ago. To overcome this. we developed an extension of XP-CLR that jointly models the behavior of a selected allele in a three-population tree.

DNA from present-day humans involved in excavation and extraction will be sequenced along with the endogenous material. This type of contamination is problematic for downstream analyses as it will introduce a bias towards the population of the contaminating individual(s). Quantifying the extent of contamination is a crucial step as it allows researchers to account for possible biases that may arise in downstream genetic analyses. Here. we present an MCMC algorithm to co-estimate the contamination rate. sequencing error rate and demographic parameters—including drift times and admixture rates—for an ancient nuclear genome obtained from human remains. when the putative contaminating DNA comes from present-day humans. We assume we have a large panel representing the putative contaminant population (e.g. European. East Asian or African). The method is implemented in a C++ program called ‘Demographic Inference with Contamination and Error’ (DICE).

Here. we develop an approximation to the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of segregating single-nucleotide mutations in humans. Unlike previous methods. we do not assume that synonymous mutations are neutral or not strongly selected. and we do not rely on fitting the DFE of all new nonsynonymous mutations to a single probability distribution. which is poorly motivated on a biological level. We rely on a previously developed method that utilizes a variety of published annotations (including conservation scores. protein deleteriousness estimates and regulatory data) to score all mutations in the human genome based on how likely they are to be affected by negative selection. controlling for mutation rate. We map this and other conservation scores to a scale of fitness coefficients via maximum likelihood using diffusion theory and a Poisson random field model on SNP data. Our method serves to approximate the deleterious DFE of mutations that are segregating. regardless of their genomic consequence. We can then compare the proportion of mutations that are negatively selected or neutral across various categories. including different types of regulatory sites.

The study of islands has proved particularly fruitful and has led to the theory that geographic area and isolation influence species colonization. extinction and speciation such that larger islands have more species and isolated islands have fewer species (that is. positive species–area and negative species–isolation relationships) 1. 2. 3. 4. However. experimental tests of this theory have been limited. owing to the difficulty in experimental manipulation of islands at the scales at which speciation and long-distance colonization are relevant 5.

However. Anolis also exhibits substantial species richness and ecomorphological disparity on mainland Central and South America. We compared patterns and rates of morphological evolution to investigate whether. in fact. island Anolis are exceptionally diverse relative to their mainland counterparts. Quite the contrary. we found that rates and extent of diversification were comparable—Anolis adaptive radiation is not an island phenomenon. However. mainland and Caribbean anoles occupy different parts of morphological space; in independent colonizations of both island and mainland habitats. island anoles have evolved shorter limbs and better-developed toe pads.

By limiting or directing covariation among component traits. modules are expected to represent evolutionary building blocks and to play an important role in morphological diversification. But how stable are patterns of modularity over macroevolutionary timescales? Comparative analyses are needed to address the macroevolutionary effect of modularity. but to date few have been conducted. We describe patterns of skull diversity and modularity in Caribbean Anolis lizards. We first diagnose the primary axes of variation in skull shape and then examine whether diversification of skull shape is concentrated to changes within modules or whether changes arose across the structure as a whole.

One key prediction is that genetic constraints should bias the early stages of species divergence along “genetic lines of least resistance” defined by the genetic (co)variance matrix. G.

We find repeated divergence in thermal physiology within these radiations. and that this divergence significantly affects performance within natural thermal environments. Morphologically similar species that co-occur invariably differ in their thermal physiology. providing evidence that physiological divergence facilitates species coexistence within anole communities.

All members of the class are terrestrial. but they attained terrestriality independently of insects. Myriapoda is the only arthropod class not represented by a sequenced genome. We present an analysis of the genome of the centipede Strigamia maritima. It retains a compact genome that has undergone less gene loss and shuffling than previously sequenced arthropods. and many orthologues of genes conserved from the bilaterian ancestor that have been lost in insects. Our analysis locates many genes in conserved macro-synteny contexts. and many small-scale examples of gene clustering. We describe several examples where S. maritima shows different solutions from insects to similar problems. The insect olfactory receptor gene family is absent from S. maritima. and olfaction in air is likely effected by expansion of other receptor gene families. For some genes S. maritima has evolved paralogues to generate coding sequence diversity. where insects use alternate splicing. This is most striking for the Dscam gene. which in Drosophila generates more than 100.000 alternate splice forms. but in S. maritima is encoded by over 100 paralogues. We see an intriguing linkage between the absence of any known photosensory proteins in a blind organism and the additional absence of canonical circadian clock genes.

There is increasing evidence for a large-scale duplication of genes in some chelicerate lineages including two rounds of whole genome duplication (WGD) in horseshoe crabs. To investigate this further. we sequenced and analyzed the genome of the common house spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum. We found pervasive duplication of both coding and non-coding genes in this spider. including two clusters of Hox genes. Analysis of synteny conservation across the P. tepidariorum genome suggests that there has been an ancient WGD in spiders. Comparison with the genomes of other chelicerates. including that of the newly sequenced bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus. suggests that this event occurred in the common ancestor of spiders and scorpions. and is probably independent of the WGDs in horseshoe crabs. Furthermore. characterization of the sequence and expression of the Hox paralogs in P. tepidariorum suggests that many have been subject to neo-functionalization and/or sub-functionalization since their duplication. Our results reveal that spiders and scorpions are likely the descendants of a polyploid ancestor that lived more than 450 MYA.

A Wiley Company,Germ cells occupy a unique position in animal reproduction. development. and evolution. In sexually reproducing animals. only they can produce gametes and contribute genetically to subsequent generations. Nonetheless. germ line specification during embryogenesis is conceptually the same as the specification of any somatic cell type: germ cells must activate a specific gene regulatory network in order to differentiate and go through gametogenesis. While many genes with critical roles in the germ line have been characterized with respect to expression pattern and genetic interactions. it is the molecular interactions of the relevant gene products that are ultimately responsible for germ cell differentiation.

However. fully understanding the regulation and evolution of P. tepidariorum development in comparison to other animals requires a genomic perspective. Although research on P. tepidariorum has provided major new insights. gene analysis to date has been limited to candidate gene approaches. Furthermore. the few available EST collections are based on embryonic transcripts. which have not been systematically annotated and are unlikely to contain transcripts specific to post-embryonic stages of development. We therefore generated cDNA from pooled embryos representing all described embryonic stages. as well as post-embryonic stages including nymphs. larvae and adults. and using Illumina HiSeq technology obtained a total of 625.076.514 100-bp paired end reads. We combined these data with 24.360 ESTs available in GenBank. and 1.040.006 reads newly generated from 454 pyrosequencing of a mixed-stage embryo cDNA library. The combined sequence data were assembled using a custom de novo assembly strategy designed to optimize assembly product length. number of predicted transcripts. and proportion of raw reads incorporated into the assembly. The de novo assembly generated 446.427 contigs with an N50 of 1.875 bp.

In Drosophila. PGCs are specified by maternally provided. asymmetrically localized cytoplasmic factors (germ plasm). In contrast. historical literature on most other arthropods reports that PGCs arise from mesoderm during midembryogenesis. suggesting that an arthropod last common ancestor may have specified PGCs via zygotic mechanisms.

Whether the Hippo pathway influences establishment of stem cell niche size to accommodate changes in organ size. however. has received little attention. Here. we ask whether Hippo signaling influences the number of stem cell niches that are established during development of the Drosophila larval ovary. and whether it interacts with the same or different effector signaling pathways in different cell types. We demonstrate that canonical Hippo signaling regulates autonomous proliferation of the soma. while a novel hippo-independent activity of Yorkie regulates autonomous proliferation of the germ line. Moreover. we demonstrate that Hippo signaling mediates non-autonomous proliferation signals between germ cells and somatic cells. and contributes to maintaining the correct proportion of these niche precursors. Finally. we show that the Hippo pathway interacts with different growth pathways in distinct somatic cell types. and interacts with EGFR and JAK/STAT pathways to regulate non-autonomous proliferation of germ cells. We thus provide evidence for novel roles of the Hippo pathway in establishing the precise balance of soma and germ line. the appropriate number of stem cell niches. and ultimately regulating adult female reproductive capacity.,True,ChHokKEAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,46,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004962,13176806390223661814,/scholar?cites=13176806390223661814,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004962,0,0,0

We have therefore created a large and publicly available transcriptome for the hemimetabolous insect Gryllus bimaculatus (cricket). a well-developed laboratory model organism whose potential for functional genetic experiments is currently limited by the absence of genomic resources. cDNA was prepared using mRNA obtained from adult ovaries containing all stages of oogenesis. and from embryo samples on each day of embryogenesis.

Here we test whether sexual selection by female choice plays a role in the maintenance of the male wing pattern in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. We perform one of the most extensive series of wing pattern manipulations in butterflies. dissecting every component of the ‘bulls-eye’ eyespot patterns in both ventral and dorsal wing surfaces of males to test the trait's appeal to females. We conclude that females select males on the basis of the size and brightness of the dorsal eyespot's ultraviolet reflecting pupils. Pupil absence is strongly selected against. as are artificially enlarged pupils. Small to intermediate (normal sized) pupils seem to function equally well.

The eyespot of nymphalid butterflies has served as an example of a novel complex trait. as multiple genes are expressed during eyespot development. Yet the origins of eyespots remain unknown. Using a dataset of more than 400 images of butterflies with a known phylogeny and gene expression data for five eyespot-associated genes from over twenty species. we tested origin hypotheses for both eyespots and eyespot-associated genes. We show that eyespots evolved once within the family Nymphalidae. approximately 90 million years ago. concurrent with expression of at least three genes associated with early eyespot development. We also show multiple losses of expression of most genes from this early three-gene cluster. without corresponding losses of eyespots.

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication. followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications. giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25.498 genes encoding proteins from 11.000 families. similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans-the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families. indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes.

We used sequence similarity clustering to explore proteins with a comprehensive dataset consisting of sequences from available databases together with 6.12 million proteins predicted from an assembly of 7.7 million Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) sequences. The GOS dataset covers nearly all known prokaryotic protein families. A total of 3.995 medium- and large-sized clusters consisting of only GOS sequences are identified. out of which 1.700 have no detectable homology to known families. The GOS-only clusters contain a higher than expected proportion of sequences of viral origin. thus reflecting a poor sampling of viral diversity until now. Protein domain distributions in the GOS dataset and current protein databases show distinct biases. Several protein domains that were previously categorized as kingdom specific are shown to have GOS examples in other kingdoms.

Wolbachia. which are found in a variety of invertebrate species. are of great interest due to their diverse interactions with different hosts. which range from many forms of reproductive parasitism to mutualistic symbioses. Analysis of the wMel genome. in particular phylogenomic comparisons with other intracellular bacteria. has revealed many insights into the biology and evolution of wMel and Wolbachia in general. For example. the wMel genome is unique among sequenced obligate intracellular species in both being highly streamlined and containing very high levels of repetitive DNA and mobile DNA elements. This observation. coupled with multiple evolutionary reconstructions. suggests that natural selection is somewhat inefficient in wMel. most likely owing to the occurrence of repeated population bottlenecks. Genome analysis predicts many metabolic differences with the closely related Rickettsia species. including the presence of intact glycolysis and purine synthesis. which may compensate for an inability to obtain ATP directly from its host. as Rickettsia can. Other discoveries include the apparent inability of wMel to synthesize lipopolysaccharide and the presence of the most genes encoding proteins with ankyrin repeat domains of any prokaryotic genome yet sequenced.

However. few species of the disturbed riverine fauna may provide a detailed and basin‐wide picture of the human impact on the population genetics of riverine organisms. Here we used the most abundant native fish. the three‐spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.). to detect the geographical determinants of genetic connectivity in the eastern part of the Scheldt basin in Belgium.

A cause for concern is that independent evolution among drainages is not guaranteed in areas with a poorly resolved glacial history. This is the case for the west European great rivers. whose downstream valleys flanked the southern limit of the late Pleistocene ice sheet. We tested for independent and postglacial colonization of these valleys hypothesizing that the relationships among anadromous and freshwater sticklebacks correspond to a raceme structure.

In such cases. it remains an open question as to whether variation attributed to that single measured agent might be influenced by some other unmeasured agent. Previous research has shown that phenotypic variation in the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is strongly influenced by predation regime. and we here ask whether parasitism might represent an additional important selective agent shaping this variation. We performed a field survey of 26 natural guppy populations of known predation regime in northern Trinidad. We quantified levels of parasitism of guppies by the monogenean ecotoparasite.

Host size and seasonal dynamics were strong determinants of parasite abundance. A strong interaction between host and parasite species determined infection levels and affected three levels of parasite organisation: community structure. population structure and topographical specialisation. Community and population structure were shaped by asymmetric cross-infections. resulting in a net transmission of the Gyrodactylus species typical of the nine-spined stickleback towards the three-spined stickleback.

We investigated variation in 98 gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for evidence of selection in local populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) across the species distribution.

SNP discovery was performed by de novo sequence clustering and contig assembly. followed by the mapping of reads against consensus contig sequences. Selection of candidate SNPs for genotyping was conducted using an in silico approach. SNP validation and genotyping were performed simultaneously using an Illumina 1.536 GoldenGate assay. Although the conversion rate of candidate SNPs in the genotyping assay cannot be predicted in advance. this approach has the potential to maximise cost and time efficiencies by avoiding expensive and time-consuming laboratory stages of SNP validation. Additionally. the in silico approach leads to lower ascertainment bias in the resulting SNP panel as marker selection is based only on the ability to design …,True,hasJTnYAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,67,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042089,6032257088841948578,/scholar?cites=6032257088841948578,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042089,0,0,0

Motivation for the inference of ancestry ranges from conservation genetics to forensic analysis. High density assays featuring Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers can be exploited to create a reduced panel containing the most informative markers for these purposes.

Here we present the case study of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius). one of the most important demersal resources of European fisheries. Two sequencing platforms. the Roche 454 FLX (454) and the Illumina Genome Analyzer (GAII). were used for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) discovery in the hake muscle transcriptome. De novo transcriptome assembly into unique contigs. annotation. and in silico SNP detection were carried out in parallel for 454 and GAII sequence data. High-throughput genotyping using the Illumina GoldenGate assay was performed for validating 1.536 putative SNPs. Validation results were analysed to compare the performances of 454 and GAII methods and to evaluate the role of several variables (e.g. sequencing depth. intron-exon structure. sequence quality and annotation). Despite well-known differences in sequence length and throughput. the two approaches showed similar assay conversion rates (approximately 43%) and percentages of polymorphic loci (67.5% and 63.3% for GAII and 454. respectively). Both NGS platforms therefore demonstrated to be suitable for large scale identification of SNPs in transcribed regions of non-model species. although the lack of a reference genome profoundly affects the genotyping success rate.

In a DNA barcoding approach. neighbour Joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees of 369 16S. 212 cyt b. and 447 COI sequences indicated that cyt b and COI are suitable for unambiguous identification. whereas 16S failed to discriminate closely related flatfish and gurnard species.

Furthermore. the simple mutation model of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) permits cost-effective high-throughput genotyping in thousands of individuals simultaneously. Genomic resources are scarce for the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). a small pelagic species that sustains high revenue fisheries.

Accurate data from scientific surveys and landings are essential to assess conservation status and to develop robust protection and management plans. Currently available data are often incomplete or incorrect as a result of inaccurate species identifications. due to a high level of morphological stasis. especially among closely related taxa. Moreover. several diagnostic characters clearly visible in adult specimens are less evident in juveniles. Here we present results generated by the ELASMOMED Consortium. a regional network aiming to sample and DNA-barcode the Mediterranean Chondrichthyans with the ultimate goal to provide a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library. This library will support and improve the molecular taxonomy of this group and the effectiveness of management and conservation measures. We successfully barcoded 882 individuals belonging to 42 species (17 sharks. 24 batoids and one chimaera). including four endemic and several threatened ones. Morphological misidentifications were found across most orders. further confirming the need for a comprehensive DNA barcoding library as a valuable tool for the reliable identification of specimens in support of taxonomist who are reviewing current identification keys.

Thunnus thynnus. is a commercially important species that has been severely over-exploited in the recent past. Although the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock is now showing signs of recovery. its current status remains very uncertain and as a consequence their recovery is dependent upon severe management informed by rigorous scientific research. Monitoring of early life history stages can inform decision makers about the health of the species based upon recruitment and survival rates. Misidentification of fish larvae and eggs can lead to inaccurate estimates of stock biomass and productivity which can trigger demands for increased quotas and unsound management conclusions. Herein we used a molecular approach employing mitochondrial and nuclear genes (CO1 and ITS1. respectively) to identify larvae (n = 188) collected from three spawning areas in the Mediterranean Sea by different institutions working with a regional fisheries management organization. Several techniques were used to analyze the genetic sequences (sequence alignments using search algorithms. neighbour joining trees. and a genetic character-based identification key) and an extensive comparison of the results is presented. During this process various inaccuracies in related publications and online databases were uncovered.

Insights into local adaptation. adaptive response to global change and evolutionary consequences of selective harvesting can be generated through population genomics studies. allowing the separation of the effects invoked by neutral processes (drift‐migration) from those due to selection. Such knowledge is important not only for improving our basic understanding of natural as well as human‐induced evolutionary processes. but also for predicting future trajectories of biodiversity and for setting conservation priorities.

We investigated variation in 98 gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for evidence of selection in local populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) across the species distribution. Our global genome scan analysis identified eight outlier gene loci with very high statistical support. likely to be subject to directional selection in local demes. or closely linked to loci under selection. Likewise. on a regional south/north transect of central and eastern Atlantic populations. seven loci displayed strongly elevated levels of genetic differentiation.

To disentangle these alternatives. we studied the genomic signature of range expansion in the damselfly Coenagrion scitulum using 4950 newly developed genomic SNPs and linked this to the rapidly evolved phenotypic differences between core and (newly established) edge populations. Most edge populations were genetically clearly differentiated from the core populations and all were differentiated from each other indicating independent range expansion events.

High polymorphism and the relative ease of scoring represent the two major features that make microsatellites of large interest for many genetic studies. The major drawback of microsatellites is that they need to be isolated de novo from species that are being examined for the first time.

Despite intense current interest in both processes as potential agents of directional sexual selection 3. few studies have attributed the success of attractive males to events that occur exclusively after insemination. This is because the interactions between pre-and post-insemination episodes of sexual selection can be important sources of variation in paternity 4. The use of artificial insemination overcomes this difficulty because it controls for variation in male fertilization success attributable to the female's perception of male quality. as well as effects due to mating order and the relative contribution of sperm from competing males 5.

1169032,Quaternary history and contemporary patterns in a currently expanding species,2009,Carole Kerdelhué and Lorenzo Zane and Mauro Simonato and Paola Salvato and Jérôme Rousselet and Alain Roques and Andrea Battisti,9,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,1-14,BioMed Central,Quaternary climatic oscillations had dramatic effects on species evolution. In northern latitudes. populations had to survive the coldest periods in refugial areas and recurrently colonized northern regions during interglacials. Such a history usually results in a loss of genetic diversity. Populations that did not experience glaciations. in contrast. probably maintained most of their ancestral genetic diversity. These characteristics dramatically affected the present-day distribution of genetic diversity and may influence the ability of species to cope with the current global changes. We conducted a range-wide study of mitochondrial genetic diversity in the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa/T. wilkinsoni complex. Notodontidae). a forest pest occurring around the Mediterranean Basin and in southern Europe. This species is responding to the current climate change by rapid natural range expansion and can also be accidentally transported by humans. Our aim was to assess if Quaternary climatic oscillations had a different effect across the species' range and to determine if genetic footprints of contemporary processes can be identified in areas of recent introduction. We identified three main clades that were spatially structured. In most of Europe. the genetic diversity pattern was typical for species that experienced marked glaciation cycles. Except in refugia. European populations were characterized by the occurrence of one main haplotype and by a strong reduction in genetic diversity. which is expected in regions that were rapidly re-colonized when climatic conditions improved. In contrast. all other sub-clades around the Mediterranean …,True,ow-iAHwAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,90,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-220,6618035567651765139,/scholar?cites=6618035567651765139,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-220,0,0,0

The abundance of the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock has been declining since the 1980s probably due to a combination of anthropogenic and climatic factors. In this paper. we explore the transcriptomic dynamics between individuals from high (river Tiber. Italy) and low pollution (lake Bolsena. Italy) environments. which were measured for 36 PCBs. several organochlorine pesticides and brominated flame retardants and nine metals. To this end. we first (i) updated the European eel transcriptome using deep sequencing data with a total of 640.040 reads assembled into 44.896 contigs (Eeelbase release 2.0). and (ii) developed a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in the critically endangered European eel of about 15.000 annotated contigs. which was applied to detect differentially expressed genes between polluted sites. Several detoxification genes related to metabolism of pollutants were upregulated in the highly polluted site. including genes that take part in phase I of the xenobiotic metabolism (CYP3A). phase II (glutathione-S-transferase) and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase). In addition. key genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation were down-regulated at the Tiber site relative to the Bolsena site.

Early inheritance studies with allozymes indicated that loci in the salmonid genome are inherited disomically in females. However. some pairs of duplicated loci showed patterns of inheritance in males indicating pairing and recombination between homeologous chromosomes. Nearly 20% of loci in the salmonid genome are duplicated and share the same alleles (isoloci). apparently due to homeologous recombination.

1169050,SNP Discovery Using Next Generation Transcriptomic Sequencing in Atlantic Herring (Clupea harengus),2012,SJ Helyar and MT Limborg and D Bekkevold and M Babbucci and et al.,7,PLoS ONE,8,e42089,PLOS,The introduction of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revolutionised population genetics. providing studies of non-model species with unprecedented genomic coverage. allowing evolutionary biologists to address questions previously far beyond the reach of available resources. Furthermore. the simple mutation model of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) permits cost-effective high-throughput genotyping in thousands of individuals simultaneously. Genomic resources are scarce for the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). a small pelagic species that sustains high revenue fisheries. This paper details the development of 578 SNPs using a combined NGS and high-throughput genotyping approach. Eight individuals covering the species distribution in the eastern Atlantic were bar-coded and multiplexed into a single cDNA library and sequenced using the 454 GS FLX platform. SNP discovery was performed by de novo sequence clustering and contig assembly. followed by the mapping of reads against consensus contig sequences. Selection of candidate SNPs for genotyping was conducted using an in silico approach. SNP validation and genotyping were performed simultaneously using an Illumina 1.536 GoldenGate assay. Although the conversion rate of candidate SNPs in the genotyping assay cannot be predicted in advance. this approach has the potential to maximise cost and time efficiencies by avoiding expensive and time-consuming laboratory stages of SNP validation. Additionally. the in silico approach leads to lower ascertainment bias in the resulting SNP panel as marker selection is based only on the ability to design …,True,bR0icU8AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,67,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042089,6032257088841948578,/scholar?cites=6032257088841948578,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042089,0,0,0

We analyzed the timing and genetic consequences of fragmentation in two isolated lake-dwelling brown trout populations. They are from the same river system (the Gudenå River. Denmark) and have been isolated from downstream anadromous trout by dams established ca. 600–800 years ago. For reference. we included ten other anadromous populations and two hatchery strains. Based on analysis of 44 microsatellite loci we investigated if the lake populations have been naturally genetically differentiated from anadromous trout for thousands of years. or have diverged recently due to the establishment of dams. Divergence time estimates were based on 1) Approximate Bayesian Computation and 2) a coalescent-based isolation-with-gene-flow model. Both methods suggested divergence times ca. 600–800 years bp. providing strong evidence for establishment of dams in the Medieval as the factor causing divergence. Bayesian cluster analysis showed influence of stocked trout in several reference populations. but not in the focal lake and anadromous populations. Estimates of effective population size using a linkage disequilibrium method ranged from 244 to > 1.000 in all but one anadromous population. but were lower (153 and 252) in the lake populations. We show that genetic divergence of lake-dwelling trout in two Danish lakes reflects establishment of water mills and impassable dams ca. 600–800 years ago rather than a natural genetic population structure.

While population divergence and ecological adaptive potential are classically viewed at the genetic level. it has recently been argued that their microbiomes may also contribute to population genetic divergence. We explored whether this might be plausible along the well-described environmental gradient of the Baltic Sea in two species of sand lance (Ammodytes tobianus and Hyperoplus lanceolatus). Specifically. we assessed both their population genetic and gut microbial composition variation and investigated not only which environmental parameters correlate with the observed variation. but whether host genome also correlates with microbiome variation. We found a clear genetic structure separating the high-salinity North Sea from the low-salinity Baltic Sea sand lances. The observed genetic divergence was not simply a function of isolation by distance. but correlated with environmental parameters. such as salinity. sea surface temperature. and. in the case of A. tobianus. possibly water microbiota. Furthermore. we detected two distinct genetic groups in Baltic A. tobianus that might represent sympatric spawning types.

However. little is known about general consequences of a WGD because gene duplicates (i.e.. paralogs) are commonly filtered in genomic studies; such filtering may remove substantial portions of the genome in data sets from polyploid‐origin species. We demonstrate a new method that enables genome‐wide scans for signatures of selection at both nonduplicated and duplicated loci by taking locus‐specific copy number into account. We apply this method to RAD sequence data from different ecotypes of a polyploid‐origin salmonid (Oncorhynchus nerka) and reveal signatures of divergent selection that would have been missed if duplicated loci were filtered.

1169070,Coevolution of Hosts and Their Microbiome,2018,Morten T Limborg and Philipp Heeb,9,,11,549,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The evolution of life-history traits in plants and animals has taken place in the midst of complex microbial communities. Biology is undergoing a fundamental reshaping where the phenotypic expression of the individuals’ traits need to be considered as the combined expression of the host and its associated microbial genomes. defined as forming the “holobiont”(ie. the host and its microbiota)[1. 2]. This new concept has wide ranging implications and has led to the realization that multicellular organisms coevolve with their microbial symbionts [3]. Although host–microbe interactions can be understood and explained through ecological processes. much less is known about the significance of evolutionary and eco-evolutionary processes in shaping the holobionts. Given the complex structure of the microbiome. understanding the specific roles. adaptability. and functions provided by the microbiome to its host is emerging as an exciting new scientific frontier [4]. The close contact between the microbiota and their host means that the microbiota can shape a variety of effects ranging from physiological trade-offs to behavioral and cognitive traits [5. 6]. In this special issue we present four papers that provide empirical examples and review recent developments in molecular and statistical techniques to discuss theoretical concepts and empirical evidence on the potential role of the microbiota in shaping holobiont evolution.

The species has a complex and diverse array of life-histories. but most forms are anadromous with a juvenile phase in fresh water. followed by smoltiﬁcation and a long migration to the ocean for feeding and growth. and a return migration to fresh water to spawn. Atlantic salmon return with a high precision to their home river. and typically only a small percentage of a population strays to other rivers. Precise homing may generate and maintain local adaptations through natural selection. and salmon populations in different rivers differ both ecologically and genetically. Individuals of some populations complete their entire life cycle in fresh water. while others may undertake only short migrations to brackish water in estuaries. or stay within marine areas close to the home river. Factors affecting spawning and feeding migrations may impact the reproductive success and survival of individual ﬁsh. Migration studies identify pathways. and critical habitats like feeding and spawning areas. and hence are essential for the protection of Atlantic salmon populations.

Canada. Surprisingly. of the seven tags that successfully transmitted archived data. six were ingested by warm-gutted predators. as observed by a sudden increase in water temperature. Gut temperatures were in the range of 20 to 25°C—too cold for marine mammals but within the range of endothermic fish. In order to identify the eel predators. we compared their vertical migratory behavior with those of satellite-tagged porbeagle shark and bluefin tuna. the only endothermic fishes occurring non-marginally in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. We accurately distinguished between tuna and shark by using the behavioral criteria generated by comparing the diving behavior of these two species with those of our unknown predators. Depth profile characteristics of most eel predators more closely resembled those of sharks than those of tuna. During the first days following tagging. all eels remained in surface waters and did not exhibit diel vertical migrations. Three eels were eaten at this time. Two eels exhibited inverse diel vertical migrations (at surface during the day) during several days prior to predation. Four eels were eaten during daytime. whereas the two night-predation events occurred at full moon.

The biological fixation of dinitrogen (N2) to bioavailable nitrogen provides an important new source of nitrogen for pelagic marine ecosystems and influences primary productivity and organic matter export to the deep ocean. As one of a series of efforts to collect biomass and rates specific to different phytoplankton functional groups. we have constructed a database on diazotrophic organisms in the global pelagic upper ocean by compiling about 12 000 direct field measurements of cyanobacterial diazotroph abundances (based on microscopic cell counts or qPCR assays targeting the nifH genes) and N2 fixation rates. Biomass conversion factors are estimated based on cell sizes to convert abundance data to diazotrophic biomass.

In some regions. this import of N supports up to half of the primary productivity. Diazotrophic Cyanobacteria appear to be the major contributors to marine N 2 fixation in surface waters. whereas the contribution of heterotrophic or chemoautotrophic diazotrophs to this process is usually regarded inconsequential. Culture-independent studies reveal that non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are diverse. widely distributed. and actively expressing the nitrogenase gene in marine and estuarine environments.

To test this hypothesis. we established simple model communities containing various combinations of 2 marine bacteria (Cellulophaga sp. and Photobacterium sp.) and 2 viruses (one specific to each bacterial type) grown in a seawater-based medium with lactose as the sole carbon source.

One central question is whether divergence is genome‐wide or localized in ‘genomic mosaics’ during early stages when gene flow is still pronounced. Empirical work has so far been limited. and the relative impacts of gene flow and natural selection on genomic patterns have not been fully explored. Here. we use ecotypes of Atlantic cod to investigate genomic patterns of diversity and population differentiation in a natural system characterized by high gene flow and large effective population sizes. properties which theoretically could restrict divergence in local genomic regions.

During 1988 and 1989. bimonthly trawl surveys were carried out from the estuary to the 50-m-isobath along a 65-km transect. A regular seasonal pattern demonstrated two combined trends. An offshore movement is observed with increasing age; this general trend is marked by an inshore migration in spring and an offshore one in winter. The fluctuations of the distribution pattern are discussed in relation to sedimentary characteristics. to trophic requirements and to hydroclimatic variations. The main conclusion is that young soles are concentrated inside a closed nursery area.

These processes are often assumed to be critical in determining recruitment in flatfish. through their impact on feeding. growth and survival.

An empirical evaluation of some genetic methods for identifying the number of gene pools and their degree of connectivity,2006,Robin S Waples and Oscar Gaggiotti,15,,6,1419-1439,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered ‘populations’. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm.

1169177,Separating the wheat from the chaff: patterns of genetic differentiation in high gene flow species,1998,Robin S Waples,89,Journal of Heredity,5,438-450,Oxford University Press,In many marine species. high levels of gene flow ensure that the genetic signal from population differentiation is weak. As a consequence. various errors associated with estimating population genetic parameters that might normally be safely ignored assume a relatively greater importance. This fact has important implications for the use of genetic data to address two common questions in fishery conservation and management: (1) How many stocks of a given species are there? and (2) How much gene flow occurs among stocks? This article discusses strategies to maximize the signal:noise ratio in genetic studies of marine species and suggests a quantitative method to correct for bias due to a common sampling problem.

Oncorhynchus spp.. and the definition of"" species"" under the Endangered Species Act",1991,Robin S Waples,53,Marine Fisheries Review,3,11-22,,"For purposes ofthe Endangered Species Act (ESA). a ""species"" is defined to include ""any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature. ""Federal agencies charged with carrying out the provisions of the ESA have struggled for over a decade to develop a consistent approach for interpreting the term ""distinct population segment."" This paper outlines such an approach and explains in some detail how it can be applied to ESA evaluations of anadromous Pacific salmonids. The following definition is proposed: A population (or group of populations) will be considered ""distinct"" (and hence a ""species "")for purposes of the ESA if it represents an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) of the biological species. A population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: 1) It must be substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units. and 2) It must represent an important component in the evolutionary legacy of the species. Isolation does not have to be absolute. but it must be strong enough to permit evolutionarily important differences to accrue in different population units. The second criterion would be met if the population contributes substantially to the ecological/genetic diversity of the species as a whole. Insights into the extent of reproductive isolation can be provided by movements of tagged fish. natural recolonization rates observed in other populations. measurements of genetic differences between populations. and evaluations of the efficacy of natural barriers.

Whereas previous treatments of this method have adopted rather limiting assumptions. the present analysis shows that the temporal method is generally applicable to a wide variety of organisms. Use of a revised model of gene sampling permits a more generalized interpretation of Ne than that used by some other authors studying this method.

Such releases are performed worldwide in vast numbers. Augmentation can be demographically and economically beneficial but can also cause four types of adverse genetic change to wild populations: (1) loss of genetic variation. (2) loss of adaptations. (3) change of population composition. and (4) change of population structure.

Although true. such consensus fails to address the nature of the ambiguity that is associated with species-related research. We argue that biologists who endure the species problem can benefit from a synthesis in which individual taxonomic species are used as hypotheses of evolutionary entities. We discuss two sources of species uncertainty: one that is a semantic confusion. and a second that is caused by the inherent uncertainty of evolutionary entities. The former can be dispelled with careful communication. whereas the latter is a conventional scientific uncertainty that can only be mitigated by research.

It stems from trawl. dredge. grab. and corer samples as well as from direct and camera observations (Table 1–2). The quality of this information varies considerably; it consists of pure descriptions. figures for presence (absence) and abundance of some key taxa or proxies for such parameters. e.g. sea-floor cover. Some data sets even cover a defined and complete proportion of the macrobenthos with further analyses on diversity and zoogeography. As a consequence the acquisition of data from approximately 90 different campaigns assembled here was not standardised. Nevertheless. it was possible to classify this broad variety of known macrobenthic assemblages to the best of expert knowledge (Gutt 2007; Fig. 1). This overview does not replace statistically sound community and diversity analyses. However. it shows from where which kind of information is available and it acts as an example of the feasibility and power of such data collections. The data set provides unique georeferenced biological basic information for the planning of future coordinated research activities. e.g. under the umbrella of the biology program “Antarctic Thresholds - Ecosystem Resilience and Adaptation” (AnT-ERA) of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and especially for actual conservation issues. e.g. the planning of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).,True,GhiruH4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,28,http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/500841/,13305068152397828981,/scholar?cites=13305068152397828981,,http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/500841/1/4499-G-3-layout.pdf,0,0,0

These species originated from a benthic ancestor and do not possess a swimbladder. However. some notothenioids have achieved neutral buoyancy through skeletal reductions as well as storage of lipids to reduce body mass relative to seawater. These adaptations enable them to exploit the highly productive pelagic realm. Mobilizing these lipid reserves in periods of critically low food intake may lead to buoyancy problems. Accumulating and conserving these reserves may slow down the development of somatic and reproductive tissues and hence future reproductive output. We constructed a dynamic state variable model to investigate how ingested energy is partitioned over 3 state variables: lipid reserves. structural protein body mass and egg development.

In this paper. we tested the hypotheses that population connectivity is positively related to a combination of life history traits. namely duration of pelagic larval period and the tendency towards pelagic life style in the adulthood. To do so. we analysed the variability of six microsatellite and one mitochondrial marker (cytochrome b) in three Southern Ocean fish species (Trematomus newnesi.

CAML was the most successful comprehensive. multinational and multidisciplinary survey of Antarctic biota ever conducted (Chapter 1.2). It used standardised methodologies. both traditional and contemporary. for sampling and identifying specimens and also for managing and analysing data. This sampling effort added important new data on the presence of species to the online data portal SCAR-MarBIN (Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research-Marine Biodiversity Information Network; www. scarmarbin. be) and to the Barcoding of Life project. The compilation of these two data sets required the contribution of hundreds of taxonomists. These experts identified the substantial amount of specimens collected and revisited. with morphological and molecular techniques. the systematic classification of different taxa. in some cases providing new phylogenies. The Biogeographic Atlas of the Southern Ocean has gathered scientists together to update our understanding of distributional patterns of biota in the Southern Ocean. which was previously based on publications such as the Antarctic Map Folio Series (Bushnell. 1964-1972) that included the zoogeographical classification of Hedgpeth (1969)(Chapter 1.1.).

In the current generation of Affymetrix human GeneChips. most probesets include probes matching transcripts from more than one gene and probes which do not match any transcribed sequence. We developed a novel set of custom Chip Definition Files (CDF) and the corresponding Bioconductor libraries for Affymetrix human GeneChips. based on the information contained in the GeneAnnot database. GeneAnnot-based CDFs are composed of unique custom-probesets. including only probes matching a single gene. GeneAnnot-based custom CDFs solve the problem of a reliable reconstruction of expression levels and eliminate the existence of more than one probeset per gene. which often leads to discordant expression signals for the same transcript when gene differential expression is the focus of the analysis. GeneAnnot CDFs are freely distributed and fully compliant with Affymetrix standards and all available software for gene expression analysis. The CDF libraries are available from                      http://www.xlab.unimo.it/GA_CDF                                        . along with supplementary information (CDF libraries. installation guidelines and R code.

Ruditapes philippinarum. is one of the major aquaculture species in the world and a potential sentinel organism for monitoring the status of marine ecosystems. However. genomic resources for R. philippinarum are still extremely limited. Global analysis of gene expression profiles is increasingly used to evaluate the biological effects of various environmental stressors on aquatic animals under either artificial conditions or in the wild. Here. we report on the development of a transcriptomic platform for global gene expression profiling in the Manila clam. A normalized cDNA library representing a mixture of adult tissues was sequenced using a ultra high-throughput sequencing technology (Roche 454). A database consisting of 32.606 unique transcripts was constructed. 9.747 (30%) of which could be annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was designed and applied to profile gene expression of digestive gland and gills. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between different tissues was performed by enrichment analysis. Expression of Natural Antisense Transcripts (NAT) analysis was also performed and bi-directional transcription appears a common phenomenon in the R. philippinarum transcriptome. A preliminary study on clam samples collected in a highly polluted area of the Venice Lagoon demonstrated the applicability of genomic tools to environmental monitoring. The transcriptomic platform developed for the Manila clam confirmed the high level of reproducibility of current microarray technology.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In multicellular organisms. secreted proteins play pivotal regulatory roles in intercellular communication. Proteins secreted by skeletal muscle can act locally on muscle cells through autocrine/paracrine loops and on surrounding tissues such as muscle blood vessels. or they can be released into the blood stream. thus producing systemic effects. By a computational approach. we have screened 6255 products of genes expressed in normal human skeletal muscle. Putatively secreted proteins were identified by sequential steps of sieving. through prediction of signal peptide. recognition of transmembrane regions. and analysis of protein annotation. The resulting putative skeletal muscle secretome consists of 319 proteins. including 78 still uncharacterized proteins. This is the first human skeletal muscle secretome produced by computational analysis.

It is dedicated to the integrated analysis of in silico target prediction. microRNA (miRNA) and gene expression data for the reconstruction of post-transcriptional regulatory networks. miRNAs are fundamental post-transcriptional regulators of several key biological and pathological processes. As miRNAs act prevalently through target degradation. their expression profiles are expected to be inversely correlated to those of the target genes. Low specificity of target prediction algorithms makes integration approaches an interesting solution for target prediction refinement. MAGIA2 performs this integrative approach supporting different association measures. multiple organisms and almost all target predictions algorithms.
