96466,Cytochrome P450 CYP1A1: wider roles in cancer progression and prevention,2009,Vasilis P Androutsopoulos and Aristidis M Tsatsakis and Demetrios A Spandidos,9,,1,1-17,BioMed Central,CYP1A1 is one of the main cytochrome P450 enzymes. examined extensively for its capacity to activate compounds with carcinogenic properties. Continuous exposure to inhalation chemicals and environmental carcinogens is thought to increase the level of CYP1A1 expression in extrahepatic tissues. through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Although the latter has long been recognized as a ligand-induced transcription factor. which is responsible for the xenobiotic activating pathway of several phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes. recent evidence suggests that the AhR is involved in various cell signaling pathways critical to cell cycle regulation and normal homeostasis. Disregulation of these pathways is implicated in tumor progression. In addition. it is becoming increasingly evident that CYP1A1 plays an important role in the detoxication of environmental carcinogens. as well as in the metabolic …,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,379,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2407-9-187,16407900109663533573,/scholar?cites=16407900109663533573,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2407-9-187,0,0,0

One of their most important characteristics. responsible for their cancer preventive properties. is their interaction with cytochrome P450 CYP1 enzymes. Flavonoids have traditionally been described as CYP1 inhibitors due to the inhibition of carcinogenic product formation and consequent blockage of the initiation stage of carcinogenesis. However. mounting evidence indicate that flavonoids are also capable of acting as CYP1 substrates. undergoing bioactivation to more antiproliferative agents within cancer cells.

Cellular genes that are altered are normally involved in maintaining cell homeostasis by participating in signaling pathways tightly regulated to maintain the functional integrity of the cell. When these genes are altered they escape from the regulatory control and transmit signals that lead to the progressive conversion of normal cells into cancer cells. Oncogenic signals involve activation of kinases. which can be either a primary event when they are directly mutated in a tumor cell or a secondary event as recipients and mediators of oncogenic signals.

The placenta acts not only as a gatekeeper of nutrient and waste exchange between mother and developing fetus. but also as a regulator of the intrauterine environment. Its functions can be influenced by the environment encountered throughout pregnancy. thereby altering the appropriate genetic programming needed to allow for appropriate fetal growth. Epigenetic alterations related to environmental exposures have been linked to aberrant fetal growth. DNA methylation. which is the best known DNA epigenetic modification. may provide an attractive mechanism linking environmental cues to placental pathology. with consequences for fetal growth and adult life.

Placentation is a crucial process that includes angiogenesis. Angiogenesis involves not only the fetal circulation. but also placental and endometrial vascular changes. In this study. we review the literature regarding any impairment in the angiogenic process in placentas from pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR). Angiogenesis is regulated by a list of factors. also known as growth factors. such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). the placental growth factor (PlGF) and the basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF). as well as the partial pressure of oxygen in the fetoplacental vessels.

Currently. molecular detection methods are the gold standard for identification of HPV. The three categories of molecular assays that are available are based on the detection of HPV DNA and include (1) non-amplified hybridization assays. such as Southern transfer hybridization (STH). dot blot hybridization (DB) and in situ hybridization (ISH); (2) signal amplified hybridization assays. such as hybrid capture assays (HC2); (3) target amplification assays. such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ PCR. STH requires large amounts of DNA. is laborious and not reproducible. while ISH has only moderate sensitivity for HPV.

The enhancer‐type activity is host cell dependent. being greater in human cells and Syrian hamster cells (the usual host cell for in vitro propagation of HSV) than in Chinese hamster or mouse cells. Enhancer activity is stimulated up to 10‐fold after superinfection by tsK. a temperature‐sensitive mutant of HSV‐1. The induction of enhancer activity is independent of de novo protein synthesis. showing that trans‐activation is effected by a component of the virion.

Activation of ras genes involves mutations that alter the catalytic activity of the protein enhancing the downstream signals mostly towards cell proliferation and malignant transformation. Ras genes are also involved in induction of senescence or apoptosis. suggesting activation of alternative pathways that may be anti-oncogenic. Early experiments showed that transfection of wild-type ras in transformed cells reversed the oncogenic phenotype suggesting that wild-type ras has onco-suppressive properties.

96582,Expression of oncogenes in human tumours with special reference to the head and neck region,1987,JK Field and DA Spandidos,16,,3,97-107,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,A major recent advance in cancer research has been in the field of oncogenes. Oncogenes are genes with a proven cancer association and which appear to be particularly implicated in cellular regulation and proliferation. The oncogenic potential of specific cellular genes has now been recognised and this has influenced current thinking concerning the initiation of carcinogenesis. The specific role of an oncogene is still incompletely understood but research with one particular oncogene (ras) has demonstrated that it can be involved in more than one stage of multi‐step carcinogenesis. New techniques are being developed and evaluated to determine the expression of specific oncogenes in normal and neoplastic tissues. with a view to using them in future diagnostic immunohistopathological methods. This review describes the concept of oncogenes and discusses their role in the development of neoplasia.

The present study aimed to characterize the metabolism and further antiproliferative activity of the natural flavonoid diosmetin in the CYP1-expressing human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Diosmetin was converted to luteolin in HepG2 cells after 12 and 30 h of incubation. In the presence of the CYP1A inhibitor α-naphthoflavone. the conversion of diosmetin to luteolin was attenuated. 3-(4.5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays revealed luteolin to be more cytotoxic than diosmetin. The antiproliferative effect of diosmetin in HepG2 cells was attributed to blockage at the G2/M phase as determined by flow cytometry.

The potential reversibility of epigenetic mechanisms makes them attractive candidates for the prevention and/or treatment of ovarian carcinoma. Detection of the epigenetic signature of each cancer cell may be useful in the identification of candidate biomarkers for disease detection. classification and monitoring and may also facilitate personalized cancer treatment. In ovarian cancer. in addition to other non‑gynaecological cancers. two opposite epigenetic phenomena occur. The first involves an overall global decrease in DNA methylation of heterochromatin leading to demethylation of several oncogenes. while the second involves specific CpG island hypermethylation associated with the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.

Therefore. new therapeutic strategies are currently being explored and are based on a better understanding of the underlying biochemical and molecular mechanisms of tumor cell resistance. Hence. novel sensitizing agents that can modify the tumor dysregulated apoptotic gene products can reverse resistance when used in combination with subtoxic doses of cytotoxic reagents.

It is generally accepted that Human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 and E7 function as the dominant oncoproteins of ‘high-risk’ HPVs by altering the function of critical cellular proteins. Initially it was shown that HPV E6 enhances the degradation of p53. while HPV E7 inactivates the function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb. However. recent studies during the last decade have identified a number of additional host cellular targets of both HPV E6 and E7 that may also play an important role in malignant cellular transformation.

CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 have shown elevated levels in human tumors as determined by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical studies. However studies that have examined CYP1 expression by enzyme activity assays are limited.    ResultsIn the current study the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 was investigated in a panel of human tumors of bladder and colorectal origin by qRT-PCR and enzyme activity assays. The results demonstrated that 35% (7/20) of bladder tumors and 35% (7/20) of colon tumors overexpressed active CYP1 enzymes. CYP1B1 mRNA was overexpressed in 65% and 60% of bladder and colon tumors respectively. whereas CYP1A1 was overexpressed in 65% and 80% of bladder and colon tumors. Mean mRNA levels of CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 along with mean CYP1 activity were higher in bladder and colon tumors compared to normal tissues (p<0.05). Statistical analysis revealed CYP1 expression levels to be independent of TNM status. Moreover. incubation of tumor microsomal protein in 4 bladder and 3 colon samples with a CYP1B1 specific antibody revealed a large reduction (72.5 ± 5.5 % for bladder and 71.8 ± 7.2% for colon) in catalytic activity. indicating that the activity was mainly attributed to CYP1B1 expression.

The tumors were placed in one of the following eight groups. according to the results of EGF. TGF-alpha and EGFR expression: group 1: none. group 2: only EGFR. group 3: EGFR and TGF-alpha. group 4: EGFR and EGF. group 5: TGF-alpha. and EGF. group 6: all three. group 7: only TFG-alpha and. finally. group 8: only EGF. Statistical analysis of the results revealed that the ratio of thyroid carcinomas with lymph node metastasis was significantly higher in groups 3 and 6 for follicular carcinomas (P less than 0.01) and in groups 4. 5 and 6 for papillary carcinomas (P less than 0.01). These results suggest that thyroid carcinomas expressing the systems EGF/EGFR. TGF-alpha/EGFR or TGF-alpha/EGF/EGFR display pathologic features of more aggressive disease.

In this context. the assessment of tumor cell metabolic pathways generates crucial data pertaining to the mechanisms through which tumor cells survive and grow in a milieu of host defense mechanisms. Indeed. various studies have demonstrated that the metabolic signature of tumors is heterogeneous. Furthermore. these metabolic changes induce the exacerbated production of several molecules. which result in alterations that aid an inflammatory milieu.

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in a genetic locus indicates the presence of a gene located in the same region that could be implicated in the development or the progression of a disease. In this study. the occurrence of LOH in tissues involved in PEX and the possible correlation of LOH incidence with clinical parameters were evaluated. METHODS: Twelve iris specimens. 12 anterior capsule specimens. and respective blood samples were obtained from 17 patients with PEX (13 men). who were undergoing glaucoma and cataract surgery. Sixteen anterior capsule specimens and four iris specimens were obtained from 16 patients without PEX. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite markers located on chromosomes 1. 7. 9. and 13. RESULTS: Overall. 83.3%(20/24) of PEX specimens and 94.11%(16/17) of patients with PEX had LOH. The highest incidence of LOH was observed in marker D13S175 (41.6%) followed by D7S478 and D7S479 (37.5%). Only three non-PEX specimens displayed LOH. The number of loci lost was directly related to the altitude of the patients' present residence. but the number lost did not differ significantly between the iris and capsule samples.

96694,Oncogenes and onco-suppressor genes in lung cancer,1993,MLM Anderson and DA Spandidos,87,,6,413-420,WB Saunders,It has been known for many years that the evolution of cancer is a multi-step process [for review see (1) and references therein]. Insight into the nature of some of the steps has been gained through advances in molecular and cellular biology and it has become apparent that mutations in a limited number of genes which control cell proliferation and differentiation is a key feature of this process. Two categories of genes in particular have been implicated: proto-oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes [for review see (2)]. Protooncogenes become ‘activated to oncogenes through particular mutations so that either the normal protein is overexpressed or a mutant protein is produced. Expression of tumour suppressor genes is believed to restrain cells from unregulated proliferation and inactivation of both homologues releases cells from these controls.Numerous studies have been undertaken to determine the mutational …,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,39,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0954611193900669,3760597319020201362,/scholar?cites=3760597319020201362,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0954611193900669/pdf?md5=ea0789e663595be5afb35e33661a9d29&pid=1-s2.0-0954611193900669-main.pdf,0,0,0

In the present study we analyzed in depth. the expression of several groups of these DE genes.   Materials and Methods Samples from 30 human BCs and their adjacent normal tissues were analyzed by whole genome cDNA microarrays. qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Our attention was focused on cell-cycle control and DNA damage repair genes. genes related to apoptosis. signal transduction. angiogenesis. as well as cellular proliferation. invasion and metastasis. Four publicly available GEO Datasets were further analyzed. and the expression data of the genes of interest (GOIs) were compared to those of the present study. The relationship among the GOI was also investigated. GO and KEGG molecular pathway analysis was performed to identify possible enrichment of genes with specific biological themes.   Results Unsupervised cluster analysis of DNA microarray data revealed a clear distinction in BC vs. control samples and low vs. high grade tumors. Genes with at least 2-fold differential expression in BC vs. controls. as well as in non-muscle invasive vs. muscle invasive tumors and in low vs. high grade tumors. were identified and ranked.

It usually appears on the upper trunk and shoulders as erythematous and squamous lesions. Although it has a slow growth and seldom metastasizes. early diagnosis and management are of crucial importance in preventing local invasion and subsequent disfigurement. Dermoscopy is nowadays an indispensable tool for the dermatologist when evaluating skin tumors. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is a novel imaging technique that allows the non‑invasive. in vivo quasi‑microscopic morphological and dynamic assessment of superficial skin tumors.

96752,Immunohistochemical study of ras and myc oncoproteins in apocrine breast lesions with and without papillomatosis.,1992,NJ Agnantis and H Mahera and N Maounis and DA Spandidos,13,European journal of gynaecological oncology,4,309-315,,We have previously employed different immunohistochemical procedures for the study of breast disease in the human. The use of the monoclonal antibodies (M. Abs) against protein products of the ras and c-myc oncogenes has shown that the respective oncoproteins are expressed not only in the cancer cases but also in the majority of complex cystic diseases (CCD). The term CCD is used when cystic disease is associated with epithelial hyperplasia and cellular atypia but without malignant transformation. Additionally. the degree of staining intensity is increasing when the latter is associated with papillary apocrine metaplasia. which is included in the group of epithelial hyperplasias. In the present study we examined 50 cases of CD 20 of which were present in infiltrating duct carcinomas of non otherwise specified (NOS) type and the remaining 30 concerned benign biopsy material. We divided CD into simple (SCD) and complex (CCD) and we focused our interest on the presence or absence of papillary hyperplasia in apocrine metaplastic lesions. The whole material (50 cases) was examined immunohistochemically for the c-myc p62 protein using the M. Ab. Myc 1-9E10. and 21 cases were also examined for the ras p21 protein using the M. Ab. Y13 259. Our results imply that the great majority of CD show elevated expression of both c-myc p62 and ras p21 when associated with apocrine metaplastic papillary proliferations. Our results suggest that the levels of the expression of ras and myc oncoproteins may serve as premalignant markers for the prevention of the disease.,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,32,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1325346,12122493936331995725,/scholar?cites=12122493936331995725,,,0,0,0

It was widely demonstrated that through the non-invasive analysis of ctDNA. it is possible to identify and characterize the mutational status of tumors while avoiding invasive diagnostic strategies. Although a number of studies on ctDNA in patients’ samples significantly contributed to the improvement of oncology practice. some investigations generated conflicting data about the diagnostic and prognostic significance of ctDNA. Hence. to highlight the relevant achievements obtained so far in this field. a clearer description of the current methodologies used. as well as the obtained results. are strongly needed. On these bases. this review discusses the most relevant studies on ctDNA analysis in cancer. as well as the future directions and applications of liquid biopsy. In particular. special attention was paid to the early diagnosis of primary cancer. to the diagnosis of tumors with an unknown primary location. and finally to the prognosis of cancer patients. Furthermore. the current limitations of ctDNA-based approaches and possible strategies to overcome these limitations are presented.

The mechanism that they use to induce tumour formation varies. Insertional mutagenesis is a common mechanism in rodent. feline and avian retroviruses. where the retrovirus integrates into the host genome and affects the transcription of the neighbouring genes. Cloning of these affected genes led to identification of a series of oncogenes that play a significant role in the induction of human neoplasms. Retrovirus insertion also serves as a model to identify collaborating oncogenes. Human retroviruses use different. more complex mechanisms contributing to oncogenesis.

Evidence comes from studies on the expression of cloned oncogenes transfected into early passage mammalian cells and into immortalized non-tumorigenic cell lines. Transformation of epithelial cells in vitro with cloned cellular and viral oncogenes is of special interest since most human tumors are of epithelial origin. An important aspect of cell transformation by oncogenes is the induction of transforming growth factors (TGFs). The role of oncogenes in differentiation has been examined by introducing the human myc and mutant T24 Ha-ras1 genes into mouse erythroleukemic cells which were then induced to differentiate.

Its progression has been also associated with the involvement of several tumour microenvironmental molecules. Among these. nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) has been indicated as a key player of osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9) activation. However. whether NF‑κB plays a role in the development and progression of melanoma in association with the OPN/MMP‑9 axis according to the BRAFV600E mutation status has not been investigated in detail to date.

These genes are converted into active oncogenes by point mutations in codons 12. 13. and 61. although a more complex way has also been shown. through alteration of gene expression. In order to investigate the spectrum of ras gene mutations. we examined 78 colorectal polypoid adenomas and 76 primary colorectal adenocarcinomas for codon 12 point mutations in K-. H-and N-ras. using a PCR-RFLP assay. K-ras mutations were found in 42.3%(33/78) of adenomas and in 36.8%(28/76) of carcinomas.

96789,Oncogenes in cellular immortalisation and differentiation,1993,Efstathios S Gonos and Demetrios A Spandidos,13,,4,1117-1122,,Oncogenes have been shown to be able to overcome the limited proliferative capacity of normal mammalian cells in culture enforcing them to an immortalised phenotype. which in turn may act as a primary step in tumourigenesis. The oncogenes which display such immortalisation activity have the common feature of nuclear localisation. while the oncogenes which are capable of transforming cells are mainly cytoplasmic. Oncogenes from both families have been shown to interfere with the differentiation processes of several cell types. There is evidence that some of these proto-oncogenes may function as regulators of normal cell differentiation. and when immortalisation occurs this is a process of blocking the cell from achieving a differentiated state. This article focuses on the ability of some oncogenes with different functions. such as myc and ras. to override the limited cellular proliferative capacity and their effects on differentiation; finally it examines the recent implications that some onco-suppressor genes are actively participating in cellular differentiation processes.,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C,27,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8352534,3414098189268076829,/scholar?cites=3414098189268076829,,,0,0,0

Tumor derived mutations in oncogenes potentially provide specific markers for the detection of surgically resectable tumors. The detection of point mutations of H-ras oncogene correlated with this disease. DNA sequences produced by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) can be considered for this application. because theoretically bladder tumors should shed cells containing this mutation into the urine. We examined urine from 21 individuals with bladder cancer before any treatment. as well as tissue specimens from the excised tumor and we found 10 mutations of the H-ras gene at codon 12 in the urine (47.61%) and 14 mutations in the tumor specimens (66.66%).

96835,The structure and function of eukaryotic enhancer elements and their role in oncogenesis.,1986,James Campbell Lang and DA Spandidos,6,,3 Pt B,437-449,,Transcriptional enhancers have now been identified near or within a large number of viral and cellular genes. They are cis-acting regulatory sequences generally capable of elevating transcription from a linked gene in a distance and orientation independent manner. More recent evidence suggests that this activity may be modulated in a host-cell-specific manner. Enhancer function in some cases at least appears to be controlled by the operation of trans-acting factors within the host cell. Occasionally enhancers may also be responsible for repression of gene transcription. It has now become clear that the development of some cancers may be linked with the activity of enhancer sequences. It is likely that this process involves subversion of the normal regulatory mechanisms which control expression of proto-oncogenes through the interposition of exogenous. cis-acting enhancer sequences. The evidence comes from two sources. firstly a strong association between the action of enhancer sequences and some forms of naturally occurring cancers. and secondly. the induction of neoplastic transformation in susceptible cells by genetically manipulated oncogenes under the transcriptional control of enhancer elements.,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC,23,https://europepmc.org/article/med/3527033,9646094379804762713,/scholar?cites=9646094379804762713,,,0,0,0

Although substantial data are available as regards the clinicopathological characterization of COPD. little is known of the molecular basis of the disease. In the present study we analysed the incidence of microsatellite instability (MI) in cytological specimens from patients with COPD. MI reflects increased mutational rate and is associated with decreased accuracy in the DNA repair. resulting in the accumulation of somatic mutations in cells manifesting this genetic alteration. Among 31 specimens tested. 7 (23%) exhibited MI in at least one among 6 microsatellite markers tested. 5 cases were affected in only one marker while the remaining two cases exhibited evidence of MI in two microsatellite markers.

Because they are difficult to identify. only a few have been described. Evidence for their existence has mainly been indirect and comes from the following types of study. 1. Recessive cancer genes in higher and lower eukaryotes have been detected. If both alleles of these genes are deleted or inactivated. cancer develops. 2. Studies on cell hybrids have implicated genes which suppress various stages in the malignant conversion of normal cells eg immortalisation. morphological conversion and metastasis. 3. The isolation from virally induced transformants of flat. non-tumorigenic revertants in which expression of the transforming gene is not down-regulated suggests the presence of genes which suppress the effects of transformation. 4.

Despite an exponential increase in our understanding of potentially important mediators and mechanisms. the pathogenesis remains elusive. and little therapeutic progress has been made in the last few years. Mortality in 3–5 years is still 50%. Autophagy. a highly conserved homeostatic mechanism necessary for cell survival. has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders.

Several herpesviruses and especially gamma-herpesviruses have played an important role in Cancer Biology. contributing significantly to our comprehension of cell signaling and growth control pathways which lead to malignancy. Unlike other infectious agents. herpesviruses persist in the host by establishing a latent infection. so that they can reactivate periodically. Interestingly. some herpesviruses are able to either deliver or induce the expression of cellular oncogenes. Such alterations can result in the derailment of the normal cell cycle and ultimately shift the balance between continuous proliferation and programmed cell death. Herpesvirus infection employs key molecules of cellular signaling cascades mostly to enhance viral replication.

Also. recent molecular studies have shown that activation of c-oncogenes might be responsible for the malignant transformation in some cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. We used immunohistochemical methods to investigate the correlation of ras and c-myc oncogene expression with the presence of HBsAg in human liver disease. Our material consisted of 23 chronic active hepatitis B needle liver biopsies and surgical specimens from 11 cases of cirrhosis. 23 hepatocellular carcinoma and 10 normal adult livers. Direct. three-step and streptavidin-biotin-complex immunoperoxidase techniques using polyclonal (anti-HBsAg) and monoclonal antibodies (anti-ras p21. anti-myc p62). were performed. Normal liver tissues were negative for all antibodies used. In HBsAg+ chronic active hepatitis B cases enhancement of c-myc. and less frequently of ras oncogene expression. was a common observation. Increased myc p62 and ras p21 expression was a finding not restricted to HBsAg+ hepatocytes. which occasionally were negative for oncoprotein immunostaining. All HBsAg-chronic active hepatitis B cases were negative for ras p21 and myc p62 specific staining. Cirrhotic livers showed more frequently enhanced c-myc expression. Most of the immunostained cells were negative for HBsAg. HBsAg-cases of hepatocellular carcinoma more often showed ras p21 than myc p62 overexpression.

A pair of complementary oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 site was synthesized and used in gel retardation assays to determine the role of the AP-1 protein in the regulation of the Rb gene expression. Using nuclear extracts from Hela cells as well as from lung and bladder tumors. we found specific binding of the AP-1 protein to this oligonucleotide. This binding is elevated in Hela cells. in 10/13 lung and 3/8 bladder tumors as compared to adjacent normal tissue.

It probably reflects an ancestral relationship with lentiviruses stemming from the primate-simian immunodeficiency virus evolutionary pathway leading to an idiosyncratic immune tolerance. which needs to be understood if effective vaccines are to be rationally designed. The majority of CD4+ T cells that die due to HIV-1 in the asymptomatic phase are not infected with the virus. Transmission of the predominant HIV-1 R5 variants to T cells is mediated by infected monocyte-derived macrophages. The two cell populations come into intimate contact mainly in the lymph nodes during antigen presentation where there is also active viral replication.

Our results suggest an association of the expression of ras p21 with metaplastic and neoplastic gastric mucosa. The comparative study showed that 58 of the 88 gastric carcinoma cases studied exhibited negative or equivocal staining (-/+). The remaining 30 were positive with moderate (+) or intense (++) staining. There was an agreement in that histologic type and tumor grade had a strict correlation with staining intensity. Intestinal metaplasia had a higher percentage of positively stained cells (+ or++).

Recent convincing evidence indicates that the majority of the cells that die due to HIV‐1 are not actually infected by the virus. Instead. these cells are being led to programmed cell death after the activation of apoptotic mechanisms by the virus or its components. We propose here from accumulated evidence that the virus appears to deregulate the physiological function of these cells during the process of antigen presentation. Ionic interactions between the variable V3 domain of the HIV‐1 coat glycoprotein gp120 and the amino terminal of the chemokine receptor CCR5 play a prominent role in this process. and we speculate that nature has evolved simple electrostatic interaction mechanisms which. coupled to specific recognition systems on the cell surface. can initiate and modulate …,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:3htObqc8RwsC,13,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0300-9475.2004.01377.x,17791290308457937270,/scholar?cites=17791290308457937270,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0300-9475.2004.01377.x,0,0,0

Endometriosis is a medical condition affecting one tenth of women in their fertile years. and accounts for up to 50% of infertile women. Thus. such high prevalence has established the necessity for investigating the effectiveness of available techniques in eradicating the disease and constraining infertility as well as the accompanying pain symptoms of endometriosis. The underlying mechanisms connecting endometriosis with low fecundity have been extensively studied. both in terms of genetic alterations and epigenetic events that contribute to the manifestation of an infertility phenotype in women with the disease.

I also think that Max Planck was right in saying that an important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out and that the growing generation is familiarized with the idea from the beginning. I was born in Agios Constantinos a little village in the slopes of mount Taygetos near Sparta. Greece. As a youngster I had to walk long distances to go to school. forming a habit that I still keep up. During my undergraduate studies at the Department of Chemistry. University of Thessaloniki. Greece.

MUC-1 is frequently expressed in adenocarcinoma. The sequentially-repeating nature of the core protein 20 aa polypeptide chain on the surface of malignant cells makes it a potential target for immunotherapy. Addressing the physicochemical role of these peptide tandem repeats (VNTR) in the structure of MUC-1 we have been prompted to use dynamic light scattering as an experimental tool to investigate peptide polymer size and dynamics directly in solution. We synthesized oligomeric VNTR peptides (monomer. trimer and pentamer) and studied their free behavior in aqueous solution. Our results revealed the simultaneous presence of three different relaxation modes corresponding to three different sizes. The small size is related to the expected hydrodynamic radius of the individual peptides. whereas the large size is associated with the presence of higher order peptide aggregates.

97055,Human papilloma virus (HPV) in lung cancer: unanswered questions,2010,Melpomeni P Kountouri and Ioannis N Mammas and Demetrios A Spandidos,67,,1,125,Elsevier,We read with interest the review by Klein et al.[1] h ighlighting the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) in lung carcinoma samples and indicating its potential role in lung carcinogenesis. In this review. it was shown that the overall incidence of HPV in lung cancer up to date is 24.5%. which essentially renders HPV the second commonest risk factor for lung cancer if the cause–effect link is indeed valid. Interestingly. there is geographic variation with higher mean incidence rates reported in Asia (35.7%) compared to Europe (17%) and America (15%). This variation has been attributed to the different detection methods used and possibly to the epidemiology of the HPV itself. although information on HPV prevalence worldwide is absent.The main questions therefore that need to be answered are: what is the route of transmission of HPV to lung tissue and how can it be potentially tumourogenic?

Additionally. H-ras cooperates with glucocorticoids and with ovarian hormones in cell transformation and in the development of mammary carcinomas. Steroids are considered to be tumor promoters and their levels influence the cure rates and survival of the patients with gynecological lesions. It is proposed that they exert tumor promoting activity by transcriptional regulation of nuclear proto-oncogenes. such as c-fos. c-jun. and c-myc. The human H-ras gene contains within its first and fourth introns. sequences that are specifically recognized by glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors. respectively. Using gel retardation assays. the level of steroid receptor binding in H-ras elements has been compared. employing nuclear extracts from human endometrial and ovarian lesions and from the adjacent normal tissue. Elevated binding of the glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors in the corresponding H-ras elements in almost all tissue pairs tested has been found.

During the last decade. their possible oncogenic involvement has also been proposed in a substantial proportion of nongenital cancers. such as breast and lung cancer. The presence of high-risk HPVs in the neonatal oral mucosa supports the transmission of HPVs from the mother to her newborn. This review presents current evidence that supports the perinatal transmission of high-risk HPVs and suggests that this may be the initial step of the oncogenic strategy of high-risk HPVs in humans.

On analysing all of these tumours into early and late disease (ie stage I and II; and stage III and IV) a correlation was found between p21-ras overexpression and early disease (P< 0.0001). As staging of neuroblastomas has been considered to be a prognostic indicator. it is argued that ras p21 over-expression maybe an indicator for a favourable prognosis in these patients.,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:kw52XkFRtyQC,7,https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijo.1.1.53,5728331908180401831,/scholar?cites=5728331908180401831,,,0,0,0

The transfected sublines formed colonies in soft agar and were tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. DNA synthesis was measured in each of the cell lines by 3H-thymidine incorporation and in the parent line there was dose related stimulation of DNA synthesis by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and inhibition by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). The c-myc transfected line had a reduced inhibitory response to TGF-beta and an exaggerated stimulatory response to EGF whereas the activated H-ras1 transfected line did not respond to TGF-beta or EGF. The activated H-ras1 transfected line was significantly more resistant to doxorubicin (ID50. 4.4 nM) and vincristine (ID50. 4.9 nM) than the parent mink lung epithelial cell line (ID50. 2.7 nM and 2.4 nM respectively).

97139,Oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes as prognostic indicators in the development of human tumours,1996,JK Field and DA Spandidos,,,,,Oxford University Press. New York,The advent of the development molecular techniques has expanded the field of new prognostic indicators in cancer research. The discovery of oncogenes during the 1980s and tumour-suppressor genes in the early 1990s has provided new data for scientists and clinicians to determine the molecular development and progression of cancer. However. the clinical correlations with the molecular progression of the disease has relied on clinical and histological staging systems that have been used for many years and which have many limitations. The reliance on these staging systems. for example. clinical staging (TNM size of tumour. nodes and metastasis based on the UICC system) and histological (level of differentiation). will in time be replaced by the introduction of molecular staging systems for each cancer. This era has arrived in so far as it is now possible to identify a predisposing genetic aberration in certain familial cancers and identify individuals at risk. Within the next 10 years it can be envisaged that molecular markers. such as oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes. may be used to identify potentially malignant lesions and progressive and terminal stages of neoplasia. As this ideal situation has not yet been attained. this chapter provides an overview of the current state of the art and highlights achievements and limitations of our present understanding of oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes as being useful prognostic markers in human cancers.

Both transfectant cells expressed CAT activity from the HIV LTR promoter. The response to the anti-neoplastic drug cisplatin was studied on the LTR regulated CAT activity in both cell lines. It was found that cisplatin at 2.5 x 10 (-5) M concentration stimulates the expression of CAT by 26-fold from the HIV LTR in A27HIV1-1. but requires a concentration of 5 x 10 (-5) M to enhance expression by 4.1-fold in the cisplatin resistant 27CPHIV1-1 cells.

To explore this hypothesis we have determined the effect of interferons. including recombinant leukocyte (IFN-alpha). fibroblast (IFN-beta) and immune (IFN-gamma). on expression of the Ha-ras proto-oncogene in the human melanoma cell line Colo 38. While concentrations of up to 1000 U/ml of either IFN-alpha or IFN-beta did not affect the total amounts of Ha-ras products. IFN-gamma at concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 U/ml caused a dose-and time-dependent (48-96 hr) reduction (approximately 40%) in the accumulation of Ha-ras-1 mRNA and in the synthesis of the specific protein products. Downregulation of this proto-oncogene occurs prior to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-gamma and parallels similar IFN-gamma mediated changes in the expression of certain melanoma associated antigens.

USA). the diagnosis of SMA type I is clinical and is based on detailed general physical and neurological examinations. SMA type I remains the most common genetic disease resulting in death in infancy and is really devastating for the child. the parents. as well as the medical professionals with the privilege of caring for patients with SMA and their parents. The proposed management options include: i) no respiratory support; ii) non‑invasive ventilation; and iii) tracheotomy with mechanical ventilation. Deciding. which option is the best. is indeed a very personal decision. The optimal clinical care should be extremely mindful of parents' wishes and management goals with regard to the quality of life.

The existing cross-sectional data show a clear association between a higher number of lifetime or recent oral sex partners and an increased odds of prevalent oral HPV infection [4–6]. providing compelling evidence that oral HPV infection is sexually transmitted in some manner. However. longitudinal partner studies are needed to confirm exactly which behaviors are involved and the level of transmission risk associated with these behaviors.

In an effort to explore any additive or synergistic interactions between these biological agents which could provide the basis for improved therapeutic regimens for myeloid leukaemia patients. we have investigated the effects of IL-3 on both RA-and vitamin D-induced actions in HL-60 human myeloid leukaemia cells. which have receptors for these three agents. in both clonogenic microassays and liquid suspension cultures. The proliferative stimulus of IL-3 overrode and reversed the antiproliferative actions of both RA and vitamin D. the latter being more sensitive to the counter-acting effect of IL-3. Whereas only high concentrations of IL-3: 1000 or more U/ml were able to oppose the antiproliferative effect of RA. all concentrations of IL-3 including the low concentration of 10 U/ml. significantly counteracted the anti-proliferative action of vitamin D. RA restrained the proliferative stimulus of IL-3 partly at low physiological concentrations and almost completely at high pharmacological concentrations. The same results were reproduced in liquid suspension culture. Whereas RA restrained the proliferative stimulus of IL-3. vitamin D failed to restrain it. However. IL-3 did not induce differentiation or affect RA-or vitamin D-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells.

Understanding the molecular events that take place during oncogenesis is necessary to find novel. more effective therapeutic interventions.

Alterations in such signaling cascades via mutations. gene amplifications or deletions frequently occur in human neoplasms.

Thus. revealing the mechanisms that regulate the expression of ras genes is critical for understanding their role in the process of tumorigenesis. Transcriptional regulation of the H-ras gene. involves nuclear factors recognizing elements in the promoter region of the gene and hormones; so far. a glucocorticoid response element and a p53 element have been identified. Alternative splicing and specific methylation patterns may regulate the expression of ras genes as well. Altered expression of ras genes has been detected in a variety of human tumours. Differential expression of the ras family genes in breast cancer has shown overexpression of all three members of ras genes. A significant correlation of overexpression of ras genes and stage of the disease was also observed suggesting that aberrant expression of the ras genes may be an initial event in breast cancer oncogenesis. Overexpression of Ras p21 protein has been detected in human endometrial and ovarian tumours. due to elevated p53 protein binding on the p53 element of the cH-ras gene. suggesting that p53 protein participates in the development of human gynecological neoplasias through aberrant transcriptional regulation of the H-ras proto-oncogene.

Though the exact mechanisms of its action are still not fully understood. SRC protein mediates crucial normal cell functions. such as cell development. proliferation and survival. and its dysregulation is considered as an oncogenic signature and a driving force for cancer initiation. In the present review. we present a flashback to the history of the Src research. while focusing on the most important milestones in the field.

Molecular changes such as deregulation of miRNA expression have been linked to tobacco smoking in both types of cancer. Dysfunction of the Mismatch DNA repair (MMR) mechanism has also been associated with a poor prognosis of these cancers. while a cross-talk between specific miRNAs and MMR genes has been previously proposed. We hypothesized that exposure of lung and head and neck squamous cancer cells (NCI and FaDu. respectively) to tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is capable of altering the expression of MSH2 and MLH1. key MMR components. by promoting specific miRNA deregulation. We found that either a low (1 μM) or high (2 μM) dose of NNK induced significant upregulation of “oncomirs” miR-21 and miR-155 and downregulation of “tumor suppressor” miR-422a. as well as the reduction of MMR protein and mRNA expression. in NCI and FaDu. compared to controls. Inhibition of miR-21 restored the NNK-induced reduced MSH2 phenotype in both NCI and FaDu. indicating that miR-21 might contribute to MSH2 regulation. Finally. NNK exposure increased NCI and FaDu survival. promoting cancer cell progression. We provide novel findings that deregulated miR-21. miR-155. and miR-422a and MMR gene expression patterns may be valuable biomarkers for lung and head and neck squamous cell cancer progression in smokers.

Direct detection of this virus is difficult due to the lack of a simple tissue culture system for growing the virus. Amplification of HBV nucleic acid sequences with the Polymerase Chain Reaction technique leads to the direct detection of the virus. but involves several critical steps and it is prone to false positive results due to inter sample contaminations. We overcame these shortcomings by using a simple boiling method for extracting DNA from histological slides of tissues coupled with double ('nested') PCR amplification.

Boston. MA,The activation of K-ras oncogene by point mutation at its 12th codon has been reported as a molecular marker of tumor progression in colonic neoplasias (early event. correlated with the increasing size of adenomas. but not with dysplasia)1. The overall frequency of K-ras point mutations has probably been underestimated by the usual former techniques. Direct sequencing of PCR amplified K-ras oncogene demonstrated that 75% and 65% adenomas and adenocarcinomas. respectively. harbored a mutated allele of K-ras at codon 122. We described a new sensitive method for an easier detection of this mutation. based upon the introduction of an artificial restriction site in a modified primer for selective in vitro amplification3.

97327,Suppression of the Phenotype of T24 H-ras1 Transformed Cells,1991,Demetrios A Spandidos,,,,145-151,Springer. Boston. MA,Many tumors contain activated ras genes (Bos. 1989; Field and Spandidos. 1990). These genes are thought to be involved in the development of these cancers. It would be of great therapeutic value to find ways to prevent these cancer cells growing. Therefore it is of interest to explore methods by which the growth of ras transformed cells is controlled i.e. suppression of cancer phenotype. These studies are more easily undertaken in vitro i.e. in tissue culture systems than in vivo and in this paper we will concentrate on the in vitro studies. A recent review has classified the suppression of ras transformants into three groups (Kuzumaki. 1991). Viz. 1. Those that operate through genetic material (genetical). 2. Those that operate through biological response modifiers (biological) and 3.

The present study aimed to characterize the metabolism and further antiproliferative activity of the hydroxylated flavonoids apigenin. luteolin. scutellarein. kaempferol and quercetin in CYP1 recombinant enzymes and in the CYP1 expressing cell lines MCF7 and MDA–MB–468. respectively. Apigenin was converted to luteolin and scutellarein. whereas kaempferol was metabolized only to quercetin by recombinant CYP1 enzymes. Luteolin metabolism yielded 6 hydroxyluteolin only by recombinant CYP1B1. whereas CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 were not capable of metabolizing this compound. Molecular modeling demonstrated that CYP1B1 favored the A ring orientation of apigenin and luteolin to the heme group compared with CYP1A1. The IC50 of the compounds luteolin. scutellarein and 6 hydroxyluteolin was significantly lower in MDA–MB–468. MCF7 and MCF10A cells compared with that of apigenin. Similarly. the IC50 of quercetin in MDA–MB–468 cells was significantly lower compared with that of kaempferol. The most potent compound was luteolin in MDA–MB–468 cells (IC50= 2±0.3 μM). In the presence of the CYP1-inhibitors α-napthoflavone and/or acacetin. luteolin activation was lessened. Taken collectively. the data demonstrate that the metabolism of hydroxylated flavonoids by cytochrome P450 CYP1 enzymes. notably CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. can enhance their antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cells.

In melanoma. the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway is constitutively activated through multiple mechanisms. including B-RAF mutation. It has been hypothesized that B-RAF mutations in melanocytic lesions arise from DNA damage induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However. it is still discussed if B-RAF mutations are associated with melanoma patients exposed to the sun. Therefore. in the present study. the known B-RAFV600E mutation was analysed in melanoma samples from 30 indoor and 38 outdoor workers. B-RAFV600E mutation was detected in 52 and 73% of outdoor workers and indoor workers. respectively. Of note. this mutation was identified in 12 of 14 (85%) melanoma of the trunk diagnosed in indoor workers and in 9 of 19 (47%) samples from outdoor workers (p=0.03). By analyzing melanomas of other body sites. no statistical difference in the frequency of B-RAFV600E mutation was identified between the groups of workers. It appears that the mutation detected among indoor workers may be associated with a recreational or intermittent exposure to the sun. as usually the trunk is a sun-protected body site. Overall. these data indicate that the B-RAFV600E mutation detected in melanoma is not associated with a chronic exposure to the sun. Mutations detected in other genes may also contribute to melanoma development in the subset of patients exposed to UV radiation.,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:XBKgkpziyI4C,0,http://thescholarship.ecu.edu/handle/10342/5576,,,,https://thescholarship.ecu.edu/bitstream/handle/10342/5576/or-31-03-1079.PMC3926654.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Current research on breast cancer has shown a relationship between amplification of the c-erbB-2 or Her-2/neu oncogenes and disease progression and patient survival (Slamon et al.. 1987). Similarly. amplification of the N-myc oncogene was found consistently in patients with advanced state neuroblastoma which was relatively resistant to chemotherapy (Schwab et al.. 1984). The association between oncogene expression and prognosis could be due to two related variables: oncogene activation could be associated with a particularly aggressive malignant phenotype. eg they could confer metastability; or the oncogenes could confer cellular drug resistance to conventional chemotherapy resulting in a tumour refractory to standard therapy. A number of in vitro studies have indicated that oncogene transfection of immortalised cells can result in relative resistance to a number of antineoplastic drugs. including cisplatin (Sklar 1988). In addition. the rate of proliferation of tumour cells may be governed by the pattern of oncogene activation and the cocktail of growth factors operant in their microenvironment.,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:4Ol-GlP6dRYC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=XEnUBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA285&dq=info:HLVUrD2Zz8cJ:scholar.google.com&ots=t38nn5IKcO&sig=xx3EI3zypwDmuuxDgmczfbTtZq4,,,,,0,0,0

These 3p genetic alterations led to the conclusion tha 3p conrains several tumor suppressor genes. TSGs. Our experiments led to the surprising conclusion that 3p21. 3 region contains at least 10 new TSGs. Among these TSGs were representatives of new types of TSGs: eg HYAL1 showing growth inhibiting activity only in vivo. NPRL2 may be a target of cisplatin. the one of the main anticancer drugs. RBSP3 is the only known direct activator of RB1. This gene also regulates activity of RNA PolII. During last years two new TSGs were identified: APRG1 and ITGA9. Another direction is based on the whole genome approach to analyse tumor cells using technologies recently developed by us: NotI microarrays (NMA). This new technique opens possibility to study epigenetic (ie methylation) and genetic (ie deletions/amplifications) changes in cancer cells both simultaneously and differentially. More than 450 cancer samples were tested using NMA (lung. breast. ovary. cervical. kidney. colon). For all studied cancers we found genes specifically methylated in malignant cells. Many genes were found to be methylated in a very high fraction of cancer samples (more than 80%). These genes can be divided in two classes: cancer specific and common for several types of cancer. Methylation of 28 genes was confirmed by methyl specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Methylation status of the genes correlated with expression. Some genes were tested functionally and demonstrated growth and tumor inhibiting activity.

HSV-1 was not detected in controls’ samples. However. one specimen from IPF lung tissue was PCR-positive for HSV-1 (1/11. 9%) while two samples of f-IIPs BALF were also positive for the same virus (2/20. 10%). In addition.

H-RAS mutations in codon 12 were observed in nine tumor samples (30%). The majority of H-RAS codon 12 mutations (78%) were detected in non-invasive TCCs. Of the H-RAS mutations. one was homozygous (11%) and the rest were heterozygous (89%). Moreover. 23/30 samples (77%) exhibited over-expression in at least one of the RAS family genes compared to adjacent normal tissue. Grade III TCCs presented significantly higher N-RAS mRNA levels compared to grade II tumors (p= 0.041. Statistical significance was not reached in the relationship between RAS mutations. expression status and the stage or grade of tumors. In addition. multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model demonstrated that there was no association between mutation/expression status and clinical outcome (progression and recurrence).

According to our previous data. expression of D-glycuronyl C5-epimerase is significantly downregulated in 82-84% of human breast tumours. revealing the gene as a novel potential diagnostic or prognostic marker of human breast cancer. Prostate cancer is another kind of epithelial tumour similar to breast cancer in terms of their hormone-dependency. In spite of an evident progress in prostate cancer diagnosis. the search for additional molecular markers is still active. In this study. comparative analysis of D-glucuronyl C5-epimerase expression in human primary prostate carcinomas. benign prostatic hyperplasias and normal prostatic tissues. as well as in prostate carcinoma cell lines. was performed by TaqMan-based quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR. Epimerase expression was decreased 3-10 fold in 46-48% of prostate tumours (compared to its expression in normal and hyperplastic prostate tissue) and 2-3 fold in all prostate cancer cell lines examined (LNCaP. DU145 and PC-3 cells). Analysis of epimerase promoter methylation by bisulfite sequencing revealed a significant hypermethylation of the promoter region. both in human prostate tumours and cell lines. Treatment of the cells with a demethylating agent (5-aza-dC) restored the levels of epimerase expression up normal. suggesting an epigenetic regulation of epimerase expression in prostate tissue.

TRAIL-resistant tumors need to be sensitized to reverse resistance. Proteasome inhibitors potentiate TRAIL apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and correlate with up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5) via an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 inhibits the transcription repressor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) which regulates TRAIL resistance and negatively regulates DR5 transcription. Treatment of PC-3 and Ramos cells with NPI-0052 (< 2.5 nM) and TRAIL sensitizes the tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. By comparison to bortezomib. a 400-fold less concentration of NPI-0052 was used. NPI-0052 up-regulated DR5 reporter activity and both surface and total DR5 protein expression. NPI-0052-induced inhibition of NF-B activity was involved in TRAIL sensitization as corroborated by the use of the NF-B inhibitor dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin. NPI-0052 inhibited YY1 promoter activity as well as both YY1 mRNA and protein expression. The direct role of NPI-0052-induced inhibition of YY1 and up-regulation of DR5 in the regulation of TRAIL sensitivity was demonstrated by the use of YY1 small interfering RNA. The NPI-0052-induced sensitization to TRAIL involved activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and dysregulation of genes that regulate apoptosis. The NPI-0052 concentrations used for TRAIL sensitization were not toxic to human hematopoetic stem cells.

Treatment of cancer remains one of the biggest challenges. particularly in view of increase in average life span. at least in developed countries; cancer is largely a disease of older individuals. Significant progress has been made in the development of novel therapeutics and the treatment of a large number of cancers. Hence. current therapeutics (chemotherapy. radiation. hormonal. and immunotherapy) have resulted in significant clinical responses and prolongation of life. albeit with little complete remission. One of the major problems in the eradication of cancer is the acquisition/development of resistance and refractoriness to conventional therapeutics. Cross-resistance develops since most cytotoxic therapeutics exerts their antitumor effect by inducing cell death by apoptosis and tumor cells develop mechanisms to resist apoptosis.The failure to eradicate …,True,i3gzJucAAAAJ:tBlTYpvFGQIC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-59745-474-2_13,,,,,0,0,0

Berg (1) describes potential metal-binding domains in nucleic acidbinding proteins. These metal-binding domains consist of sequences Cys-X24-Cys-X415-His-X2-8-Cys. Berg also cites the fact that proteins known to bind ions have short sequences of the form Cys-X2-4-Cys. Cys-X24-His. or His-X2-3-His. A well-known DNA-binding protein. histone H3. also has the conserved sequence Cys-Ala-Ile-His from residues 110 to 113 (2). The nucleo-some octamer has two histones of each kind offour histones. These histones are organized about an axis of symmetry. such that these conserved sequences on each histone H3 oppose each other (3). The apposition of these two histone H3 sequences would generate a structure potentially able to coor-dinate a metal ion. namely 2 (Cys-Ala-Ile-His).It has been proposed that the two his-tones H3. in the nucleosome. interact through the formation of an interchain di …,True,MZ6qrPUAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C,0,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/234/4783/1589.2.abstract,,,,,0,0,0

99040,Dioxomolybdenum (VI) structural results relevant to the molybdenum containing enzymes,1980,Jeremy Mark Berg,,,,,Stanford University,The molybdenum sites lack the distinctive spectroscopic properties of iron and copper sites in proteins. Structural characterization had depended exclusively on the interpretation of electron paramagnetic resonance spectraču until the recent developments in X-ray absorption spectroscopy21. 22. Analysis of the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) has allowed identification of the probable donor atoms to the molybdenum and determination of the bond distances in certain states of the enzymes sulfite oxidase 23 and xanthine oxidase24. The results of the EXAFS studies of the fully oxidized enzymes. which contain molybdenum in the+ VI oxidation state. are given in Table 1.2. From these studies. the molybdenum coordination spheres have been shown to contain terminal oxo groups as well as several sulfur ligands. These results have heightened the interest in molybdenum complexes with oxo and sulfur ligands. By far the most prevalent type of oxo MO (VI) complex is MoOnL where l represents some ligand or combination of ligands which yields four donor atoms25. At the time that this work began a number of complexes of this type had been structurally characterized25. 26. These complexes all have distorted,True,MZ6qrPUAAAAJ:-jrNzM816MMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7648097234066802429&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

99044,Packaging and transportation of depleted uranium for disposition from the Savannah River Site,,DL Gillas and J Berg,,,,,,The Savannah River Site (SRS) produced a large inventory of depleted uranium trioxide (DUO) in a powder form packaged in approximately 36.000 55-gallon drums that required final disposition. Each drum weighs an average of 680 kg (1.500 pounds) with some as much as 820 kg (1.800 pounds). The weight. and the fact that the material is in a powder form. requires detailed planning concerning the packaging and transportation (P&T) that must be used. Four disposition campaigns have been completed with the first in Fiscal Year 2003 (FY03). the second in FY04/05. and the most recent two campaigns being completed in early FY09. The remaining inventory of approximately 16.000 drums will likely follow similar paths in the future. This paper will describe the DUO inventory and the thought process behind determining the appropriate P&T for each campaign. very briefly covering the first two campaigns and emphasizing the most recent campaigns.In FY03. SRS completed a pilot project that disposed of 3.270 55-gallon drums of DUO. The shipping method used 110-ton mill gondola railcars with a polypropylene coated fabric liner as the DOT “strong. tight” package. These railcars were shipped to the EnergySolutions low level waste (LLW) disposal facility in Clive. UT (previously Envirocare of Utah now referred to in this paper as the Clive Facility) for final disposition of the DUO as LLW. In FY04/05. an additional 7.296 drums that were overpacked in 85-gallon drums were shipped in boxcars (not part of the packaging) since the overpacks were qualified as IP-2 containers due to the excessive weight of the drums (over 680 kg each) to the Clive …,True,MZ6qrPUAAAAJ:pUxgyZctzPYC,0,http://archive.wmsym.org/2009/pdfs/9447.pdf,,,,http://archive.wmsym.org/2009/pdfs/9447.pdf,0,0,0

These atom densities will be used to infer effective actinide neutron capture cross-sections ranging from thorium to califorium isotopes in different neutron spectra relevant to advanced fuel cycles. This project will require the measurement of many samples with high precision and accuracy. The AMS technique at ATLAS is based on production of highly-charged positive ions in an ECRIS followed by injection into a linear accelerator. We use a picosecond laser to ablate the actinide material into the ion source. We expect that the laser ablation technique will have higher efficiency and lower chamber contamination than sputtering or oven evaporation thus reducing ‘cross talk’between samples. The results of offline ablation tests and first results of an accelerated beam generated by the laser coupled to the ECR will be discussed as well as the overall project schedule.,True,MZ6qrPUAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC,0,https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/ecris2012/papers/frxa03.pdf,,,,https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/ecris2012/papers/frxa03.pdf,0,0,0

The biological activity of nitro-substituted compounds is derived from reductive metabolism of the nitro moiety. a process catalyzed by a variety of nitroreductase activities. Resistance of bacteria to nitro-substituted compounds is believed to result primarily from mutations in genes encoding oxygen-insensitive nitroreductases. We have characterized thenfsA and nfsB genes of a large number of nitrofuran-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli and have correlated mutation with cell extract nitroreductase activity.

However. these earlier studies were conducted when the diagnosis of hypothyroidism was only suspected and was confirmed only in the presence of classic clinical features. In contrast. the diagnosis has recently been established in the early mild stage or more often in an asymptomatic stage because of more frequent or routine determinations of thyroid function tests. especially in the elderly. Thus the subjects in the older studies were severely hypothyroid at the time of diagnosis and may not be representative of the present hypothyroid population.

The diagnosis of Parkinsonism is challenging because currently none of the clinical tests have been proven to help in diagnosis. PD may produce characteristic perturbations in the metabolome and such variations can be used as the marker for detection of disease. To test this hypothesis. we used proton NMR and multivariate analysis followed by neural network pattern detection. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis was carried out on plasma samples of 37 healthy controls and 43 drug-naive patients with PD. Focus on 22 targeted metabolites. 17 were decreased and 5 were elevated in PD patients (p < 0.05). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that pyruvate is the key metabolite. which contributes to the separation of PD from control samples. Furthermore. gene expression analysis shows significant (p < 0.05) change in expression of PDHB and NPFF genes leading to increased pyruvate concentration in blood plasma. Moreover. the implementation of 1H- NMR spectral pattern in neural network algorithm shows 97.14% accuracy in the detection of disease progression. The results increase the prospect of a robust molecular definition in detection of PD through the early symptomatic phase of the disease. This is an ultimate opening for therapeutic intervention. If validated in a genuinely prospective fashion in larger samples. the biomarker trajectories described here will go a long way to facilitate the development of useful therapies.

N‐cadherin is downregulated as precursors generate Schwann cells. coinciding with the time at which most axons make target connections. Therefore. glial N‐cadherin expression is essentially restricted to the period of axon outgrowth. We also provide evidence that N‐cadherin supports the formation of contacts between Schwann cell precursors and show that …,True,ZQZOi1YAAAAJ:ON9TkA72AHEC,90,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/glia.20390,4068854373885191150,/scholar?cites=4068854373885191150,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44670861/Wanner_I.B._et_al._Role_of_N-cadherin_in20160412-18283-h2yuxf.pdf,0,0,0

Se- lection of crop(s) is an important issue for agriculture planning. It depends on various parameters such as production rate. market price and government policies. Many researchers studied prediction of yield rate of crop. prediction of weather. soil classification and crop classification for agriculture planning using statistics methods or machine learning techniques. If there is more than one option to plant a crop at a time using limited land resource. then selection of crop is a puzzle. This paper proposed a method named Crop Selection Method (CSM) to solve crop selection problem. and maximize net yield rate of crop over season and subsequently achieves maximum economic growth of the country.

The self-diverting acid contains a novel viscoelastic surfactant that undergoes an increase in viscosity as the fluid penetrates carbonate formations. The decrease in acid concentration as the acid reacts with the carbonate rocks promotes the transformation of spherical micellar structure into a worm-like structure that imparts high viscosity to the fluid. The highly viscous fluid acts as a temporary barrier to reduce further fluid loss into the wormholes and allows complete stimulation of all treating zones. After acid treatment. the viscous fluid is broken by either formation hydrocarbons or pre-flush fluids. The VES based self-diverting acid contains no solids. so there is no bridging when it is pumped through tubing.

The method is based on a single pulse of high-energy excitation light and a double-frame exposure on an interline transfer charge-coupled device camera for recording luminescent lifetime. Small pressures can be measured on surfaces that are moving in an aperiodic manner (which precludes phase averaging). Measurements in environments having overall surface pressure gradients as small as 1 kPa show that the technique is capable of accurately resolving small pressure fluctuations.

The manipulator is visually controlled with stereo vision in an eye-to-hand configuration. A novel Kohonen’s self-organizing map (KSOM) based visual servoing scheme has been proposed for a redundant manipulator with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF). The inverse kinematic relationship of the manipulator is learned using a Kohonen’s self-organizing map. This learned map is shown to be an approximate estimate of the inverse Jacobian. which can then be used in conjunction with the proportional controller to achieve closed loop servoing in real-time.

Currently many substances are under investigation for drug delivery and more specifically for cancer therapy technology is the latest trend in the cancer therapy. It helps the pharmacist to formulate the product with maximum therapeutic value and minimum or negligible range side effects. Cancer is a class of disorders characterized by abnormal growth of cells that proliferate in an uncontrolled way and a major disadvantage of anticancer drugs is their lack of selectivity for tumor tissue. which causes severe side effects and results in low cure rates. Thus. it is very hard to target the abnormal cells by the conventional method of the drug delivery system. In harmony with these approaches. this review’s basic approach is that the defining features of solid lipid nanoparticles are embedded in their breakthrough potential for patient care.

Result shows that the addition of H 2 upto 20% does not exhibit any change in the flame length. However. when hydrogen level is varied from 20% to 40%. a reduction in flame length is observed which may be attributed to the enhanced diffusivity caused due to the increased gas temperature. It is also observed that the SFLF increases as H 2 is added to fuel stream. This might have caused due to the reduction in the C/H ratio in the flame which is favorable to attenuate PAH formation rate. Moreover. the reduction in radiant fraction with hydrogen addition is pertinent with the reduction in soot concentration level. Besides this. the decrease in NO x emission level with H 2 addition to the fuel stream is also observed.

99175,Entrepreneurship development in Nigeria: A review,2014,Linus Egwu Idam,16,Journal of Business and Management,1,01-07,,Empirical researchers and policy makers have shown increasing interest in entrepreneurship and its association with economic development. In the literature. a good number of studies have established positive relationship between entrepreneurship and employment generation. poverty alleviation and economic development. It is for this reason that various governments in Nigeria over the past three decades implemented a number of policies and programmes aimed at addressing the high rate of unemployment. wide-spread poverty and low level of economic development. Unfortunately. the various policies and programmes have failed to achieve the desired results. This paper attempts to identify the causal factors that militate against the effectiveness of government efforts at entrepreneurship development. Major government programmes are examined to identify inherent weaknesses. Supported by empirical and theoretical literature. this paper asserts that the treatment of all small businesses as entrepreneurial constrains the development of entrepreneurship in Nigeria and in other developing economies. as policies and programmes are implemented across the board. It canvasses a distinctive categorization to distinguish entrepreneurial firms from non-entrepreneurial small businesses and the development and implementation of policies and strategies that are suitable for each class of small businesses.

These visually impaired people have a reduced perception of the world around them and thus face a lot of difficulty in carrying out their day to day tasks. Even their problems go unnoticed from the sight of the normal people. The Indian currency notes have a size difference of just ten mm between two consecutive denominations and make it highly unlikely for a blind person to determine it correctly. Also. the new one rupee coin has the same shape and size as was of the old fifty paisa coin while both are in circulation and hence have become undistinguishable now. These problems make visually impaired people unable to do everyday transactions easily. As a part of currency recognition system for visually impaired. we have already developed an efficient currency note localization algorithm that localizes currency notes in color images.

With an SMES-DC link. an SMES system can be shared between several neighboring power systems. This results in better economics for SMES usage for each participating power system. In addition to SMES operation. an SMES-DC link also allows asynchronous connection and interchange of power between the interconnected systems. It is demonstrated that an SMES-DC link can achieve significant economic benefits over pure power interchange or SMES operation alone. The basic principle of an SMES-DC link. which is able to interconnect any number of neighboring power systems with a single SMES unit. and various interconnected system operation modes are presented.

This study was carried out from April 2009 to March 2012 to document the diversity of wetland birds. Altogether 57 species of wetland birds belonging to 37 genera and 16 families were recorded from the study area. Family Anatidae dominated the wetland bird community with 13 species. Among recorded species. 33 were winter migrants. two summer migrants and 22 were resident species. The winter migratory birds did not arrive at this wetland in one lot and at one time. Instead. they displayed a definite pattern specific to species for arrival and departure. They appeared at the wetland during mid-October and stayed up to early April. The composition of birds in major feeding guilds in the study area showed that the insectivore guild was the most common with 35.09% species. followed by carnivore (29.82%). omnivore (19.30%). herbivore (10.53%) and piscivore (5.26%).

India devised its first National Forest Policy (NFP) back in 1894. There has been a paradigm shift from timber production to forest conservation followed by community-based agroforestry and social forestry bringing a change in perspective towards forest resources. This change has been socio-economic. cultural and ecological. Since the 1952 NFP. there has been an advocacy for 33% forest cover with a 60% forest cover in mountainous and hilly regions. This objective was reiterated in the NFP 1988 and also confirmed in the National Forestry Commission report in 2006. This paper reviews the probable reasons for these targets.

99231,Numerical investigation of the flow and flame structure in an axisymmetric trapped vortex combustor,2012,PK Ezhil Kumar and DP Mishra,102,Fuel,,78-84,Elsevier,The main intention of the present investigation is to bring out the effect of the momentum flux ratio (MFR) on the flow and flame structure in an axisymmetric Trapped Vortex Combustor (TVC). In this study. the MFR was varied by changing the secondary air jet velocity. while keeping the fuel. primary and the mainstream air velocities constant. This study revealed that a single vortex. embedded within a flame on its edge was formed in the cavity for the low MFR case (MFR ∼ 0.57) for which intense burning was observed at the shear layer. In contrast. for the higher MFR cases (MFR ∼ 0.82 and 1.8). the flow and flame structures were altered considerably due to the occurrence of multiple vortices within the cavity. A comparison with the previous cold flow study revealed that the change in flow structure was attributed to the volume expansion due to the heat release during the combustion.

The methods of induced abortion dif-fer between species mainly because of different sources for progesterone production during pregnancy between species and within a species according to different stages of gestation. In cows and buffaloes. pregnancy can be effectively terminated from 5 to 150 days by administration of luteolytic doses of prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PG). From 150 days onwards and till term bovine and bubaline pregnancies can be safely terminated by administration of a combination of PG and dexamethasone. During the last month of pregnancy in these two species. pregnancy can be successfully terminated by using either a PG or dexamethasone. In goats pregnancy can be terminated during the entire gestation by administration of luteolytic doses of prostaglandins. In sheep pregnancies up to 55 days can be terminated by administration of 100 μg cloprostenol or 10-12 mg of dinoprost. From day 55 onward the termination of sheep pregnancies requires the administration of single or multiple injections of dexamethasone. Early pregnancy (day 5-34) termination in the mare can be achieved by physical methods or ad-ministration of PG. The same treatment is effective in terminating pregnancies between days 35-120 but repeated injections are required and because the endometrial cups continue to exist for a couple of days after pregnancy termination. mares do not return to estrus for prolonged periods.

In 2007 and 2008. this Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (GASP) was enhanced by the inclusion of data from the South East Asian Region (SEAR) and recruitment of additional centres within the WPR. Approximately 17.450 N. gonorrhoeae were examined for their susceptibility to one or more antibiotics used for the treatment of gonorrhoea by external quality controlled methods in 24 reporting centres in 20 countries and/or jurisdictions. A high proportion of penicillin and/or quinolone resistance was again detected amongst isolates tested in North Asia and the WHO SEAR. but much lower rates of penicillin resistance and little quinolone resistance was present in most of the Pacific Island countries. The proportion of gonococci reported as' resistant'.'less susceptible'or'non-susceptible'gonococci to the third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone lay in a wide range. but no major changes were evident in cephalosporin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) patterns in 2007-2008. Altered cephalosporin susceptibility was associated with treatment failures following therapy with oral third-generation cephalosporins. There is a need for revision and clarification of some of the in vitro criteria that are currently used to categorise the clinical importance of gonococci with different ceftriaxone and oral cephalosporin MIC levels.

Steel braces of SCBFs are expected to undergo large inelastic axial deformations in order to provide an adequate level of structural ductility and hysteretic energy dissipation under cyclic loading. The energy dissipation capacity and ductility of SCBFs largely depend on the slenderness ratio and width-to-thickness ratio of braces. The main objective of this study is to find an optimum range of these parameters for braces of hollow circular steel (HCS) sections in order to achieve the enhanced seismic performance of SCBFs. A finite element (FE) study has been conducted on a wide range of values of these parameters using a software package ABAQUS.

Consequently. therapeutic modulators of the classical. lectin and alternative pathways of the complement system are currently in pre-clinical and clinical development. Our laboratory has identified a peptide that specifically inhibits the classical and lectin pathways of complement and is referred to as Peptide Inhibitor of Complement C1 (PIC1). In this study. we determined that the lead PIC1 variant demonstrates a salt-dependent binding to C1q. the initiator molecule of the classical pathway. Additionally. this peptide bound to the lectin pathway initiator molecule MBL as well as the ficolins H. M and L. suggesting a common mechanism of PIC1 inhibitory activity occurs via binding to the collagen-like tails of these collectin molecules. We further analyzed the effect of arginine and glutamic acid residue substitution on the complement inhibitory activity of our lead derivative in a hemolytic assay and found that the original sequence demonstrated superior inhibitory activity. To improve upon the solubility of the lead derivative. a pegylated. water soluble variant was developed. structurally characterized and demonstrated to inhibit complement activation in mouse plasma. as well as rat. non-human primate and human serum in vitro.

The discovery of virally encoded miRNAs attracted immense attention towards their role in viral replication and pathogenesis. Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated herpes virus encodes miRNA that functions as an orthologue of human cellular miRNA. i.e.. hsa-miR-155. Keeping the same view we extended the miRNA-homology search between the miRNAs of humans and Epstein–Barr virus. The In silico analyses shows that EBV encoded miR-BART-5 has a significant ‘seed’ sequence homology to hsa-miR-18 of humans. Further. the mRNA transcripts of the human genes involved in cellular growth could potentially be targeted by both viral as well as human miRNAs. The known etiological role of hsa-miR-18 as an oncomiR suggests that miR-BART-5 may function as viral oncomiR as observed in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma patients.,True,ZQZOi1YAAAAJ:pxLfhFzThFYC,22,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482511001557,10671822329036272375,/scholar?cites=10671822329036272375,,,0,0,0

99291,Classification of various land features using RISAT-1 dual polarimetric data,2014,VN Mishra and P Kumar and DK Gupta and R Prasad,,,,,International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,Land use land cover classification is one of the widely used applications in the field of remote sensing. Accurate land use land cover maps derived from remotely sensed data is a requirement for analyzing many socio-ecological concerns. The present study investigates the capabilities of dual polarimetric C-band SAR data for land use land cover classification. The MRS mode level 1 product of RISAT-1 with dual polarization (HH & HV) covering a part of Varanasi district. Uttar Pradesh. India is analyzed for classifying various land features. In order to increase the amount of information in dual-polarized SAR data. a band HH+HV is introduced to make use of the original two polarizations. Transformed Divergence (TD) procedure for class separability analysis is performed to evaluate the quality of the statistics prior to image classification. For most of the class pairs the TD values are greater than 1.9 which indicates that the classes have good separability. Non-parametric classifier Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify RISAT-1 data with optimized polarization combination into five land use land cover classes like urban land. agricultural land. fallow land. vegetation and water bodies.

This material shares a similar layered tetragonal structure with iron-based superconductors. with Fe square planar sheets forming from the edge-sharing iron antimony tetrahedral network. CuFeSb differs remarkably from Fe-based superconductors in the height of anion Z anion from the Fe plane; Z Sb for CuFeSb is∼ 1.84 Å. much larger than Z As (1.31–1.51 Å) in FeAs compounds and Z Te (∼ 1.77 Å) in Fe 1+ y Te. In contrast with the metallic antiferromagnetic (AFM) or superconducting state of iron pnictides and chalcogenides under current studies. CuFeSb exhibits a metallic. ferromagnetic (FM) state with T c= 375 K.

99308,Pesticide mineralization in water using silver nanoparticles,2011,G Manimegalai and S Shantha Kumar and Chandan Sharma,9,International Journal of Chemical Sciences,3,1463-1471,Sadguru Publications,In recent days. pesticides are widely used for pest control in agriculture and public health. due to which a large part of drinking water is getting contaminated. Due to their wide spread use. they are present in both; surface and ground water. Pesticides comprise different classes. including insecticides. fungicides. herbicides etc. Most of the pesticides are resistant to biodegradation and are found to be carcinogenic even at ppb levels. Surface adsorption. photocatalysis. membrane separation and biodegradation are the conventional methods of pesticide removal. However. these methods are unfavorable because of its time consumption and expensiveness. Nanoparticles can be utilized for the mineralization of pesticides to overcome both of the above mentioned drawbacks. In order to prevent the contamination of nanoparticles in the purified water after mineralization of pesticides. they need to be incorporated on a support. This paper deals with the review of the supported silver nanoparticles in pesticide degradation. Earlier researchers used activated carbon and alumina as a support for silver nanoparticles in pesticide mineralization.

99310,Effects of bluff-body shape on LPG–H2 jet diffusion flame,2008,P Kumar and DP Mishra,33,International journal of hydrogen energy,10,2578-2585,Pergamon,The effects of bluff-body lip thickness on the several physical parameters like flame length. radiant fraction. gas temperature and NO x emissions in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)–H 2 jet diffusion flame are investigated experimentally. Results indicate that the flame length reduces with the addition of hydrogen in the bluff-body stabilized flame. which can be attributed to the enhanced reactivity and residence time of the mixture gases. Moreover. with increasing lip thickness of the bluff body. the flame length also gets reduced. The soot free length fraction (SFLF) is observed to be enhanced with H 2 addition to the fuel stream.

99311,Indexing the effectiveness of tax administration,2007,Sanjay Kumar and AL Nagar and Sayan Samanta,,Economic and Political Weekly,,104-110,Sameeksha Trust,The capacity of the tax administration needs to be continuously augmented to keep pace with the changing requirements of tax policy. One of the key challenges in this respect is to measure the effectiveness of the tax administration. This paper develops an econometric model for indexing the effectiveness of tax administration by using the principal component method to remove the feedback effect between voluntary and enforced compliance. This model shows that there has not been a large change in the effectiveness of the direct tax administration in the country over a period of time. despite the fact that there has been a substantial increase in the quantum of direct tax revenue. particularly over the last few years. This calls for attention to strengthen the tax administration.,True,ZQZOi1YAAAAJ:iHaZ0gpiSgoC,19,https://www.jstor.org/stable/40277058,13291159708962021818,/scholar?cites=13291159708962021818,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34718603/EPW_-_Indexing_the_Tax_Enforcement_-_15_Dec_2007.pdf,0,0,0

The present study concerned the prevalence of tobacco use and leukoplakia and also associations between the two. Study design: This cross sectional survey was conducted amongst the Gond tribal population of Kundam Block. Jabalpur district. Madhya Pradesh state. Central India during 2007 to 2009. Screening for leukoplakia was conducted by a medical officer with two mouth mirrors. It is only based on visual inspection and oral pathology was not performed. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographic and smoking habits. Prevalence of leukoplakia among users and non-users of tobacco was calculated in terms of percentages. Results: Of 1.552 individuals aged more than 12 years of age who were screened. 144 (9.3%) were found to have oral leukoplakia. The prevalence of leukoplakia was significantly elevated among tobacco users as compared to non-users (11% vs 2.5%; p< 0.001). The percentage of leukoplakia was almost similar in both tobacco smokers and chewers (9% vs 11%; p= 0.304). However. the percentage of leukoplakia was especially high among those chewers who also smoked tobacco (21.9%). Conclusions: The findings of the present study showed a positive effect of tobacco use and prevalence of leukoplakia.

SSSC and UPFC. Furthermore. the state models and control algorithms for the FACTS devices are proposed. A Digital Signal Processor (DSP) is used to implement the control system for these devices. The comparison of the experimental and simulation results is also provided to verify the proposed controls and also it describes an active approach to series line compensation. in which a synchronous voltage source. implemented by a gate turn-off (GTO) based voltage sourced inverter. is used to provide controllable series compensation. This compensator. called static synchronous series compensator (SSSC). can provide controllable compensating voltage over an identical capacitive and inductive range. independently of the magnatude of the line current. It is immune to classical network resonances. In addition to series reactive compensation. with an external DC power supply it can also compensate the voltage drop across the resistive component of the line impedence. The compensation of the real part of the impedence can maintain high X/R ratio even if the line has a very high degree of series compensation. Concurrent and coordinated modulation of reactive and real compensation can greatly increase power oscillation damping.

Many researchers proposed different grid tie inverters for applications like domestic powering. street lighting. water pumping. cooling and heating applications. however traditional grid tie PV inverter uses either a line frequency or a high frequency transformer between the inverter and grid but losses will increase in the network leading to reduced efficiency of the system. In order to increase the efficiency. with reduced size and cost of the system. the effective solution is to remove the isolation transformer. But common mode (CM) ground leakage current due to parasitic capacitance between the PV panels and the ground making the system unreliable. The common mode current reduces the efficiency of power conversion stage. affects the quality of grid current. deteriorate the electric magnetic compatibility and give rise to the safety threats. In order to eliminate the common mode leakage current in Transformerless PV systm two control algorithms of multi-carrier pwm are implemented and compared for performance analysis. The shoot-through issue that is encountered by traditional voltage source inverter is analyzed for enhanced system reliability.

Fuzzy logic theory is highly useful in Medical diagnosis due to the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in the medical knowledge database and their inter relationships. In our approach. the fuzzy system model uses two inputs such as measured CBF of a diabetic patient and derived epilepsy CBF which is obtained from EEG signal parameters and clinical parameters using aggregation operators.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are promising class of drive trains in the coming years especially in urban regions in order to shift the decentralized exhaust emission in megacities to centralized power plants in rural areas. Up to now the BEV’s bottleneck is in the range of 100km per charge due to limited on board energy which can be optimized by introduction of plug-in hybrid vehicles along with real time road traffic management. With increase in liberalization. privatization and expansion of distributed and renewable power generation of Indian electricity market. transmission and distribution. as well as market processes related to the allocation of energy and energy mix are undergoing an evolutionary development with improved efficiency and reliability. A structured analysis of respective parameters is performed for the commercial scopes of electric vehicles in existing energy market. Market-based and regulatory concerns are considered to outline a scenario where an aggregator controls the charging of electric vehicles and provides ancillary grid services. Searching charging stations for electric vehicles is an important issue for the drivers which need the implementation of smart charging infrastructure network.

99362,Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels correspond to fluctuations of lactate levels in crosstalk of astrocyte-neuron cell lines,2010,Shantanu Ghosh and Deepak K Kaushik and James Gomes and Shahid Nayeem and Shashank Deep and Anirban Basu,,,,,CSIR,Neurons and astrocytes differentially express isoenzymes of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The metabolic consequences for the variations in mRNA expression of LDH isoenzyme subtypes in neurons and astrocytes control cerebral vasoregulation. Moreover. cellular signalling consequences for functional neurovascular control may also be dependent on LDH isoenzyme subtype profiles. Initial computer simulations revealed glutamate-induced calcium waves in connected astrocytes. and showed concomitant changes in the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and lactic acid metabolism. To validate these findings. the nature and extent of glutamate-dependent signalling crosstalk in murine cell lines were investigated through correlated lactate levels and calcium upregulation. Neuro2A and C8D1A cells were separately treated with timed supernatant extracts from each other and their LDH1 and LDH5 isoenzyme responses were recorded. Western blot analysis showed LDH1/LDH5 isoenzyme ratio in the astrocytes to be positively correlated with Neuro2A-derived lactate levels estimated by the amplitude of 1.33-ppm spectral peak in 1H-NMR. and LDH1/LDH5 isoenzyme ratio in neurons is negatively correlated with C8D1A-derived lactate levels. Significant modulations of the calcium-responsive protein pCamKII levels were also observed in both cell lines. particularly correlations between pCamKII and lactate in C8D1A cells. thus explaining the calcium dependence of the lactate response. Together. these observations indicate that lactate is a key indicator of the metabolic state of these cell types. and may be a determinant of release of …,True,ZQZOi1YAAAAJ:bJZ_LSxkz4EC,16,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/9079,1448713773261389937,/scholar?cites=1448713773261389937,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/9079/1/IJEB%2048(6)%20529-537.pdf,0,0,0

It prescribes novel methods to manage employees of the knowledge economy. where they use their minds more than their hands. These prescriptions are based on the latest research and on the realization that people from new-age families relate etter to colleagues and peers than to bosses. In order to keep the employees interested and focused. the book also suggests that the management takes responsibility for everything that might adversely affect an employee’s capacity to work creatively and intellingently. irrespective of whether the cause lies inside the organization or outside it. The book considers that attitudinal changes are difficult to achieve. These can be brought about by prescribing an appropriate behaviour and individual in the organization. It mandates organizations to take complete responsibility of their employees. Since the focus of the book is on holistic development of the individual. it does not distinguish between an individual at home and an individual in the organization. It mandates organizations to take complete responsibility of their employees. The book peeps in the human mind and acknowledges that humans continue to have the same passions and fears that they had even during the Stone Age. It prescribes how organizations can tap into the passions and fears of their employees to make them more creative and productive.

India,2015,Shreya K Pereira and Paresh Kumar and Varun Dutt and Kaveri Haldar and Loveday Penn-Kekana and Andreia Santos and Timothy Powell-Jackson,10,Implementation science,1,1-14,BioMed Central,Social franchising is the fastest growing market-based approach to organising and improving the quality of care in the private sector of low- and middle-income countries. but there is limited evidence on its impact and cost-effectiveness. The “Sky” social franchise model was introduced in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in late 2013. Difference-in-difference methods will be used to estimate the impact of the social franchise programme on the quality and coverage of health services along the continuum of care for reproductive. maternal and newborn health. Comparison clusters will be selected to be as similar as possible to intervention clusters using nearest neighbour matching methods. Two rounds of data will be collected from a household survey of 3600 women with a birth in the last 2 years and a survey of 450 health providers in the same localities. To capture the full range of effects. 59 study outcomes have been specified and then grouped into conceptually similar domains. Methods to account for multiple inferences will be used based on the pre-specified grouping of outcomes. A process evaluation will seek to understand the scale of the social franchise network. the extent to which various components of the programme are implemented and how impacts are achieved. An economic evaluation will measure the costs of setting up. maintaining and running the social franchise as well as the cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability of the programme.

Despite the impact of the industry on the environment. the world of pulp and paper industry continues to expand at alarming rates and so more and more paper mills are booming up in the newly industrialized countries. Pulp and paper mill produces large number of highly heterogeneous waste waters containing sulphur based compounds. nitrogen oxide. chlorinated based and many other toxic pollutants. All these lead to very high chemical oxygen demand (COD) values of effluent water. Although there are many cheapest processes available for treatment of various organic effluents. but present need is to use a process which is efficient in reducing pollution and also eco-friendly. Available industrial waste treatment processes are expensive and pose a major threat to the environment. Several methods have been attempted by various researchers throughout the world for the reduction in COD of pulp and paper mill effluents. So this paper is a comprehensive review of various literature sources for adaptation in pollutants and chemical oxygen demand by biodegradable anionic polymers. These anionic polymers are more frequently employed in industrial water clarification plants because of improved flocculation. Also they frequently permit appreciable dosage reduction in primary coagulants. They are exposed to a greater number of separate particles when added to the water because of their strong bridging action. Hence this paper comprises the potential of various biodegradable anionic polymers in purifying the effluent …,True,ZQZOi1YAAAAJ:1HYIo8DVeu0C,15,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shashi_Kumar63/publication/281740100_Treatment_of_Pulp_and_Paper_Mill_Effluents_using_Novel_Biodegradable_Polymeric_Flocculants_based_on_Anionic_Polysaccharides_a_New_Way_to_Treat_the_Waste_Water/links/594bb3e3a6fdcc3bb5ceda28/Treatment-of-Pulp-and-Paper-Mill-Effluents-using-Novel-Biodegradable-Polymeric-Flocculants-based-on-Anionic-Polysaccharides-a-New-Way-to-Treat-the-Waste-Water.pdf,16069304207685364250,/scholar?cites=16069304207685364250,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shashi_Kumar63/publication/281740100_Treatment_of_Pulp_and_Paper_Mill_Effluents_using_Novel_Biodegradable_Polymeric_Flocculants_based_on_Anionic_Polysaccharides_a_New_Way_to_Treat_the_Waste_Water/links/594bb3e3a6fdcc3bb5ceda28/Treatment-of-Pulp-and-Paper-Mill-Effluents-using-Novel-Biodegradable-Polymeric-Flocculants-based-on-Anionic-Polysaccharides-a-New-Way-to-Treat-the-Waste-Water.pdf,0,0,0

Electrical power system developed so far was of three phases since the beginning of the last century but research in the field of multi-phase machines have attracted increased interest in recent years due to the several advantages that they offer as compared to the conventional three-phase ones. such as high power handling capability by dividing the required power between multiple phases. reduced torque pulsations and higher reliability. In particular. unlike in a three phase drive. the loss of stator phase does not prevent the machine from starting and running.

The studs were operated under a steam pressure of 35 kg/cm2 and a temperature of 535°C. The studs were fractured at one end of the threaded end. Various techniques were employed to analyse the failure of the studs. It has been concluded that the failure of the studs was due to reverse temper embrittlement. The failure was delayed due to the presence of Mo and V. To reduce the tendency to this kind of failure. the following steps were recommended: (a) reduce the phosphorus content in the steel to a low level or (b) reduce the grain size to about 10 μm.,True,ZQZOi1YAAAAJ:r655XaDZu5IC,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630700000194,689812135358469330,/scholar?cites=689812135358469330,,http://eprints.nmlindia.org/352/1/Sandip_Ghosh_Chowdhury.pdf,0,0,0

Several protocols (Chunwongse et al. 1993. Kang et al. 1998. Pal et al. 2001. Sharma et al. 2002) and commercial kits (Nucleon phytopure DNA isolation kit. Amersham Biosciences. USA) are available for DNA isolation from rice seed and grain. but they are expensive and/or cumbersome involving the use of relatively costly reagents like Chelex-100. proteinase K and are unsuitable for handling large numbers of samples. An ideal DNA isolation method should require only a small amount of tissue. involve simple procedures. use a minimal number and amounts of chemicals. should be rapid and yield reasonably good quality as well as quantity of DNA.

While a six-fold increase in fumarase (FUM EC 4.2.1.2) activity was observed in cells subjected to Al-citrate compared to control cells. citrate synthase (CS EC 4.1.3.7) activity experienced a two-fold increase. On the other hand. in the Al-stressed cells malate synthase (MS EC 4.1.3.2) activity underwent a five-fold decrease in activity. This modulation of enzymatic activities appeared to be evoked by Al stress. as the incubation of Al-stressed cells in control media led to the complete reversal of these enzymatic profiles.

Traffic congestion is therefore one of the most predominant problems encountered in such environment of which Nigeria case is no exemption. The paper aims to describe intra-urban transport circulation in Akure metropolis with its attendant traffic congestion situation and problems. The study adopts empirical design to investigate vehicular congestion and parking difficulties in the study area. Using field observation. twelve congestion spots were identified and primary source of data was used to find out distance covered within the study area. periods when traffic holdups are experienced and time lost to traffic hold-up in a journey. The study established parking problems in the Central Business District of Akure as a major cause of traffic congestion. The paper therefore suggested that traffic flows along major roads in the city need to be monitored and controlled regularly. There is also need for parking provisions not only in the CBD but also in some identified land use zones.,True,ZQZOi1YAAAAJ:Nnq8S6OXqDYC,13,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14996822580407025816&hl=en&oi=scholarr,14996822580407025816,/scholar?cites=14996822580407025816,,,0,0,0

We report a left ventricular myxoma arising from interventricular septum in a 12-year-old girl who presented with history of single episode of syncope while playing in school. General examination of the child did not reveal any abnormality except a grade II/VI systolic murmur in left parasternal area. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a round pedunculated mass (18 × 30 mm) in left ventricle arising from middle of interventricular septum with a pedicle measuring 4 mm at its base. The tumour was projecting through aortic valve in systole. Syncope in this case was probably due to obstruction of left ventricular outflow tract by myxoma leading to a decrease in cardiac output.

A Wiley Company,Congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a rare cardiovascular anomaly. Rupture of sinus of Valsalva (RSOV) is a rare occurrence. occurring in 10–20% of cases. Rupture into right atrium is further a rare occurrence. The rupture is usually a catastrophic event presenting as acute onset congestive cardiac failure in an apparently healthy individual in the 2nd or 3rd decade of life. Surgery used to be the mainstay of treatment of RSOV aneurysm. however. in past few years several reports of transcatheter closure of RSOV have come into light.

99447,Kenya's quest for growth stabilization and reforms-but political stability?,2008,Luca Bandiera and Praveen Kumar and Brian Pinto,,,,,The World Bank,Kenya has long had a reputation of being politically risky. manifested in corruption. uncertainty about policies. and the importance of political connections in doing business. Kenya began its economic liberalization in 1993. Reform picked up speed after a tightening of aid by donors on governance grounds and an attempt to re-establish credibility following the costly Goldenberg scandal uncovered in 1992. But tangible results in the shape of favorable government debt dynamics and a pick up in growth took a decade to materialize. The paper argues that the peaceful presidential election and transfer of power in December 2002 was central to the economic upswing after 2002. The subsequent decline in political risk was singled out by the private sector as an important development.
