1036812,Application of metabolomics in thyroid cancer research,2015,Anna Wojakowska and Mykola Chekan and Piotr Widlak and Monika Pietrowska,2015,,,,Hindawi,Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with four major types distinguished on the basis of histopathological features: papillary. follicular. medullary. and anaplastic. Classification of thyroid cancer is the primary step in the assessment of prognosis and selection of the treatment. However. in some cases. cytological and histological patterns are inconclusive; hence. classification based on histopathology could be supported by molecular biomarkers. including markers identified with the use of high-throughput “omics” techniques. Beside genomics. transcriptomics. and proteomics. metabolomic approach emerges as the most downstream attitude reflecting phenotypic changes and alterations in pathophysiological states of biological systems. Metabolomics using mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques allows qualitative and quantitative profiling of small molecules present in biological systems. This approach can be applied to reveal metabolic differences between different types of thyroid cancer and to identify new potential candidates for molecular biomarkers. In this review. we consider current results concerning application of metabolomics in the field of thyroid cancer research. Recent studies show that metabolomics can provide significant information about the discrimination between different types of thyroid lesions. In the near future. one could expect a further progress in thyroid cancer metabolomics leading to development of molecular markers and improvement of the tumor types classification and diagnosis.,True,UZwqf_gAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,44,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ije/2015/258763/abs/,17438693451813515313,/scholar?cites=17438693451813515313,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ije/2015/258763/abs/,0,0,0

In this paper we performed molecular profiling of thyroid tissue aiming to identify metabolites characteristic for different types of thyroid cancer. FFPE tissue specimens were analysed from 5 different types of thyroid malignancies (follicular. papillary/classical variant. papillary/follicular variant. medullary and anaplastic cancers). benign follicular adenoma and normal thyroid.

However. existing algorithms do not allow for automated analyses of whole spectra. Therefore. despite highlighting potential advantages of mixture modeling of mass spectra of peptide/protein mixtures and some preliminary results presented in several papers. the mixture modeling approach was so far not developed to the stage enabling systematic comparisons with existing software packages for proteomic mass spectra analyses. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for Gaussian mixture modeling of proteomic mass spectra of different types (e.g.. MALDI-ToF profiling. MALDI-IMS). The main idea is automated partitioning of protein mass spectral signal into fragments. The obtained fragments are separately decomposed into Gaussian mixture models. The parameters of the mixture models of fragments are then aggregated to form the mixture model of the whole spectrum. We compare the elaborated algorithm to existing algorithms for peak detection and we demonstrate improvements of peak detection efficiency obtained by using Gaussian mixture modeling. We also show applications of the elaborated algorithm to real proteomic datasets of low and high resolution.,True,UZwqf_gAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,34,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134256,2996113257794521939,/scholar?cites=2996113257794521939,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134256,0,0,0

Though imaging of fresh‐frozen tissues is considered to give the best results. they are incompatible with clinical practice. since routine diagnostics is most frequently performed using formalin‐fixed tissues. and formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded material is a gold standard in histopathology. We aimed to assess utility of formalin‐fixed tissue specimen processed without paraffin embedding (i.e.. deep‐frozen and cryo‐sectioned) for MALDI imaging of both peptides and lipids. Peptide and lipid imaging was performed in fresh‐frozen. FFPE and formalin‐fixed/frozen samples of a mouse kidney. then composition of the resulting spectra was compared.

We have characterized one aspect of aneuploidy: the gain of extra chromosomes. We created a collection of haploid yeast strains that each bear an extra copy of one or more of almost all of the yeast chromosomes. Their characterization revealed that aneuploid strains share a number of phenotypes. including defects in cell cycle progression. increased glucose uptake. and increased sensitivity to conditions interfering with protein synthesis and protein folding. These phenotypes were observed only in strains carrying additional yeast genes. which indicates that they reflect the consequences of additional protein production as well as the resulting imbalances in cellular protein composition.

Yet. how cells regulate assembly and disassembly of PBs remains poorly understood. Here. we show that in budding yeast. mutations in the DEAD-box ATPase Dhh1 that prevent ATP hydrolysis. or that affect the interaction between Dhh1 and Not1. the central scaffold of the CCR4-NOT complex and an activator of the Dhh1 ATPase. prevent PB disassembly in vivo. Intriguingly. this process can be recapitulated in vitro. since recombinant Dhh1 and RNA. in the presence of ATP. phase-separate into liquid droplets that rapidly dissolve upon addition of Not1.

Whereas the control of mRNA synthesis through transcription has been well characterized. less is known about the regulation of mRNA turnover. and a consensus model explaining the wide variations in mRNA decay rates remains elusive. Here. we combine non-invasive transcriptome-wide mRNA production and stability measurements with selective and acute perturbations to demonstrate that mRNA degradation is tightly coupled to the regulation of translation. and that a competition between translation initiation and mRNA decay -but not codon optimality or elongation- is the major determinant of mRNA stability in yeast. Our refined measurements also reveal a remarkably dynamic transcriptome with an average mRNA half-life of only 4.8 min - much shorter than previously thought. Furthermore. global mRNA destabilization by inhibition of translation initiation induces a dose-dependent formation of processing bodies in which mRNAs can decay over time.,True,L47penwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,63,https://elifesciences.org/articles/32536,1635788520286721516,/scholar?cites=1635788520286721516,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/32536.pdf,0,0,0
1036820,The protein phosphatase 2A functions in the spindle position checkpoint by regulating the checkpoint kinase Kin4,2009,Leon Y Chan and Angelika Amon,23,Genes & development,14,1639-1649,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,In budding yeast. a surveillance mechanism known as the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) ensures accurate genome partitioning. In the event of spindle misposition. the checkpoint delays exit from mitosis by restraining the activity of the mitotic exit network (MEN). To date. the only component of the checkpoint to be identified is the protein kinase Kin4. Furthermore. how the kinase is regulated by spindle position is not known. Here. we identify the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in complex with the regulatory subunit Rts1 as a component of the SPOC. Loss of PP2A-Rts1 function abrogates the SPOC but not other mitotic checkpoints. We further show that the protein phosphatase functions upstream of Kin4. regulating the kinase's phosphorylation and localization during an unperturbed cell cycle and during SPOC activation. thus defining the phosphatase as a key regulator of SPOC function.,True,L47penwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,61,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/14/1639.short,1800630113877875903,/scholar?cites=1800630113877875903,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/14/1639.full.pdf,0,0,0

Candida albicans. causes half of all invasive fungal infections in humans. Unlike other fungal pathogens. this organism switches between growth as budding yeast and as pseudohyphal and hyphal filaments in host organs and in vitro.

The spindle position checkpoint is a prime example of this problem. This checkpoint senses spindle position and. in budding yeast. inhibits the mitotic exit network (MEN). a signaling pathway that promotes exit from mitosis. We find that spindle position is sensed by a system composed of MEN-inhibitory and -activating zones and a sensor that moves between them. The MEN inhibitory zone is located in the mother cell. the MEN-activating zone in the bud. and the spindle pole body (SPB). where the components of the MEN reside. functions as the sensor.

In budding yeast. a signaling system known as the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) monitors spindle position and regulates the activity of the mitotic exit network (MEN). a GTPase signaling pathway that promotes exit from mitosis. The protein kinase Kin4 is a central component of the spindle position checkpoint. Kin4 primarily localizes to the mother cell and associates with spindle pole bodies (SPBs) located in the mother cell to inhibit MEN signaling. In contrast. the kinase does not associate with the SPB in the bud.

However. the mechanisms underlying silencing and stability of heterochromatin are not fully understood.

Lacrimal nerve action potentials. lacrimal cell membrane potentials. and the outflow of fluid from an excretory duct of the lacrimal gland were recorded before. during. and after stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion. preganglionic trunk of the superior cervical ganglion. and the distal and proximal cut ends of the lacrimal nerve. The results indicate that the lacrimal nerve as it approaches the lacrimal gland contains secretomotor fibers. which originate in the sphenopalatine but not in the superior cervical ganglion.

One strain producing maximum protease was selected. In order to enhance the production of protease. the effects of major medium ingredients. such as carbon. nitrogen sources and metal ions. on the production of the enzyme were investigated. Among the carbon sources used. fructose showed the highest potential for the production. The best organic nitrogen source was skim milk. Inorganic nitrogen sources were not as effective as organic sources. Addition of combine metal ions minimized the enzyme production. Combinations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in medium were the best. Both ions were not effective alone. Increased production (51%) of the enyzme was obtained by manipulating the medium composition.

Some functions of melatonin are mediated by its membrane receptors but others are receptor‐independent. For the latter. melatonin must enter into the cell. Melatonin is a derivative of the amino acid tryptophan and reportedly easily crosses biological membranes due to its amphipathic nature. However. the mechanism by which melatonin enters into cells remains unknown. Changes in redox state. endocytosis pathways. multidrug resistance. glycoproteins or a variety of strategies have no effect on melatonin uptake.

1036909,Materialism: A Historico-Philosophical Introduction,2016,Charles T Wolfe,,,,,Springer,There are many ‘idealist’critiques of materialism. including as a natural philosophy. Early modern critiques often invoke a notion of ‘soul’or ‘life’as a feature which the materialist either eliminates. or at least cannot account for. Here I examine an early and powerful critique of materialism in Aristotle. which brings out both his subtlety with regard to the nature of biological entities and. perhaps. his desire to find a ‘third way’between the pure idealism of Platonic forms and the equally pure chance-and-necessity of the atomists. who he calls the phusiologoi.,True,7jQpkyYAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,43,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-24820-2.pdf,6954289080493247959,/scholar?cites=6954289080493247959,,http://196.189.45.87/bitstream/123456789/76318/1/94.pdf.pdf,0,0,0

From substantival to functional vitalism and beyond: animas. organisms and attitudes. Eidos [online]. 2011. n. 14. pp. 212-235. ISSN 1692-8857.I distinguish between'substantival'and'functional'forms of vitalism in the eighteenth century. Substantival vitalism presupposes the existence of a (substantive) vital force which either plays a causal role in the natural world as studied scientifically. or remains an immaterial. extra-causal entity. Functional vitalism tends to operate'post facto'. from the existence of living bodies to the search for explanatory models that will account for their uniquely'vital'properties better than fully mechanistic models can. I discuss representative figures of the Montpellier school (Bordeu. Ménuret. Fouquet) as functional rather than substantival vitalists. and suggest an additional point regarding the reprisal of vitalism (s) in the 20th century. from Driesch to Canguilhem: that in addition to the substantival and functional varieties. we encounter a third species of vitalism. which I term'attitudinal'. as it argues for vitalism as a kind of attitude.,True,7jQpkyYAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,37,http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1692-88572011000100009,4061745328668715520,/scholar?cites=4061745328668715520,,http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1692-88572011000100009,0,0,0

1036913,On the Role of Newtonian Analogies in Eighteenth-Century Life Science VITALISM AND PROVISIONALLY INEXPLICABLE EXPLICATIVE DEVICES,2014,Charles Wolfe,,,,,,"Newton's impact on Enlightenment natural philosophy has been studied at great length. in its experimental. methodological and ideological ramifications. One aspect that has received fairly little attention is the role Newtonian ""analogies"" played in the formulation of new conceptual schemes in physiology. medicine. and life science as a whole. So-called 'medical Newtonians' like Pitcairne and Keill have been studied; but they were engaged in a more literal project of directly transposing. or seeking to transpose. Newtonian laws into quantitative models of the body. I am interested here in something different: neither the metaphysical reading of Newton. nor direct empirical transpositions. but rather. a more heuristic. empiricist construction of Newtonian analogies. Figures such as Haller. Barthez. and Blumenbach constructed analogies between the method of celestial mechanics and the method of physiology. In celestial mechanics. they held. an unknown entity such as gravity is posited and used to mathematically link sets of determinate physical phenomena (e.g.. the phases of the moon and tides). This process allows one to remain agnostic about the ontological status of the unknown entity. as long as the two linked sets of phenomena are represented adequately. Haller et. al. held that the Newtonian physician and physiologist can similarly posit an unknown called 'life' and use it to link various other phenomena. from digestion to sensation and the functioning of the glands. These phenomena consequently appear as interconnected. goal-oriented processes which do not exist either in an inanimate mechanism or in a corpse.

FDAP measurements reveal that each cell in a developing embryo shows one of two distinct Oct4 kinetics. before there are any morphologically distinguishable differences or outward signs of lineage patterning. The differences revealed by FDAP are due to differences in the accessibility of Oct4 to its DNA binding sites in the nucleus.

Myosin II accumulates specifically around constricting cells. and its disruption dysregulates constriction and cell fate. Laser ablations of actomyosin networks reveal that constricting cells have higher cortical tension. generate tension anisotropies and morphological changes in adjacent regions of neighboring cells. and require their neighbors to coordinate their own changes in shape.

The addition of epidermal growth factor and insulin to serum-free medium (SFM) completely restores cell survival. In this report. we examine the role of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction. When cell attachment is prevented. PCD is markedly accelerated. This effect is observed in cells collected at low or high density and is unaffected by calcium depletion. Cells plated in SFM on purified laminin. tenascin C. or collagen IV-coated dishes. as well as on dishes coated with endogenous extracellular matrix deposited by HC11 mammary cells. show reduced PCD. The addition of soluble laminin or tenascin C to suspension cultures of MECs also partially inhibits PCD. In contrast. no effect is seen with fibronectin or collagen I. These results indicate that reduced contact with a solid substrate contributes to the induction of PCD. which might partially explain the fact that it is only observed in confluent cultures.

The sites covered a latitude interval between 27.88° and 42.74°. We have identified wild-type strains of N. discreta. N. tetrasperma. N. crassa. and N. sitophila and the frequency of each species varied from site to site. It has been shown that after exposure to light Neurospora accumulates the orange carotenoid neurosporaxanthin. presumably for protection from UV radiation. We have found that each Neurospora species accumulates a different amount of carotenoids after exposure to light. but these differences did not correlate with the expression of the carotenogenic genes al-1 or al-2. The accumulation of carotenoids in Neurospora shows a correlation with latitude. as Neurospora strains isolated from lower latitudes accumulate more carotenoids than strains isolated from higher latitudes. Since regions of low latitude receive high UV irradiation we propose that the increased carotenoid accumulation may protect Neurospora from high UV exposure. In support of this hypothesis. we have found that N. crassa. the species that accumulates more carotenoids. is more resistant to UV radiation than N. discreta or N. tetrasperma.

Such systems are ideal for the study of the evolution of life histories because the consequences of selective episodes can be more easily identified. Here I report an interesting and classic example of a species exhibiting true alternative strategies. Due to a chromosomal inversion. male and female white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) occur as two distinct morphs. tan or white. Tan and white morphs mate disassortatively. and this mating pattern maintains the polymorphism in relatively equal proportions within the population. In comparison with tan males. white males are more aggressive. frequently intrude into neighboring territories. spend less time guarding their mates. occasionally attempt polygyny. and provide less parental care.

Darwin argued that sexual selection could operate in monogamous systems if breeding sex ratios are biased or if some males attract highly fecund females. Alternatively. sexual selection might result from promiscuous copulations outside the pair bond. although several recent studies have cast doubt on this possibility. in particular by showing that variance in apparent male reproductive success (number of social young) differs little from variance in actual male reproductive success (number of young sired). Our results from a long‐term study of the socially monogamous splendid fairy‐wren (Malurus splendens) demonstrate that such comparisons are misleading and do not adequately assess the effects of extra‐pair paternity (EPP).

For example. auxiliaries may reduce the costs of seeking extrapair fertilizations for breeding males or females. and auxiliary males may themselves seek copulations with the breeding female in their own group. We employed microsatellite markers to examine patterns of parentage in the cooperatively breeding splendid fairy-wren (Malurus splendens melanotus). Our study population exhibited a relatively high level of extrapair paternity (42% of 386 offspring) with considerable annual variation (range = 24–52%).

Recent theory suggests that socially monogamous females may improve the genetic quality of their offspring by mating with extrapair males with whom they are more genetically dissimilar (relative to their social mates). because decreased genetic similarity between mates may lead to decreased inbreeding depression of offspring and other benefits. We found that levels of extrapair paternity in splendid fairy-wren. Malurus splendens. broods were predicted by genetic similarity between social mates.

We model the interaction between habitat matching and temporal variation in resource abundance. In one patch the rate of resource input follows a Markov chain; a second patch does not vary temporally. We predict patch use by scaling transition rates in the variable patch to the time that consumers require to respond to changes in rates of resource input.

Ltd,Although receptor‐mediated regulation of small G‐proteins and the cytoskeleton is intensively studied. the mechanisms for attenuation of these signals are poorly understood. In this study. we have identified the Rac‐GAP β2‐chimaerin as an effector of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via coupling to phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and generation of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). EGF redistributes β2‐chimaerin to promote its association with the small GTPase Rac1 at the plasma membrane. as determined by FRET. This relocalization and association with Rac1 were impaired by disruption of the β2‐chimaerin C1 domain as well as by PLCγ1 RNAi. thus defining β2‐chimaerin as a novel DAG effector. On the other hand. GAP‐deficient β2‐chimaerin mutants show enhanced translocation and sustained Rac1 association in the FRET assays. Remarkably.

Several mechanisms have been identified in AR activation. among them signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Disruption of STAT3 activity has been associated to cancer progression. Recent studies suggest that heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) may play a key role in PCa that may be independent of its catalytic function. We sought to explore whether HO-1 operates on AR transcriptional activity through the STAT3 axis. Our results display that HO-1 induction in PCa cells represses AR activation by decreasing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter activity and mRNA levels.

Many studies emphasized on the role of microglial cells. oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory cytokines (IC) in the development of diabetic neuropathy (DN). AIM: Present study was designed to evaluate the effect of kaempferol in attenuation of DN in mice. METHODS: Diabetes was induced in mice by i.p. injection of a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (200 mg/kg). Cold allodynia. thermal hyperalgesia and chemical hyperalgesia were assessed. as well as markers of inflammation and OS. RESULTS: Diabetic mice (DM) showed an increased pain sensation. IC and OS accompanied with reduced body weigh gain. Treatment of DM with kaempferol (25. 50 and 100 mg/kg/day/orally) attenuated the development of DN and reduced pain sensation. Moreover. it reduced interleukin-1β (IL-1β). tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). lipid peroxidation and nitrite. concomitant with the improvement of antioxidant defense and body weight gain. In contrast. kaempferol (100 mg/kg) had no effects on the behavioral and biochemical parameters. Our results strongly suggest that activated microglia. IC and OS are involved in the development of DN.

Several pathophysiological stimuli. such as pressure and volume overload. trigger the remodeling cascade. a process that initially confers protection to the heart as a compensatory mechanism. Yet chronic inflammation after myocardial infarction also leads to cardiac remodeling that. when prolonged. leads to heart failure progression.

It is the fundamental mechanism by which epithelial cells lose many of their characteristics while acquiring features typical of mesenchymal cells. such as migratory capacity and invasiveness. Depending on the contest. EMT is complemented and balanced by the reverse process. the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET).

These three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems. whose phenotype has been shown to be strongly dependent on TGF-β-regulated EMT/MET processes. present the advantage of recapitulating in vitro the hypoxic in vivo micro-environment of tissue stem cell niches and their formation. These spheroids. therefore. nicely reproduce the finely regulated Ying-Yang equilibrium. which. together with other mechanisms. can be determinant in cell fate decisions in many pathophysiological scenarios. such as differentiation. fibrosis. regeneration. and oncogenesis.

Autophagy also mediates similar effects; however. it is not currently known whether EGCG can regulate hepatic autophagy. Here. we show that EGCG increases hepatic autophagy by promoting the formation of autophagosomes. increasing lysosomal acidification. and stimulating autophagic flux in hepatic cells and in vivo. EGCG also increases phosphorylation of AMPK. one of the major regulators of autophagy. Importantly. siRNA knockdown of AMPK abrogated autophagy induced by EGCG. Interestingly. we observed lipid droplet within autophagosomes and autolysosomes and increased lipid clearance by EGCG. suggesting it promotes lipid metabolism by increasing autophagy. In mice fed with high-fat/western style diet (HFW; 60% energy as fat. reduced levels of calcium. vitamin D3. choline. folate. and fiber).

1037073,Current perspectives on the hormonal control of seed development in Arabidopsis and maize: a focus on auxin,2014,Antonella Locascio and Irma Roig-Villanova and Jamila Bernardi and Serena Varotto,5,Frontiers in Plant Science,,412,Frontiers,The seed represents the unit of reproduction of flowering plants. capable of developing into another plant. and to ensure the survival of the species under unfavorable environmental conditions. It is composed of three compartments: seed coat. endosperm and embryo. Proper seed development depends on the coordination of the processes that lead to seed compartments differentiation. development and maturation. The coordination of these processes is based on the constant transmission/perception of signals by the three compartments. Phytohormones constitute one of these signals. gradients of hormones are generated in the different seed compartments. and the ratios of which constitute the signals that induce/inhibit a particular process in seed development. Among the hormones. auxin seems to exert a pivotal role; since it is the unique hormone that maintains high level of accumulation from fertilization to seed maturation. The gradient of auxin generated by its PIN carriers. affects several processes of seed development. including pattern formation. cell division and expansion. Despite the high degree of conservation in the regulatory mechanisms that lead to seed development within the Spermatophytes. remarkable differences exists during seed maturation between Monocots and Eudicots species. For instance. in Monocots. the endosperm persists until maturation. and constitutes an important compartment for nutrients storage; while in Eudicots it is reduced to a single cell layer. as the expanding embryo gradually replaces it during the maturation.

Recently it has been shown that hormones such as auxin and cytokinins play important roles in ovule development and patterning. The establishment and regulation of auxin levels in cells is predominantly determined by the activity of the auxin efflux carrier proteins PIN-FORMED (PIN). To study the roles of PIN1 and PIN3 during ovule development we have used mutant alleles of both genes and also perturbed PIN1 and PIN3 expression using micro-RNAs controlled by the ovule specific DEFH9 (DEFIFICENS Homologue 9) promoter. PIN1 down-regulation and pin1-5 mutation severely affect female gametophyte development since embryo sacs arrest at the mono- and/or bi-nuclear stages (FG1 and FG3 stage). PIN3 function is not required for ovule development in wild-type or PIN1-silenced plants. We show that sporophytically expressed PIN1 is required for megagametogenesis. suggesting that sporophytic auxin flux might control the early stages of female gametophyte development. although auxin response is not visible in developing embryo sacs.,True,3tByLwcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,87,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066148,1232491444126709686,/scholar?cites=1232491444126709686,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066148,0,0,0

It is essential to understand the mechanisms that control ovule number and development as they ultimately determine the final number of seeds and. thereby. the yield in crop plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana. ovules arise laterally from a meristematic tissue within the carpel referred to as placenta. For a correct determination of the number of ovules. a precise establishment of the positions where ovule primordia emerge is needed. and a tight definition of the boundaries between ovules is therefore also required. In the last decades. few factors have been identified to be involved in the determination of ovule number.

Close vegetation proximity might result in competition for resources. such as light. To face this challenge. plants have evolved two alternative strategies: to either tolerate or avoid shade. Shade-avoiding species generally adapt their development by inducing hypocotyl. stem and petiole elongation. apical dominance and flowering. and decreasing leaf expansion and yield. a set of responses collectively known as the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). The SAS responses have been mostly studied at the seedling stage. centered on the increase of hypocotyl elongation. After compiling the main findings about SAS responses in seedlings. this review is focused on the response to shade at adult stages of development. such as petioles of adult leaves. and the little information available on the SAS responses in reproductive tissues.

Multiple piRNA biogenesis factors have been identified in Drosophila. The majority of piRNA factors are localized in the nuage. electron-dense non-membranous cytoplasmic structures located in the perinuclear regions of germ cells. Thus. piRNA biogenesis is thought to occur in the nuage in germ cells. Immunofluorescence analyses of ovaries from piRNA factor mutants have revealed a localization hierarchy of piRNA factors in female nuage. However. whether this hierarchy is female-specific or can also be applied in male gonads remains undetermined. Here. we show by immunostaining of both ovaries and testes from piRNA factor mutants that the molecular hierarchy of piRNA factors shows gender-specificity. especially for Krimper (Krimp). a Tudor-domain containing protein of unknown function(s): Krimp is dispensable for PIWI protein Aubergine (Aub) nuage localization in ovaries but Krimp and Aub require each other for their proper nuage localization in testes.

Gibbons are non-human primates that produce loud. distinctive and melodious vocalizations resembling more those of birds than of other non-human primates. Wild gibbons are characterized by flexibility in social organization (i.e.. pairs and multimale units) as well as in mating system (i.e.. monogamy and polyandry). Such features make them a suitable model to investigate whether the physiology (hormonal status) and socio-demographic features find their correspondence in the structure of their songs. By combining male solo song recordings. endocrine outputs using non-invasive fecal androgen measures and behavioral observations. we studied 14 groups (10 pair-living. 4 multimale) of wild white-handed gibbons (Hylobates lar) residing at Khao Yai National Park. Thailand. We collected a total of 322 fecal samples and recorded 48 songs from 18 adult animals. Our results confirmed inter-individuality in male gibbon songs. and showed a clear correlation between androgen levels and song structures. Gibbons with higher androgen levels produced calls having higher pitch. and similarly adult individuals produced longer calls than senior males. Thus. it is plausible that gibbon vocalizations provide receivers with information about singers' attributes.,True,ID85SBYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,41,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082748,13228507981132968511,/scholar?cites=13228507981132968511,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082748,0,0,0

Replicate interclonal combinations yield essentially identical rejection reactions. and differences in graft dosage had no effect on either the direction or intensity of allocytotoxicity. Alloreaction times are inversely proportional to the strength of the H barrier.

The tomato is a well-known model for studying fruit ripening and development. and the disassembly of primary cell walls and the middle lamella. such as through pectin de-methylesterified by pectin methylesterase (PE) and depolymerization by polygalacturonase (PG). is generally accepted to be one of the major changes that occur during ripening. Although many reports of the changes in pectin during tomato fruit ripening are focused on the relation to softening of the pericarp or the Blossom-end rot by calcium (Ca2+) deficiency disorder. the changes in pectin structure and localization in each tissues during tomato fruit ripening is not well known. In this study. to elucidate the tissue-specific role of pectin during fruit development and ripening. we examined gene expression. the enzymatic activities involved in pectin synthesis and depolymerisation in fruit using biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. and uronic acids and calcium (Ca)-bound pectin were determined by secondary ion-microprobe mass spectrometry. These results show that changes in pectin properties during fruit development and ripening have tissue-specific patterns. In particular. differential control of pectin methyl-esterification occurs in each tissue. Variations in the cell walls of the pericarp are quite different from that of locular tissues. The Ca-binding pectin and hairy pectin in skin cell layers are important for intercellular and tissue–tissue adhesion.

1037149,Effects of using arsenic-iron sludge in brick making,2003,Md Abdur Rouf,,,,,Department of Civil Engineering,Arsenic-iron treatment plants generate huge amount of sludge. The aeeumulation of these materials is not only burden to the treatment plant but also affects the environment adversely. Therefore. development of new teehnologies to reeycle and convert waste into reusable materials is critically important for protection of environment and sustainable development of society. There is a strong demand for environmentally safe reuse and effective disposal methods of iron and arsenic contaminated sludgc out of water treatment plant duc to thc increasing amount of sludge generated by the water treatment plants in Bangladesh. A possible long-term solution appears to be recycling of the sludge and using it for beneficial purposes. Thc study work has been performed to study and analyse the effects of using arsenic-iron sludge in making of bricks. Leaching of arsenic li'om brick manufactured out of arscnic-iron sludge was investigated with a view to assessing its environment quality. TCLI' tcst of sludge indicated that leaching of arsenic from sludge is more than that of burnt bricks. Increasing the firing temperature resulted in decrease in leaching of arscnic. Howcver. leachate concentrations of bricks manufactured at varying temperature indicate it to be independent of temperature and mix proportion. As leachate from arsenic laden sludge out of Column Leaching method reflects values higher than 5 mg/L; as such indicates it to be toxic waste. The results of compressive strength tests on the bricks indicate that the strength is greatly dependent on the amount of sludge in the brick and the firing temperature.

1037167,How succulent leaves of Aizoaceae avoid mesophyll conductance limitations of photosynthesis and survive drought,2013,Brad S Ripley and Trevor Abraham and Cornelia Klak and Michael D Cramer,64,Journal of experimental botany,18,5485-5496,Oxford University Press,In several taxa. increasing leaf succulence has been associated with decreasing mesophyll conductance (gM) and an increasing dependence on Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). However. in succulent Aizoaceae. the photosynthetic tissues are adjacent to the leaf surfaces with an internal achlorophyllous hydrenchyma. It was hypothesized that this arrangement increases gM. obviating a strong dependence on CAM. while the hydrenchyma stores water and nutrients. both of which would only be sporadically available in highly episodic environments. These predictions were tested with species from the Aizoaceae with a 5-fold variation in leaf succulence. It was shown that gM values. derived from the response of photosynthesis to intercellular CO2 concentration (A:Ci). were independent of succulence. and that foliar photosynthate δ13C values were typical of C3. but not CAM photosynthesis.

However. several years ago attention turned to a third mechanism of radiation. termed the"" bystander effect"" or"" radiation-induced bystander effect""(RIBE). This is induced by agents and signals emitted by directly irradiated cells and manifests as a lowering of survival. cytogenetic damage. apoptosis enhancement. and biochemical changes in neighboring non-irradiated cells. The bystander effect is mainly observed in in vitro experiments using very low doses of alpha particles (range; mGy. cGy). but also after conventional irradiation (X-rays. gamma rays) at low as well as conventional doses. The mechanisms responsible for the bystander effect are complex and still poorly understood. It is believed that molecular signals released from irradiated cells induce different signaling ways in non-irradiated neighboring cells. leading to the observed events. The molecular signals may be transmitted through gap junction intercellular communication and through a medium transfer mechanism. The nature of these transmitted factors are diverse. and still not definitely established.

These drugs are proposed to attenuate tumor growth solely through inhibition of Hedgehog (HH). which is produced in tumor cells but acts on tumor stromal cells. The pivotal argument underlying this model is that the growth-inhibitory properties of SMO antagonists on HH-producing cancer cells are due to their off-target effects. Here. we show that the tumorigenic properties of such lung cancer cells depend on their intrinsic level of HH activity. Notably. reducing HH signaling in these tumor cells decreases HH target gene expression. Taken together. these results question the dogma that autocrine HH signaling plays no role in HH-dependent cancers. and does so without using SMO antagonists.

We report a hybrid system formed by simultaneous covalent and supramolecular polymerizations of monomers. The process yields cylindrical fibers of uniform diameter that contain covalent and supramolecular compartments. a morphology not observed when the two polymers are formed independently. The covalent polymer has a rigid aromatic imine backbone with helicoidal conformation. and its alkylated peptide side chains are structurally identical to the monomer molecules of supramolecular polymers. In the hybrid system. covalent chains grow to higher average molar mass relative to chains formed via the same polymerization in the absence of a supramolecular compartment. The supramolecular compartments can be reversibly removed …,True,28k5ExIAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,111,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/497.abstract,10567691827933643490,/scholar?cites=10567691827933643490,,,0,0,0

MS-VTST uses a multi-faceted dividing surface and provides a convenient way to include the contributions of many structures (typically conformers) of the reactant and the transition state in rate constant calculations. In this particular application. we also account for the torsional anharmonicity. We used the multi-configuration Shepard interpolation method to efficiently generate a semi-global portion of the potential energy surface from a small number of high-level electronic structure calculations using the M06 density functional in order to compute the energies and Hessians of Shepard points along a reaction path.

Cyclic voltammetric (CV) and amperometric experiments showed that. relative to other reported electrodes. the enzyme‐immobilized electrodes possess fast electron‐transfer rates (2.2 s−1). a broad linear range (15–540 μmol L−1). a low detection limit (3.2 nmol L−1). a remarkably long lifetime (5 months). and high stability in the pH range 5–10.

It is found that the free energy. enthalpy. and entropy differences for this assembly process are −67 kcal/mol. −71.5 kcal/ml. and −14.5 cal/(mol K). respectively. and therefore that enthalpy provides the driving force for self-assembly to form a fiber. A pairwise interaction analysis shows that both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions play important roles in the self-assembly process. with the van der Waals interaction being the larger effect. The mechanistic picture that emerges from this work is that as the PA is pulled from the fiber. the interaction evolves through three stages: (1) initially electrostatic interactions between the charged head of the pulled PA and other …,True,28k5ExIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,58,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp401508w,10215919021584106187,/scholar?cites=10215919021584106187,,,0,0,0

To determine the relationship between the dietary zinc level and zinc concentration in common carp. the fish were fed diets containing 17. 294. 1.007 and 1.974 ppm zinc for 8 weeks. and the zinc concentration in each tissue was measured. It was found that the group of fish fed 17 ppm zinc had the highest growth rate. When the dietary concentration of zinc was lower than 294 ppm. the zinc concentrations in the tissues were similar during the 8 weeks of experiment. The zinc accumulated in the fish when the dietary zinc concentration was higher than 1.007 ppm.

The two phases differ extensively in behavior. morphology and physiology but very little is known about the molecular basis of these differences. We used our recently generated Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database derived from S. gregaria central nervous system (CNS) to design oligonucleotide microarrays and compare the expression of thousands of genes in the CNS of long-term gregarious and solitarious adult desert locusts. This identified 214 differentially expressed genes. of which 40% have been annotated to date. These include genes encoding proteins that are associated with CNS development and modeling. sensory perception. stress response and resistance. and fundamental cellular processes. Our microarray analysis has identified genes whose altered expression may enable locusts of either phase to deal with the different challenges they face. Genes for heat shock proteins and proteins which confer protection from infection were upregulated in gregarious locusts. which may allow them to respond to acute physiological challenges. By contrast the longer-lived solitarious locusts appear to be more strongly protected from the slowly accumulating effects of ageing by an upregulation of genes related to anti-oxidant systems. detoxification and anabolic renewal.

The ring includes 15 membrane-embedded c subunits forming an hourglass-shaped assembly. The structure demonstrates that proton translocation across the membrane entails protonation of a conserved glutamate located near the membrane center in the c subunit outer helix. The proton is locked in this site by a precise hydrogen bond network reminiscent of that in Na+-dependent ATP synthases. However. the structure suggests that the different coordination chemistry of the bound proton and the smaller curvature of the outer helix drastically enhance the selectivity of the H+ site against other cations. including H 3 O+.

NaCl caused a decrease in photosystem II (PSII) mediated oxygen evolution activity and increase in photosystem I (PSI) activity and the amount of P700. Similarly maximal efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) and variable fluorescence (Fv/Fo) were also declined in salt-stressed cells. Western blot analysis reveal that the inhibition in PSII activity is due to a 40% loss of a thylakoid membrane protein. known as D1. which is located in PSII reaction center. NaCl treatment of cells also resulted in the alterations of other thylakoid membrane proteins: most prominently. a dramatic diminishment of the 47-kDa chlorophyll protein (CP) and 94-kDa protein. and accumulation of a 17-kDa protein band were observed in SDS-PAGE. The changes in 47-kDa and 94-kDa proteins lead to the decreased energy transfer from light harvesting antenna to PSII. which was accompanied by alterations in the chlorophyll fluorescence emission spectra of whole cells and isolated thylakoids. Therefore we conclude that salt stress has various effects on photosynthetic electron transport activities due to the marked alterations in the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins.,True,Npa05IwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,129,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO200510103462262.page,1872090986056408291,/scholar?cites=1872090986056408291,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO200510103462262.pdf,0,0,0

A role for niche separation,2004,Michael D Thom and Lauren A Harrington and David W Macdonald,105,Oikos,3,525-535,Munksgaard International Publishers,American mink are highly sexually dimorphic. with males being up to twice the size of females. Sexual dimorphism may arise for several reasons. including intra‐ or inter‐sexual selection. inter‐sexual competition. or divergent reproductive roles. Whether or not dimorphism arises from competition. a degree of niche separation is expected in dimorphic species. Sexual divergence in feeding niche has been reported for many species. including mink. This is likely to be manifested in a greater degree of dimorphism in those structures. such as teeth. that are used for the acquisition of prey.

The highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) influences scents and contributes to the recognition of close kin and avoidance of inbreeding when MHC haplotypes are shared. MHC diversity between individuals has also been proposed as a primary source of scents used in individual recognition. We tested this in the context of scent owner recognition among male mice. which scent mark their territories and countermark scents from other males. We examined responses towards urine scent according to the scent owner's genetic difference to the territory owner (MHC. genetic background. both and neither) or genetic match to a familiar neighbour.

The range of taxa exhibiting various forms of diapause indicates its enormous ecological significance and highlights its value as a model for examining life‐history trait evolution. However. despite the impact of diapause on species ecology. there is little understanding of its adaptive value in many groups. Furthermore. the relative roles of phylogeny and ecology in determining the contemporary expression of the trait remain unresolved. Delayed implantation (DI) is a type of diapause found in several orders of mammals. It is particularly prevalent in the Mustelidae. with mustelids making up more than half of all mammals known to exhibit DI.

Although functionally enigmatic. diversity in baculum form is hypothesised to result from sexual selection. According to this hypothesis. the baculum should influence the outcome of reproductive competition among males within promiscuous mating systems.

After controlling for body size and other reproductive traits. the width (but not length) of the house mouse baculum predicts both the mean number of offspring sired per litter and total number of offspring sired.

Clostridium. and Escherichia coli to pig intestinal mucus obtained from different intestinal regions. In combination. probiotic strains enhanced each other’s adhesion. mainly in large intestinal mucus. Treatment of intestinal mucus with Bb12 and LGG. alone or in combination. significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the adhesion of the tested pathogens. The ability to inhibit pathogen adhesion appears to depend on the specific probiotics and pathogens and on the mucosal site.

To date. the only therapy for CD is the complete exclusion of dietary sources of grains and any food containing gluten. It has been hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota is somehow involved in CD. For this reason. probiotics are appearing as an interesting adjuvant in the dietetic management of CD. This review aims to discuss the characteristics of the microbiota in CD subjects and the use of probiotics as a novel therapy for CD. Comparisons between children with CD and controls show that their microbiota profiles differ; the former have fewer lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.

It examines the possibility that variability in adrenal gland responsiveness may be attributable to neural or hormonal modulation of adrenal blood flow. Changes in the rate of blood flow through the adrenal cortex would be expected to play an important role in the regulation of steroid hormone release. It would affect both the delivery of the major stimulant (ACTH) and the removal of the end product from the steroidogenic cells (the glucocorticoids). In the past. interest in this area has concentrated on the regulation of arterial blood flow. rather than the regulation of venous drainage.

Live internalized cells are either degraded by lysosomal enzymes or released. We term this cell internalization process entosis and present evidence for entosis as a mechanism underlying the commonly observed “cell-in-cell” cytological feature in human cancers.

Here we describe a non-genetic mechanism of cytokinesis failure that occurs as a direct result of cell-in-cell formation by entosis. Live cells internalized by entosis. which can persist through the cell cycle of host cells. disrupt formation of the contractile ring during host cell division.

The process is not completed until much later. however. when the final cytoplasmic bridge connecting the two daughter cells is severed.

A surprisingly broad range of additional cellular processes are also important for cytokinesis. including protein and membrane trafficking. lipid metabolism. protein synthesis and signaling pathways.

SP) and cytokines. SP mediates neuromodulation partly through the stimulation of bone marrow (BM) progenitors. This study shows that SP. through the neurokinin-1 receptor. stimulates the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors: cobblestone-forming cells (CAFC. CD34+). This effect is optimal when macrophage is included within the fibroblast support. Indirect induction of IL-1 could be important in the proliferation of CAFC colonies by SP.

Recent phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the ectomycorrhiza forming genera Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus cluster within Serpula. In this study we use DNA sequence data to investigate phylogenetic relationships. historical biogeography of. and nutritional mode transitions in Serpulaceae. Our results corroborate that the two ectomycorrhiza-forming genera. Austropaxillus and Gymnopaxillus. form a monophyletic group nested within the saprotrophic genus Serpula. and that the Serpula species S. lacrymans and S. himantioides constitute the sister group to the Austropaxillus-Gymnopaxillus clade. We found that both vicariance (Beringian) and long distance dispersal events are needed to explain the phylogeny and current distributions of taxa within Serpulaceae. Our results also show that the transition from brown rot to mycorrhiza has happened only once in a monophyletic Serpulaceae. probably between 50 and 22 million years before present.

Even without spatial or temporal constraints mutualistic pairwise interactions may vary. or rewire. across space but this variability is not well understood. Here. we quantify the beta diversity of species and interactions and test factors influencing the probability of turnover of pairwise interactions across space. We ask: 1) whether beta diversity of plants. pollinators. and interactions follow a similar trend across space. and 2) which interaction properties and site characteristics are related to the probability of turnover of pairwise interactions. Geographical distance was positively correlated with plant and interaction beta diversity. We find that locally frequent interactions are more consistent across space and that local flower abundance is important for the realization of pairwise interactions. While the identity of pairwise interactions is highly variable across space. some species-pairs form interactions that are locally frequent and spatially consistent.

In such networks. modularity is the division of species into compartments. or modules. where species within modules share more interactions with each other than they do with species from other modules. Such a modular structure is common in mutualistic networks and several evolutionary and ecological mechanisms have been proposed as underlying drivers. One prominent explanation is the existence of pollination syndromes where flowers tend to attract certain pollinators as determined by a set of traits.

In plants an RNAi-like mechanism defends against viruses. but the hypothesis that animals possess a similar natural antiviral mechanism related to RNAi remains relatively untested. To test whether genes needed for RNAi defend animal cells against virus infection. we infected wild-type and RNAi-defective cells of the nematode C. elegans with vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to encode a GFP fusion protein.

In budding yeast. secretory vesicles are transported by the myosin-V Myo2p to sites of cell growth. We show that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is present in late secretory compartments and is critical for their association with. and transport by. Myo2p. Further. the trans-Golgi network Rab Ypt31/32p and secretory vesicle Rab Sec4p each bind directly. but distinctly. to Myo2p. and these interactions are also required for secretory compartment transport. Enhancing the interaction of Myo2p with PI4P bypasses the requirement for interaction with Ypt31/32p and Sec4p. Together with additional genetic data. the results indicate that Rab proteins and PI4P collaborate in the association of secretory compartments with Myo2p.

Insights from studies in budding yeast.,1994,Anthony Bretscher and Beth Drees and Edina Harsay and Daniel Schott and Tongtong Wang,126,,4,821-825,,WENTY-FIVE years ago. F-actin was discovered to be the major component of microfilaments in animal cells (36). Since then. actin has been found in virtually all eukaryotic cells. What functions do microfilaments perform? Studies in animal cells have provided us with a picture of F-actin as the backbone of many structurally and functionally diverse assemblies coexisting within any given cell. Microfilaments are important for cell shape determination. cell motility. and various contractile activities. as well as for participating in aspects of transmembrane signaling. endocytosis. and perhaps secretion. Since some actin-binding proteins are regulated by changes in free Ca:+. phospholipids. and by phosphorylation (75). and microfilament organizations can be modulated by small G-proteins (69. 70). microfilaments seem to be under exquisite control.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Morphometrics of the molar crown is based traditionally on diameter measurements but is nowadays more often based on 2D image analysis of crown outlines. An alternative approach involves measurements at the level of the cervical line. We compare the information content of the two options in a three‐dimensional (3D) digital sample of lower and upper first molars (M1 and M1) of modern human and Neanderthal teeth. The cervical outline for each tooth was created by digitizing the cervical line and then sectioning the tooth with a best fit plane. The crown outline was projected onto this same plane.

Targeting pathological tau proteins via immunotherapy is a promising strategy for disease-modifying treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Previously. we reported a 24-week phase 1 trial on the active vaccine AADvac1 against pathological tau protein; here. we present the results of a further 72 weeks of follow-up on those patients. We did a phase 1. 72-week. open-label study of AADvac1 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease who had completed the preceding phase 1 study. Patients who were previously treated with six doses of AADvac1 at monthly intervals received two booster doses at 24-week intervals. Patients who were previously treated with only three doses received another three doses at monthly intervals. and subsequently two boosters at 24-week intervals. The primary objective was the assessment of long-term safety of AADvac1 treatment. Secondary objectives included assessment of antibody titres. antibody isotype profile. capacity of the antibodies to bind to AD tau and AADvac1. development of titres of AADvac1-induced antibodies over time. and effect of booster doses; cognitive assessment via 11-item Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive assessment (ADAS-Cog).

Dordrecht,Among the introduced species of fishes. the pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus (Linnaeus) is one of the most successful. During the last century. the pumpkinseed became established in most European countries. not merely by introductions but also by natural spreading into adjacent water bodies. and in many cases they attained high population densities in the receiving waters. Impacts on local ichthyofauna were first reported in Portugal and Spain. where pumpkinseed spread invasively (e.g. Zapata and Granado-Lorencio 1993. Godinho et al. 1997a. Godinho et al. 1998.

To understand the problems associated with these invasions better. we examined the external morphology of 184 round goby Neogobius melanostomus specimens using both triple regression (distance‐based measurements) and geometrical (coordinates‐based measurements) analysis within an ontogenetical and epigenetical aspect. Using geometrical analysis of distance‐based characters. we found that the external body shape in four size groups of round goby remained essentially unchanged. Such direct development represents a strongly precocial (i.e. specialized) life‐history. whereas earlier maturation in this non‐native population suggests a shift back towards more altricial (i.e. less specialized. more generalized) life history.

A 6-week diet of 0.15% 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) was fed to wild-type (+/+PTU) and homozygous-truncated cMyBP-C (t/tPTU) mice starting at age ≈8 weeks and leading to a myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform profile of 10% α-MHC and 90% β-MHC in both groups. Western blot analysis confirmed that cMyBP-C was present in the +/+PTU and effectively absent in the t/tPTU. Total LV mechanical energy per beat was quantified as pressure-volume area (PVA).

We employed novel and conventional chemical ecology approaches to identify potential attractants. which were demonstrated in field tests to be effective for monitoring populations of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus in human dwellings. Immunohistochemistry studies showed that an odorant-binding protein from this species. CquiOBP1. is expressed in trichoid sensilla on the antennae. including short. sharp-tipped trichoid sensilla type. which house an olfactory receptor neuron sensitive to a previously identified mosquito oviposition pheromone (MOP). 6-acetoxy-5-hexadecanolide. CquiOBP1 exists in monomeric and dimeric forms. Monomeric CquiOBP1 bound MOP in a pH-dependent manner. with a change in secondary structure apparently related to the loss of binding at low pH. The pheromone antipode showed higher affinity than the natural stereoisomer.

Both. particularly H. armigera. are extremely polyphagous. and H. armigera has developed resistance to many insecticides. Here we use comparative genomics. transcriptomics and resequencing to elucidate the genetic basis for their properties as pests. We find that. prior to their divergence about 1.5 Mya. the H. armigera/H. zea lineage had accumulated up to more than 100 more members of specific detoxification and digestion gene families and more than 100 extra gustatory receptor genes. compared to other lepidopterans with narrower host ranges. The two genomes remain very similar in gene content and order. but H. armigera is more polymorphic overall. and H. zea has lost several detoxification genes. as well as about 50 gustatory receptor genes. It also lacks certain genes and alleles conferring insecticide resistance found in H. armigera. Non-synonymous sites in the expanded gene families above are rapidly diverging. both between paralogues and between orthologues in the two species. Whole genome transcriptomic analyses of H. armigera larvae show widely divergent responses to different host plants. including responses among many of the duplicated detoxification and digestion genes.

Aedes aegypti. is the primary vector for the viruses that cause yellow fever. mostly in tropical regions of Africa and in parts of South America. and human dengue. which infects 100 million people yearly in the tropics and subtropics. A better understanding of the structural biology of olfactory proteins may pave the way for the development of environmentally-friendly mosquito attractants and repellents. which may ultimately contribute to reduction of mosquito biting and disease transmission.  Methodology Previously. we isolated and cloned a major. female-enriched odorant-binding protein (OBP) from the yellow fever mosquito. AaegOBP1. which was later inadvertently renamed AaegOBP39. We prepared recombinant samples of AaegOBP1 by using an expression system that allows proper formation of disulfide bridges and generates functional OBPs. which are indistinguishable from native OBPs. We crystallized AaegOBP1 and determined its three-dimensional structure at 1.85 Å resolution by molecular replacement based on the structure of the malaria mosquito OBP. AgamOBP1. the only mosquito OBP structure known to date.  Conclusion The structure of AaegOBP1 ( = AaegOBP39) shares the common fold of insect OBPs with six α-helices knitted by three disulfide bonds. A long molecule of polyethylene glycol (PEG) was built into the electron-density maps identified in a long tunnel formed by a crystallographic dimer of AaegOBP1.

The cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera is one of the most destructive pest species that can feed on over 200 different plant species. This diversity of host plants is likely linked to a complex chemosensory system. Here we built on previous work to characterize crucial chemosensory tissues linked to environmental interactions including larval antennae. larval mouthparts and larval fat bodies. as well as male and female adult heads. male and female adult tarsi. and female abdomens. Using transcriptome sequencing. Trinity RNA-seq assemblies and extensive manual curation. we identified a total of 91 candidate chemosensory receptors (60 candidate ORs. 10 GRs and 21 IRs). Thirty-five of these candidates present full-length transcripts. First. we performed in silico differential expression analysis on different sequenced tissues. Further. we created extensive expression profiles using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR on a variety of adult and larval stages.

This review discusses the integrity. biodistribution. and fate of NPs after in vivo administration. The hybrid nature of the NPs is described. conceptually divided into the inorganic core. the engineered surface coating comprising of the ligand shell and optionally also bio-conjugates. and the corona of adsorbed biological molecules. Empirical evidence shows that all of these three compounds may degrade individually in vivo and can drastically modify the life cycle and biodistribution of the whole heterostructure.

The sensor is made by layer‐by‐layer assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes around ion‐sensitive fluorophores. in this case for protons. The sensor is spontaneously incorporated by cells and resides over days in the lysosome. Intracellular changes of the concentration of protons upon cellular stimulation with pH‐active agents are monitored by read‐out of the sensor fluorescence at real time. With help of this sensor concept it is demonstrated that the different agents used (Monensin. Chloroquine. Bafilomycin A1. Amiloride) possessed different kinetics and mechanisms of action in affecting the intracellular pH values.,True,H_ZyZcgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,105,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smll.201101780,5143588307555131296,/scholar?cites=5143588307555131296,,,0,0,0

The method is one-pot. scalable. and produces nanoclusters that are stable in aqueous solution for at least 9 months at room temperature under ambient conditions. with very little degradation to their unique UV-Vis optical absorption spectrum. The composition. size. and monodispersity were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation. The produced nanoclusters are likely to be in a superatom charge-state of m = 4−. due to the fact that their optical absorption spectrum shares most of the unique features of the intense and broadly absorbing nanoparticles identified as [Ag44(SR)30]4− by Harkness et al.

In this study. we developed a high-throughput gene knockout system using a novel yeast-Escherichia-Agrobacterium shuttle vector. pKO1B. in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Using this method. we deleted 104 fungal-specific Zn2Cys6 transcription factor (TF) genes in M. oryzae. We then analyzed the phenotypes of these mutants with regard to growth. asexual and infection-related development. pathogenesis. and 9 abiotic stresses. The resulting data provide new insights into how this rice pathogen of global significance regulates important traits in the infection cycle through Zn2Cys6TF genes. A large variation in biological functions of Zn2Cys6TF genes was observed under the conditions tested. Sixty-one of 104 Zn2Cys6 TF genes were found to be required for fungal development. In-depth analysis of TF genes revealed that TF genes involved in pathogenicity frequently tend to function in multiple development stages. and disclosed many highly conserved but unidentified functional TF genes of importance in the fungal kingdom. We further found that the virulence-required TF genes GPF1 and CNF2 have similar regulation mechanisms in the gene expression involved in pathogenicity. These experimental validations clearly demonstrated the value of a high-throughput gene knockout system in understanding the biological functions of genes on a genome scale in fungi. and provided a solid foundation for elucidating the gene expression network that regulates the development and …,True,LUgjWBAAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,75,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004432,4575479149738316726,/scholar?cites=4575479149738316726,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004432,0,0,0

However. δ-catenin is upregulated in human prostatic adenocarcinomas. although the effects of δ-catenin overexpression in prostate cancer are unclear. We hypothesized that δ-catenin plays a direct role in prostate cancer progression by altering gene profiles of cell cycle regulation and cell survival. We employed gene transfection and small interfering RNA to demonstrate that increased δ-catenin expression promoted. whereas its knockdown suppressed prostate cancer cell viability. δ-Catenin promoted prostate cancer cell colony formation in soft agar as well as tumor xenograft growth in nude mice. Deletion of either the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal sequences outside the armadillo domains abolished the tumor promoting effects of δ-catenin. Quantitative RT2 Profiler™ PCR Arrays demonstrated gene alterations involved in cell cycle and survival regulation. δ-Catenin overexpression upregulated cyclin D1 and cdc34. increased phosphorylated histone-H3. and promoted the entry of mitosis. In addition. δ-catenin overexpression resulted in increased expression of cell survival genes Bcl-2 and survivin while reducing the cell cycle inhibitor p21Cip1. Taken together. our studies suggest that at least one consequence of an increased expression of δ-catenin in human prostate cancer is the alteration of cell cycle and survival gene profiles. thereby promoting tumor progression.,True,LUgjWBAAAAAJ:_axFR9aDTf0C,67,https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-4598-8-19,4412697260451903981,/scholar?cites=4412697260451903981,,https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-4598-8-19,0,0,0

Here we describe an experimental approach for analyzing mast cell functions in vivo by comparing the biological responses in wild-type mice. genetically mast cell-deficient mice. and ‘mast cell knock-in mice’ (mast cell-deficient mice selectively repaired of their mast cell deficiency). Studies using ‘mast cell knock-in mice’ have indicated that mast cells can contribute importantly to IgE-associated late phase reactions and to chronic allergic inflammation. Moreover. ‘mast cell knock-in mice’ containing adoptive-transferred mast cell populations with defined alterations in the expression of specific mast cell products can be used to characterize the mechanisms by which mast cells contribute to the …,True,dp--VzAAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,67,https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/87644,12120642035083589215,/scholar?cites=12120642035083589215,,,0,0,0

This is the first evidence demonstrating that TSC is capable of limiting hemorrhagic injury to neurons in the brain.

1037523,Microbial Modulation of Host Locomotion,2019,Catherine Elizabeth Schretter,,,,,,Coordinated locomotor behavior is critical for the survival and propagation of an individual and is modulated by internal and external sensory inputs. The microbiota regulates host metabolism. which is closely intertwined with motor behavior. However. little is known regarding influences by the gut microbiome on host locomotion. or the pathways involved. The work presented in this thesis examines microbial regulation of locomotor behavior from both bacterial and host perspectives. Removal of the microbiota results in hyperactivity in female D. melanogaster. which is reversible through colonization with specific bacteria or administration of bacterial-derived products. including xylose isomerase (Xi) from Lactobacillus brevis. We found that Xi modulates host speed via sugar metabolism and octopamine signaling in flies. Additionally. aspects of microbial regulation of host locomotion appear to be conserved in mice. This work suggests that microbial modulation of host physiology extends beyond local intestinal effects to locomotor behavior through alterations in energy-related pathways.,True,sfoWjQkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/11154/,,,,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/11154/1/Catherine%20Schretter%20Thesis_8%2022.pdf,0,0,0

In most cases. however. the information does not exist or is highly unreliable. In this paper. published studies on flowering abundance. fruit and seed production were used to estimate and review fertility variation in 99 stands and 36 seed orchards.

Both measures express how parents differ in fertility; the former focuses on the variance of fertility among individuals while the later focuses on probabilistic aspects. As expected. fertility varied considerably within and among populations. Only ∼15 per cent in both stands and seed orchards indicated small variations in fertility.

This previously undescribed conformational transition is considered to play a major role in the “overturning” phenomena and “island” formation observed in these L−B films. ,True,cNyN1pEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,42,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la9701743,7521096488580404174,/scholar?cites=7521096488580404174,,,0,0,0

Here we expand this class of techniques by demonstrating the mechanical uncaging of a reactive species within a single protein. We proved this novel technique by capturing the regiospecific reaction between a thiol and a vicinal disulfide bond. We designed a protein that includes a caged cysteine and a buried disulfide. The mechanical unfolding of this protein in the presence of an external nucleophile frees the single reactive cysteine residue. which now can cleave the target disulfide via a nucleophilic attack on either one of its two sulfur atoms.

By applying a calibrated force to a substrate disulfide. the chemical mechanisms of Trx catalysis can be examined in detail at the single-molecule level. Here we use single-molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to explore the chemical evolution of Trx catalysis by probing the chemistry of eight different Trx enzymes. All Trxs show a characteristic Michaelis-Menten mechanism that is detected when the disulfide bond is stretched at low forces. but at high forces. two different chemical behaviors distinguish bacterial-origin from eukaryotic-origin Trxs. Eukaryotic-origin Trxs reduce disulfide bonds through a single-electron transfer reaction (SET). whereas bacterial-origin Trxs show both nucleophilic substitution (S N 2) and SET reactions.

Recently. single-molecule force spectroscopy by atomic force microscopy has been used as a new tool to study the catalytic properties of an enzyme. In this approach. a mechanical force ranging up to hundreds of piconewtons is applied to the substrate of an enzymatic reaction. altering the conformational energy of the substrate-enzyme interactions during catalysis. From these measurements. the force dependence of an enzymatic reaction can be determined. The force dependence provides valuable new information about the dynamics of enzyme catalysis with sub-angstrom resolution. a feat unmatched by any other current technique.

Although Aβ has been extensively studied as the pathological plaque-forming protein species in Alzheimer's disease (AD). little is known about the normal physiological function (s) and signaling pathway (s). We previously discovered that physiologically-relevant. low picomolar amounts of Aβ can enhance synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent cognition in mice.

The concept of co-evolution implicates that compensatory mutations occur to preserve the structure and function of proteins. We have combined statistical analysis of protein sequences with the sensitivity of single molecule force-clamp spectroscopy to probe how catalysis is affected by structurally distant correlated mutations in Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Our findings show that evolutionary anti-correlated mutations have an inhibitory effect on enzyme catalysis. whereas positively correlated mutations rescue the catalytic activity. We interpret these results in terms of an evolutionary tuning of both the enzyme-substrate binding process and the chemistry of the active site.

It has been shown that. calcium (Ca2+) is an important determinant for plant salt tolerance and confers protective effects on plants under growing in sodic soils. Calcium plays an essential role in processes that preserve the structural and functional integrity of plant cell membranes. stabilizes cell wall structures. regulates ion transport and selectivity. and controls ion-exchange behavior as well as cell wall enzyme activities. The nature of these responses will vary depending on the plant genotype. One of the essential functions of Ca2+ is acting as a second messenger in stress signaling.

I do this by investigating various aspects. including partitioning frames and explanatory accounts. of the theoretical perspectives that fall under and are guided by compositional biology.

I glean data for this analysis from canonical textbooks and defend the use of such texts for the philosophy of science.

We compare concepts of genetic independence in the two theoretical traditions of evolutionary genetics. population genetics and quantitative genetics. and show how independence of gene action (represented by the multiplicative model of population genetics) can be different from the absence of gene interaction (represented by the linear additive model of quantitative genetics). The two formulations converge with weak selection but not with strong selection or. for multiple loci. when the aggregated interaction terms are not negligible.

The theory and measure of genetic variation. and the very concept of “race”,2013,Jonathan Michael Kaplan and Rasmus Grønfeldt Winther,7,Biological theory,4,401-412,Springer Netherlands,It is illegitimate to read any ontology about “race” off of biological theory or data. Indeed. the technical meaning of “genetic variation” is fluid. and there is no single theoretical agreed-upon criterion for defining and distinguishing populations given a particular set of genetic variation data. By analyzing three formal senses of “genetic variation.” viz.. diversity. differentiation. and heterozygosity. we argue that the use of biological theory for making claims about race inevitably amounts to a pernicious reification. Biological theory does not force the concept of “race” upon us; our social discourse. social ontology. and social expectations do.

However. its role in memory formation in the amygdala. a site critical for the formation of fear memories. currently remains unknown. Here we provide the first evidence that protein degradation through the UPS is critically engaged at amygdala synapses during memory formation and retrieval. Fear conditioning results in NMDA-dependent increases in degradation-specific polyubiquitination in the amygdala. targeting proteins involved in translational control and synaptic structure and blocking the degradation of these proteins significantly impairs long-term memory. Furthermore. retrieval of fear memory results in a second wave of NMDA-dependent polyubiquitination that targets proteins involved in translational silencing and synaptic structure and is critical for memory updating following recall.

PKMζ is a constitutively active. atypical isoform of protein kinase C that is believed to maintain long term potentiation at hippocampal synapses in vitro. In behaving animals. local inhibition of PKMζ disrupts spatial memory in the hippocampus and conditioned taste aversion memory in the insular cortex. The role of PKMζ in context fear memory is less clear. This study examined the role of PKMζ in amygdala and hippocampal neurons following a standard fear conditioning protocol. The results indicate that PKMζ inhibition in the amygdala. but not in the hippocampus. can disrupt fear memory.

Consistent with this. numerous studies have reported that CaMKII. PKA and protein synthesis are critical for long-term memory formation. Recently. we found that protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system is also critical for long-term memory formation in the amygdala. However. the mechanism by which ubiquitin-proteasome activity is regulated during memory formation and how protein degradation interacts with known intracellular signaling pathways important for learning remain unknown. Recently. evidence has emerged suggesting that both CaMKII and PKA are capable of regulating proteasome activity in vitro through the phosphorylation of proteasome regulatory subunit Rpt6 at Serine-120. though whether they regulate Rpt6 phosphorylation and proteasome function in vivo remains unknown. In the present study we demonstrate for the first time that fear conditioning transiently modifies a proteasome regulatory subunit and proteasome catalytic activity in the mammalian brain in a CaMKII-dependent manner. We found increases in the phosphorylation of proteasome ATPase subunit Rpt6 at Serine-120 and an enhancement in proteasome activity in the amygdala following fear conditioning. Pharmacological manipulation of CaMKII. but not PKA. in vivo significantly reduced both the learning-induced increase in Rpt6 Serine-120 phosphorylation and the increase in proteasome activity without directly affecting protein polyubiquitination levels.

However. purified ovatoxins are not widely available and their toxicities are still unknown. The aim of this study was to improve understanding of the ecophysiology of Ostreopsis cf. ovata and its toxin production as well as to optimize the purification process for ovatoxin. During Ostreopsis blooms in 2011 and 2012 in Villefranche-sur-Mer (France. NW Mediterranean Sea). microalgae epiphytic cells and marine organisms were collected and analyzed both by LC-MS/MS and hemolysis assay. Results obtained with these two methods were comparable. suggesting ovatoxins have hemolytic properties. An average of 223 μg· kg− 1 of palytoxin equivalent of whole flesh was found. thus exceeding the threshold of 30 μg· kg− 1 in shellfish recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Ostreopsis cells showed the same toxin profile both in situ and in laboratory culture. with ovatoxin-a (OVTX-a) being the most abundant analogue (~ 50%). followed by OVTX-b (~ 15%). p-PLTX (12%). OVTX-d (8%). OVTX-c (5%) and OVTX-e (4%). Ostreopsis cf. ovata produced up to 2 g of biomass per L of culture. with a maximum concentration of 300 pg PLTX equivalent cell− 1. Thus. an approximate amount of 10 mg of PLTX-group toxins may be produced with 10 L of this strain.

It was reported to be produced by cyanobacteria. but also found in edible aquatic organisms. thus raising concern of a widespread human exposure. However. the chemical analysis of BMAA and its isomers are controversial. mainly due to the lack of selectivity of the analytical methods. Using factorial design. we have optimized the chromatographic separation of underivatized analogues by a hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) method. A combination of an effective solid phase extraction (SPE) clean-up. appropriate chromatographic resolution and the use of specific mass spectral transitions allowed for the development of a highly selective and sensitive analytical procedure to identify and quantify BMAA and its isomers (in both free and total form) in cyanobacteria and mollusk matrices (LOQ of 0.225 and 0.15 µg/g dry weight. respectively). Ten species of cyanobacteria (six are reported to be BMAA producers) were screened with this method. and neither free nor bound BMAA could be found. while both free and bound DAB were present in almost all samples.

1037654,Shorebirds in the marine environment,2002,Nils Warnock and Chris Elphick and Margaret A Rubega,,"Biology of Marine Birds (EA Schreiber and J. Burger, Eds.). CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida",,581-615,,The purpose of this chapter is to review the ecology of shorebirds in the context of their relationship to the marine environment. The shorebirds are a group of families usually placed in the order Charadriiformes along with gulls. skuas. terns. skimmers. and auks (eg. del Hoyo et al. 1996. American Ornithologists’ Union 1998). An alternative view. based on studies of DNA-DNA hybridization. is to treat this entire group as a suborder within the order Ciconiiformes (Sibley and Monroe 1990). The shorebirds are traditionally thought of as a monophyletic group. although this may not be the case and the relationships among the families within the order remain uncertain (American Ornithologists’ Union 1998). Depending on taxonomic source. shorebirds are variously divided into about a dozen families. Three of these are of particular significance to this discussion: the Scolopacidae (sandpipers. snipes. and phalaropes) and Charadriidae (plovers) which include 71% of all shorebird species. and the Haematopodidae (oystercatchers). with 11 species found largely in marine environments (Table 18.1). Even though their name conveys an affinity to water. shorebirds are not traditionally considered marine birds (Burger 1984a).

The purpose of front-end feeding systems is to acquire food to be delivered to the back-end for chemical digestion and assimilation. In accomplishing this. the feeding system faces as many as five separate mechanical tasks recognized as “feeding stages:” capture/subjugation. ingestion. transport. processing. and swallowing. In general. aquatic species exploit the high density of water to manipulate food items by modulating water flow through the mouth and pharynx. In contrast. terrestrial vertebrates typically employ some form of hyolingual feeding in which movements of the tongue and hyobranchial apparatus take the place of water flow in capturing. supporting and manipulating food. The condition of the bolus. when swallowed. varies markedly among taxa. Most ectotherms process their food little. if at all. whereas mammals and birds typically reduce their food to small particles (in mammals. by oral mastication; in birds. within the “gastric mill” of the gizzard).

1037663,Rich and Poor Cities in Europe. An Urban Scaling Approach to Mapping the European Economic Transition,2016,Emanuele Strano and Vishal Sood,11,PLOS ONE,8,e0159465,PLOS,Recent advances in the urban science make broad use of the notion of scaling. We focus here on the important scaling relationship between the gross metropolitan product (GMP) of a city and its population (pop). It has been demonstrated that GMP ∝ Y Ypopβ with β always greater than 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule that holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of cities. However. in an increasingly connected world. the hypothesis that the economy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using data for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010. we found a double GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities. β = 1 over the whole the period. while for post-communist cities β > 1 and increases from ∼1.2 to ∼1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the convergence of post-communist European cities to open and liberal economies. We propose a simple model of economic convergence in which. under stable political conditions. a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results suggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic growth rather than a steady. universal urban feature. The results also suggest that relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic context and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities. urbanization and urban economics.,True,barUe8gAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,28,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159465,7687999883012961183,/scholar?cites=7687999883012961183,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159465,0,0,0

We directly measure the cycle lengths of attractors and the sizes of basins of attraction in RBNs using exact enumeration of the state space. In general. the distribution of attractor lengths differs markedly from that obtained by randomly choosing an initial state and following the dynamics to reach an attractor. Our results indicate that the former distribution decays as a power law with exponent 1 for all connectivities K> 1 in the infinite system size limit. In contrast. the latter distribution decays as a power law only for K= 2. This is because the mean basin size grows linearly with the attractor cycle length for K> 2. and is statistically independent of the cycle length for K= 2.

By measuring the uncertainties of movements using entropy. considering both the frequencies and temporal correlations of individual trajectories. we find that the theoretical maximum predictability is as high as 88%. To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached. we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87% for stationary trajectories and 95% for non-stationary trajectories.

On the basis of measles dynamics for industrialized countries. high birth rate regions should experience regular annual epidemics.

Models demonstrate that this variability arises from powerful seasonality in transmission—generating high amplitude epidemics—within the chaotic domain of deterministic dynamics.

This expansion has. however. not been matched by advancements in the development of spatial datasets of human population distribution that accompany disease maps or spatial models. Where risks are heterogeneous across population groups or space or dependent on transmission between individuals. spatial data on human population distributions and demographic structures are required to estimate infectious disease risks. burdens. and dynamics.

We found considerable regional variation in both magnitude of transmission and amplitude of seasonal variation in transmission. Several lines of evidence pointed to stochastic dynamics as an important driver of multi-annual cycles.

The gravity model for directly transmitted diseases is currently one of the most parsimonious models for spatial epidemic spread. This model uses distance-weighted. population size-dependent coupling to estimate host movement and disease incidence in metapopulations. The model captures overall measles dynamics in terms of underlying human movement in pre-vaccination England and Wales (previously established). In spatial models. edges often present a special challenge. Therefore. to test the model's robustness. we analyzed gravity model incidence predictions for coastal cities in England and Wales. Results show that. although predictions are accurate for inland towns. they significantly underestimate coastal persistence. We examine incidence. outbreak seasonality. and public transportation records. to show that the model's inaccuracies stem from an underestimation of total contacts per individual along the coast. We rescue this predicted ‘edge effect’ by increasing coastal contacts to approximate the number of per capita inland contacts.

Schistosomiasis is a global health burden with over 200 million people infected. and the disease results in about 300000 deaths annually. It is estimated that approximately 800 million are at risk of infection in Africa. South America. and Asia [1. 2]. Schistosomiasis occurs throughout the developing world and remains a major public health problem in the poorest communities with enormous consequences for development [2. 3]. Schistosoma mansoni is one of three major species of schistosomes that cause significant disease in humans [1]. Despite schistosomiasis being one of the most tenacious neglected tropical diseases. treatment and disease control are based on the use of a single drug. praziquantel. an isoquinoline-parazine derivative [4. 5]. Praziquantel is effective against all species of schistosomes infecting humans and has been used for the last decades. It is well tolerated. easily administered in tablet form. and inexpensive [6. 7]. However. despite this success. the prospect of relying on a single drug to treat millions of people is of concern; in addition. the potential for drug resistance. particularly in areas of high transmission. must be considered and raises concerns about future control of the disease [7. 8]. Given this situation. it is imperative to develop new effective drugs for treatment and prevention of the infection.

However. it is not clear yet how NMDARs regulate ERK activity. Stimulation of the NMDARs induces a complex modification of ERK that includes both ERK activation and inactivation and depends on particular experimental conditions. Here we show that there exists a differential restriction in the regulation of ERK activity that depends on the pool of NMDAR that was activated. The synaptic pool of NMDARs activates ERK whereas the extrasynaptic pool does not; on the contrary. it triggers a signalling pathway that results in the inactivation of ERK.

The destiny of neurons in damaged brain depends on tiny equilibrium between pro‐survival and pro‐death signalling.

However. it remained unclear whether the change of the KCC2 function protects neurons or contributes to neuronal death.

Like all organophosphates. ClPH affects the nervous system by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In addition. it is transformed in higher animals into ClPF-oxon that is about 3000 times more potent against the nervous system than ClPF itself. As was found recently. the action on ACh is not the only mechanism of ClPF toxicity. One other mechanism of this organophosphate is induction of oxidative stress leading to generation of free radicals. We investigated the effects of ClPF on hippocampal cells of the rat in vitro and focused our attention on mediation of its cytotoxic effect related to the production of reactive oxygen species.

Dreissena polymorpha. into North American waters has resulted in profound ecological disturbances and large monetary losses. This study examined the invasion history and patterns of genetic diversity among endemic and invading populations of zebra mussels using DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. Patterns of haplotype frequency indicate that all invasive populations of zebra mussels from North America and Europe originated from the Ponto‐Caspian Sea region. The distribution of haplotypes was consistent with invasive populations arising from the Black Sea drainage. but could not exclude the possibility of an origin from the Caspian Sea drainage.

Transcription of genes is regulated by DNA elements called enhancers. which are bound by transcription factors and coactivators. leading to the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the production of RNA. Enhancers are thought to loop to specific gene promoters to stimulate transcription. but the mechanisms that cause enhancers to selectively loop to specific gene promoters is not well understood. In this thesis. I first describe new insights into enhancer-promoter loop specificity from studies examining the mechanisms that allow tumor-specific super-enhancers to loop to the MYC oncogene in diverse cancer types (Schuijers and Manteiga et al.. 2018).

This paper discusses how the occurrence of learning changes our understanding of the host selection behaviour of this polyphagous moth. Host preferences determined from previous laboratory studies may be vastly different from preferences exhibited by moths in the field. where the abundance of particular hosts may be more likely to determine host preference. In support of this prediction. a number of field studies have shown that the ‘attractiveness’ of different hosts for H. armigera oviposition may depend on the relative abundance of these host species. Insect learning may play a fundamental role in the design and application of present and future integrated pest management strategies such as the use of host volatiles. trap crops and resistant crop varieties for monitoring and controlling this important pest species.,True,YbpRK8sAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,148,https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/482,14411422886801409361,/scholar?cites=14411422886801409361,,https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/482/CunninghamZaluckiWest99.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Whereas the majority of nonpest heliothinae specialize on a single plant family. genus. or species. pest species are highly polyphagous. with populations often escalating in size as they move from one crop species to another. Here. we examine the current literature on heliothine host-selection behavior with the aim of providing a knowledge base for research scientists and pest managers. We review the host relations of pest heliothines. with a particular focus on Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). the most economically damaging of all heliothine species.

Current hypotheses propose that learning may be advantageous in adult host selection behaviour through improved recognition. accuracy or selectivity in foraging. In this paper. we present a hypothesis for when learning can be advantageous without such improvements in adult host foraging. Specifically. that learning can be an advantageous strategy for egg laying females when larvae must feed on more than one plant in order to complete development. if the fitness of larvae is reduced when they switch to a different host species.

Learning may enable insects to obtain nectar from flowers more efficiently. Learning in nectar foraging has been shown primarily in studies of bees and butterflies. Here. learning is demonstrated in the nectar foraging behaviour of a noctuid moth. Helicoverpa armigera.2. The present studies show that: (1) previous experience with a flowering host species increases the probability of that species being selected for nectar foraging. and (2) previous experience of a particular flower type (food source at bottom or top of the corolla tube) increases the likelihood of the food source being found when that flower type is being searched.3.

Ubiquitinated EphA8 also bound to the SAM domains of Odin. a member of the Anks family proteins. More importantly. the overexpression of wild-type Odin protected EphA8 and EphA2 from undergoing degradation following ligand stimulation and promoted …,True,42a2Bb4AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,38,https://mcb.asm.org/content/30/7/1582.short,10233751896232293441,/scholar?cites=10233751896232293441,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/30/7/1582.full.pdf,0,0,0
