The increasing demand for catalysts in oxidation reactions under mild conditions has provided the necessary impulse for research into new efficient systems based on metalloporphyrin catalysts that mimick natural enzymatic systems [2]. For example. for the degradation of aromatic compounds from water [3. 4]. a greater attention is given to the study of TiO2–based photocatalysts. One of the important goals for studying these types of catalysts is the obtaining of photocatalysts with enhanced activity compared to TiO2. A growing interest is given to studying new hybrid materials that can be obtained by impregnating TiO2 with various dyes. Dye-impregnated TiO2 can also have other applications. like in photography or solar energy conversion [5-12]. In this study. the impregnation of some metalloporphyrins. which are heteroatomic macrocyclic compounds. on TiO2. and the photocatalytic action in the oxidation of 4-nitrophenol of the newly formed hybrid materials were studied.

The premature aging phenomena observed in the case of insulating materials has been explained by induction of manufacturing defects such as air pockets. or the inclusion of certain impurities. Chemical aging is in fact chemical degradation. which is caused by formation of free radicals. which leads to bond breaking or unzipping of the polymer structure. The process can be initiated by thermal or mechanical means. by oxidizing reactions. by hydrolysis. or by UV or ionizing radiation. Polluted environments may cause a direct attack upon a polymer. This has been studied in the context of atmospheric pollution and strong industrial acids/alkalis. but studies applicable to PVC have been limited. For many plastics used in electrical insulation. metals accelerate oxidative pyrolysis. Metallic contaminant inclusions can cause “extreme oxidative degradation”. and such metallic contaminants can act to produce initiation sites for electrical treeing.

1205760,Enrichment of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes with indigo-fluorene-based copolymers and their use in printed thin-film transistors and carbon dioxide gas sensors,2020,Chang Guo and Jianying Ouyang and Homin Shin and Jianfu Ding and Zhao Li and François Lapointe and Jacques Lefebvre and Arnold J Kell and Patrick RL Malenfant,5,ACS sensors,7,2136-2145,American Chemical Society,High-purity semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (sc-SWCNTs) are promising for portable and high-sensitivity gas sensors because of their excellent physical and electrical properties. Here. we describe the synthesis of a novel indigo-fluorene-based copolymer (PFIDBoc) that has been designed to selectively enrich sc-SWCNTs with excellent purity (>99.9%) yet contain a latent function in the form of a tert-butoxy (t-BOC)-protected amine that can be later revealed and exploited for carbon dioxide (CO2) gas sensing. SWCNTs wrapped with the PFIDBoc polymer can be easily converted via an on-chip thermal process to reveal a vinylogous amide moiety with a secondary amine nitrogen within the indigo building block of the copolymer which is perfectly suited for CO2 recognition. Thin-film transistors and sensors were inkjet-printed onto rigid and flexible substrates. demonstrating the versatility of enriched …,True,zyZoFeYAAAAJ:EYYDruWGBe4C,4,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssensors.0c00764,3775879035739860036,/scholar?cites=3775879035739860036,,,0,0,0
1205761,Carbon nanotube transistors as gas sensors: Response differentiation using polymer gate dielectrics,2019,François Lapointe and Jianfu Ding and Jacques Lefebvre,,ACS Applied Polymer Materials,,,American Chemical Society,The high sensitivity of carbon nanotube devices as gas sensors is generally attributed to the large surface area of the material. whereas selectivity is often imparted by the “lock-and-key” mechanism. In contrast with this picture. where little function is conferred to the underlying substrate. we demonstrate that bottom gate carbon nanotube network field-effect transistors (CNN-FETs) fabricated on a variety of polymer dielectrics. but with the same pristine carbon nanotubes. show differentiated responses to analytes. Interaction with the environment thus occurs not only directly with carbon nanotubes but is often mediated by the substrate. In a broad survey of polymers. we identify several materials suitable as the gate dielectric of printed devices and that yield a vanishing gate hysteresis in ambient air. The other two classes of polymers that induce a lagging or advancing hysteresis in CNN-FETs are found desirable for gas …,True,zyZoFeYAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C,4,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsapm.9b00707,9874311470260578778,/scholar?cites=9874311470260578778,,,0,0,0

Through a survey of polymer dielectric encapsulants compatible with printing processes. a simple correlation is found between the measured interfacial charge density and the onset of conduction in a transistor. providing a rational route to control the electrical characteristics of carbon nanotube transistors. Smooth and continuous balancing of the properties between unipolar p-type and n-type transport is achieved using a molar fraction series of poly(styrene-co-2-vinylpyridine) statistical copolymers combined with an electron-donating molecule. We further demonstrate the easy fabrication of a p–n diode which shows a modest rectification of 8:1.,True,zyZoFeYAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC,4,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.9b09857,3894453861141062147,/scholar?cites=3894453861141062147,,,0,0,0

A wide range of models have been tested. The favoured model consists of an ordered c(2×2) CuPt underlayer below a Cu terminated surface. Models involving a mixed ordered CuPt layer outermost may be definitively ruled out. The average T-matrix approximation (ATA) has been applied allowing variable Pt concentrations to be introduced into both the outermost layer and deeper into the selvedge (layers 3 and 4) in the form of a random substitutionally disordered CuxPt1−x alloy. The favoured concentration profile corresponds to an almost pure outermost Cu monolayer (ΘPt=10±10 at.%) with Pt concentrations of 20±20 and 30±30 at.% in layers 3 and 4 respectively.

The favoured model from the wide range tested consists of a double layer ordered c (2× 2) CuPd alloy with p (2× 2)-p2gg symmetry introduced into the outermost layer via clock rotation of the CuPd monolayer with the corners of the p (2× 2) unit cell centred over second layer Pd atoms (R p= 0.21). Lateral shifts of the top layer Cu and Pd atoms are determined to be 0.25±0.12 Å.

CaCO3 deposition and fouling resistance with greater accuracy. Through the MED stages. the HCO3− and CO2 concentrations slightly increased while the CO32− concentration slightly decreased. The pH decreased from 8.8 in the first stage to 8.4 in the 5th stage. The CO2 release rates as well as the CaCO3 deposition rates increase with increasing top brine temperature (TBT). CO2 release rates decrease from 36.4 g/t feed water in the first stage to 32.5 g/t in the last stage.

Manganese perovskite oxides. with the general formula A1-xBxMO3±δ (where A= Nd or In. and B= Sr) exhibit interesting magnetic and electric properties. such as a transition from insulator antiferromagnetic to metallic ferromagnetic behaviour. including colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and charge ordering phenomena [1-3]. The magnetic and electrical properties have been explained within the framework of Zener double exchange theory [4]. which considers the transfer of electrons between neighbouring Mn3+–Mn4+ ions through Mn–O–Mn bonds. A strong magnetic field aligns the atomic magnetic moments. which enhances eg electron hopping and reduces resistivity. The strong electron-phonon interactions due to the Jahn-Teller effect of the Mn3+ ions are greatly involved in the metallic-insulator transitions in manganites [5]. Magnetic superlattice can give new and essential way to control these spin ordered states directly. The superexchange interaction. which describes interaction between localized spin moments. is essential for magnetism in transition metal oxides [6].

Additional considerations in cloning large pieces of high G+C DNA in yeast may be related to toxic genes. to the size of the DNA. or to the absence of yeast origins of replication within the sequence. As an example of our ability to clone high G+C DNA in yeast. we chose to work with Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. which has an average G+C content of 55%.

For example. the entire 1 Mb Mycoplasma mycoides chromosome can be stably maintained and manipulated in yeast before being transplanted back into recipient cells. We have previously demonstrated that cloning in yeast of large (> ~ 150 kb). high G + C (55%) prokaryotic DNA fragments was improved by addition of yeast replication origins every ~100 kb. Conversely. low G + C DNA is stable (up to at least 1.8 Mb) without adding supplemental yeast origins. It has not been previously tested whether addition of yeast replication origins similarly improves the yeast-based cloning of large (> 150 kb) eukaryotic DNA with moderate G + C content. The model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum has an average G + C content of 48% and a 27.4 Mb genome sequence that has been assembled into chromosome-sized scaffolds making it an ideal test case for assembly and maintenance of eukaryotic chromosomes in yeast.

This is often achieved by recoding a stop codon and requires two additional components: an evolved aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (AARS) and a cognate tRNA. Analysis of the most successful AARSs reveals common characteristics. The highest fidelity NAA systems derived from the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii tyrosyl AARS feature specific mutations to two residues reported to interact with the hydroxyl group of the substrate tyrosine.

Using the hydrogenase from Alteromonas macleodii “deep ecotype” as a model. we substituted one of four amino acids (Asp. His. Asn. Gln) at each of the 12 ligating positions because these amino acids are alternative coordinating residues in otherwise conserved-cysteine positions found in a broad survey of NiFe hydrogenase sequences. We also hoped to discover an enzyme with elevated hydrogen evolution activity relative to a previously reported “G1” (H230C/P285C) improved enzyme in which the medial FeS cluster Pro and the distal FeS cluster His were each substituted for Cys. Among all the substitutions screened. aspartic acid substitutions were generally well-tolerated. and examination suggests that the observed deficiency in enzyme activity may be largely due to misprocessing of the small subunit of the enzyme. Alignment of hydrogenase sequences from sequence databases revealed many rare substitutions; the five substitutions present in databases that we tested all exhibited measurable hydrogen evolution activity. Select substitutions were purified and tested. supporting the results of the screening assay. Analysis of these results confirms the importance of small subunit processing. Normalizing activity to quantity of mature small subunit. indicative of total enzyme maturation. weakly suggests an improvement over the “G1” enzyme.

We build on previous research improving the Alteromonas macleodii “Deep Ecotype”[NiFe] hydrogenase. and report progress towards creating an artificial electron transfer pathway to supply the hydrogenase with electrons necessary for hydrogen production. Ferredoxin is the first soluble electron transfer mediator to receive high-energy electrons from photosystem I. and bears an electron with sufficient potential to efficiently reduce protons. Thus. we engineered a hydrogenase-ferredoxin fusion that also contained several other modifications. In addition to the C-terminal ferredoxin fusion. we truncated the C-terminus of the hydrogenase small subunit. identified as the available terminus closer to the electron transfer region. We also neutralized an anionic patch surrounding the interface Fe-S cluster to improve transfer kinetics with the negatively charged ferredoxin. Initial screening showed the enzyme tolerated both truncation and charge neutralization on the small subunit ferredoxin-binding face. While the enzyme activity was relatively unchanged using the substrate methyl viologen. we observed a marked improvement from both the ferredoxin fusion and surface modification using only dithionite as an electron donor. Combining ferredoxin fusion and surface charge modification showed progressively improved activity in an in vitro assay with purified enzyme.

The optical band gap showed a positive linear relationship with the two-thirds power of carrier density ne2/3. The work function ranged from 4.56 to 4.73 eV and showed a negative linear relationship with ne2/3.

In the present study. the effect of water stress applied alone and in combination with wounding stress on the activation of primary (shikimic acid) and secondary (phenylpropanoid) metabolic pathways related with the accumulation of phenolic compound in plants was evaluated. Carrot (Daucus carota) was used as model system for this study. and the effect of abiotic stresses was evaluated at the gene expression level and on the accumulation of metabolites. As control of the study. whole carrots were stored under the same conditions.

1205998,UVA. UVB light doses and harvesting time differentially tailor glucosinolate and phenolic profiles in broccoli sprouts,2017,Melissa Moreira-Rodríguez and Vimal Nair and Jorge Benavides and Luis Cisneros-Zevallos and Daniel A Jacobo-Velázquez,22,Molecules,7,1065,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Broccoli sprouts contain health-promoting glucosinolate and phenolic compounds that can be enhanced by applying ultraviolet light (UV). Here. the effect of UVA or UVB radiation on glucosinolate and phenolic profiles was assessed in broccoli sprouts. Sprouts were exposed for 120 min to low intensity and high intensity UVA (UVA L. UVA H) or UVB (UVB L. UVB H) with UV intensity values of 3.16. 4.05. 2.28 and 3.34 W/m 2. respectively. Harvest occurred 2 or 24 h post-treatment; and methanol/water or ethanol/water (70%. v/v) extracts were prepared. Seven glucosinolates and 22 phenolics were identified. Ethanol extracts showed higher levels of certain glucosinolates such as glucoraphanin. whereas methanol extracts showed slight higher levels of phenolics. The highest glucosinolate accumulation occurred 24 h after UVB H treatment. increasing 4-methoxy-glucobrassicin. glucobrassicin and glucoraphanin by~ 170. 78 and 73%. respectively. Furthermore. UVA L radiation and harvest 2 h afterwards accumulated gallic acid hexoside I (~ 14%). 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (~ 42%). gallic acid derivative (~ 48%) and 1-sinapoyl-2. 2-diferulolyl-gentiobiose (~ 61%). Increases in sinapoyl malate (~ 12%). gallotannic acid (~ 48%) and 5-sinapoyl-quinic acid (~ 121%) were observed with UVB H Results indicate that UV-irradiated broccoli sprouts could be exploited as a functional food for fresh consumption or as a source of bioactive phytochemicals with potential industrial applications.

1205999,Effect of exogenous amylolytic enzymes on the accumulation of chlorogenic acid isomers in wounded potato tubers,2014,Ana Mariel Torres-Contreras and Vimal Nair and Luis Cisneros-Zevallos and Daniel A Jacobo-Velázquez,62,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,31,7671-7675,American Chemical Society,Potato tubers under wounding stress synthesize chlorogenic acid isomers. which are phenolic compounds that prevent chronic diseases. The biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in plants requires aromatic amino acids that are produced from sugars. Therefore. in this study. we hypothesized that the wound-induced accumulation of chlorogenic acid isomers in potatoes could be enhanced if the availability of sugars is increased by exogenous amylolytic enzymes applied to the surface of the site of wounding. To test this hypothesis. wounded potatoes stored at 20 °C were treated with amylolytic enzymes (pullulanase and amyloglucosidase. 282 units/mL. 10 mL/kg) after being stored for 0 (E0h). 48 (E48h). or 96 h (E96h).

Violacein was the first microbial bisindole alkaloid [2]. and subsequent investigation of microbial organisms for anticancer natural products led to the discovery of staurosporine [3]. a kinase inhibitor [4]. and. later. rebeccamycin [5. 6] and analogs. of which some are potent topoisomerase I inhibitors [7]. More recently. terrequinone A. structurally related to the cytotoxic. antiviral. and antidiabetic asterriquinones [8]. was isolated from a fungus dwelling in the rhizosphere of an Arizona desert plant [9]. A more recently characterized class of tryptophan-derived alkaloids consists of trisindoles. The first reported trisindoles were the (±)-gelliusines isolated from the Caledonian sponge. Orina sp.[10]. These molecules showed a strong affinity for somatostatin and neuropeptide Y receptors and anti-serotonin activity in receptor binding assays.

1206057,Catalisadores de Pd/Al2O3 modificados com La: preparação. caracterização e propriedades catalíticas nas reações de reforma a vapor e autotérmica do metano,2010,Wellington H. Cassinelli,,,Biblioteca Digital de Teses e Dissertações da Univ,,,The Pd catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method of the supports using an aqueous solution of palladium nitrate. (x)La2O3-Al2O3 carriers. with x = 0 to 20 wt %. were obtained by wet impregnation and sol gel methods. The supports and catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption. X-ray diffraction. thermogravimetry. temperature-programmed reduction. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy of the adsorbed CO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. transmission electron microscopy and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane reaction. The La2O3 presence on the carriers promotes a decrease in the Eaap and an increase in the TOFap and CH4 consumption values at 510 °C in the steam reforming of CH4 reaction. This increase in activity was related to Pdº*Pd+-OLa interfacial species type formation. These interfacial species promote the formation of Pd° sites of higher electron density. most activ e to C-H bond cleavage. and are also likely to be oxidized by H2O and CO2 co-reagents. promoting the O * transfer to the metal surface. which act on the oxidation of chemisorbed carbon (C *). This fact makes that the determining steps process to be more balanced. promoting a greater of CH4 accessibility to the Pd surface. The nature of the supports has a high influence on the properties of Pd catalysts in autothermal reforming of CH4 reaction (ATR). The Pd/Al catalysts showed a high deactivation in the ATR. due to strong agglomeration of Pd crystallites during the time the catalyst was maintained at 800 °C.

Catalysts containing 5-20 wt.% of copper were obtained by wetness impregnation of two alumina:(1) commercial product (Al-Com. S BET: 264 m 2/g. pore volume: 0.9 cm 3/g);(2) hierarchical porous alumina obtained by sol-gel method (Al-SG. S BET: 577 m 2/g. pore volume: 4.3 cm 3/g). Structural characterizations (TEM and XRD) provided evidence that Cu clusters are highly dispersed on hierarchical alumina. Irrespective of the metal loading no change in the local order around Cu. as determined by Cu K-edge XAS experiments (8979 eV). was observed. This order could be described as monomeric Cu species in a diluted state. associated with an incomplete layer of Cu 2+ octahedrons on the porous alumina surface. A two-step reduction process was observed for xCu/Al-SG samples. The high dispersion of Cu altered the temperature of reduction and the amount of intermediate Cu+ species formed during the reduction treatment from RT to 250 deg C.

1206060,Copper catalysts supported on porous ZrO2 for ethanol dehydrogenation reaction,,JV Schiavon and WH Cassinelli and MAA Rosa and L Martins,,,,,,Copper is a well-known catalyst for ethanol dehydrogenation with a high selectivity and relative low cost in comparison with others metals. However. the application of Cu catalysts is fated to deactivation through of sintering of the mass metallic copper. due the low melting point. This results in a loss of active sites due to the decrease of metal superficial area. The zirconium oxide has been described as support that prevents the sintering of metallic phase in reaction conditions by optimization of the interaction between support and metal clusters [1]. In this work. the ZrO2 was obtained through solgel method by addiction of the surfactants [Pluronic 127 and Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)] to create ceramic supports with different porosities and thus. variable dispersion of copper. After that. Cu catalysts. containing 10 wt.%. were obtained by wetness impregnation using Cu (NO3) 2 solution. The supports used are ZrO2 with 10 wt.% of Pluronic (Cu/Zr-1); with 7 wt.% of Pluronic and 3 wt.% of SDS (Cu/Zr-2); without surfactant (Cu/Zr-3) and commercial ZrO2 (Cu/Zr-4). The catalysts were characterized by different techniques and evaluated in ethanol dehydrogenation reaction. The catalysts were previous reduced at 250 ºC (H2/N2) for 0.5 h and 6 ml/h ethanol was introduced on N2 flow. The presence of pluronic and SDS promoted an increase of surface area values in relation to ZrO2 carriers without surfactants. However. the support containing SDS showed pore shrinkage after calcination at 800 ºC.

The MIONs were prepared by co-precipitation of aqueous iron precursor solution at a high temperature. The polymer modified MIONs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS). transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). and vibrating sample magnetometery (VSM). It was found that these MIONs were successfully modified by this water-soluble polymer ligand with a fairly uniform size and narrow size distribution. The dried powder of MIONs could be stored for a long time and re-dispersed well in water without any significant change. Additionally. the polymer concentration showed a significant effect on size and magnetic properties of the MIONs. The saturation magnetization was increased by optimizing the polymer concentration. Furthermore. the 3-(4. 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-assay demonstrated that these MIONs were highly biocompatible and they could be successfully coupled with fluorescent dye Rhodamine due to the formation of amide bond between carboxylic acid groups of MIONs and amine groups of dye.

An absorption band located at 438 nm was detected; it corresponds to the surface plasmon resonance. High resolution transmission electronic microscopy measurements show core-shell structures of silver-silver oxide nanoparticles in these sol-gel silica films. These optical properties were modeled and well fitted with the Gans theory considering refractive index higher than the one coming from host matrix. This index is explained because the silver oxide shell modifies the local surrounding medium of the metallic nanoparticles and therefore plays an important role in the optical properties of the films.,True,81zSC2gAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,7,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/6641/66411T/Modeling-of-core-shell-silver-nanoparticles-in-nanostructured-sol-gel/10.1117/12.730872.short,5418204541445558499,/scholar?cites=5418204541445558499,,https://www.repositoriodigital.ipn.mx/bitstream/123456789/10653/1/6641-68%20Modelling%20core-shell%202007.pdf,0,0,0

Substitution of the 2-naphthalene position in analogues of ZD6021 resulted in increased NK1 potency and thus afforded NK1 preferential antagonists. Alterations of the piperidine region could then increase NK2 potency to restore dual NK1/NK2 selectivity. Through these efforts. three novel receptor antagonists from a single chemically related series were identified; two are dual NK1/NK2 antagonists. and the third is an NK1 preferential antagonist. In this paper. the factors affecting the balance of NK1 and NK2 selectivity in this series are discussed and the in vitro and in vivo properties of the novel antagonists are described. ,True,EpFIcqcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,76,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm020094i,1394108197737087328,/scholar?cites=1394108197737087328,,,0,0,0

This paper describes a successful new method in which DNA binds directly to iron oxide nanoparticles for use in an optical biosensor. A wide variety of nanoparticles with different properties have found broad application in biosensors because their small physical size presents unique chemical. physical. and electronic properties that are different from those of bulk materials. Of all nanoparticles. magnetic nanoparticles are proving to be a versatile tool. an excellent case in point being in DNA bioassays. where magnetic nanoparticles are often used for optimization of the hybridization and separation of target DNA. A critical step in the successful construction of a DNA biosensor is the efficient attachment of biomolecules to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles. To date. most methods of synthesizing these nanoparticles have led to the formation of hydrophobic particles that require additional surface modifications. As a result. the surface to volume ratio decreases and nonspecific bindings may occur so that the sensitivity and efficiency of the device deteriorates. A new method of large-scale synthesis of iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4) nanoparticles which results in the magnetite particles being in aqueous phase. was employed in this study. Small modifications were applied to design an optical DNA nanosensor based on sandwich hybridization.

The coverage of ferrocene is controlled by varying the coupling time between azidomethylferrocene and the distal alkyne of the monolayer via the copper assisted azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. All other variables in the surface preparation are maintained identical. What is observed is that the higher the surface coverage of the ferrocene moieties the faster the apparent rates of electron transfer. This surface coverage-dependent kinetic effect is attributed to electrons hopping between ferrocene moieties across the redox film toward hotspots for the electron transfer event.

Mansurov,49,Bulgarian Chemical Communications,3,600-607,,Objects of investigation are the coals of the central region of Kazakhstan and solid organic wastes in the form of polymers. In this work process of hydrogenation of brown coal of the Kazakhstan fields is studied. The mechanochemical activation of ore catalyst affects not only the degree of carbon conversion but also on the composition of the liquid products. Processing increases activity of the iron-containing catalyst in reactions of conversion of the high-molecular asfaltens into maltens possessing smaller molecular weight ie increases cracking properties of the catalyst. The presence of the polymer in the coal leads to release of the volatile and soluble low molecular weight products. which are products of the destructive conversion of coal and polymers. Their yield. composition and structure depend on the condition of the hydrogenation. the stage of coalification of coal. the medium. type and mode of mechanical action. The advantage of the proposed method for producing liquid products from coal is the high yield of hydrocarbon products boiling up to 200 C and the exception of the stages of selection and hydrotreating processes of the pastes. possibility of recycling of industrial and household wastes of polymeric materials.,True,6yDL2NMAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,18,http://www.bcc.bas.bg/bcc_volumes/Volume_49_Number_3_2017/BCC-49-3-2017-4378-%D0%91aisejtow-600-607.pdf,6046827024643283876,/scholar?cites=6046827024643283876,,http://www.bcc.bas.bg/bcc_volumes/Volume_49_Number_3_2017/BCC-49-3-2017-4378-%D0%91aisejtow-600-607.pdf,0,0,0

Biodiesel is the most efficient alternative to fossil fuel substitution because it can be properly modified for current diesel engines. It is a vegetable oil-based fuel with similar properties to petroleum diesel. Generally. biodiesel is a non-toxic. biodegradable. and highly efficient alternative for fossil fuel substitution. In Malaysia. oil palm is considered as the most valuable commodity crop and gives a high economic return to the country. However. the ethical challenge of food or fuel makes palm oil not an ideal feedstock for biodiesel production. Therefore. attention is shifted to non-edible feedstock like Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (Jatropha curcas L.). It is an inedible oil-bearing crop that can be processed into biodiesel. It has a high-seed yield that could be continually produced for up to 50 years. Furthermore. its utilization will have zero impact on food sources since the oil is poisonous for human and animal consumption. However. Jatropha biodiesel is still in its preliminary phase compared to palm oil-based biodiesel in Malaysia due to a lack of research and development. Therefore. this paper emphasizes the potential of Jatropha curcas as an eco-friendly biodiesel feedstock to promote socio-economic development and meet significantly growing energy demands even though the challenges for its implementation as a national biodiesel program might be longer.

1206307,The effect of solvents on the soxhlet extraction of omega 3 from perah oil,2014,Nuraimi Azlan Hadi Tan and Bazlul Mobin Siddique and Ida Idayu Muhamad and Fook Seng Kok,67,Jurnal Teknologi,4,,,This study aims to investigate the influence of solvent on the Soxhlet extraction of omega 3 in perah seed oil. Three types of extraction solvent include hexane. hexane: methanol (90: 10) and methanol: ethanol (70: 30) were investigated. The concentration of extracted omega 3 was measured using Gas chromatography (GC). the colour of extracted oil was classified using colormeter and the total phenolic content (TPC) by Folin-Ciocalteau colorimetry. Based on the total yield extraction of the oil. the result shows that hexane solvent (57.5%) shows better performance compared to hexane-methanol (53.42%) and ethanol-methanol (34.52%). For the omega 3 concentration. hexane-methanol solvent provided highest yield at 1.41 g Ï‰-3/g oil followed by ethanol-methanol and hexane at 1.32 Ï‰-3/g oil and 1.15 Ï‰-3/g oil respectively. On the other hand. the extracted oil using hexane as extraction solvent was appeared to be lighter in colour as compared to other solvents studied. In addition. total phenolics content of perah oil was high with hexane solvent. As conclusion. the polar solvent of methanol and ethanol promoted the extraction of omega 3; however. it may cause a darker appearance of the extract as well as reducing the content of phenolic compounds.,True,zh1OBfAAAAAJ:-w1eE4La9_EC,4,https://journals.utm.my/jurnalteknologi/article/view/2797,7871667743025373967,/scholar?cites=7871667743025373967,,https://journals.utm.my/jurnalteknologi/article/download/2797/2098,0,0,0

Solution casting method was used for the film preparation while thymol was incorporated prior to casting. The physical and chemical properties of the developed film were determined. SEM was found to have a smooth and homogeneous with a small amount of thymol which grows coarser with 1.5% or higher thymol content. FTIR was used to find the chemical property of the film and suggested that the carbonyl functional group was unchanged in the film. however.-OH groups increased substantially with increased amount of thymol. Thermal properties were profiled through thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimeter where the AM film containing 1.5%(w/v) of thymol shows the highest thermal stability and decomposes less in comparison to other samples. The inhibitory capability of the film was tested against a list of microbial contamination and was found to successfully inhibit the growth of selected gram positive and gram negative bacteria in a wide range of studied concentration.

Application of heat produces some chemical compounds as impurities and even toxic compounds in oils and fats that give absorbance at different region. FTIR spectra of pure palm olein shows an absorbance at 3002 cm−1 whereas other pure oils show maximum absorption at around 3007 cm−1 due to C-H stretching vibration of cis-double bond (=C-H). By blending of high unsaturated oils with palm olein. a clear shift of 3007 cm−1 band to 3005 cm−1 occurs.

However recent studies had shown that under static shearing stress. more fracture failures had been found to occur through the solder and thus indicate the significance of solder microstructures in the joint integrity. In this work. we investigated the effect of Bi substitution for Sn on the shear strength of solder joints of near eutectic SAC alloy Sn3. 5Ag0. 9Cu.Design/methodology/approach: Ingot alloy were prepared from pure elements and their melting characteristics were followed with thermal analyses. Copper plates were soldered together in lap joints that were subjected to shear testing in the as-soldered conditions. The microstructures were followed by SEM and EDS. Findings: Results show that failures occurred in quasi-brittle manner. with large variability. The ternary SAC alloy had average shear strength of 30 MPa better than binary eutectic Sn/Cu. Small Bi substitution of Sn up to 2 wt% lead to increased average shear strengths with maximum strengths of about 50 MPa recorded for compositions with Bi content of 0.5 to 1.5 wt%. Bi substitutions beyond 2wt% gave substantially lower strength values. The application of Weibull criteria suggest untypical high variability in strength with Webuill moduli less than 10.

Precise temperature control is important as inadequate control may lead to thermal “run-away”. resulting in localized material damage. Consequently. the main objective of the present work is to use temperature for controlling the intensity of microwave radiation during the adhesive curing process. Using microwave energy delivered through a slotted waveguide at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. and with the power varied between 300 and 600 W. three engineering thermoplastics or adherends were joined by curing two types of “two-pack” epoxy adhesives.

Design/methodology/approach: The study was performed with the use of Gleeble 3800 simulator. Stressstrain curves were determined during continuous compression test in a temperature range from 900 to 1100 C and at a strain rate of 1. 10 and 50 s-1. In order to determine recrystallization kinetics of plastically deformed austenite. discontinuous compression tests of specimens were done with a given strain at the rate of 10 s-1. in a temperature range from 900 to 1100 C. with isothermal holding of samples between successive stages of deformation for 2 to 100 s.

Casting of metallic glasses in wire form is also now possible by a rotating water bath process developed by Ohnaka [1]. There are interesting differences between the two types of processes. the most notable being that the cooling is unidirectional for ribbon casting while it is radial for the wire casting. Thus. the shrinkage during cooling and vitrification should not lead to void or cavity formation in the former while it might be expected that such defects could be formed in the latter.

However. precipitation strengthened Cu-alloys are limited to very dilute concentration thereby limiting the volume proportion hardening precipitates. In this work. we report the investigation of the reprocessing of higher Cr concentration Cu-based alloys via rapid solidification. Design/methodology/approach: The ingot alloys with Cr content up to 10 wt.% were prepared via semi-chilling of small rods before been cast into ribbon using chill block melt spinner. Thermal aging studies followed by conductivity and microhardness tests were performed to follow the HSHC properties. Findings: It is found that the rapid solidification in the as-cast ribbon imposed combined solution extension and ultra-refinement of Cr rich phases. X-ray diffraction evidences suggest that the solid solution extension was up to 6wt% Cr. Lattice parameters determined confirmed the many folds extension of solid solution of Cr in Cu. Thermal aging studies of the cast ribbons indicated that peak aging treatments occurred in about twenty minutes. Peak aged hardness ranged from about 200 to well over 300Hv. The maximum peak aged hardness of 380Hv was obtained for alloy containing 6wt.% Cr but with conductivity of about 50% IACS.

For this purpose. the solvent extraction of lignin is performed in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. employing H2 pressure or an H-donor solvent (e.g.. 2-propanol). and thus leading to passivation of reactive lignin fragments via reductive processes. As a result. lignin-first biorefining methods generate high-quality pulps in addition to low-molecular-weight lignin streams with high molecular uniformity. Nonetheless. upon cooking lignocellulose in solvent mixtures containing water. other processes on the lignocellulosic matrix take place. releasing soluble intermediates.

1206371,Kinematic modeling of mechanocatalytic depolymerization of α-cellulose and beechwood,2018,Martin Kessler and Robert T Woodward and Narumi Wong and Roberto Rinaldi,,,,,Wiley,Mechanocatalytic depolymerization of lignocellulose presents a promising method for the solid‐state transformation of acidified raw biomass into water‐soluble products (WSPs). However. the mechanisms underlining the utilization of mechanical forces in the depolymerization are poorly understood. A kinematic model of the milling process is applied to assess the energy dose transferred to cellulose during its mechanocatalytic depolymerization under varied conditions (rotational speed. milling time. ball size. and substrate loading). The data set is compared to the apparent energy dose calculated from the kinematic model and reveals key features of the mechanocatalytic process. At low energy doses. a rapid rise in the WSP yield associated with the apparent energy dose is observed. However. at a higher energy dose obtained by extended milling duration or high milling speeds. the formation of a substrate cake layer on the mill vials appear to buffer the mechanical forces. preventing full cellulose conversion into WSPs. By contrast. for beechwood. there exists a good linear dependence between the WSP yield and the energy dose provided to the substrate over the entire range of WSP yields. As the formation of a substrate cake in depolymerization of beechwood is less severe than that for the cellulose experiments. the current results verify the hypothesis regarding the negative effect of a substrate layer formed on the mill vials upon the depolymerization process. Overall. the current findings provide valuable insight into relationships between the energy dose and the extent of cellulose depolymerization effected by the mechanocatalytic process.,True,xz-ro5oAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,15,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/58446,8379275967329006292,/scholar?cites=8379275967329006292,,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/58446/2/manuscript-production.pdf,0,0,0

This approach provides a route to the successful extraction and reductive passivation of lignin fragments to produce low molar mass lignin oils together with high-quality pulps. Herein. we present an investigation into the impact of process severity (i.e.. cooking temperature) on the reductive processes taking place on the lignin fragments and uniformity of the product mixture. In addition to improving overall delignification yields (up to 87%) and producing low molar mass fragments. higher process temperatures led to the preferential cleavage of hydroxyl groups in monolignol sidechains via hydrodeoxygenation. yielding oils with lower oxygen content. By comparing products from both lignin-first biorefining and organosolv processes at various temperatures. we elucidate key performance differences and outline routes to increased chemical uniformity in lignin streams. Overall. this study outlines clearly the importance of process temperature in the deconstruction of lignocellulose by lignin-first biorefining when producing highly depolymerized lignin products.

State-of-the-art supercapacitors feature activated carbon electrodes impregnated with a non-aqueous electrolyte (typically acetonitrile) that operate at voltages between 2.2–2.7 V. Unfortunately. activated carbons have low specific capacitance (100–120 F g−1) in organic electrolytes which severely limits the energy density of supercapacitors. In addition. organic solvents are often flammable leading to safety and environmental concerns. Aqueous electrolytes. on the other hand. are safer. cheaper and have higher ionic conductivity. promising higher capacitance electrodes.

Valence isoelectronic substitution of C with Si and Ge in this cluster leads to a radical change of structure toward distorted pentagonal species.

Counter intuitively. for the AAl42−/− (A = C. Si.

Cycling tests via cyclic voltammetry over a potential window of 0 to 1.0 V or 0 to 1.2 V in a two-electrode device configuration resulted in solid-state electropolymerization and chain scission. Electropolymerization of the aniline tetramer to generate long chain oligomers is shown to be possible despite the suggested decrease in reactivity and increase in intermediate stability with longer oligomers.

The modified wool fabrics exhibited brilliant colors due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties of silver NPs. The colors of wool fabrics altered with the morphologies of silver NPs. These modified wool fabrics were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicated that anisotropic silver NPs were effectively assembled on the surface of wool fibers when the solution pH and temperature was about 4 and 40 °C. respectively. This assembling of silver NPs on the wool fibers was realized by the electrostatic interaction between wool fibers and silver NPs. This technique was also applied to gold NPs.

However. viscose methods use large quantities of chemicals and hence the process is not considered as environmentally friendly. The process also fails to retain bamboo’s inherent unique properties such as ultraviolet (UV) screening and antibacterial functions. Hence. it is necessary to design an effective and more eco-friendly manufacturing method that would also retain the unique properties of raw bamboo plant into the fibres. In this research. bamboo was processed using new methods involving thermo mechanical treatments such as ultra-sonication. shaker milling and boiling with continuous stirring. Sodium hydroxide. hydrogen peroxide. enzyme and water were used separately in this process and their effects on fibre processing were compared. The morphology and UV shielding ability were analysed before and after processing. It was demonstrated that bamboo can be processed into fibres using only water and ball milling without the aid of any hazardous chemicals.

Therefore. new therapeutic approaches for renal cancer are essential. Englerin A is a natural product with a very potent and selective cytotoxicity against renal cancer cells. This makes it a promising drug candidate that may improve current treatment standards for patients with renal cancers in all stages. However. little is known about englerin A's mode of action in targeting specifically renal cancer cells. Our study is the first to investigate the biological mechanism of englerin A action in detail. We report that englerin A is specific for renal tumor cells and does not affect normal kidney cells. We find that englerin A treatment induces necrotic cell death in renal cancer cells but not in normal kidney cells. We further show that autophagic and pyroptotic proteins are unaffected by the compound and that necrotic signaling in these cells coincided with production of reactive oxygen species and calcium influx into the cytoplasm. As the first study to analyze the biological effects of englerin A. our work provides an important basis for the evaluation and validation of the compound's use as an anti-tumor drug.

Recent reports suggest that CBD and THC elevate the levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) when administered to humans. suggesting that phytocannabinoids target cellular proteins involved in endocannabinoid clearance.

Furthermore. animal studies by others have shown that elevated levels of endocannabinoids resulted in beneficial pharmacological effects on stress. pain and inflammation and also ameliorate the effects of drug withdrawal. Based on these observations. we hypothesized that FABP5 and FABP7 would provide excellent pharmacological targets. Thus. we performed a virtual screening of over one million compounds using DOCK and employed a novel footprint similarity scoring function to identify lead compounds with binding profiles similar to oleic acid. a natural FABP substrate. Forty-eight compounds were purchased based on their footprint similarity scores (FPS) and assayed for biological activity against purified human FABP5 employing a fluorescent displacement-binding assay. Four compounds were found to exhibit approximately 50% inhibition or greater at 10 µM. as good as or better inhibitors of FABP5 than BMS309403. a commercially available inhibitor. The most potent inhibitor. γ-truxillic acid 1-naphthyl ester (ChemDiv 8009-2334). was determined to have Ki value of 1.19±0.01 µM. Accordingly a novel α-truxillic acid 1-naphthyl mono-ester (SB-FI-26) was synthesized and assayed for its inhibitory activity against FABP5. wherein SB-FI-26 exhibited strong binding (Ki 0.93±0.08 µM).

1206453,Inhibition of fatty acid binding proteins elevates brain anandamide levels and produces analgesia,2014,Martin Kaczocha and Mario J Rebecchi and Brian P Ralph and Yu-Han Gary Teng and William T Berger and William Galbavy and Matthew W Elmes and Sherrye T Glaser and Liqun Wang and Robert C Rizzo and Dale G Deutsch and Iwao Ojima,9,PloS one,4,e94200,Public Library of Science,The endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) is an antinociceptive lipid that is inactivated through cellular uptake and subsequent catabolism by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are intracellular carriers that deliver AEA and related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) to FAAH for hydrolysis. The mammalian brain expresses three FABP subtypes: FABP3. FABP5. and FABP7. Recent work from our group has revealed that pharmacological inhibition of FABPs reduces inflammatory pain in mice. The goal of the current work was to explore the effects of FABP inhibition upon nociception in diverse models of pain. We developed inhibitors with differential affinities for FABPs to elucidate the subtype(s) that contributes to the antinociceptive effects of FABP inhibitors. Inhibition of FABPs reduced nociception associated with inflammatory. visceral. and neuropathic pain. The antinociceptive effects of FABP inhibitors mirrored their affinities for FABP5. while binding to FABP3 and FABP7 was not a predictor of in vivo efficacy. The antinociceptive effects of FABP inhibitors were mediated by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and FABP inhibition elevated brain levels of AEA. providing the first direct evidence that FABPs regulate brain endocannabinoid tone.

Accordingly. there is a pressing need to identify new drug targets. Filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ). a bacterial tubulin homologue. is an essential cell-division protein that polymerizes in a GTP-dependent manner. forming a highly dynamic cytokinetic ring. designated as the Z ring. at the septum site. Other cell-division proteins are recruited to the Z ring and. upon resolution of the septum. two daughter cells are produced. Since inactivation of FtsZ or alteration of FtsZ assembly results in the inhibition of Z-ring and septum formation. FtsZ is a very promising target for novel antimicrobial drug development. This review describes the function and dynamic behaviors of FtsZ and the recent development of FtsZ inhibitors as potential anti-TB agents.,True,gHifO_sAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,91,https://www.future-science.com/doi/abs/10.4155/fmc.10.220,1518609457471870028,/scholar?cites=1518609457471870028,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3039483/,0,0,0

1206460,Drug discovery through combination of computational screening and design. chemical synthesis and biological evaluations,2013,William Theodore Berger,,,,,,A long-standing problem with the use of conventional cancer chemotherapy is the inherent lack of tumor specificity.  Tumor-targeting drug-delivery systems (TTDS) have since been explored to overcome this deficiency.  These drug conjugates can deliver potent cytotoxic drugs specifically to tumors and tumor cells with minimal systemic toxicity.  Among various tumor-targeting molecules discussed. Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) represent a new approach to tumor targeting.  In particular. DARPins targeting CD326 Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) receptors provide an effective cancer target. as EpCAM is critical to the regulation of cellular matrix composition and overall cancer aggressiveness. Botulism is a human illness caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum which results in fatal flaccid paralysis and eventual respiratory failure.  Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum neurotoxins (BotNTs). which by themselves are considered by the CDC to be potential Category A bioterrorism weapons.  The light chain protease domain of BotNTs efficiently cleaves SNARE proteins which in turn regulates neurotransmitter release in motor neurons. resulting in the inhibition of neuronal transmission.  Discussed is the use of a novel footprint-based virtual screening to identify compounds with inhibitory activity against BotNTA-LC catalytic activity.

The reflectivity of light over a wide range of wavelengths was higher from gold layer coated single-crystal silicon substrates than from glass substrates. Furthermore. the efficiency of reflection from gold layers of two different thicknesses was examined. The thicker gold layer (100 nm) on the single-crystal silicon showed a higher reflectivity than the thinner gold film (10 nm). The formation of a nucleic acid duplex and aptamer–ligand interactions were evaluated on these gold layers. and a crystalline silicon substrate coated with the 100-nm-thick gold layer is proposed as an alternative substrate for studies of interactions of biomolecules.

Despite having large cavities. these clathrates of DC are found to be very stable when exposed to high pressure. and even the apohost structure. which contains large void space regions. is stable up to pressures above 6.6(1) GPa. The similarity between the compression of the apohost and the DC clathrates is presumably due to the extraordinary strength of the host framework. Bulk modulus and linear compression values are derived for the apohost and DC/acetic acid clathrate. The observed compression is shown to be more isotropic than what is expected from experimental elastic tensor data in the literature. although the compression along the a-axis is the largest for all the studied clathrates.

Low-cost byproducts – citrus pulp (CP) and soybean hulls (SH) – were employed as substrate for GA3 production by Gibberella fujikuroi in semisolid fermentation. A CP/SH mixture (70%/30%) promoted high productivities both in bubble column reactor (1.66 mg L/h). and in stirred tank reactor (2.13 mg L/h). GA3 production medium cost (US$ 6.70/m3) was reduced by 85% when compared to previously reported synthetic media (US$ 44.96/m3). It was described that GA3 fermented extract has low stability. and that liquid and powder formulation of the fermented extract maintained the biomolecule activity over 6 months.

The traditional antibiotic pipeline has been exhausted. prompting research into alternate antimicrobial strategies. Inspired by nature. antimicrobial peptides are rapidly gaining attention for their clinical potential as they present distinct advantages over traditional antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides are found in all forms of life and demonstrate a pivotal role in the innate immune system. Many antimicrobial peptides are evolutionarily conserved. with limited propensity for resistance. Additionally. chemical modifications to the peptide backbone can be used to improve biological activity and stability and reduce toxicity. This review details the therapeutic potential of peptide-based antimicrobials. as well as the challenges needed to overcome in order for clinical translation. We explore the proposed mechanisms of activity. design of synthetic biomimics. and how this novel class of antimicrobial compound may address the need for effective antibiotics.

At present. no effective strategies are available and the emergence of multidrug resistance has highlighted the need to develop novel antibacterial coatings to combat device-related infections. One approach is to interfere with the bacterial communication pathway or quorum sensing (QS). which is responsible for biofilm formation and virulence factors. by incorporating QS inhibitors (QSIs) such as dihydropyrrolones (DHPs) on biomaterial surfaces. The endogenous biological signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) is also a potential candidate for prevention of biomedical infections due to its antibiofilm activity. In this study. we have developed dual-action surface coatings based on DHPs and NO.

Cham,Traditional treatment for bacterial infection is based on compounds that target bacterial viability or growth. However. a major concern with this approach is the frequent development of drug-resistant mutants. The discovery of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) systems. which control fundamental processes involved in bacterial physiology and virulence. has opened new avenues for the development of antimicrobial agents for the control of bacterial infections. Fimbrolides isolated from Australian native marine alga Delisea pulchra are excellent examples of QS inhibitors provided by nature. Fimbrolides and their analogues exhibit excellent QS inhibitory activity without interfering with bacterial growth. and thus offer promising targets for development of new strategies to control microbial colonisation of surfaces.

However. contact lens wear is often associated with the risk of developing ocular surface infection and inflammation. and in severe cases. the infection can result in loss of vision. Antimicrobial peptide-coated contact lenses have been made to help reduce the incidence of infection and inflammation. This paper reviews the research progress from conception. through the laboratory and preclinical tests to the latest information on clinical testing of an antimicrobial contact lens. We provide insights into the pathways followed and pitfalls that have been encountered. The journey has not always been linear or smooth. but has resulted in some of the first published clinical testing of antimicrobial peptide-coated contact lenses in humans.

1206652,The Role of Orientation of Surface Bound Dihydropyrrol-2-ones (DHP) on Biological Activity,2019,Aditi Taunk and Renxun Chen and George Iskander and Kitty KK Ho and Basmah Almohaywi and David StClair Black and Mark DP Willcox and Naresh Kumar,24,Molecules,14,2676,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Quorum sensing (QS) signaling system is important for bacterial growth. adhesion. and biofilm formation resulting in numerous infectious diseases. Dihydropyrrol-2-ones (DHPs) represent a novel class of antimicrobial agents that inhibit QS. and are less prone to develop bacterial resistance due to their non-growth inhibition mechanism of action which does not cause survival pressure on bacteria. DHPs can prevent bacterial colonization and quorum sensing when covalently bound to substrates. In this study. the role of orientation of DHP compounds was investigated after covalent attachment by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) coupling reaction to amine-functionalized glass surfaces via various positions of the DHP scaffold. The functionalized glass surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements and tested for their in vitro biological activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. DHPs attached via the N-1 position resulted in the highest antibacterial activities against S. aureus. while no difference was observed for DHPs attached either via the N-1 position or the C-4 phenyl ring against P. aeruginosa.

We use a dipole polarizable potential (DIPPIM: the dipole polarizable ion model) and optimize its parameters by fitting them to a series of density functional theory calculations. The resulting potential was tested by calculating a series of fundamental properties for CeO 2 and by comparing them against experimental values. The values for all the calculated properties (thermal and chemical expansion coefficients. lattice parameters. oxygen migration energies. local crystalline structure and elastic constants) are within 10–15% of the experimental ones. an accuracy comparable to that of ab initio calculations.

Collective lithium transport was analyzed by identifying dynamical excitations: persistent ion displacements over distances comparable to the separation between lithium sites. and stringlike clusters of ions that undergo cooperative motion. We find that dynamical excitations in c-LLZO (cubic) are frequent. with participating lithium numbers following an exponential distribution. mirroring the dynamics of fragile glasses. In contrast. excitations in t-LLZO (tetragonal) are both temporally and spatially sparse. consisting preferentially of highly concerted lithium motion around closed loops.

In particular. ions of the same charge can approach at close contact. leading to the formation of a superionic state.

Glycerol and urea are two examples of NMF components that are also used in skin care applications. In the present study. we investigate the influence of glycerol and urea on the permeability of a model drug (metronidazole. Mz) across excised pig skin membranes at different hydrating conditions. The degree of skin hydration is regulated by the gradient in water activity across the membrane. which in turn depends on the water activity of the formulation in contact with the skin membrane. Here. we determine the water activity of all formulations employed using an isothermal calorimetric method. Thus. the gradient in water activity is controlled by a novel experimental set-up with well-defined boundary conditions on both sides of the skin membrane.

This leads to a variation in the degree of hydration from the inside to the outside of skin and changes in this gradient may affect its structure and function. In this study we raise the question: How do changes in the water gradient across skin affect its permeability? We approach this problem in novel diffusion experiments that permit strict control of the gradient in the chemical potential of water and hence well-defined boundary conditions. The results demonstrate that a water gradient can be used to regulate transport of drugs with different lipophilic characteristics across the skin barrier. It is shown that the transport of metronidazole (log Po/w = 0.0) and methyl salicylate (log Po/w = 2.5) across skin increases abruptly at low water gradients. corresponding to high degrees of skin …,True,Q5rT_aYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,78,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365910000143,2405963130509189307,/scholar?cites=2405963130509189307,,,0,0,0

One strategy to increase drug delivery across skin is to increase the hydration. A detailed description of how hydration affects skin permeability requires characterization of both macroscopic and molecular properties and how they respond to hydration. We explore this issue by performing impedance experiments on excised skin membranes in the frequency range 1 Hz to 0.2 MHz under the influence of a varying gradient in water activity (aw). Hydration/dehydration induces reversible changes of membrane resistance and effective capacitance. On average. the membrane resistance is 14 times lower and the effective capacitance is 1.5 times higher when the outermost SC membrane is exposed to hydrating conditions (aw = 0.992). as compared to the case of more dehydrating conditions (aw = 0.826).

To investigate the influence of hydration and heating on the SC. we record the natural-abundance 13C signal of SC using polarization transfer solid-state NMR methods. Resonance lines from all major SC components are assigned. Comparison of the signal intensities obtained with the INEPT and CP pulse sequences gives information on the molecular dynamics of SC components. The majority of the lipids are rigid at 32°C. and those lipids co-exist with a small pool of mobile lipids. The ratio between mobile and rigid lipids increases with hydration. An abrupt change of keratin filament dynamics occurs at RH = 80–85%. from completely rigid to a structure with rigid backbone and mobile protruding terminals. Heating has a strong effect on the lipid mobility. but only a weak influence on the keratin filaments.

However. acute or chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has several harmful effects on the skin structure and function. especially in the case of the failing function of antioxidative enzymes. which may lead to substantial tissue damage due to the increased presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aim of this work was to investigate the combined effect of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation and oxidative stress on the skin barrier integrity. For this. we employed electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize changes of the electrical properties of excised pig skin membranes after various exposure conditions of UVB irradiation. oxidative stress. and the inhibition of antioxidative enzymatic processes. The oxidative stress was regulated by adding hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) as a source of ROS. while sodium azide (NaN 3) was used as an inhibitor of the antioxidative enzyme catalase. which is naturally present throughout the epidermis. By screening for the combined effect of UVB and oxidative stress on the skin membrane electrical properties. we developed a new protocol for evaluating these parameters in a simple in vitro setup. Strikingly. the results show that exposure to extreme UVB irradiation does not affect the skin membrane resistance. implying that the skin barrier remains macroscopically intact.

Therefore. they are ubiquitous and can be found in a wide range of different applications such as paints and varnishes. pressure-sensitive adhesives. textiles. construction materials. paper coatings and inks. However. they also have weaknesses and their surfactant content is among them. Surfactants are often needed to stabilize polymer particles in the aqueous latex dispersions. These surfactants also form part of the coatings formed from these dispersions. and it is well-known that they can lower their performance. This work further explores this aspect and focuses on the role that embedded surfactant domains play in the response of latex coatings to humid environments. For this purpose. we made use of several experimental techniques where humidity control was implemented: quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. atomic force microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. By means of this multimethodological approach. we report that surfactants embedded in latex coatings can undergo humidity-induced transitions towards more hydrated and softer phases. and that this results in a drastic decrease of the mechanical and water barrier properties of the whole coatings. Subsequently. this work highlights the potential of taking into account the phase behavior of surfactants when choosing which ones to use in the synthesis of latex dispersions as this would help in predicting their performance under different environmental conditions.

Caffeic acid is a potent antioxidant molecule whose cutaneous administration is hampered by its low solubility and scarce stability. In order to improve its therapeutic potential. caffeic acid has been encapsulated within solid lipid nanoparticles and ethosomes. The effect of lipid matrix has been evaluated on the morphology and size distribution of solid lipid nanoparticles and ethosomes loaded with caffeic acid. Particularly. morphology has been investigated by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. while mean diameters have been evaluated by photon correlation spectroscopy. The antioxidant power has been evaluated by the 2. 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl methodology. The influence of the type of nanoparticulate system on caffeic acid diffusion has been evaluated by Franz cells associated to the nylon membrane. while to evaluate caffeic acid permeation through the skin. an amperometric study has been conducted. which was based on a porcine skin-covered oxygen electrode. This apparatus allows measuring the O 2 concentration changes in the membrane induced by polyphenols and H 2 O 2 reaction in the skin. The antioxidative reactions in the skin induced by caffeic acid administered by solid lipid nanoparticles or ethosomes have been evaluated. Franz cell results indicated that caffeic acid diffusion from ethosomes was 18-fold slower with respect to solid lipid nanoparticles.

These applications are strongly influenced by hydration where elevated hydration generally leads to increased skin permeability. Thus. favorable transdermal delivery and extraction conditions can be easily obtained by exploiting elevated skin hydration. Here. we provide a detailed in vivo and in vitro investigation of the skin hydration dynamics using three techniques based on electrical impedance spectroscopy. Good correlation between in vivo and in vitro results is demonstrated. which implies that simple but realistic in vitro models can be used for further studies related to skin hydration (eg. cosmetic testing).

1206732,Biophysical differences between COPD. CF and healthy airways mucus.,2020,Vladislav Genevskiy,,,,,Malmö universitet/Hälsa och samhälle,An improved understanding of the mucus biophysical alteration in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is a milestone towards a more accurate and effective treatment of these common and highly debilitating conditions. Little is known about the variations in mucus structure between ill and healthy individuals. An established fact. however. is the role of the mucus obstruction in the exacerbation of the two conditions which impairs the physiological cleaning mechanism of the airways (mucociliary clearance) and is assessed as the strongest predictor of mortality. Therefore. it appears relevant to investigate which properties and structural changes are responsible of the impaired clearance of airway mucus. This thesis presents investigations of mucus on the basis of mucin structure observed in healthy. COPD and cystic fibrosis bronchial mucus samples. AFM (atomic force microscopy) and synchrotron SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) techniques were used to characterise the structural features of the mucin molecules and allowed to identify the dumbbell structure of airways mucin monomers. The analysis of structural and dimensional features of mucins. highlighted a greater similarity of COPD with the healthy sample rather than with cystic fibrosis. The water sorption analysis using QCM-D (quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring). established a divergent behaviour between COPD and cystic fibrosis. Compared to healthy specimen. the mucus from COPD donors. showed a greater tendency to absorb water while cystic fibrosis mucus. in contrast. displayed the lowest water absorption.,True,Q5rT_aYAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1486201,,,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1486201/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

Raman scattering was used to associate the Eapp variations along the glass transition conversion with the stereochemistry evolution during the polymeric relaxation. Herein. the selection of atactic PVC as the polymer model permits us to monitor the glassy polymer segment stereodynamics during the heating ramp through the C–Cl stretching.

The foaming behavior of seven polypropylene based resins with ethylene content varying from 0 to 11 mol% can be categorized into two groups related to their respective degrees of regio-defects: below 0.1 and around 0.66 mol%. Increasing the ethylene content from 0 to 4.04 mol% is enough to decrease the foam density by a factor of 6.3. as well as the foaming temperature by 15 °C. For a specific number of stereo and regio-defects. the ethylene content has a linear response with the optimal foaming temperature.

The major component of biomass are polysaccharides. so to drive the competitive utilization of (2nd generation) polysaccharides towards non-food applications and thereby creating biorefinery supply chains it is essential that all (side-) products are valorized at maximal added value. Nowadays biobased building materials are used in various fields and for a wide range of applications such as polymers. fillers. coatings. adhesives. impregnation materials or high performance composites. This work focuses on humins. a biomacromolecular by-product of a FDCA biorefinery.

Obtaining an improved understanding of the fundamental chemistry of lignin. the most recalcitrant component of biomass. during pretreatment is critical to the continued development of renewable biofuel production. To examine the intrinsic chemistry of lignin during dilute acid pretreatment (DAP). lignin was isolated from poplar and switchgrass using a cellulolytic enzyme system and then treated under DAP conditions. Our results highlight that lignin is subjected to depolymerization reactions within the first 2 min of dilute acid pretreatment and these changes are accompanied by increased generation of aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyl groups of lignin.

Iridium is in a distorted octahedral (n= 6) coordination with the N. C’atoms of two phenylpyridine and the N atoms of two acetonitrile ligands. The peculiarity of this structure is that three independent moieties of the title compound and three PF 6− anions. to counterbalance the charge. are observed in the asymmetric unit and this is a rather uncommon fact among the Cambridge Crystallographic Database (CSD) entries. The three couples are almost identical conformers with very similar torsional angles. The packing. symmetry. and space group were accurately analyzed and described also by means of Hirshfeld surface analysis. which is able to underline subtle differences among the three anion/cation couples in the asymmetric unit. The driving force of the packing is the clustering of the aromatic rings and the maximization of acetonitrile: PF 6− interactions.

We begin with an overview of charge transport in organic electronic materials with a focus on electronic polarization while discussing recent models. followed by a review of the computational methods employed throughout our investigations. We provide a bottom-up approach to the problem of describing electronic polarization by first laying the framework of our model and comparing calculated properties of bulk materials to available experimental data and previously proposed models. We then explore the effects of changing the electronic structure of our systems though perfluorination. and investigate the effects of modifying the crystalline packing through the addition of bulky functional groups while investigating how the non-bonded interactions between molecular neighbors change in different packing motifs.

Using this strategy. we describe the deposition of layered polyelectrolyte−silica coating on negatively charged surfaces of polystyrene particles and latex nanocapsules. which could not be coated directly with silica alone. By etching away the underlying polystyrene bead. we were able to form polyelectrolyte−silica capsules that were mechanically robust. Using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. we imaged and studied the coating after the deposition of each layer of polyelectrolyte and silica. We then applied this new coating to latex nanocapsules that were loaded with fluorescein molecules.

To induce rotation. we placed the microparticle at the center of rotation of the vortex and used the recirculating fluid flow to drive rotation. We have monitored the rotation of single beads (which ranged in diameter from a few micrometers to tens of micrometers) and living cells in a microvortex. To follow the rotation of a smooth and symmetrically shaped bead. we first ablated a small region (∼1 μm) on the bead. An Ar+ laser was then tightly focused (∼0.5-μm spot size) onto the bead. and rotation was tracked by recording changes in the level of backscattered laser light as the ablated region repeatedly transited the laser focus.

The theory of deconvolution and the method of analysis is presented. The vesicles were quantitatively labeled using primary antibodies directed at the vesicle protein being measured. The number of several vesicle proteins reported. including SV2. the proton ATPase.

This correlation. given by ln(k•OH) = (19.72 ± 0.14) + (0.424 ± 0.033)(#CH2). suggests that hydroxyl radical oxidation predominantly occurs by hydrogen atom abstraction from constituent methylene groups in each of these nitrosamines.

1206926,Earth-abundant water-splitting catalysts coupled to silicon solar cells for solar-to-fuels conversion,2014,Casandra R Cox,,,,,,Direct solar-to-fuels conversion can be achieved by coupling semiconductors with water-splitting catalysts. A 10% or higher solar to fuels conversion is minimally necessary for the realization of a robust future technology. Many water-splitting devices have been proposed but due to expensive designs and/or materials. none have demonstrated the necessary efficiency at low-cost that is a requisite for large-scale implementation. In this thesis. a modular approach is used to couple water-splitting catalysts with crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaics. with ultimate goal of demonstrating a stand-alone and direct solar-to-fuels water-splitting device comprising all non-precious. technology ready. materials.  Since the oxygen evolution reaction is the key efficiency-limiting step for water-splitting. we first focus on directly interfacing oxygen evolution catalysts with c-Si photovoltaics. Due to the instability of silicon under oxidizing conditions. a protective interface between the PV and OER catalyst is required. This coupling of catalyst to Si semiconductor thus requires optimization of two interfaces: the silicon|protective layer interface; and. the protective layer|catalyst interface. A modular approach allows for the independent optimization and analysis of these two interfaces. A stand-alone water-splitting device based on c-Si is created by connecting multiple single junction c-Si solar cells in series. Steady-state equivalent circuit analysis allows for a targeted solar-to-fuels efficiency to be designed within a predictive framework for a series-connected c-Si solar cells and earth-abundant water-splitting catalysts operating at neutral pH.

These kinetically stabilized materials can show improved functionality over their thermodynamically stable counterparts. However. it is difficult at best to predict formation pathways for such metastable materials. In this work. we aim to understand how the initial state of amorphous thin films of VO x influences the final crystalline form or polymorph. We employ a range of synchrotron based techniques: grazing incidence pair distribution function (GIPDF). x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). and x-ray diffraction (XRD) during in-situ crystallization. We focus on amorphous VO x films deposited by pulsed laser deposition with varying laser repetition rates and oxygen partial pressures and subsequently crystallized by annealing under different conditions. These different synthesis conditions create several different amorphous structures. as identified from GIPDF and XAS analysis. In-situ 2D-XRD during film crystallization shows that the different starting amorphous structures result in the formation of different polymorph. We use these results to relate the local structure of the initial amorphous structures to the VO x polymorph structure. This work is part of a larger effort to help better understand the pathways needed to synthesize different polymorph.(author),True,ei12SUIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:49081786,,,,,0,0,0

The use of nZVI for environmental applications is challenging because of the formation of an oxide layer rapidly in the presence of oxygen. Therefore. radiation-grafted NWPE/PP synthetic fabric was used as the functional carrier to anchor nZVI and enhance its spreading and stability. The chemical reduction of nitrate by nZVI-adsorbed NWPE/PP-g-AAc (nZVI-Ads-NWP) fabric was examined in batch experiments at different pH values. At low pH values. the protective layers on nZVI particles can be readily dissolved. exposing the pure iron particles for efficient chemical reduction of nitrate.

This results in enhanced electric conductance of dispersions of these oxides. which is higher than the conductance of dispersion containing only solvent and metal oxide and of an alcoholic solution of a weak acid. This phenomenon is accompanied by a shift of the ζ potential of the oxide particles to more negative values. The changes in the ζ potential indicate strong positive adsorption of anions from solution.,True,f3Hzsg0AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,8,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp1058462,12464323349881865862,/scholar?cites=12464323349881865862,,,0,0,0

We show here that the high pressure on the ocean floor induces dissolution of sparingly soluble metal hydroxides and release of metal cations pre-sorbed on iron hydrous oxides. The concentration of divalent cations of a heavy metal in equilibrium with the metal hydroxide at a 5 km depth is four-times higher than on the ocean surface (at atmospheric pressure. and otherwise the same conditions). and this result is practically independent of the nature of the heavy metal.

1206984,Dispersions of metal oxides in the presence of anionic surfactants,2019,Leszek Ruchomski and Edward Mączka and Marek Kosmulski,3,Colloids and Interfaces,1,3,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,We studied the behavior of dilute dispersions of nanoparticles of hematite. alumina. and titania in the presence of various concentrations of very pure sodium dodecyl-. tetradecyl-. and hexadecylsulfate. The concentrations studied were up to critical micelle concentration (CMC) for sodium dodecylsulfate. and up to the solubility limit in case of sodium tetradecyl-and hexadecylsulfate. The dispersions were adjusted to different pH (3–11). and 10− 3 M NaCl was used as the supporting electrolyte. The solid-to-liquid ratio was strictly controlled in all dispersions. and the behavior of fresh dispersions was compared with dispersions aged for up to eight days. The presence of very low concentrations of ionic surfactants had rather insignificant effects on the ζ potentials of the particles. At sufficient concentrations of ionic surfactants the isoelectric point (IEP) of metal oxides shifted to low pH. and the long-chain surfactants were more efficient in shifting the IEP than their shorter-chain analogues. Once the surfactant concentration reached a critical value. the ζ potentials of the particles reached a pH-independent negative value. which did not change on further increase in the surfactant concentration and/or aging of the dispersion. This critical concentration increases with the solid-to-liquid ratio. and it is rather consistent (for certain oxides and certain surfactants) when it is expressed as the amount of surfactant per unit of surface area.

To this end. the interaction between alkyl‐substituted phosphines (Me3P and tBu3P) and hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) is first investigated. Driven by the lone‐pair to π‐orbital interaction. the binding energy is found to be even larger than usual π–π interaction energies between small aromatic compounds. This character. which is inherited to fluorophenyl‐substituted B(C6F5)3 in the FLP. induces large flexibility in the FLP over the molecular surface of B(C6F5)3.

A series of semiclassical approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem in various settings. The Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME) utilizes a partial Wigner transform and a mapping representation for its formulation. and has been developed to describe nonadiabatic processes in an efficient manner. Operationally. it is expressed as a set of Hamilton's equations of motion. similar to more conventional classical molecular dynamics. However. this original Hamiltonian PBME sometimes suffers from a large deviation in accuracy especially in the long time limit.

We find that the interpolated surface actually reproduces experimentally found features much better than the conventional force field based potential especially in terms of both dynamics Stokes shift in the short time limit and solute vibrational decoherence.

1207088,On the Mechanism of Irreversible Carbon Dioxide Binding with a Frustrated Lewis Pair: Solvent‐Assisted Frustration and Transition‐State Entropic Encouragement,2011,Hee Jae Kwon and Hyun Woo Kim and Young Min Rhee,17,Chemistry–A European Journal,23,6501-6507,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,The mechanism of irreversible carbon dioxide binding with a Lewis pair Mes3P:AlCl3 (Mes=2.4.6‐C6H2Me3) is computationally investigated to reveal that the steric congestion is not the driving force for the activation of CO2. Instead. we find that the specific solute–solvent interaction between the Lewis acid and a bromobenzene molecule lowers the effective binding energy of the Lewis pair. This solvation effect affects the reaction in a similar manner to the steric encumbering of conventional frustrated Lewis pairs.

Soc,,465-469,,Proton transfer reaction is one of the most fundamental processes in chemistry and life science. Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) has been studied as a model system of the proton transfer. since it can be conveniently initiated by light. We report ESIPT reaction dynamic of 1-hydroxy-anthraquione (1-HAQ) in solution by highly time-resolved fluorescence. ESIPT time of 1-HAQ is determined to be  fs directly from decay of the reactant fluorescence and rise of the product fluorescence. High time resolution allows observation of the coherent vibrational wave packet motion in the excited state of the reaction product tautomer. The coherently excited vibrational mode involves large displacement of the atoms. which shortens the distance between the proton donor and the acceptor. With the theoretical analysis. we propose that the ESIPT of 1-HAQ proceeds barrierlessly with assistance of the skeletal vibration. which in turn becomes excited coherently by the ESIPT reaction.,True,T5ScIkoAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,21,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201309256122743.page,12562953535115966795,/scholar?cites=12562953535115966795,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201309256122743.pdf,0,0,0

The selective formation of methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a key process. but it is rather difficult to achieve with high selectivity due to a radical reaction. Catalytic ionic processes can be a solution. Herein. sulfated tin oxide (STO) was employed in the gas-phase catalytic chlorination of CH4. The STO catalyst exhibited high selectivity to CH3Cl (>96%) even at high CH4 conversion. By applying a suite of physicochemical characterizations. it is shown that the strong Lewis acid sites on STO generated by the interaction of Sn and surface sulfate groups are mainly responsible for the highly selective CH4 conversion. DFT calculations further revealed that STO surface can activate more Cl2 molecules in a heterolytic manner. leading to better catalytic performances as compared to SnO2 and sulfated zirconia catalysts.,True,T5ScIkoAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,6,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.9b02645,12304038303729009423,/scholar?cites=12304038303729009423,,,0,0,0

Analysis of molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) demonstrates existence of two areas of positive MEP (σ-holes) in the outermost part of the sulfur atom on the continuation of the lines of the C–S bonds. One of these σ-holes is oriented toward region of negative MEP around the oxygen atom of carbonyl group. Such situation corresponds to formation of σ-hole or chalcogen bond.

It is demonstrated that. due to the violation of symmetry in π-systems. the introduction of any substituent in the benzene ring results in a decrease in the degree of aromaticity. It has been found that structural Bird and HOMA aromaticity indices do not reflect the strength of substituents and their ability to perturb ring electronic density in the benzene ring. The application of magnetic indices NICS0 and NICS1 results in an overestimation of aromaticity of substituted molecules with respect to benzene.

In this study class F-fly ash based sodium silicate free geopolymers were synthesized and used for coating application at 60oC. Setting time and adhesion strength analysis were performed using Vicat needle and Elcometer 108 according to ASTM C 807-08 and D 4541 respectively. Infra Red spectroscopy was used to understand the degree of geopolymerisation by observing the vibration frequency of-Si-OT bonds around 1000 cm-1. A gradual increase in adhesion strength was observed with alteration of Na/Al ratio from 0.6 to 1.0. A maximum of 3.8 MPa adhesion strength was produced by geopolymer with Na/Al= 1. Final setting time shows variation with varying Na/Al at a constant water content. It was found that geopolymers gained maximum strength within first 3 days and only partial changes has been noticed in terms of adhesion strength. Scanning electron microscopy of the final product revealed that the formation of geopolymer has occurred without addition of sodium silicate. It can be concluded that sodium silicate free geopolymer has the potential to be used as a sustainable and green coating material for metals protection.,True,WwcIX2IAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,13,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irfan_Khan26/publication/267695413_Sodium_Silicate_Free_Geopolymer_As_Coating_Material_Adhesion_To_Steel/links/546422b00cf2837efdb34a53/Sodium-Silicate-Free-Geopolymer-As-Coating-Material-Adhesion-To-Steel.pdf,13900747041010877343,/scholar?cites=13900747041010877343,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Irfan_Khan26/publication/267695413_Sodium_Silicate_Free_Geopolymer_As_Coating_Material_Adhesion_To_Steel/links/546422b00cf2837efdb34a53/Sodium-Silicate-Free-Geopolymer-As-Coating-Material-Adhesion-To-Steel.pdf,0,0,0

The novel optical arrangement employs three 60° beam combiners to blend the spectral output from four light sources such as electrodeless discharge lamps. or hollow cathode lamps. and then direct that output over an atomizer. This instrument uses an inexpensive tungsten coil atomizer that is extracted from a standard 150 W projector bulb. The temperature of the coil is computer-controlled by changing the voltage across the coil. A low voltage is first used to dry the sample then a higher voltage is used to atomize the sample.

It would be difficult to experimentally determine the impact of various factors on secondhand exposure including. but not limited to. room characteristics (indoor space size. ventilation rate). device specifications (aerosol mass delivery. e-liquid composition). and use behavior (number of users and usage frequency). Therefore. a well-mixed computational model was developed to estimate the indoor levels of constituents from EVPs under a variety of conditions. The model is based on physical and thermodynamic interactions between aerosol. vapor. and air. similar to indoor air models referred to by the Environmental Protection Agency. The model results agree well with measured indoor air levels of nicotine from two sources: smoking machine-generated aerosol and aerosol exhaled from EVP use. Sensitivity analysis indicated that increasing air exchange rate reduces room air level of constituents. as more material is carried away. The effect of the amount of aerosol released into the space due to variability in exhalation was also evaluated. The model can estimate the room air level of constituents as a function of time. which may be used to assess the level of non-user exposure over time.

1207226,A Comparison of a High-and Low-Resolution ICP-MS for the Analysis of Toxic Metals in Plant Matrices,,Derek D Bussan and Timothy L Danielson and Karl A Wagner,,,,,,ObjectivesInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is the analytical tool of choice for routine analysis of trace metals. For this work. we determined nine elements (As. Be. Cd. Co. 1. 2 Cr. Hg. Ni. Pb. and Se) in plant matrices using two ICP-MS instrumental platforms. The two platforms included high-resolution magnetic sector mass spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a collision and dynamic reaction cell. The target analytes were selected based on their inclusion in the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) established list of Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents (HPHCs) for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. As. Co. Cr. Ni. and Se are known to suffer from polyatomic and/or molecular spectral interferences with quadrupole-based mass spectrometers due to a low resolving power of approximately 400 atomic mass units. These interferences are commonly addressed using collision and/or reaction cell technology.

1207227,A Tobacco Laboratory Process Control Sample with Elevated Levels of Selenium,,Karl A Wagner and Greg A Davis,,,,,,In 2012. the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a list of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) for currently 1 regulated tobacco products. This list included the following eight metals: beryllium. cadmium. chromium. cobalt. lead. mercury. nickel. and selenium. Selenium is present at low ng/g levels in tobacco. which is often near or below the limit of quantitation of the analytical method. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is frequently employed due to high throughput and sensitivity; however. all of the major selenium isotopes suffer from polyatomic interferences. which can 2 adversely impact accuracy with low level determinations. When conducting analytical assays such as elemental analysis. it is a common practice to include a standard reference material or process control sample as a measure of accuracy and/or to ensure the entire laboratory process is in control. When choosing a reference material. it is important that the matrix be as similar to the sample matrix as possible.,True,p7yLLyQAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,https://www.coresta.org/sites/default/files/abstracts/2016_STPOST44_Wagner.pdf,,,,https://www.coresta.org/sites/default/files/abstracts/2016_STPOST44_Wagner.pdf,0,0,0

It consists of three domains: residues 1–20. which comprise the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain; residues 21–30. which is a hinge segment; and residues 31–52. which encompass the hydrophobic a-helical membrane-spanning region [1]. Phosphorylation of PLB activates the Ca2+ pump of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increases the Ca2+ uptake by a mechanism which is still unclear [2]. Structural analysis of PLB has been instrumental in understanding the motion and dynamics of PLB in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Fuji and co-workers [3] elucidated the complete PLB primary structure by amino acid sequencing. established the molecular mass of the PLB monomer to be 6082 Da. and determined that PLB is a pentamer consisting of five identical subunits. The existence of a stable PLB pentamer in the SR and its small size makes it suitable for spectroscopic studies. The isolation of large quantities of native PLB through molecular biology techniques has been hampered due to difficulties encountered in the bacterial overexpression of phospholamban cDNA [4. 5]. Recently. PLB has been prepared by chemical synthesis using standard solid-phase peptide synthesis and purification in organic solvents [6–8]. Synthetic PLB exhibited biochemical characteristics identical to native PLB [7. 8].

Ltd.,The UV‐vis and variable‐temperature X‐band EPR spectral studies (298–77 K) on π‐cation of zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) have revealed for the first time a labile electronic ground state. The electronic structure changes from 2A2u to 2A1u as the temperature is lowered from 298 to 150 K. Axial ligands and σ‐donor solvents show a significant effect on the spectral data. The lability in the ground state electronic configuration is attributed to the flexibility of the porphyrin moiety in changing from a ‘ruffled’ to a lower symmetry. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons.

However. continuous photo-thermal conversion can cause the PCMs to reach high thermal equilibrium temperatures after phase transition. In our study. a novel light-driven phase change material system with temperature-control properties was constructed using a thermochromic compound. Thermochromic phase change materials (TC-PCMs) were prepared by introducing 2-anilino-6-dibutylamino-3-methylfluoran (ODB-2) and bisphenol A (BPA) into 1-hexadecanol (1-HD) in various proportions. Photo-thermal conversion performance was investigated with solar radiation (low power of 0.09 W/cm 2) and a xenon lamp (at a high power of 0.14 W/cm 2). The TC-PCMs showed a low equilibrium temperature due to variations in absorbance. Specifically. the temperature of TC-PCM 180 (ODB-2. bisphenol A and 1-HD ratio 1: 2: 180) could stabilize at 54 C approximately.

The envelope of CHIKV is composed of 240 copies of two glycoproteins: E1 and E2. In this work. we have characterized the N-glycosylation patterns of CHIKV virus-like particles (VLPs). containing both E1 and E2 proteins. derived from mammalian and insect cells using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with fluorescence (FL) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection. While HEK293 derived CHIKV VLPs contain oligomannose. hybrid and complex glycans. VLPs derived from SfBasic predominantly contain oligomannose glycans. This strong host dependence of N-glycosylation pattern resembles other alphaviruses such as SINV. The VLPs from HEK293 and SfBasic. with significantly different N-glycosylation profiles. are valuable reagents enabling future in-depth correlation studies between immunogenicity and glycosylation. In addition. the characterization tools presented here allow one to monitor glycosylation during vaccine process development and ensure process consistency.,True,xPcehDQAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5306173,,,,,0,0,0

1207329,Surface self-assembly of electroactive molecules as wires and switches,2011,Claudia Delgado Simão,,,,1,,The aim of the present thesis is to construct switches in surfaces based on a bottom-up approach using multifunctional molecules as building blocks and use self-assembly to address these building blocks onto surfaces. The multifunctional systems on study are based on polychlorotriphenylmethyl radicals and tetrathiafulvalenes. which both are families of molecules exhibiting bistability based on their redox pairs. where each redox state exhibits different magnetic. electric and optical properties. This bistability is the basis of the device. where one can switch between states by applying an external stimulus. in this case. a voltage that allows to reach each redox state. Then. the optical. magnetic or electric properties of this switch can be used read-out mechanisms of the fabricated molecular devices.

1207330,Titanium particle incorporation in block copolymer templates,2016,Martin Kreuzer and Claudia Simao and Ana Diaz and Clivia M Sotomayor Torres,105,Polymer,,195-202,Elsevier,Template-directed formation of titanium structures on block copolymer templates has been recently reported [1]. Here. the incorporation of titanium in a thin film template is studied. We show that the surface free energy contrast in microphase-separated polystyrene-block-polyethylene oxide templates is not limited to the template film surface. but directs the assembly of titanium atoms in the template thin film. The details of the self-assembly of titanium particles on the block copolymer nanostructured surface and inside the 3D film structure are studied with selected amounts of titanium. Evaporated titanium preferentially wets the polystyrene block of the block copolymer film and diffuses inside the film. conserving the block copolymer nanostructure. Increasing deposition leads to the formation of a mesoporous titanium layer on the block copolymer film. which reproduces that of the underlying template. in this particular …,True,p77x0FgAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032386116309120,1942058934825168499,/scholar?cites=1942058934825168499,,,0,0,0

This method is needed as PA containing iodine (such as CuI/KX (X = I or Br) heat stabilizing agent). may represent a risk of corrosion for electronic parts in the automotive industry. The method involved a microwave assisted digestion method using nitric acid followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. A dilution in 0.5% NH3 was needed prior to ICP-MS analysis to suppress memory effect. The limit of quantification was estimated to be 0.9 mg kg−1 which allows the control of very low iodine content PA used for applications in sensitive electronic parts. Spiking with iodide at 50 mg kg−1 gave recovery factors of 100 ± 0.8%. The acid digestion method was compared with microwave assisted extraction of PA with 5% NH3 solution.

1207389,Nanostructured p-type semiconductor electrodes and photoelectrochemistry of their reduction processes,2016,Matteo Bonomo and Danilo Dini,9,,5,373,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This review reports the properties of p-type semiconductors with nanostructured features employed as photocathodes in photoelectrochemical cells (PECs). Light absorption is crucial for the activation of the reduction processes occurring at the p-type electrode either in the pristine or in a modified/sensitized state. Beside thermodynamics. the kinetics of the electron transfer (ET) process from photocathode to a redox shuttle in the oxidized form are also crucial since the flow of electrons will take place correctly if the ET rate will overcome that one of recombination and trapping events which impede the charge separation produced by the absorption of light. Depending on the nature of the chromophore. ie. if the semiconductor itself or the chemisorbed dye-sensitizer. different energy levels will be involved in the cathodic ET process.

Water is one of the best choices. thus 100% aqueous electrolytes are proposed in this work. which are gelled with xanthan gum. This well-known biosourced polymer matrix is able to form stable and easily processable hydrogel electrolytes based on the iodide/triiodide redox couple. An experimental strategy. also supported by the multivariate chemometric approach. is used here to study the main factors influencing DSSCs efficiency and stability. leading to an optimized system able to improve its efficiency by 20% even after a 1200 h aging test. and reaching an overall performance superior to 2.7%. In-depth photoelectrochemical investigation demonstrates that DSSCs performance based on hydrogel electrolytes depends on many factors (eg. dipping conditions. redox mediator concentrations. etc.). that must be carefully quantified and correlated in order to optimize these hydrogels.

Nanotechnol,,201,,Mesoporous NiO films obtained via screen-printing deposition of a newly formulated paste containing preformed NiO-nanospheres have been employed as nanostructured photocathodes of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSCs). The novel aspect of this contribution is the utilization of a diluted solution of weak acid as anti-aggregating agent of NiO nanoparticles during the preparation of the screen-printing precursor. Screen printed NiO cathodes of p-DSCs displayed photoactivity in both bare and sensitized states with overall efficiencies not higher than 0.05% when erythrosine b (ERY) was the colorant and I3-/I-the redox mediator. The charge recombination resistance of NiO photocathodes in the illuminated p-DSCs diminished from 230 to 90 Ω with the increase of cell efficiency in going from the pristine oxide to its ERY sensitized version. In absence of a redox mediator. the NiO electrodes here considered displayed electroactivity due to the occurrence of solid state oxidation processes in the range 0.1-1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl. From the modelling of the electrochemical impedance data the total electrical resistance Rtot of screen printed NiO decreased drastically in passing from the pristine (1* 105-6* 105 Ω) to the oxidized state (20-150 Ω).

These compounds have recently found several applications in green chemistry methodologies and consequently require the highest purity standards. Yet. we found that malonic DES. differing from the other DESs that were prepared (containing short alkyl-chained dicarboxylic acids). is especially sensitive to thermal treatment and undergoes sizable decarboxylation beyond 60 °C. Such release of CO2 would become a serious limit in the potential process scale-up and prompt researchers to avoid heating during the preparation.

The dyes differ for the nature of the electron acceptor group which functionalizes the pyran core. Such a structural variation significantly influences the optical properties of the dyes so that the new pyrans overall cover most of the visible spectrum. In some cases. the p-DSCs employing these pyran-based dyes display power conversion efficiency significantly higher than the device sensitized with sensitizer benchmark P1. The relevant photo-electrochemical activity of one of the reported dyes combined with its ability to absorb the visible radiation in the lower energy portion (λ > 500 nm) makes it a promising candidate to be used in a tandem DSC (t-DSC) with the photoanode sensitized by a dye typically absorbing the higher energy zone of the visible spectrum (λ < 500 nm).,True,mLbkiUwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X18304079,14168869736050137832,/scholar?cites=14168869736050137832,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matteo_Bonomo4/publication/325114691_New_pyran-based_dyes_as_efficient_sensitizers_of_p-type_dye-sensitized_solar_cells/links/5af85ee5a6fdcc0c03287730/New-pyran-based-dyes-as-efficient-sensitizers-of-p-type-dye-sensitized-solar-cells.pdf,0,0,0

The dyes are constituted of a pyran core functionalized with different electron acceptor groups and with peripheral cyano-acrylic groups. The molecules were carefully characterized for what concerns optical and electrochemical properties and a clear dependence from the strength of the electron-acceptor group functionalizing the pyran core was observed. A detailed DFT analysis on the dyes gave a better insight of the electronic properties and showed a good accord with the experimental properties. The dyes were used as photosensitizers both in n-type and p-type DSSCs. In the first case. the stabilization of the LUMO achieved partially prevented a fast kinetics of the electron injection.

The obtained material was electrochemically treated and characterized with ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in order to gain information beneficial to the application of sensitized NiO as photocathodes of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (p-DSCs). In particular. EryB-sensitized NiO films underwent a series of electrochemical treatments in LiClO4/Acetonitrile (ACN) electrolyte devised so as to simulate possible conditions the electrode might encounter during operation in the photoelectrochemical cell. Upon potential-cycling in a range where the two NiO faradic events Ni(II) → Ni(III) and Ni(III) → Ni(IV) occur.

The efficiency of a p-type device (2.5%) is roughly one order of magnitude lower than the n-type counterparts (13.1%). thus limiting the overall efficiency of the tandem cell. especially in terms of powered current density. This is mainly due to the recombination reaction that occurs especially at the photocathode (or Indium-doped Tin Oxide (ITO))/electrolyte interface. To minimize this phenomenon. a widely employed strategy is to deposit a compact film of NiO (acting as a blocking electrode) beneath the porous electrode. Here. we propose electrodeposition as a cheap. easy scalable and environmental-friendly approach to deposit nanometric films directly on ITO glass. The results are compared to a blocking layer made by means of sol-gel technique. Cells embodying a blocking layer substantially outperformed the reference device. Among them. BL_1. 10V shows the best photoconversion efficiency (0.166%) and one of the highest values of fill factor (approaching 46%) ever reported. This is mainly due to an optimized surface roughness of the blocking layer assuring a good deposition of the porous layer. The effectiveness of the implementation of the blocking layer is further proved by means of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy.,True,mLbkiUwAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,8,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/1/167,12946334701064851400,/scholar?cites=12946334701064851400,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/1/167/pdf,0,0,0

In the role of counter electrode for p-DSCs. CoS was preferred over traditional platinized fluorine-doped indium oxide (Pt-FTO) due to the lower cost of the starting materials (Co salts) and the easier procedure of deposition onto large area substrates. The latter process was carried out via direct precipitation of CoS from aqueous solutions. The photoconversion efficiency (η) of the corresponding device was 0.07%. This value is about 35% less than the efficiency that is obtained with the analogous p-DSC employing the Pt-FTO anode (η= 0.11).

In the present study we intend to optimize the composition of the iodine-based electrolyte for p-DSCs employing variable concentrations of redox shuttle.

En realidad. son tan escasas las especies cristaliza-das en el sistema de los Andes de Chile. del Perú i de Bolivia. especial-mente entre los minerales metálicos que ofrecen algun interes particular al minero. que aun el naturalista mui pocas veces se ve precisado a va-lerse de los caractéres cristalográficos para reconocer una sustancia. A mas de esto. una descripcion completa de las formas cristalinas hubiera necesitado láminas prolijas. cuyo grabado. sobre presentar dificultades invencibles por falta de buenos artistas. habria ocasionado gastos dema-siado crecidos.En consecuencia de los nuevos descubrimientos hechos en la mineralojía. muchas especies minerales se hallan en este libro descritas de un modo enteramente distinto del que se observa en las mineralojías de Beu-dant.

Nacional,Es natural que cuando se trata de discurrir sobre aguas minerales se principie por averiguar qué es lo que se llama agua mi-neral i en qué se diferencia de las aguas ordinarias. Todos los hidrólogos que han escrito en esta materia buscan definiciones i cada cual las halla en su especialidad. Los fisiólogos i los médicos procuran dar a la definicion del agua mineral un carácter puramente terapéutico. los químicos insisten en la composicion del agua i sus elementos mineralizadores. los físicos i los jeólogos fijan principalmente su atencion en la temperatura i el orijen de estas aguas. Los mas convienen en la imposibilidad de definir lo que son las aguas minerales. Ahora bien. si en la definicion que se quiere dar no se hallare comprometida mas que la ciencia pura especulativa. seria talvez llevadero i permitido conformarnos con esta imposibilidad. Pero sabemos que esta cuestion es sumamente práctica i de grande interés. tanto para la hijiene i bien público. como para los empresarios. empeñados en la conservacion de los establecimientos de baños existentes i en la creacion de otros nuevos. Raro es el año en que no ocurran de várias partes de la República al laboratorio. los hacendados. los campesinos. con botellas de agua. exijendo que se les conteste llana i positivamente si las que traen son minerales. si son activas. i si son mejores que las que se conocen hasta ahora.,True,sFrgu4oAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,8,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YbNNkfIWb7kC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:doLo7X6pb14J:scholar.google.com&ots=ytToNSTITL&sig=nLDxiZ9lPj3kcyGWQ83RE05JMSw,6804843924602520182,/scholar?cites=6804843924602520182,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YbNNkfIWb7kC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:doLo7X6pb14J:scholar.google.com&ots=ytToNSTITL&sig=nLDxiZ9lPj3kcyGWQ83RE05JMSw,0,0,0

Our analysis revealed that the loading values of both molecules were higher for the MOFs containing unfunctionalized linkers. Confocal microscopy showed that all the materials were able to penetrate into cells. and the therapeutic effect of α-CHC on HeLa cells was enhanced when loaded (20 wt%) into the MOF with the longest linker.

1207454,The effect of surface functionalisation on cancer cells internalisation and selective cytotoxicity of zirconium metal organic frameworks,2018,Isabel Abánades Lázaro,,,,,,A considerable amount of effort has been directed to develop porous materials as drug delivery systems (DDSs) – one of the most promising emerging applications in healthcare. as most anticancer therapeutics have toxic dose dependence due to a lack of tumour selectivity – as their hierarchical porosity can be used to store and release challenging drugs.  Among them. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) – emerging hybrid. highly porous crystalline structures – offer several advantages compared to other available DDS. as they combine desirable features from both organic (biocompatibility. e.g. porous polymers) and inorganic (high loadings. e.g. mesoporous silica) porous materials. MOFs are highly amenable to functionalisation. meaning fine control over their physical properties can be achieved. and thus they have experienced tremendous development during the past decade in many applications. Despite surface engineering being advantageous for diverse fields – in biomedicine. it can both improve stability and dispersion. and provide the possibility of targeted carriers. decreasing the immune system recognition – surface functionalization of MOFs is underdeveloped. The multiple synthetic steps – synthesis. drug loading and surface modification – and the lack of orthogonality between them hinder their industrial manufacturing as DDSs.  This thesis focuses on the development of surface functionalisation protocols of Zirconium MOFs. particularly UiO-66. a Zr-terephthalate MOF. the study of their cell internalisation fate and routes and the correlation with their therapeutic activity.

Cytotoxic assays were subsequently conducted on bone marrow-derived preosteoclast cell line of human origin (FLG 29.1) and human colon cancer cells (HCT-116). A far greater cytotoxic activity was measured for compound 1 against HCT-116 cells compared to 2 and 3; conversely. all compounds were highly and similarly active against FLG 29.1 cells. Results obtained for the reaction of complexes 1 and 2 with RNase A documented the occurrence of a weak interaction with this model protein and the formation of a tiny amount of the corresponding adduct.

A currently advanced theory attributing almost the entire catalytic power of enzymes to electrostatic reorganization is shown to be superfluous when suitable interatomic interactions are present.

For all cases. the increase in the electric field have similar effects:(i) the stabilization of the potential energy.(ii) an increment of the equilibrium bond length and (iii) the transition from an homolytic dissociation mechanism to an heterolytic one when the bond is subjected under a strong enough field.

The six evaluated substrates were propachlor (A). alachlor (B). metolachlor (C). tioacetanilide (D). β-anilide (E). and methylene (F). Three possible mechanisms were considered:(a) bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S N 2) reaction mechanism.(b) oxygen assistance. and (c) nitrogen assistance. Mechanisms based on O-and N-assistance were discarded due to a very high activation barrier in comparison with the corresponding S N 2 mechanism. with the exception of compound F. The N-assistance mechanism for compound F had a free activation energy of 23.52 kcal/mol. which was close to the value for the corresponding S N 2 mechanism (23.94 kcal/mol). as these two mechanisms could occur in parallel reactions with almost 50% of each one. In compounds A to D. an important electron-withdrawing effect of the C= O and C= S groups was seen. and consequently. the activation free energies in these S N 2 reactions were smaller. with a value of approximately 18 kcal/mol.

The classical phosphine P(t-Bu)3 Lewis base in conjunction with two Lewis acids. B(C6F5)3 and Al(C6F5)3. were used as representative models of intermolecular FLPs. DFT calculations were performed using the dispersion corrected ωB97x-D functional. including toluene as a solvent through the PCM-SMD implicit solvent scheme. The results show that. in all cases. the activation barrier is larger for methane than for hydrogen. We conclude that the observed increase in the barrier for methane activation is due primarily to a larger distortion in methane compared to hydrogen to reach the transition state.

Due to the intensive use of praziquantel. there is increasing concern about the development of drug-resistant strains. Therefore. it is necessary to search for and investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. This work reports the in vivo effect of the alkaloid epiisopiloturine (EPI) against adults and juvenile worms of Schistosoma mansoni. EPI was first purified its thermal behavior and theoretical solubility parameters charaterised. In the experiment. mice were treated with EPI over the 21 days post-infection with the doses of 40 and 200 mg/kg. and 45 days post-infection with single doses of 40. 100 and 300 mg/kg. The treatment with EPI at 40 mg/kg was more effective in adult worms when compared with doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg. The treatment with 40 mg/kg in adult worms reduced parasite burden significantly. lead to reduction in hepatosplenomegaly. reduced the egg burden in faeces. and decreased granuloma diameter. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes to the parasite tegument after treatment. including the loss of important features. Additionally. the in vivo treatment against juvenile with 40 mg/kg showed a reduction of the total worm burden of 50.2%. Histopathological studies were performed on liver. spleen. lung. kidney and brain and EPI was shown to have a DL50 of 8000 mg/kg. Therefore EPI shows potential to be used in schistosomiasis treatment.

Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans. S. mansoni is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug. praziquantel (PZQ). despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study. we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult S. mansoni resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (P < 0.001). as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult S. mansoni. oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile S. mansoni. In addition. we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no in vitro cytotoxicity (in HaCaT. and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed in silico analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this. we investigated systemic acute toxicity in vivo by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice.

Since treatment for this disease relies only on the use of praziquantel. there is an urgent need to identify new antischistosomal drugs. Piplartine is an amide alkaloid found in several Piper species (Piperaceae) that exhibits antischistosomal properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure–function relationship between piplartine and its five synthetic analogues (19A. 1G. 1M. 14B and 6B) against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. as well as its cytotoxicity to mammalian cells using murine fibroblast (NIH-3T3) and BALB/cN macrophage (J774A. 1) cell lines. In addition. density functional theory calculations and in silico analysis were used to predict physicochemical and toxicity parameters. Bioassays revealed that piplartine is active against S. mansoni at low concentrations (5–10 µM). but its analogues did not. In contrast. based on 3-(4. 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2. 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry assays. piplartine exhibited toxicity in mammalian cells at 785 µM. while its analogues 19A and 6B did not reduce cell viability at the same concentrations. This study demonstrated that piplartine analogues showed less activity against S. mansoni but presented lower toxicity than piplartine.

Amplitude-time. amplitude-frequency. and amplitude-frequency-time spectra are all produced with the method and compared to equivalent results obtained using wavelet analysis. The wavelet and HHT analysis yield qualitatively similar results. but the HHT provides a better match to physical intuition than the wavelet transform.

1207536,Dynamic service provisioning using GRIA SLAs,2007,Mike Boniface and Stephen C Phillips and Alfonso Sanchez-Macian and Mike Surridge,,,,56-67,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Service Level Agreements (SLA) include quality of service (QoS) constraints and bounds that have to be honoured by the service provider. To maximise the Service Provider revenue while satisfying the QoS requirements of the agreed SLAs it is important to be able to perform a dynamic distribution of the service provider resources between the services and SLAs. This distribution should be based on the current status and predicted evolution of the QoS characteristics. This paper describes the experiences managing SLA obligations from a service provider perspective in a scenario where dynamic deployment of services can be undertaken. The main issues faced to deal with the management of SLAs in this context are detailed.

Hammond,15,Journal of Surfactants and detergents,2,157-165,Springer,The hydrophobicity of alkyl‐polypropylene oxide sulfate surfactants was evaluated via their characteristic curvature (Cc) using the hydrophilic‐lipophilic difference (HLD) framework. A close examination of the relationship between the molecular structure of the surfactants considered (structure of the alkyl group and the number of propylene oxide groups in each surfactant) and their Cc led to a group contribution model that. for the first time. takes into consideration the geometry of the alkyl tail group. Based on this group contribution model. branching at the C2 (beta‐carbon) position of the alkyl group produces the largest increase in characteristic curvature. This observation is consistent with the notion that the Cc is associated with the packing factor for anionic surfactants. Branching at the C2 position tends to produce cylindrical or inverse cone shape packing. typical of more hydrophobic (positive Cc) surfactants …,True,nUi212cAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,47,https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11743-011-1303-2,14373660284506104243,/scholar?cites=14373660284506104243,,,0,0,0
1207574,The HLD-NAC Model for Extended Surfactant Microemulsions,2012,Charles E. Hammond Edgar J. Acosta and Sumit K. Kiran,15,Journal Surfactants and Detergents,4,495-504,Springer,It has been confirmed that the structure of the alkyl group of an extended surfactant plays an important role in defining its interfacial properties. Alkyl groups containing a higher degree of β‐branching (C2‐branching) produce microemulsions with a larger characteristic length (ξ. the extent of solubilization in middle phases). This effect is explained on the basis that β‐branching increases the hydrophobicity of the surfactant and decreases the optimal salinity of the microemulsion. Higher salinities produce a dehydration of the surfactant groups that lead to shorter extent of the interactions with the oil and the water. Larger characteristic lengths are desirable if the objective of the formulation is obtaining greater solubilization of oil and water. and lower interfacial tensions. Large characteristic lengths are. in most cases. associated with high interfacial rigidities. which are undesirable if rapid coalescence is required …,True,nUi212cAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,35,https://aocs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s11743-012-1343-2,6062640949795970803,/scholar?cites=6062640949795970803,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46021494/s11743-012-1343-220160528-25215-ntcir5.pdf,0,0,0

The clay was incorporated to the polymer at a content ratio of 5 wt. %. The film samples were prepared by melt compounding using cast extrusion process. The study showed that accelerated photo-oxidation induced changes in the chemical structure of both PA11 and PA11 nanocomposite resulting in the formation of imides and carboxylic acids as the main carbonyl products. Furthermore. the carbonyl index increased linearly in the first 360 h of exposure indicating a fast oxidation process before decreasing.

This process involved solid-solid thermochemical treatment of tailings with ammonium sulphate (stage one). followed by an optimised acid dissolution step (stage two). The inclusion of a control experiment for the optimal dissolution procedure was however overlooked. The new set of data delivered by the control experiment reveals that (i) most of the silicon and calcium are extracted via the acid leaching step. (ii) aluminium and magnesium are extracted at each stage of the process. and (iii) the thermochemical step is the main contributor to chromium and iron extraction.

In the 1930s. Staudinger observed mechanical degradation of polymers. and Melville later discovered that polymer chain scission caused the degradation.

By quantifying the anthracene-containing cleaved PMA polymers. which are generated via retro-[4 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. the first-order kinetic coefficient was determined. Activation characteristics of mechanophores anchored to a nanoparticle exhibit behavior similar to mechanophore-linked polymers. e.g.. threshold molecular weight and linear increase in rate coefficient with molecular weight above the threshold.

The films demonstrate moderate capacitances of 78.6 F g-1 in the positive region and 73.1 F g-1 in the negative region at 0.5 A g-1. as well as excellent rate capabilities in positive and negative charge storage regions of 87% and 56% at 20 A g-1. respectively. The polymer film was applied as both electrodes in a symmetric type III supercapacitor device with a gel polymer electrolyte. demonstrating a wide operating potential range of 2.2 V.

Inc.,Organic electrodes are attractive candidates for electrochemical energy storage devices because they are lightweight. inexpensive and environmentally friendly. In recent years. many researchers have focused on the development of carbonyl‐containing materials for organic electrodes. These materials demonstrate promising results as the next generation of rechargeable batteries owing to their fast redox kinetics and structural diversity in design. However. these electrodes still exhibit intrinsic drawbacks such as solubility in battery electrolytes and low electrical conductivity. This review provides recent examples of organic carbonyl‐containing electrodes that highlight strategies to overcome these inherent limitations. and pave the way to develop an organic rechargeable battery that has high‐energy density and long cycle life.      ,True,19mIcwYAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eom2.12055,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/eom2.12055,0,0,0

Ab initio calculations are performed to rationalize the observed magnetic behavior and to understand the effect that the ligand and coordination geometry around the Dy III ion has on the single-molecule magnet (SMM) behavior. In recent years. seven coordinate Dy III complexes possessing pseudo~ D 5h symmetry are found to yield attractive blocking temperatures for the development of new SMM complexes. However. here we show that the strength of the donor ligand plays a critical role in determining the effective energy barrier and is not simply dependent on the geometry and the symmetry around the Dy III ion. Seven coordinate molecules possessing pseudo D 5h symmetry with strong equatorial ligation and weak axial ligation are found to be inferior. exhibiting no SMM characteristics under zero-field conditions.

Most new academic material is digitally formatted upon its creation and is thus easy to find and query. However. there remains a good deal of material from times prior to the “information age” that has yet to be converted to digital form. Much of this material can be found in library collections—whether academic. public or private—and thus remains available only to a limited number of locals or willing-and-able sojourners. Using OCR technology. most typeset documents can be digitized and made available online; and there are several projects underway to do exactly this. However. there remains little to be done for handwritten materials. Those who own collections of handwritten documents are increasingly wanting to make the content thereof available to the general public.

1207678,Determination of Abraham model solute descriptors for the monomeric and dimeric forms of trans-cinnamic acid using measured solubilities from the Open Notebook Science Challenge,2015,Jean-Claude Bradley and Michael H Abraham and William E Acree and Andrew SID Lang and Samantha N Beck and David A Bulger and Elizabeth A Clark and Lacey N Condron and Stephanie T Costa and Evan M Curtin and Sozit B Kurtu and Mark I Mangir and Matthew J McBride,9,Chemistry Central Journal,1,1-6,BioMed Central,Calculating Abraham descriptors from solubility values requires that the solute have the same form when dissolved in all solvents. However. carboxylic acids can form dimers when dissolved in non-polar solvents. For such compounds Abraham descriptors can be calculated for both the monomeric and dimeric forms by treating the polar and non-polar systems separately. We illustrate the method of how this can be done by calculating the Abraham descriptors for both the monomeric and dimeric forms of trans-cinnamic acid. the first time that descriptors for a carboxylic acid dimer have been obtained. Abraham descriptors were calculated for the monomeric form of trans-cinnamic acid using experimental solubility measurements in polar solvents from the Open Notebook Science Challenge together with a number of water-solvent partition coefficients from the literature. Similarly. experimental solubility measurements in non-polar solvents were used to determine Abraham descriptors for the trans-cinnamic acid dimer. Abraham descriptors were calculated for both the monomeric and dimeric forms of trans-cinnamic acid. This allows for the prediction of further solubilities of trans-cinnamic acid in both polar and non-polar solvents with an error of about 0.10 log units.,True,poMzPNwAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,20,https://bmcchem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13065-015-0080-9,7708215118956782655,/scholar?cites=7708215118956782655,,https://bmcchem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13065-015-0080-9,0,0,0

Current models are linear in nature and often require foreknowledge of either melting point or aqueous solubility. Here we extend the range of applicability of 1-octanol solubility models by creating a random forest model that can predict 1-octanol solubilities directly from structure.

Considering previous reports of bifunctional Kunitz-type proteins from anemones. we also studied the effect of r ShPI-1A on voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. r ShPI-1A binds Kv1. 1. Kv1. 2. and Kv1. 6 channels with IC 50 values in the nM range. Hence. ShPI-1 is the first member of the sea anemone type 2 potassium channel toxins family with tight-binding potency against several proteases and different Kv1 channels. In depth sequence analysis and structural comparison of ShPI-1 with similar protease inhibitors and Kv channel toxins showed apparent non-sequence conservation for known key residues. However. we detected two subtle patterns of coordinated amino acid substitutions flanking the conserved cysteine residues at the N-and C-terminal ends.

Iran,Allergic asthma is the most common acute inflammatory airway disorder and their incidence population has exploded in the last years. being estimated that over 300 million people worldwide have the condition. Here. we present a brief overview of relationship of allergic asthma with diet and food intake. Several studies have shown that most asthma cases are due to an allergic immune response to environmental allergens. Diet affects strongly the development of asthma because the systemic inflammatory mediators are affected by a high fat diet and obesity. Thus. obesity has effect on airway function and trigger inflammation pathways. There are also strong associations between asthma and dietary antioxidants. such as vitamins. and they may protect the respiratory system from inflammation and allergic reactions. An increased prevalence of food allergy has been also observed in the last years and this problem could be a major risk factor for severe asthma. According to the findings of many researchers. specific diets could help controlling asthma. therefore therapeutic strategies for allergic asthma suggest the modification of diet. which could include antioxidantrich foods. the avoidance of allergic food. low saturated fat intake and maintenance of weight in the healthy range.,True,q6i9Sd4AAAAJ:QUX0mv85b1cC,5,http://jfqhc.ssu.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=105&sid=1&slc_lang=fa,18215911254431038629,/scholar?cites=18215911254431038629,,http://jfqhc.ssu.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_f703af/admin-A-10-1-49-ab7de46.pdf,0,0,0

1207714,Polar Desolvation and Position 226 of Pancreatic and Neutrophil Elastases Are Crucial to their Affinity for the Kunitz-Type Inhibitors ShPI-1 and ShPI-1/K13L,2015,Jorge Enrique Hernández González and Rossana García-Fernández and Pedro Alberto Valiente,10,PLOS ONE,9,e0137787,Public Library of Science,The Kunitz-type protease inhibitor ShPI-1 inhibits human neutrophil elastase (HNE. Ki = 2.35·10−8 M) but does not interact with the porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE); whereas its P1 site variant. ShPI-1/K13L. inhibits both HNE and PPE (Ki = 1.3·10−9 M. and Ki = 1.2·10−8 M. respectively). By employing a combination of molecular modeling tools. e.g.. structural alignment. molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics Generalized-Born/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area free energy calculations. we showed that D226 of HNE plays a critical role in the interaction of this enzyme with ShPI-1 through the formation of a strong salt bridge and hydrogen bonds with K13 at the inhibitor’s P1 site. which compensate the unfavorable polar-desolvation penalty of the latter residue. Conversely. T226 of PPE is unable to establish strong interactions with K13. thereby precluding the insertion of K13 side-chain into the S1 subsite of this enzyme. An alternative conformation of K13 site-chain placed at the entrance of the S1 subsite of PPE. similar to that observed in the crystal structure of ShPI-1 in complex with chymotrypsin (PDB: 3T62). is also unfavorable due to the lack of stabilizing pair-wise interactions. In addition. our results suggest that the higher affinity of ShPI-1/K13L for both elastases mainly arises from the lower polar-desolvation penalty of L13 compared to that of K13. and not from stronger pair-wise interactions of the former residue with those of each enzyme. These results provide insights into the PPE and HNE inhibition and may contribute to the design of more potent and/or specific inhibitors toward one of these proteases.,True,q6i9Sd4AAAAJ:SnGPuo6Feq8C,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137787,11832093195132858039,/scholar?cites=11832093195132858039,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137787,0,0,0

Las proteasas también son cruciales en la propagación de diferentes enfermedades. al encontrarse involucradas en los mecanismos de replicación e infectividad de muchos patógenos al hombre. plantas y animales. por lo cual los inhibidores de estas proteasas han emergido con utilidades terapéuticas efectivas (Hugli. 1996; Leung,True,q6i9Sd4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rossana_Garcia-Fernandez/publication/233660815_INHIBIDORES_DE_PROTEASAS_NO_PROTEICOS_AISLADOS_DE_ORGANISMOS_MARINOS/links/0912f50abe41569dea000000.pdf,1821321712821682984,/scholar?cites=1821321712821682984,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rossana_Garcia-Fernandez/publication/233660815_INHIBIDORES_DE_PROTEASAS_NO_PROTEICOS_AISLADOS_DE_ORGANISMOS_MARINOS/links/0912f50abe41569dea000000.pdf,0,0,0

On the basis of this phenomenon. kinetically inert Pt(II)-linked coordination rings and cages are formed in high yields from their components by obtaining a kinetically distributed mixture and subsequently equilibrating the mixture into the thermodynamically stable structures upon temporary photolabilization. This method is applicable when the pyridine rings in the ligands are not conjugated with other aromatic rings. in good agreement with DFT calculations that indicate the dependency of the photolability on the π-conjugation of the ligand frameworks.

However. ultramacrocyclization [4] with n> 100 has scarcely been described because the entropy cost is too high in bringing the ends of a long acyclic compound together for cyclization to proceed (Figure 1a). However. if the reaction sites are sufficiently large. the probability of the association of the both ends prior to cyclization should significantly increase and ultramacrocyclization should proceed efficiently.

We now report quantum mechanical/molecular mechenical calculations that examine the energetics of C–C bond cleavage for a pyruvate molecule bound within the putative active site of FrsA. These calculations suggest that the barrier to C–C bond cleavage in the bound substrate is 28 kcal/mol. which is similar to that estimated for the uncatalyzed decarboxylation of pyruvate in water at 25 °C. In agreement with the theoretical predictions. no pyruvate decarboxylase activity was detected for recombinant FrsA protein that could be crystallized and structurally characterized.

1207782,A mechanochemical switch to control radical intermediates,2014,Elizabeth Brunk and Whitney F Kellett and Nigel GJ Richards and Ursula Rothlisberger,53,Biochemistry,23,3830-3838,American Chemical Society,B12-dependent enzymes employ radical species with exceptional prowess to catalyze some of the most chemically challenging. thermodynamically unfavorable reactions. However. dealing with highly reactive intermediates is an extremely demanding task. requiring sophisticated control strategies to prevent unwanted side reactions. Using hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations. we follow the full catalytic cycle of an AdoB12-dependent enzyme and present the details of a mechanism that utilizes a highly effective mechanochemical switch. When the switch is “off”. the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical moiety is stabilized by releasing the internal strain of an enzyme-imposed conformation. Turning the switch “on.” the enzyme environment becomes the driving force to impose a distinct conformation of the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical to avoid deleterious radical transfer.

Using tissue baths and isometric smooth muscle tension recordings. we examined the contribution of BK channels in the neurogenic contractions of DSM strips isolated from rats and Guinea pigs. Neurogenic contractions were induced by increasing electrical field stimulation (EFS) frequencies (0.5-50 Hz) under stimuli with constant amplitude (20 V). pulse width (0.75 ms). and duration (3 s). These EFS-induced contractions were abolished by the Na+ channel inhibitor. tetrodotoxin (1∈ 1/4M). indicating their neurogenic origin.

Metalloenzymes. which contain a metal cofactor. are particularly adept at propagating these reactions. This thesis focuses on several metalloenzymes; each an example of a different unique reaction control strategy. Both experimental and computational methodologies have been employed in order to identify specific residues or features which contribute to each enzyme's ability to control the reaction. Emphasis is made on special properties of the metal Manganese. Controlling residues include not only first shell or active site residues. but also residues more distant from the active-site. Further. manipulation of such residues can be used to alter reactivity at"" non""-active-sites. or to alter the apparent electrostatics of the protein (in the case of substitution of hydrogen with fluorine). Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and other forms of magnetic spectroscopy can be used to evaluate subtle differences imposed by substitution for controlling residues to a metal center. which gives further insight into the electronic contributions of given residues. as well as the electronic properties of metal cofactors. In summary. the catalysis by Mn-dependent and other metal-dependent metalloenzymes can be investigated through multiple kinetic and spectroscopic avenues. unveiling suprising and novel themes in enzymatic catalysis. such as mechano-chemical switches and super long-distance metallo-interactions.",True,8qiQqKMAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,0,https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/open_access_dissertations/304/,,,,https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1377&context=open_access_dissertations,0,0,0

Polymers prepared by the polymeriza tion of bronostyrene do not have undesirable side chain halogenation. and are preferred for their relatively greater thermal stability. Not only do the two methods of preparing bromi nated polystyrenes provide different end products. there are also numerous disadvantages inherent to the bromination of polystyrene approach.

In thin cells these systems display strong iridescence originating from hexagonally arranged columns that are predominantly aligned perpendicularly to the cell walls. Small angle X-ray scattering and polarization microscopy indicate the presence of orientational fluctuations in the hexagonal columnar liquid crystal phase. The presence of decoupling of the average platelet orientation and the column axis as well as column undulations leading to a decrease of the effective column diameter are discussed.

Real-time monitoring of particle size during bottom-up synthesis in liquids would allow a detailed study of particle nucleation and growth. which provides valuable insights in the mechanism of formation of the nanoparticles. Furthermore. it facilitates a rational scale-up. and would enable adequate intervention in the production process of nanoparticle dispersions to minimize the number of off-spec batches. Since real-time monitoring requires particle size measurements on dispersions in flow. conventional dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques are not suited: they rely on single scattering and measure the Brownian motion of particles dispersed in a liquid. Here. we present a set-up that allows accurate measurements in real-time on flowing dispersions using a DLS technique based on modulated 3D cross-correlation. This technique uses two simultaneous light scattering experiments performed at the same scattering vector on the same sample volume in order to extract only the single scattering information common to both. We connected the reactor to a flow-cell in the DLS equipment using a tailor-made analysis loop. and successfully demonstrated the complete set-up through monitoring of the size of spherical silica nanoparticles during Stöber synthesis in a water-alcohol mixture starting from the molecular precursor tetraethyl orthosilicate.

We report on the sol-gel. sol-glass and liquid crystal phase transitions of positively charged colloidal gibbsite platelets in water over a wide range of particle concentrations and salt concentrations. The natures of the kinetically-arrested states which enclose the sol region in this system are analyzed. We demonstrate that the hexagonal columnar liquid crystal phase of charged silica coated gibbsite particles can easily be formed by centrifugation. In situ growth of silica can stabilize and fixate the liquid crystal structures such that synthetic opals of gibbsite in silica were produced. Part of the thesis is devoted to systems of sterically stabilized gibbsite platelets. We show that platelets with an average diameter larger than 0.5 micrometer do form strongly iridescent hexagonal columnar phases in tetralin within hours. while particles of the same size in water do not crystallize at all. The undulations of the columns and bending of the particle director in these liquid crystals are studied. Furthermore. we describe the formation of ordered nanostructures of colloidal gibbsite platelets in bulk polymer.

Herein. we use 4-cyanoindole and cyclopentanone as models to show that. when a fundamental CO or CN stretching mode is involved in Fermi resonance. the underlying vibrational coupling constant (W) is a convenient reporter of the hydrogen-bonding status of the corresponding carbonyl or nitrile group. Specifically. we find that for both groups a W value of 7.7 cm−1 or greater is indicative of their involvement in hydrogen-bonding interactions. Furthermore. we find that. as observed in similar studies. the Fermi resonance coupling leads to quantum beats in the …,True,3NPt4ccAAAAJ:owLR8QvbtFgC,21,https://pubs.rsc.org/--/content/articlehtml/2017/cp/c7cp02442h,13609606807884810544,/scholar?cites=13609606807884810544,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5538721/,0,0,0

Although this effect can be generally attributed to ion-induced changes in forces that govern protein folding. delineating the underlying mechanism of action still remains challenging because it requires assessment of all relevant interactions. such as ion–protein. ion–water. and ion–ion interactions. Herein. we use two unnatural aromatic amino acids and several spectroscopic techniques to examine whether guanidinium chloride. one of the most commonly used protein denaturants. and tetrapropylammonium chloride can specifically interact with aromatic side chains. Our results show that tetrapropylammonium. but not guanidinium. can preferentially accumulate around aromatic residues and that tetrapropylammonium undergoes a transition at ∼1.3 M to form aggregates.

We find that this mutant peptide exhibits significantly different aggregation behavior than the wild-type peptide: (1) it forms fibrils with a much faster rate. (2) its fibrils lack the long-range helical twists observed in TTR105–115 fibrils. (3) its fibrils exhibit a giant far-UV circular dichroism signal. and (4) its fibrils give rise to an unusual amide I′ band consisting of four distinct and sharp peaks.

1207888,Studying Orientation and Conformation of a-helical Peptides at Interfaces.,2014,Bei Ding,,,,,,Membrane associated peptides and proteins with unique biological functions have drawn extensive attention due to their enormous therapeutic potential. Being an intrinsic surface-sensitive technique. Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) Spectroscopy has the capability to elucidate both structural and orientational information at biointerfaces. e.g.. cell membranes. However. there are significant experimental and theoretical challenges in adapting this application from simple model peptides to more complex systems associated with cell membranes. My Ph.D. research started with elucidating structure and orientations of a simple linear helical peptide. Pep-1. By comparing its performance on gel-phase and liquid-phase lipid bilayers. we have elucidated the orientation information of Pep-1 at different concentrations and unveil the importance of lipid viscosity from a molecular level (Chapter 2). Unlike the linear peptide Pep-1. LL-37 is a bent α-helix and shows different structures on different kinds of lipids. We developed SFG orientation analysis methodology to address the bent issue. We then applied this methodology to more complex systems with mixed lipids and cholesterols to better approximate actual cells and discovered a “three-stage” interaction process in the presence of negative charged lipids (Chapter 3). We then studied the peptide GRK52-31. the active site of the GRK5 N-terminus together with its two truncated peptides.

1207908,NMR of organomagnesium compounds,2007,Peter J Heard,,,,,Glyndŵr University Research Online,Since their discovery. the exact solution composition of Grignard compounds has been the subject of considerable debate. and given the power of NMR in elucidating chemical structure it is unsurprising that it was applied to the study of Grignard and other organomagnesium compounds from its earliest days. However. the complex nature of the solution behaviour of such compounds and the low magnetic field strengths then available often frustrated proper analysis of the data. and the first reported NMR studies were generally inconclusive. Worse. the interpretation of early NMR spectra was often based on preconceived (and as it is now realized incorrect) notions as to the nature of the compounds in solution. so caution must be exercised when considering much of the pre-1970’s data.
