1129566,Phthalate esters in foods: sources. occurrence. and analytical methods,2010,Xu‐Liang Cao,9,,1,21-43,Blackwell Publishing Inc, Phthalates are a group of diesters of ortho‐phthalic acid (dialkyl or alkyl aryl esters of 1.2‐benzenedicarboxylic acid). Higher‐molecular‐weight phthalates. such as di‐2‐ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). are primarily used as plasticizers to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products. while the lower‐molecular‐weight phthalates. such as diethyl phthalate (DEP). di‐n‐butyl phthalate (DBP). and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP). are widely used as solvents to hold color and scent in various consumer and personal care products. Phthalates have become ubiquitous environmental contaminants due to volatilization and leaching from their widespread applications. and thus contamination of the environment has become another important source for phthalates in foods in addition to migration from packaging materials. Human exposure to phthalates has been an increased concern due to the findings from toxicology studies in …,True,eT0STx8AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,335,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2009.00093.x,8694470017163159710,/scholar?cites=8694470017163159710,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2009.00093.x,0,0,0

Theoretical equations describing the operation of various types of passive samplers are summarized. The problems associated with the application of passive samplers for the sampling of organic vapours in indoor and ambient air. and the factors affecting the performance of passive samplers are discussed. It is suggested the effective cross‐sectional area be employed in calculating the diffusion uptake rate according to DA/L instead of the total cross‐sectional area. It is further suggested that suitable passive samplers with a higher uptake rate should be designed (e.g. by reducing the diffusion length). and a new and simple validation procedure should be developed for their application in indoor and ambient air environments.,True,eT0STx8AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,49,https://iahr.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09593339109385104,8361228096886008335,/scholar?cites=8361228096886008335,,,0,0,0

A major problem to overcome in drug design is the ability of the compound in question to cross the BBB. Neuroactive drugs are required to cross the BBB to function. Conversely. drugs that target other parts of the body ideally should not cross the BBB to avoid possible psychotropic side effects. Thus. the task of predicting the BBB permeability of new compounds is of great importance. Two gold-standard experimental measures of BBB permeability are logBB (the concentration of drug in the brain divided by concentration in the blood) and logPS (permeability surface-area product).

Thus. reliable in silico screening of drug candidates for possible ADRs would be advantageous. In this work. we introduce a computational approach that predicts ADRs by combining the results of molecular docking and leverages known ADR information from DrugBank and SIDER. We employed a recently parallelized version of AutoDock Vina (VinaLC) to dock 906 small molecule drugs to a virtual panel of 409 DrugBank protein targets. L1-regularized logistic regression models were trained on the resulting docking scores of a 560 compound subset from the initial 906 compounds to predict 85 side effects. grouped into 10 ADR phenotype groups. Only 21% (87 out of 409) of the drug-protein binding features involve known targets of the drug subset. providing a significant probe of off-target effects. As a control. associations of this drug subset with the 555 annotated targets of these compounds. as reported in DrugBank. were used as features to train a separate group of models. The Vina off-target models and the DrugBank on-target models yielded comparable median area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curves (AUCs) during 10-fold cross-validation (0.60–0.69 and 0.61–0.74. respectively).

1129622,Effect of Cr203 in the varistor behaviour of Ti02,1996,PR Bueno and E Camargo and E Longo and E Leite and JA Varela,15,Journal of materials science letters,,2048-20S0,,"Commercial varistors used in protection systems are based on silicon carbide or on zinc oxide. Varistors based on SiC have low non-linearity coefficients (a= 5). where a is the non-linearity constant defined by the relation 1= KVa where I is the current. V is the voltage and K is a proportionality constant [I].The lnO based varistors present very high nonlinearity coefficients(a= 50) and have lnO as the major phase and small amounts of Bi203. Sb203. CoO. Mn02 and Cr203[2]. Reaction at high temperatures between lnO and additives leads to the formation of severa I phases on the grain boundary of lnO[3. 4]. So. despite its chemical composition. the type of processing employed. as well as the sintering temperature and heating and cooling rates. are fundamental for the control of the material's microstructure[5]. Other varistor systems have been described in the literature based on SrTi03 [6] and. more recently. Sn02 varistors [7. 8] doped with CoO. Nb20S and Cr203. The addition of CoO to Sn02 leads to high densification that makes it possible to obtain varistors of this system. A high non-linearity coefficient of a~ 41 was obtained in the Sn02· CoO· b20S system when Cr203 was added. In our recent study. segregation of a secondary phase was not observed in the Sn02 varistor systems and a potential barrier was possibly formed with the presence of O'and O"" at lhe grain boundary interface due to the creation of defects. such as Crsll. that donate electrons to oxygen [9].

The aim was prospectively to collect worldwide mortality data following emergency abdominal surgery. comparing findings across countries with a low. middle or high Human Development Index (HDI).Methods: This was a prospective. multicentre. cohort study. Self-selected hospitals performing emergency surgery submitted prespecified data for consecutive patients from at least one 2-week interval during July to December 2014. Postoperative mortality was analysed by hierarchical multivariable logistic regression.Results: Data were obtained for 10 745 patients from 357 centres in 58 countries; 6538 were from high-. 2889 from middle-and 1318 from low-HDI settings. The overall mortality rate was 1⋅ 6 per cent at 24 h (high 1⋅ 1 per cent. middle 1⋅ 9 per cent. low 3⋅ 4 per cent; P< 0⋅ 001). increasing to 5⋅ 4 per cent by 30 days (high 4⋅ 5 per cent. middle 6⋅ 0 per cent. low 8⋅ 6 per cent; P< 0⋅ 001). Of the 578 patients who died. 404 (69⋅ 9 per cent) did so between 24 h and 30 days following surgery (high 74⋅ 2 per cent. middle 68⋅ 8 per cent. low 60⋅ 5 per cent).

By keeping cysteine levels within a narrow range and by regulating the synthesis of glutathione. which serves as a reservoir of cysteine. the liver addresses both the need to have adequate cysteine to support normal metabolism and the need to keep cysteine levels below the threshold of toxicity. Cysteine catabolism is tightly regulated via regulation of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) levels in the liver. with the turnover of CDO protein being dramatically decreased when intracellular cysteine levels increase. This occurs in response to changes in the intracellular cysteine concentration via changes in the rate of CDO ubiquitination and degradation.

Boston. MA,During the 1960s. Cavallini and coworkers demonstrated the presence of a protein with cysteamine dioxygenase activity in animal tissues and proposed that this enzyme was important in the conversion of cysteamine to hypotaurine (Cavallini et al.. 1963. 1966). Based on the earlier demonstration that cysteamine was a component of coenzyme A (Baddiley et al.. 1953; Novelli et al.. 1954) as well as their own work. they proposed a coenzyme A-cysteamine pathway for taurine production. As shown in Fig. 1. coenzyme A is synthesized using cysteine. but the cysteinyl moiety is subsequently decarboxylated to produce the cysteamine moiety of coenzyme A. Coenzyme A turnover results in production of pantetheine. and pantetheine is hydrolyzed by pantetheinase to yield cysteamine and pantothenic acid. The released cysteamine is oxidized to hypotaurine and then further oxidized to taurine by an unknown …,True,oCiyEVEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,51,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-33504-9_3.pdf,13927577851545252310,/scholar?cites=13927577851545252310,,,0,0,0

It was observed that the apparent diffusion coefficients vary with crystal size. confirming the existence of a surface resistance. Considering that surface and the intracrystalline characteristic diffusion times are additives. it was possible to dissociate the two resistances.Surface mass transfer coefficient was found to be in the same order of magnitude for the different samples and activated with temperature. The contribution of surface resistance to mass transfer limitation is lower at high temperatures and for the bigger crystals. Surface resistance is far from being negligible for the smaller crystals: for crystals of 2 μm. surface resistance represents more than 60% of the total mass transfer resistance at 398 K.

The spinel structure has two cation sites; one of octahedral symmetry and the other of tetrahedral symmetry. The energetics show that Si favors the octahedral sites. while Ge favors the tetrahedral sites. Statistical calculations show that Si 3 N 4− Ge 3 N 4 forms solid solution/alloys of (Si x Ge 1− x) 3 N 4 at high temperatures. but miscibility gaps in alloy composition appear at lower temperature. The calculated stable/metastable boundary lines at ambient pressure are discussed.

A computational challenge is that at least half of the eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors are desired in practice. We establish the equivalence between Bethe–Salpeter eigenvalue problems and real Hamiltonian eigenvalue problems. Based on theoretical analysis. structure preserving algorithms for a class of Bethe–Salpeter eigenvalue problems are proposed.

A major source of water pollution originates from high temperature industrial processes such as fossil fuel combustion and solid waste incineration. This waste typically contains high levels of oxyanion/cation forming elements which are particularly hazardous due to their inherent solubility in water and their resulting bioavailability. One approach for oxyanion/cation removal from water involves using an adsorbing medium to soak up and remove pollutants. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer an interesting platform for water remediation. MOFs are structurally diverse. porous materials that are constructed from metal nodes bridged by organic ligands.

The use of neural networks as a variable selection tool is shown and the advantage of networks as a nonlinear data modelling device is discussed.

In this study a set of QM properties derived from frontier electron theory have been used to produce a predictive model of the dissociation constants of phenols. benzoic acids and aliphatic carboxylic acids. The pKa values and structures of nearly 500 compounds were extracted from the Physprop database for this purpose. Multiple linear regression was used to search for relationships between pKa and the calculated QM properties. In most cases only a single independent variable. electrophilic superdelocalisability. was needed to produce a good model of pKa.

As discussed in this paper. formation of mesocrystals can result from a topochemical reaction between single crystal particles or templates suspended in a liquid phase and ionic/molecular species in solution. In such a case. the initial particle morphology is retained in the final mesocrystal. If the transformation is not topotactic. the final product will maintain no memory of the precursor morphology. The magnitude of the lattice mismatch as well as the defective state of the precursor surface probably determine the degree of mutual crystallographic alignment of the nanocrystals which nucleate and grow on the substrate.

A progressive reduction of thermal conductivity κ with decreasing grain size was observed. At room temperature. κ of the ceramic with grain size of 24 nm (1.2 W m−1 K−1) is one order of magnitude lower than that of undoped single crystals. The strong suppression of κ can be ascribed to (i) the high concentration of lattice defects. (ii) the increasing contribution of grain boundaries to phonon scattering when the grain size is decreased to the nanoscale and (iii) a moderate amount (10–15 vol.%) of nanopores.

However. DNP SENS usually requires the use of radicals as an exogenous source of polarization. which has so far limited applications for organometallic surface species to those that do not react with the radicals. Here we show that reactive surface species can be studied if they are immobilized inside porous materials with suitably small windows. and if bulky nitroxide bi-radicals (here TEKPol) are used as the polarization source and which cannot enter the pores.

In plants. electrophilic herbicides are conjugated to the thiol group of GSH. and heavy metal ions form complexes as thiolates with GSH‐derived phytochelatins (PCs). In both detoxification processes of plants. phytochelatin synthase (PCS) emerges as a key player. The enzyme is activated by heavy metal ions and catalyzes PC formation from GSH by transferring glutamylcysteinyl residues (γ‐EC) onto GSH. In this study with Arabidopsis. we show that PCS plays a role in the plant‐specific catabolism of glutathione conjugates (GS‐conjugates).

Plants have evolved multiple α (TSA) and β (TSB) homologs. which have probably diverged in biological function and their ability of subunit interaction. There is some evidence for a tryptophan synthase (TS) complex in Arabidopsis. On the other hand maize (Zea mays) expresses the TSA-homologs BX1 and IGL that efficiently cleave IGP. independent of interaction with TSB. In order to clarify. how tryptophan is synthesized in maize. two TSA homologs. hitherto uncharacterized ZmTSA and ZmTSAlike. were functionally analyzed. ZmTSA is localized in plastids. the major site of tryptophan biosynthesis in plants. It catalyzes the tryptophan synthase α-reaction (cleavage of IGP). and forms a tryptophan synthase complex with ZmTSB1 in vitro. The catalytic efficiency of the α-reaction is strongly enhanced upon complex formation. A 160 kD tryptophan synthase complex was partially purified from maize leaves and ZmTSA was identified as native α-subunit of this complex by mass spectrometry. ZmTSAlike. for which no in vitro activity was detected. is localized in the cytosol. ZmTSAlike. BX1. and IGL were not detectable in the native tryptophan synthase complex in leaves.

The detoxification of xenobiotics frequently involves conjugation to glutathione prior to compartmentalization and catabolism. In plants. degradation of glutathione-S-conjugates is initiated either by aminoterminal or carboxyterminal amino acid cleavage catalyzed by a γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and phytochelatin synthase. respectively. In order to establish yeast as a model system for the analysis of the plant pathway. we used monochlorobimane as a model xenobiotic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mutants thereof. The catabolism of monochlorobimane is initiated by conjugation to form glutathione-S-bimane. which is then turned over into a γ-GluCys-bimane conjugate by the vacuolar serine carboxypeptidases CPC and CPY. Alternatively. the glutathione-S-bimane conjugate is catabolized by the action of the γ-glutamyl transpeptidase Cis2p to a CysGly-conjugate.

As chitosan oligosaccharides (GlcNn. n = 2–6) were hydrolyzed by exochitosanase (exo-β-glucosaminidase) from Amycolatopsis orientalis. the reaction time-courses of substrate. intermediate and products could be monitored simultaneously by direct infusion of the reaction solvent into the mass spectrometer. Consequently. the analytical approach of real-time MS is an enormous time-saving method. Furthermore. the high sensitivity of the mass spectrometric detection allows the determination of the reaction time-courses with very low quantities of substrate and therefore also a low amount of applied enzyme. Real-time mass spectrometric detection was also applicable in investigating the reaction behaviour of Streptomyces sp.

Falls result from a complex and interactive mix of biological or medical. behavioral and environmental factors. many of which are preventable. Studying these diverse risk factors would aid early detection and management of them at the primary care level. Methods: This is a cross sectional study about risk factors of falls was conducted to 340 elders in Urban Suez. Those are all patients over 60 who attended two family practice centers in Urban Suez. Results: When asked about falling during the past 12 months. 205 elders recalled at least one incident of falling. Of them. 36% had their falls outdoors and 24% mentioned that stairs was the most prevalent site for indoor falls. Falls were also reported more among dependant than independent elderly. Using univariate regression analysis. almost all tested risk factors were significantly associated with falls in the studied population. These risk factors include: living alone. having chronic diseases. using medications. having a physical deficit. being in active. and having a high nutritional risk. However. the multivariate regression analysis proved that the strongest risk factors are low level of physical activity with OR 0.6 and P value 0.03. using a cane or walker (OR 1.69 and P value 0.001) and Impairment of daily living activities (OR 1.7 and P value 0.001).

Various activation methods including the thermal. acid/base of steam provided activated carbon that could be extensively utilized as catalyst support. as well as in adsorption. chromatography. electrochemistry. etc. The design of carbonaceous materials with tunable surfaces and functional groups through such well known thermal/activation processes is. however. highly challenging despite some examples in which the macro-structure of the original biomass can be found and more or less controlled.[1. 2] The preparation of novel porous (ordered) carbonaceous structures from renewable resources is comparatively a new area. quickly being recognized in terms of application and economic advantages. In terms of sustainability issues. these porous materials can play an increasing and rather significant role in future applications and implementation. owing to the versatility of the designed systems for advanced applications.

The oxidation of thiosulphate to tetrathionate. predominantly via the second order disproportionation with a rate constant of 1.2× 10 5 l mol− 1 s− 1 produces Cu (S 2 O 3)−. which is stabilized as Cu (S 2 O 3) n-(2 n-1)(n= 2 or 3).

The effect occurs in dots suspended in a variety of organic or aqueous environments. During periods of constant illumination. the exciton PL quantum yield was found to reach a value of up to 60 times that of the solution of as-prepared quantum dots and. if illumination continued. subsequently declined slowly because of photooxidation. When returned to the dark. the PL reverted to near its original value. The rate and magnitude of photoenhancement are found to depend on the illumination wavelength. the presence of a ZnS shell. the solvent environment. and the concentration of surfactant molecules.

Particularly crucial to our understanding of excitation dynamics in. e.g.. multiNC assemblies. would be a way of differentiating between processes involving trap states and those that do not. Direct optical measurement of NC trap state processes is not usually possible because they have negligible transition dipole moments; however. they are known to indirectly affect exciton photoluminescence.

The bandgap and related optical‐property tuning of these materials are mainly governed by the nature of their band edges. In addition. fusing one type of nanocrystal over another enables further control of material properties that are dependent on the relative alignments of their energy levels.

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The results are interpreted using a set of simplified models for the production of dark matter via a scalar. pseudoscalar. vector. or axial vector mediator. Additional sensitivity is achieved by tagging events consistent with the jets originating from a hadronically decaying vector boson. This search uses jet substructure techniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both Lorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios. This analysis yields improvements of 80% in terms of excluded signal cross sections with respect to the previous CMS analysis using the same data set. No significant excess with respect to the standard model expectation is observed and limits are placed on the parameter space of the simplified models.

This charge-transfer event will be investigated (exploited) on the basis of its implication toward a solar energy conversion scheme. Experimentally. we show that the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of a solution of InP quantum dots is quenched by the introduction of solvated poly(3-hexylthiophene). Time-resolved PL experiments on these solutions are also presented. It was observed that the PL transients did not significantly change upon the addition of the conductive polymer. These new results indicate that said PL quenching is static in nature. This suggests that in solution. the quantum dot and the polymer exhibit a strong intermolecular interaction.

Exposure to air strongly attenuates the cleavage activity. even in the presence of a large excess of reducing agent (e.g.. 40 equiv of GSH per P4+). suggesting that the complex may be useful in targeting cells with a low-oxygen microenvironment (hypoxia) for destruction via DNA cleavage. The active species is identified as the doubly reduced. doubly protonated complex H2P4+. and a carbon-based radical species is implicated in the cleavage action.

In India. killing of the newborn female child has been practiced from time immemorial for a variety of reasons. A female may be compelled to end her life at the alter of dowry or may be killed by a midwife or a doctor who is supposed to help her come into this world. The illegal use of ultrasonography techniques had emerged as a tool for killing of female fetus even inside the uterus. That is why it is said that―womb to tomb female is in danger‖. To know the magnitude and pattern of Unnatural female deaths in Vadodara City of Gujarat. we have conducted an autopsy based retrospective study on 480 cases of female deaths in the department of Forensic Medicine during the year of 2008.

It is based on the colour bleaching of methylene blue (MB) in anionic micellar medium. Arsine gas was formed by borohydride reduction of arsenite/arsenate. Arsine generation and colour bleaching (quantification of arsenic) could be done in one-pot. The presence of silver or gold nanoparticles makes the determination faster. Different calibration graphs at the three different ranges of arsenic concentration such as 0–8.63. 0–1.11 and 0–0.11 ppm were constructed and limit of detection (LODs) were found to be 1.3. 0.53 and 0.03 ppm. respectively.

The Si–C band is in a region (650–690 cm− 1) where it will be obscured by residual Si–H bands unless alkylation proceeds to high coverage such as is observed upon methylation (ca. 80% replacement of Si–H). The Raman spectra of porous silicon and methylated porous silicon are reported. and it is shown that this technique is not significantly better than FTIR for the identification of the Si–C stretching band.,True,sbSKJ_UAAAAJ:JV2RwH3_ST0C,59,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387700302004653,11187787079716435368,/scholar?cites=11187787079716435368,,,0,0,0

However. this test is subject to interference by strong oxidants. certain transition metal ions. and true peroxidases. This paper reports methods for reducing the interference caused by hypochlorite-containing bleaches. Amines such as 1.2-diaminoethane react rapidly with hypochlorite without interfering significantly with the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation. Thus. addition of 0.1 mol/L 1.2-diaminoethane to a standard luminol-peroxide spray lead to almost complete inhibition of hypochlorite-induced chemiluminescence while satisfactory chemiluminescence was still observed from bloodstains.

The results of the studies are consistent with (1) forward intraensemble electron transfer (ET) taking place rapidly following photoexcitation of the chlorin donor at 575 nm (kET = 7.6 × 108 s-1; ΔGcs ∼ −457 mV; Φ = 0.91) and (2) back electron transfer occurring even more rapidly. ,True,IZRe1Z8AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,61,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jo9810112,11609479050905899988,/scholar?cites=11609479050905899988,,,0,0,0

1130506,Carbonated water injection for oil recovery and CO2 storage,2008,M Sohrabi and M Riazi and M Jamiolahmady and S Ireland and C Brown,,"Sustainable energy UK conference: meeting the science and engineering challenge, Oxford, UK",,,,CO2 injection is increasingly considered as having potential applications as a possible enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process for oil reservoirs. Storage potential of these reservoirs to store CO2 for a long period of time also provides an opportunity to develop sustainable solutions in response to the challenge of continued use of fossil fuels. climate-change and compliance with national and international commitments to reduce CO2 emissions. Poor sweep efficiency has been a problem in CO2-floods of many oil reservoirs and hence. injection strategies like WAG (water-alternating-gas) injection have been proposed and applied as a way to mitigate the problem. An alternative injection strategy is carbonated water injection (CWI).This paper describes some of the results of an ongoing research project to investigate both experimentally and theoretically the process of CWI. The results of our flow visualization experiments using high-pressure transparent micromodels. reveal the underlying physical processes and the pore-scale mechanisms of fluid-fluid and fluidsolid interactions during CWI. The results show that CWI. compared to unadulterated water injection. improves oil recovery as both secondary (before water flooding) and tertiary (after water flooding) recovery methods. The improvement is. however. higher when carbonated water is injected in the secondary recovery mode. The main mechanisms of oil recovery by CWI are swelling and coalescence of the isolated oil ganglia and the resultant fluid redistribution as a result of CO2 diffusion. A favourable increase in water viscosity and decrease in oil viscosity also contribute to this promising …,True,IZRe1Z8AAAAJ:jU7OWUQzBzMC,33,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehran-Sohrabi/publication/208047666_Carbonated_Water_Injection_for_Oil_Recovery_and_CO2_Storage/links/02e7e53428b3a0160e000000/Carbonated-Water-Injection-for-Oil-Recovery-and-CO2-Storage.pdf,14668140694963176361,/scholar?cites=14668140694963176361,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehran-Sohrabi/publication/208047666_Carbonated_Water_Injection_for_Oil_Recovery_and_CO2_Storage/links/02e7e53428b3a0160e000000/Carbonated-Water-Injection-for-Oil-Recovery-and-CO2-Storage.pdf,0,0,0

This results in ep transport of DNA to the location where the ep and eo velocities are equal and opposite. Accumulation of the analyte occurs at this location.

MWNTs were etched at potentials more positive than 1.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) in an aqueous 0.1 M KCl electrolyte solution. The logarithm of etching rate was proportional to the applied electrode potential. suggesting a kinetic etching mechanism. The estimated charge necessary to etch a MWNT was smaller than the total charge passed during etching. indicating that current was consumed for other parasitic reactions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of partially etched MWNTs indicate that etching begins at the distal end and proceeds preferentially along the longitudinal axis of the nanotube.

Electron tunneling was found to occur locally from an electron-donating moiety of the porphyrin to the fullerene through charge-transfer interaction between them. In addition. electron tunneling within the single fullerene–porphyrin pair exhibited rectifying behavior in which electrons can be driven only at the direction from the porphyrin to the fullerene. It is demonstrated that localized electron tunneling enables us to spatially visualize the frontier orbital of the porphyrin involved in electron tunneling.

However. weak light absorption and the absence of a gain mechanism that can generate multiple charge carriers from one incident photon have limited the responsivity of graphene-based photodetectors to∼ 10− 2 A W− 1.

The strand complementary to the quinone-containing strand has four isolated GG steps. which serve as traps for a migrating radical cation. Irradiation of the quinone leads to electron transfer from the DNA to the quinone forming the anthraquinone radical anion and a base radical cation. The radical cation migrates through the DNA. causing reaction at GG steps revealed as strand breaks. The efficiency of strand cleavage falls off exponentially with distance from the quinone (slope = −0.02 Å−1). This finding necessitates reinterpretation of mechanisms proposed for radical cation migration in DNA.

Spectroscopic and chemical evidence indicates that the DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes adopt an overall A-form-like structure. Irradiation of the covalently linked anthraquinone group injects a radical cation and leads to remote damage at GG steps. which is revealed as strand breaks by subsequent treatment with piperidine. Radical cation transport through the A-form hybrid duplex occurs. but the strand cleavage at GG steps in the hybrid is much less efficient than it is in duplex DNA. These findings are interpreted within the phonon-assisted polaron-like hopping model to show that the reaction of a radical cation with H2O in the A-form helix is inhibited relative to this reaction in B-form DNA. ,True,Ad7_YP4AAAAJ:7E1sdDGsGRMC,72,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja9925406,12388217532719267445,/scholar?cites=12388217532719267445,,,0,0,0

Robust. validated biomarkers are needed to measure oxidative damage in the context of molecular epidemiology. to clarify risks associated with oxidative stress. to improve our understanding of its role in health and disease and to test intervention strategies to ameliorate it. Of the urinary biomarkers for DNA oxidation. 8-oxo-7. 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is the most studied. However. there are a number of factors which hamper our complete understanding of what meausrement of this lesion in urine actually represents. DNA repair is thought to be a major contributor to urinary 8-oxodG levels. although the precise pathway (s) has not been proven. plus possible contribution from cell turnover and diet are possible confounders. Most recently. evidence has arisen which suggests that nucleotide salvage of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua can contribute substantially to 8-oxoG levels in DNA and RNA. at least in rapidly dividing cells. This new observation may add an further confounder to the conclusion that 8-oxoGua or 8-oxodG. and its nucleobase equivalent 8-oxoguanine. concentrations in urine are simply a consequence of DNA repair.

Niobium ions (Nb5+) were carefully chosen to dope and drive anatase TiO2 into very thin nanosheets standing perpendicularly onto transparent conductive electrode (TCE) and simultaneously construct TiO2 with an ion-conducting surface together with expanded ion diffusion channels. which enabled ultrafast metal ions to diffuse across the electrolyte/solid interface and into the bulk of TiO2. To demonstrate the superior metal-ion insertion rate. the electrochromic features induced by ion intercalation were examined. which exhibited the best color switching speed of 4.82 s for coloration and 0.91 s for bleaching among all reported nanosized TiO2 devices.

Two validation studies demonstrated that the protocol can reproduce crystal structures of nuclear receptors. and is appropriate for modeling ligand binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. Key hydrogen bonding interactions between mometasone furoate and the glucocorticoid receptor. as well as favorable hydrophobic interactions between the furoate group and the 17α pocket. contribute to high affinity and specificity of this ligand for the receptor.

The material is synthesized from the parent compound Na2IrO3 by a topotactic reaction where sodium is exchanged with copper under mild conditions. Cu2IrO3 has the same monoclinic space group (C2/c) as Na2IrO3 with a layered honeycomb structure. The parent compound Na2IrO3 is proposed to be relevant to the Kitaev spin liquid on the basis of having Ir4+ with an effective spin of 1/2 on a honeycomb lattice.

Some metal fluorides. such as CuF2. are promising candidates for cathode materials owing to their high operating potential. which stems from the high electronegativity of fluorine. However. the high ionicity of the metal–fluorine bond leads to a large band gap that renders these materials poor electronic conductors. Nanosizing the active material and embedding it within a conductive matrix such as carbon can greatly improve its electrochemical performance. In contrast to other fluorides. such as FeF2 and NiF2. good capacity retention has not. however. been achieved for CuF2.

This is supported by density functional calculations. and is also consistent with the observed alternation in V–V distances of 2.8 and 3.2 Å along the chains. Partial lithiation results in reduction of the disulfide ions to sulfide S2–. via an internal redox process whereby an electron from V4+ is transferred to [S2]2– resulting in oxidation of V4+ to V5+ and reduction of the [S2]2– to S2– to form Li3VS4 containing tetrahedral [VS4]3– anions.

One of the main criteria for an efficient homonuclear dipolar decoupling scheme is an effective z-rotation condition.

This is at variance to the commonly held notion that these methods require MAS frequencies not comparable to the cycle frequencies of the pulse schemes.

1130796,Efficient medical image enhancement using CLAHE enhancement and wavelet fusion,2017,Brij Bhan Singh and Shailendra Patel,167,International Journal of Computer Applications,5,0975-8887,Foundation of Computer Science,Medical image processing is a challenging field of research since the captured images suffers from the noise and poor contrast. The efficiency of the medical image processing depends on the quality of the captured medical images. Major factors for the low contrast medical images are age of capturing equipments. poor illumination conditions and inexperience of medical staff. Thus. contrast enhancement methods are used for improving the contrast of medical images before being used. In this paper an combination of the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) method and the wavelet based Fusion techniques are used for designing the efficient medical image enhancement method. Method is capable of adapting the Fusion rules adaptively for best enhancement results. First CLAHE image enhancement is used for improving the contrast of the medical images. then in second stage 2D Discrete wavelet transformation based adaptive image fusion is used for fusing the original and CLAHE output images. For testing the performance SNR and entropy are calculated and used as parameters. It is found that based on adaptive Fusion the visual content of the medical images are efficiently improved under all kind of capturing environments.,True,frPkwAYAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,35,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7746185652452911899&hl=en&oi=scholarr,7746185652452911899,/scholar?cites=7746185652452911899,,,0,0,0

These investigations utilize model systems involving the trans-esterification and amidation of methylbenzoate (MB) with ethylene glycol (EG). ethylenediamine (EDA). and ethanolamine (EA) organocatalyzed by 1.5.7-triazabicyclododecene (TBD) and 1.8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Mechanisms for reactions in which TBD acts as the lone catalyst have been compared with pathways in which TBD and DBU catalyze these processes with an additional molecule of the amine or alcohol acting as a cocatalyst.

Consistently. it was found that in the enyne cases the Diels−Alder reaction occurred specifically at the acetylenic center. Furthermore. it was found that the regiochemical sense of the cycloaddition was apparently determined by the remote activating group bound to the olefinic site. This remote acrylyl group totally dominated the course of the cycloaddition. relative to the activating group bound directly on the acetylene site. Explanations for these findings at the computational level are provided. The computations also rationalize the strong preference for cycloaddition to occur at the acetylene linkage and encompass the otherwise surprising regiochemical dominance by the remote ester on the olefinic site.

Organocatalytic ring opening polymerization (ROP) of eight-membered cyclic carbonates was explored as a route to access narrowly dispersed polymers of predictable molecular weights. Polymerization kinetics was highly dependent on the substituent on the nitrogen atom and the catalyst used for the reaction. The use of triazabicyclodecene (TBD). instead of 1.8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). as the catalyst for the N-alkyl substituted monomers significantly enhanced the rate of polymerizations.

The glycol ester lipids can be hydrated and well dispersed in water but they cannot form polydiacetylenes upon UV irradiation. They however can be mixed with PCDA up to 30 mol% and polymerized to form blue sols. The mixed polydiacetylene sols show blue to red thermochromic transition with two-stepped transition temperatures. The first transition temperature decreases with the increase of the glycol ester content as well as the length of their chains indicating greater fluidity of the self-assembled structure due to less collaborative hydrogen bonding among the lipid head groups.

While a large amount of information is available on coordination chemistry in general and synthetic methods in particular. no comprehensive work has been presented on the preparation of coordination compounds with an emphasis on synthetic strategies rather than on detailed descriptions of specific syntheses. The goal of this book is to provide an approach to coordination chemistry that is based upon preparative strategies. The main aim of the authors is to present a systematic classification of synthetic reactions rather than an encyclopedic listing of experimental results. Hence. the coverage is more selective than exhaustive. Despite this. the book provides access to the original literature with ca. 2000 references.

There is an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry between anion (I-) and cation (hexamethyl-para-rosaniline+) during the reaction and. since the small chloride anion is replaced by the bulkier iodide. the complex formed becomes insoluble in water. It is this same precipitate which forms in the cellular substance of bacteria (both gram-positive and gram-negative types) and which initiates the Gram reaction. Potassium trichloro(eta 2-ethylene)-platinum(II). as an electronopaque marker for electron microscopy. was chemically synthesized. and it produced an anion in aqueous solution which was compatible with crystal violet for the Gram stain.

Environmental effects on the imidazolium ring proton chemical shifts are quite significant and must be taken into account explicitly. Calculations performed on the isolated imidazolium cation as well as on the [emim][Cl] ion pair grossly fail to reproduce the correct spacing between proton signals.

For covalent species. a good agreement between experimental and calculated results is achieved without scalar relativistic effects. but their inclusion (with a triple-ζ. doublepolarization basis set) leads to some improvement in the quality of the correlation. The spin±orbit coupling term has a significant effect on the shielding constant. but makes a small contribution to the chemical shift. Coupling constants contain substantial contributions from the Fermi contact and paramagnetic spin±orbit terms; unlike light nuclei the spin±dipole term is also large. whereas the diamagnetic spin±orbit term is negligible.

We previously proposed that PGRPs are bactericidal due to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). a mechanism of killing that was also postulated. and later refuted. for several bactericidal antibiotics. Here. using whole genome expression arrays. qRT-PCR. and biochemical tests we show that in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis PGRPs induce a transcriptomic signature characteristic of oxidative stress. as well as correlated biochemical changes. However. induction of ROS was required. but not sufficient for PGRP killing. PGRPs also induced depletion of intracellular thiols and increased cytosolic concentrations of zinc and copper. as evidenced by transcriptome changes and supported by direct measurements. Depletion of thiols and elevated concentrations of metals were also required. but by themselves not sufficient. for bacterial killing. Chemical treatment studies demonstrated that efficient bacterial killing can be recapitulated only by the simultaneous addition of agents leading to production of ROS. depletion of thiols. and elevation of intracellular metal concentrations. These results identify a novel mechanism of bacterial killing by innate immunity proteins. which depends on synergistic effect of oxidative. thiol. and metal stress and differs from bacterial killing by antibiotics. These results offer potential targets for developing new antibacterial agents that would kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria.,True,PsyEnWAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,81,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004280,1986738845535968553,/scholar?cites=1986738845535968553,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004280,0,0,0

The mineral acanthite is a monoclinic crystalline form of Ag2S that is stable to 176 ºC. Upon heating above 176 ºC. there is a phase conversion to a bodycentered cubic (BCC) form referred to as argentite. Further heating above 586 ºC results in conversion of the BCC phase to a face-centered cubic (FCC) phase polymorph. Both hightemperature cubic phases are solid-state silver ion conductors.

The CNCs–GNPs composite films not only preserve the photonic ordering of the CNCs matrix but also retain the plasmonic resonance of GNPs. leading to a distinct plasmon-induced chiroptical activity and a strong resonant plasmonic–photonic coupling that is confirmed by the stationary and ultrafast transient optical response.

We analyze the experimental features observed in the decay of photovoltage and provide an interpretation of the different depolarization regimes at distinct time scales. We introduce an instantaneous relaxation time that shows the type of relaxation for each separate mechanism. The decay of photovoltage is characterized by electronic events at the ms time scale followed by a power law relaxation in the 10–100 s time window.

The display market is governed mainly by liquid crystal display and light-emitting diode (LED) technology; however. it suffers from limitations that can be overcome by developing the next generation of electroluminescent displays. The introduction of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as down-converters has enabled the production of displays with extremely high color purity and gamut. Therefore. colloidal nanocrystals are excellent candidates for the preparation of electroluminescent devices. which represent a straightforward approach to the development of unprecedented high-quality displays.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Acrylated epoxidized soybean resin has been utilized to immobilize the α‐amylase via UV‐curing technique. Among the numerous methods that exist for enzyme immobilization. entrapment and covalent binding are the focus of this study. The properties of immobilized enzyme were investigated and compared with those of the free enzyme. Upon immobilization by the two methods. the catalytic properties of the enzyme were not considerably changed as compared with that of nonimmobilized form; only the pH profile was broadened for the immobilized enzyme. The free enzyme lost its activity completely in 20 days. where as storage and repeated usage capability experiments demonstrated higher stability for the immobilized form.

Accompanying anthropogenic CO2 emissions are inevitably outpacing nature’s carbon cycle. Excess CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere. where its concentration has reached 400 ppm from a preindustrial level of 270 ppm.[1] It is now widely acknowledged that CO2. along with other greenhouse gases. causes global climate change; rising of the sea levels; and other environmental issues. such as ocean acidification.[2] In this context. CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) is considered to be a promising solution as a remediation to the increasing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. The process for commercializing CCS on a large scale requires continual efforts and collaboration from scientists. engineers. and policymakers. On the other hand. instead of considering CO2 as an unwanted and problematic combustion product of carbonaceous materials. it should be regarded as a valuable C1 feedstock for the production of fuels and materials as part of a carbon capture and recycling (CCR) scheme.[3–6] Presently. the required CO2 can be captured from industrial point sources. but it will eventually have to be captured directly from the atmosphere.[7–13] CO2 capture from the air is an important problem to address since half of the anthropogenic CO2 emission originates from small and distributed sources. such as home and office heating and cooling. and the transportation sector.

1131271,Radial anisotropic growth of rhodium nanoparticles,2005,James D Hoefelmeyer and Krisztian Niesz and Gabor A Somorjai and T Don Tilley,5,Nano letters,3,435-438,American Chemical Society,In this contribution. we report the synthesis of rhodium multipods that result from a homogeneous seeded growth mechanism. Small Rh nanocrystal seeds were synthesized by the reduction of RhCl3 in ethylene glycol in the presence of PVP. These seed particles could be subsequently used. without isolation. to form larger rhodium nanoparticles. A reaction temperature of 190 °C led to isotropic cubic Rh particles. Lowering the reaction temperature resulted in more anisotropic growth. which gave Rh cubes with horns at 140 °C. and Rh multipods at 90 °C. The anisotropic growth occurred in the (111) direction. as determined by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). Anisotropic growth proceeds via a seeded growth mechanism. and not by oriented attachment. ,True,To7zDdwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,218,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl048100g,2967710269280371544,/scholar?cites=2967710269280371544,,,0,0,0

VOx/SBA-15 was prepared by a grafting/anion-exchange procedure. As a first step of the procedure. the inner pores of SBA-15 are functionalized via grafting of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane. After formation of the corresponding ammonium salt. decavanadate (V10O286-) is incorporated into the pores by anion exchange. In the final step. calcination of the decavanadate precursor. yields the chemically bonded vanadia species. Using this approach. vanadium loadings of up to 22 wt % of V on SBA-15 were obtained.

Appearing at high intensity. these resonances occur at ±1/2. ±1/3. ±1/4. and ±1/5 times the frequency of the ground-state hyperfine splitting ω_hfs. We argue that these resonances result from higher-order processes. specifically χ^(n) where n ≥ 5. In particular. to describe the resonances at ±ω_hfs/5. at least χ^(13) is required.

This change has a smaller than anticipated effect on the transitional properties and suggests that the four mesogenic units in the tetramer are not strongly correlated. The behavior of the tetramers is shown to strongly resemble that of a copolymer series containing differing lengths of spacers. ,True,pTSdrKYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,69,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma0502304,14210583610363679976,/scholar?cites=14210583610363679976,,,0,0,0

1131342,Effects of forest management and elevated carbon dioxide on soil carbon storage,1995,Dale W Johnson and Phyllis Henderson,,Soil management and the greenhouse effects,,137-145,Lewis Publ.,"On a global scale. soil organic maner (SOM) contains more C (approximately lSOO-1600 x 10*^ g) than either vegetation (500-800 x 10 “g) or the atmosphere (750 x 10*’g)(Post et al.. 1990). Thus. there is justifiable concern over whether soils are a source or a sink for carbon. Of particular interest is the"" missing sink"" of C. which arises from the difference in CO2 release by fossil fuels (approximately 6 x 10” g) and the annual COj increase in the atmosphere (approximately 3.4 x 10” g)(Lugo 1992). It will be difficult. if not impossible. to definitively identify this missing sink because the background fluxes and pools are very large by comparison. For example. CO^ fixation by photosynthesis is estimated at 120 x 10” g. and autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration are each estimated at 60 x 10” g (Post et al.. 1990). Nonetheless. it is important to try to at least identify the direction. if not the exact magnitude. of C flux into and out of major global C reservoirs such as soils.The role of soils as a source or sink for carbon on a global scale is somewhat controversial. Schlesinger (1990) estimated that soils can. at most. sequester about 0.4 x 10” g yr* of carbon based upon a review of chronosequence studies. He also stated that."" if the terrestrial biosphere is indeed to act as a carbon sink under fiimre elevated levels of carbon dioxide. this would be more likely to be a result of changes in the distribution and biomass of terrestrial vegetation than of changes in the accumulation of soil organic matter’.

Such measurements are normally conducted at very low solute concentrations (infinite dilution). and they result in a single numerical value of γsd for homogeneous materials which exhibit Henry’s Law adsorption behavior.

A longer-term aim of the workshop is to develop lifelong teacher–scholars by encouraging workshop participants to engage with teaching-focused faculty learning communities through the CSC NFW and at their institutions. The workshop also provides a platform to investigate the adoption of student-centered pedagogies among new faculty. and a study of that process was initiated concurrently.

To highlight the peculiar effects of these procedures on the characteristics of the final product. both SG and CVD routes were used for the preparation of single-phase La−O and Co−O species. The process resulted in the formation of LaCoO3 nanostructured films with an average crystallite size lower than 20 nm. The required processing conditions were strongly dependent on the specific synthetic pathway:  (i) SG of Co−O on CVD La−O; (ii) CVD of Co−O on SG La−O …,True,FmsC8_wAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,36,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm0489643,9106190228697315748,/scholar?cites=9106190228697315748,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45801765/Hybrid_Chemical_Vapor_DepositionSolGel_R20160520-18297-1vh7mv7.pdf,0,0,0

The results show clearly that the Pb atoms occupy fcc hollow sites at the surface. but also favor a structure in which these are surrounded by Ni atoms to form a surface alloy phase. A surface alloy with a surface stacking fault. as has been found for the (3× 3) surface alloy phases formed by Sb adsorption on Cu (111) and Ag (111). can be clearly excluded. The preference for a surface alloy structure is consistent with the results of an earlier low-energy ion scattering study. but we find significant differences in the quantitative structural parameters.

Here. we address these three challenges by establishing and exploring an intimate functional link between the reactivity and stability of crystalline (CoS 2 and MoS 2) and amorphous (CoS x and MoS x) hydrogen evolution catalysts. We propose that Co 2+ and Mo 4+ centres promote the initial discharge of water (alkaline solutions) or hydronium ions (acid solutions). We establish that although CoS x materials are more active than MoS x they are also less stable. suggesting that the active sites are defects formed after dissolution of Co and Mo cations.

The reaction is not only used for routine structural determination of peptides. but is also a potential artificial modulator of protein function. Realizing the substrate scope beyond the conventional chemical or enzymatic cleavage of peptide bonds is. however. a formidable challenge. Here we report a serine‐selective peptide‐cleavage protocol that proceeds at room temperature and near neutral pH value. through mild aerobic oxidation promoted by a water‐soluble copper–organoradical conjugate.

The reaction was unaffected by the presence of various oxidation-sensitive functional groups. which proved to be problematic in previously reported studies on the oxidation of C(sp3)–H bonds.

En el plan de estudios 1999-2010. dentro de la orientación de Polímeros de dicha titulación. el Departamento de Ingeniería Química imparte un total de cinco asignaturas relacionadas con diferentes aspectos de los polímeros: Propiedades físicas de polímeros. Diseño de moldes. Reología. Operaciones unitarias del procesado de polímeros y Tecnología de polímeros. Es por ello que estos apuntes se centran en las principales técnicas de procesado y además. incluyen algunos temas de introducción sobre propiedades de polímeros. aditivos. mezclado y formulaciones básicas. aunque es posible que se echen en falta otros aspectos relacionados con la Tecnología de polímeros. ya que se estudian en otras asignaturas de la orientación. Además. se tratan con detalle aquellos procesos de transformación que tienen mayor auge. como la inyección y la extrusión y. en el caso de la provincia de Alicante. donde se encuentra nuestra Universidad. el moldeo rotacional.

1131591,Mechanisms of plasticizers action,2004,A Marcilla and M Beltran,,Handbook of plasticizers,,107-120,ChemTec Publishing. Toronto. Canada,In spite of plasticizers being used since the XIX century. the theories about plasticization were not developed until the years 1930 to 1950. These earlier theories could not explain adequately all the phenomena involved during plasticization. but they provided an interesting picture of the process. Probably due to this fact and to their simplicity and easy comprehension. these classical theories have been used for many years. and in some cases are still being used. With the development of the computational methods. some quantitative models of plasticization have been proposed. The lubricity theory. the gel theory. or the viscosity theory were developed during the 1940s. All of them attempt to explain some critical phenomena observed in plasticized polymers. In the following years. during the 1950s. some other models were proposed. Among them the free volume theory. is undoubtedly the one giving more precise explanation on plasticization. Perhaps this is the reason why in the following years no more theories were published. but only some mathematical models based on the free volume theory and correlating the evolution of some properties of plasticized systems with their plasticizer content. Lately. and based on the free volume concept. a mathematical model has appeared in the literature which is commented below. There are a few published monographs which collect the theories on plasticization in a more or less exhaustive way. Among them it is worth to mention the books by Doolittle1. 2 and the book by Ritchie. 3 The Chapter 2 from “The Technology of Plasticizers” by Sears and Darby4 is undoubtedly the most valuable review of all the …,True,jve-BaEAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,67,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FSJ2DQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA119&dq=info:OibbjvaBtY8J:scholar.google.com&ots=vSompv6j-o&sig=u5I1_EM-Jb7PMPcESA8e4spoNEA,10355325814166988346,/scholar?cites=10355325814166988346,,,0,0,0
1131592,Catalyst addition in polyethylene pyrolysis: Thermogravimetric study,2001,A Marcilla and M Beltran and JA Conesa,58,Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis,,117-126,Elsevier,The effect of catalyst addition on the thermal decomposition of low-density polyethylene has been studied. The pyrolysis has been studied in a thermobalance. using polyethylene mixed with different catalysts. such as MCM41. USY and ZSM-5. The study comprises the analysis of various effects. including the amount of catalyst added and the type of catalyst. It has been observed that almost all the catalytic effect is obtained for a given amount of added catalyst. and a further increase in the catalyst added does not produce a further reduction in the decomposition temperature. A kinetic model has been applied which allows a very good correlation of all the runs performed using the same catalyst. The model involves two different ways for the decomposition. one catalysed and the other non-catalysed. The order of the non-catalysed reaction has been allowed to vary. yielding reaction orders close to zero (i.e. very …,True,jve-BaEAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,62,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165237000001625,16505148511956590479,/scholar?cites=16505148511956590479,,,0,0,0

On the other hand. when the plastisol undergoes the gelation process. a great decrease of these ratios is observed. showing that the increase in temperature produces a decrease in the amount of the crystalline phase in the resin with respect to the amorphous phase.

More than 90% of these catalysts correspond to heterogeneous catalysis.[1] which are preferred industrially. Nevertheless. most of the catalytic processes engaged in the preparation of bulk and fine chemicals are homogeneous in nature; the major drawback of these homogeneous processes are the difficulty in separating the relatively expensive catalyst from the reaction mixture. its recycling and reuse. and avoiding the possible contamination of the final product. These processes produce a large amount of byproduct waste materials. which are hazardous to the environment.A general strategy for converting a homogeneous process to a heterogeneous one is to support the soluble catalyst onto large-surface area inorganic carriers.[2] In this context. conventional sol–gel processes have been used extensively in the preparation of nanostructured porous oxide materials. which serve either as catalysts or as supports for the catalytically active species (nanoparticles. organometallic compounds. en-,True,_JzbzX0AAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,39,https://www.academia.edu/download/34516853/Sol-Gel-Coordination-Chemistry-final.pdf,13983476885735191113,/scholar?cites=13983476885735191113,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34516853/Sol-Gel-Coordination-Chemistry-final.pdf,0,0,0

The acetylene group. or the carbon–carbon triple bond. is one of the oldest and simplest functional groups in chemistry. and although not present in any of the naturally occurring carbon allotropes. it is an essential tool to access their synthetic carbon-rich family. In general. two strategies towards the synthesis of π-conjugated carbon-rich structures can be employed: (a) either the acetylene group serves as a building block to access acetylene-derived structures or (b) it serves as a synthetic tool to provide other. usually benzenoid. structures.

Nature’s hydrogels become stiffer as they are strained. This stiffness is not constant but increases when the gel is strained. This stiffening is used. for instance. by cells that actively strain their environment to modulate their function. When optimized. such strain-stiffening materials become extremely sensitive and very responsive to stress. Strain stiffening. however. is unexplored in synthetic gels since the structural design parameters are unknown. Here we uncover how readily tuneable parameters such as concentration. temperature and polymer length impact the stiffening behaviour.

The molecular conformation of TPP molecules. their adsorption on a gold surface and the growth of highly ordered TPP islands are modelled with a combination of density functional theory and dynamic force field methods.

The corresponding side-chain substituted polymers were prepared by an analogous polymer substitution reaction. The mesogens differ in the nature of the substituents. i.e. CH2. O. S.

A wide range of mesophases and corresponding transition temperatures have been detected. varying from low melting nematic phases to highly stable columnar phases. The wide spread in phase behaviour is described in terms of specific intermolecular interactions. The addition of planar electron deficient molecules resulted in the formation of charge transfer complexes.

Recently. discotic liquid crystals1 (DLCs) have gained attention due to their various possible applications. eg. as compensation layers in LCD technology and for one-dimensional conduction. However. before DLCs can be applied. knowledge and control over the mesomorphic properties. ie. the phase behavior and transition temperatures. of such materials are crucial.Columnar mesophases (ColX) are obtained if the diskshaped mesogens stack into columns and the columns possess a long-range 2D order. Besides the highly ordered columnar phases. two nematic phases are distinguished. In the nematic discotic (ND) phase. the mesogens only possess orientational order. In the nematic columnar (NCol) phase. the molecules stack into (short) columns. and the columns order in a nematic arrangement. analogous to the nematic phase in calamitic liquid crystals.

This method is based on the vortex motion of a subphase (water). which directs floating C60NWs to align on the water surface according to the direction of rotational flow. Aligned C60NWs could be transferred onto many different flat substrates. and. in this case. aligned C60NWs on glass substrates were employed as a scaffold for cell culture. Bone forming human osteoblast MG63 cells adhered well to the C60NWs. and their growth was found to be oriented with the axis of the aligned C60NWs.

Room temperature emission spectra of Tb(III) in a variety of environments have been examined under relatively high resolution. The samples studied include structurally well-characterized crystalline solids. model chelate complexes in solution and Tb(III) bound to the enzyme thermolysin and the protein parvalbumin. The fine structure in the emissions is caused by ligand field splittings of both ground and excited state J manifolds. These spectra provide signatures sensitive to the immediate coordination environment of the Tb(III) ion. Solid state/solution state structural comparisons are made.

To do so. Parellada must. sterilized and inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Na33 (pure inoculated fermentation). inoculated Parellada must (mixed inoculated fermentation) and Parellada must that fermented with its wild yeasts (control fermentation) were used. From the results obtained in the pure inoculated fermentation it can be seen that S. cerevisiae produced appreciable quantities of isoamyl acetate. ethyl hexanoate. ethyl octanoate. and ethyl decanoate. However. the wild yeasts also contributed to the synthesis of esters since the total concentration of these substances was higher in the mixed inoculated fermentation than in the pure inoculated fermentation. 2-Phenylethyl acetate was only synthesized by wild yeasts when they did not compete with S. cerevisiae.

The compounds tested were total extract (fraction 1). vitamin C (fraction 2). neutral polyphenols (fraction 3) and acidic polyphenols (fraction 4). All the extracts showed high cytotoxicity after 72 h. both low and high concentrations. The flow cytometric analysis revealed that all the fractions produce disturbances in the cell cycle resulting in a concomitant cell death by an apoptotic pathway. Changes in the redox status of Caco-2 cells in response to Rosa canina hips were determined. Cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide in presence of plant fractions and the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was significantly decreased. Therefore. our data demonstrate that rosehip extracts are a powerful antioxidant that produces an antiproliferative effect in Caco-2 cells. Therefore. these results predict a promising future for Rosa canina as a therapeutic agent.

Lack of these nutrients can inhibit sugar uptake and growth. which leads to incomplete or ‘stuck’ fermentation. Oxygen or lipids supplementation not only restores yeast fermentative activity and also affects formation of yeast volatile metabolites. To clarify the effect of oxygen and lipid supplementation on the formation of flavour active metabolites during wine fermentation. we evaluated the addition of these two nutrients to chemically defined grape juice and filter clarified Chardonnay must. Lipid addition increased the concentration of esters. higher alcohols and volatile acids. whereas oxygen increased the concentration of higher alcohols and altered the proportion of acetate to ethyl esters and the proportion of branch-chain acids to medium-chain fatty acids.

1131808,Turbulence structure above a vegetation canopy,2009,John J Finnigan and Roger H Shaw and Edward G Patton,637,J. Fluid Mech,1,387-424,,We compare the turbulence statistics of the canopy/roughness sublayer (RSL) and the inertial sublayer (ISL) above. In the RSL the turbulence is more coherent and more efficient at transporting momentum and scalars and in most ways resembles a turbulent mixing layer rather than a boundary layer. To understand these differences we analyse a large-eddy simulation of the flow above and within a vegetation canopy. The three-dimensional velocity and scalar structure of a characteristic eddy is educed by compositing. using local maxima of static pressure at the canopy top as a trigger. The characteristic eddy consists of an upstream head-down sweep-generating hairpin vortex superimposed on a downstream head-up ejection-generating hairpin. The conjunction of the sweep and ejection produces the pressure maximum between the hairpins. and this is also the location of a coherent scalar microfront. This eddy structure matches that observed in simulations of homogeneous-shear flows and channel flows by several workers and also fits with earlier field and wind-tunnel measurements in canopy flows. It is significantly different from the eddy structure educed over smooth walls by conditional sampling based only on ejections as a trigger. The characteristic eddy was also reconstructed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. when only the dominant. sweep-generating head-down hairpin was recovered. prompting a re-evaluation of earlier results based on EOF analysis of wind-tunnel data.

1131815,Chemical sensing of plant stress at the ecosystem scale,2008,T. Karl and A. Guenther and A. Turnipseed and E. G. Patton and K. Jardine,5,Biogeosciences,,1287-1284,Copernicus, Significant ecosystem-scale emissions of methylsalicylate (MeSA). a semivolatile plant hormone thought to act as the mobile signal for systemic acquired resistance (SAR). were observed in an agroforest. Our measurements show that plant internal defence mechanisms can be activated in response to temperature stress and are modulated by water availability on large scales. Highest MeSA fluxes (up to 0.25 mg/m2/h) were observed after plants experienced ambient night-time temperatures of ~7.5°C followed by a large daytime temperature increase (e.g. up to 22°C). Under these conditions estimated night-time leaf temperatures were as low as ~4.6°C. likely inducing a response to prevent chilling injury. Our observations imply that plant hormones can be a significant component of ecosystem scale volatile organic compound (VOC) fluxes (e.g. as high as the total monoterpene (MT) flux) and therefore contribute to the missing VOC budget. If generalized to other ecosystems and different types of stresses these findings suggest that semivolatile plant hormones have been overlooked by investigations of the impact of biogenic VOCs on aerosol formation events in forested regions. Our observations show that the presence of MeSA in canopy air serves as an early chemical warning signal indicating ecosystem-scale stresses before visible damage becomes apparent. As a chemical metric. ecosystem emission measurements of MeSA in ambient air could therefore support field studies investigating factors that adversely affect plant growth.,True,G0ka_QUAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,102,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/5/1287/2008/,17778638705362972999,/scholar?cites=17778638705362972999,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/5/1287/2008/bg-5-1287-2008.pdf,0,0,0

Phys.,12,3219-3231,Copernicus, The distribution and evolution of reactive species in a boundary layer characterized by the presence of shallow cumulus over land is studied by means of two large-eddy simulation models: the NCAR and WUR codes. The study focuses on two physical processes that can influence the chemistry: the enhancement of the vertical transport by the buoyant convection associated with cloud formation and the perturbation of the photolysis rates below. in and above the clouds. It is shown that the dilution of the reactant mixing ratio caused by the deepening of the atmospheric boundary layer is an important process and that it can decrease reactant mixing ratios by 10 to 50 percent compared to very similar conditions but with no cloud formation. Additionally. clouds transport chemical species to higher elevations in the boundary layer compared to the case with no clouds which influences the reactant mixing ratios of the nocturnal residual layers following the collapse of the daytime boundary layer. Estimates of the rate of reactant transport based on the calculation of the integrated flux divergence range from to −0.2 ppb hr-1 to −1 ppb hr-1. indicating a net loss of sub-cloud layer air transported into the cloud layer. A comparison of this flux to a parameterized mass flux shows good agreement in mid-cloud. but at cloud base the parameterization underestimates the mass flux. Scattering of radiation by cloud drops perturbs photolysis rates.

We analysed a case study based on some of these observations and large-eddy simulation (LES) data focusing on the turbulent vertical structure throughout the afternoon transition.

Patton,732,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,150-165,Cambridge University Press,The deepening of a shear-driven turbulent layer penetrating into a stably stratified quiescent layer is studied using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The simulation design mimics the classical laboratory experiments by Kato and Phillips (J. Fluid Mech. 37. 643–655. 1969) in that it starts with linear stratification and applies a constant shear stress at the lower boundary. but avoids side wall and rotation effects inherent in the original experiment.

Consistent with this finding. the dimensionless entrainment velocity varies with the bulk Richardson number as Ri− 1 2. In addition it is observed that all cases evolve in a self-similar fashion.

1131833,A modelling study of flux imbalance and the influence of entrainment in the convective boundary layer,2008,Jianping Huang and Xuhui Lee and Edward G Patton,127,Boundary-layer meteorology,2,273-292,Springer Netherlands,It is frequently observed in field experiments that the eddy covariance heat fluxes are systematically underestimated as compared to the available energy. The flux imbalance problem is investigated using the NCAR’s large-eddy simulation (LES) model imbedded with an online scheme to calculate Reynolds-averaged fluxes. A top–down and a bottom–up tracer are implemented into the LES model to quantify the influence of entrainment and bottom–up diffusion processes on flux imbalance. The results show that the flux imbalance follows a set of universal functions that capture the exponential decreasing dependence on u */w *. where u * and w * are friction velocity and the convective velocity scale. respectively. and an elliptic relationship to z/z  i . where z  i  is the mixing-layer height.

The particular window with the frequency of 15 Hz and the amplitude of 3.4 mT increased the ATP level more than 20% compared with the control experiment after 8 h of continuous exposure. Under another window with the frequency of 50 Hz and the amplitude of 4.9 mT. the ATP level was more than 30% as much as with the control experiment after 6 h of continuous exposure. The condition for this result was the electrostimulation of the cell proliferation. however. the ATP concentration per cell remained constant.

Carbonic anhydrase (CA). the fastest enzyme that can covert carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. can be spontaneously entrapped in carboxylic acid group-functionalized mesoporous silica (HOOC-FMS) with super-high loading density (up to 0.5 mg of protein/mg of FMS) in sharp contrast to normal porous silica. The binding of CA to HOOC-FMS resulted in a partial conformational change comparing to the enzyme free in solution. but it can be overcome with increased protein loading density. The higher the protein loading density. the less conformational change. hence the higher enzymatic activity and the higher enzyme immobilization efficiency (up to >60%).

However. pest species cause significant losses in agricultural and forest crops. and many are vectors of diseases. Currently. many scientists are focused on developing new tools to control insect populations. including secondary plant metabolites. eg. alkaloids. glycoalkaloids. terpenoids. organic acids and alcohols. which show promise for use in plant protection. These compounds can affect insects at all levels of biological organization. but their action generally disturbs cellular and physiological processes. eg. by altering redox balance. hormonal regulation. neuronal signalization or reproduction in exposed individuals. Secondary plant metabolites cause toxic effects that can be observed at both lethal and sublethal levels. but the most important effect is repellence. Plants from the Solanaceae family. which contains numerous economically and ecologically important species. produce various substances that affect insects belonging to most orders. particularly herbivorous insects and other pests. Many compounds possess insecticidal properties. but they are also classified as molluscides. acaricides. nematocides. fungicides and bactericides. In this paper. we present data on the sublethal and lethal toxicity caused by pure metabolites and crude extracts obtained from Solanaceae plants. Pure substances as well as water and/or alcohol extracts cause lethal and sublethal effects in insects. which is important from the economical point of view. We discuss the results of our study and their relevance to plant protection and management.

Among these novel natural biocides are the bioactive secondary metabolites of Burkholderia gladioli pv. agaricicola (Bga). The aim of this study is to determine antifungal activity of Bga strains against some phytopathogenic fungi. The fungicidal tests were carried out using cultures and cell-free culture filtrates against Botrytis cinerea. Aspergillus flavus. Aspergillus niger. Penicillium digitatum. Penicillium expansum. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Phytophthora cactorum. Results demonstrated that all tested strains exert antifungal activity against all studied fungi by producing diffusible metabolites which are correlated with their ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. All strains significantly reduced the growth of studied fungi and the bacterial cells were more bioactive than bacterial filtrates. All tested Bulkholderia strains produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs). which inhibited the fungal growth and reduced the growth rate of Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani. GC/MS analysis of VOCs emitted by strain Bga 11096 indicated the presence of a compound that was identified as 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)-cyclohexene. a liquid hydrocarbon classified as cyclic terpene.

Results showed that cell viability percentage of treated HepG2 by EO and its main constituents was significantly decreased when compared to untreated cells. The calculated inhibition concentration (IC 50) values for HepG2 were lower than healthy renal cells. indicating the sort of selectivity of the studied substances. Citral is not potentially recommended as an anticancer therapeutic agent. since there are no significant differences between IC 50 values against both tested cell lines. Results showed also that oregano EO and its main constituents have a significant antibacterial activity and a moderate phytotoxic effect.

The main drawbacks of these eluent solutions are (i) column regeneration between runs.

The use of synthetic compounds that are able to facilitate the transmembrane transport of anions is a fascinating and burgeoning topic. The study of facilitated anion transport across lipid bilayers is an emerging field in supramolecular and bioorganic chemistry. In this critical review we describe the recent research progress in this area. focusing on literature published during the years 2007–2009.

Deregulation of this process has been associated with the development of several pathophysiological processes. such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer. autophagy has opposing roles. being either cytoprotective or cytotoxic. Thus. deciphering the role of autophagy in each tumor context is crucial. Moreover. autophagy has been shown to contribute to chemoresistance in some patients. In this regard. autophagy modulation has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment and chemosensitization of tumors. and has already demonstrated positive clinical results in patients. In this review. the dual role of autophagy during carcinogenesis is discussed and current therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting autophagy for the treatment of cancer. both under preclinical and clinical development. are presented. The use of autophagy modulators in combination therapies. in order to overcome drug resistance during cancer treatment. is also discussed as well as the potential challenges and limitations for the use of these novel therapeutic strategies in the clinic.

Using a quantitative structure–transport activity (QSAR) approach it was possible to rationalize these results and to quantify the contribution of lipophilicity to the transport activity of these derivatives. While the optimal value of log P and the curvature of the parabolic dependence is a property of the membrane (and so similar for the different series of substituents) we found that for relatively simple substituents in certain locations on the tambjamine core. hydrophobic interactions clearly dominate. but for others. more specific interactions are present that change the position of the membrane …,True,yfb1RVIAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,35,https://pubs.rsc.org/hy/content/articlehtml/2016/sc/c5sc03932k,12417866423868656439,/scholar?cites=12417866423868656439,,https://pubs.rsc.org/hy/content/articlehtml/2016/sc/c5sc03932k,0,0,0

Cancer cells have a reversed pH gradient compared to normal cells. which favours cancer progression by promoting proliferation. metabolic adaptation and evasion of apoptosis.

Indeed. there is a growing body of evidence supporting ionophores as novel antitumour drugs.

The success of the macrobicyclization strongly depends on the central triamine scaffold. which dictates the correct preorganization of the intermediates. The chloride binding properties of the protonated pseudopeptidic cages have been studied in the solid state (by X‐ray diffraction) as well as in solution (by NMR spectroscopy and ESI‐MS) and in the gas phase (by collision‐induced dissociation (CID)‐MS). The crystal structure of the HCl salts of several cages show a chloride partially or completely caged within the cavity of the macrobicycle.

Kinetic resolution of various racemic sec-alcohols and desymmetrization of 1.2-. 1.3-. and 1.4-meso-diols were performed by using the twisted amides.

1132082,Late-Stage Fluorination With 19F− and 18F− via Concerted Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution,2016,Constanze N Neumann,,,,,,The formation of C–F bonds has long been considered a challenging transformation and C–F bonds commonly had to be formed early on in a synthetic sequence towards complex organofluorides. Late-stage fluorination reactions are reactions with a broad substrate scope and extensive functional group tolerance that can be performed on complex molecules. Many classic fluorination reactions fail to qualify as late-stage transformations either due to severe limitations in their substrate scope or because the required reaction conditions are incompatible with many functional groups.   Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is widely used for the aromatic functionalization with 19F and by far the most common method to introduce 18F fluoride into aromatic molecules. Classic SNAr reactions proceed with the formation of a negatively charged Meisenheimer intermediate upon fluoride attack on the aromatic nucleus. Because only arenes with electron-withdrawing substituents can sufficiently stabilize the Meisenheimer intermediate to allow nucleophilic substitution to proceed efficiently. SNAr is restricted to electron-deficient arenes.   In Chapter 1 of this work an unusual concerted mechanism for nucleophilic aromatic substitution with fluoride is presented. Unlike the classic two-step mechanism. the concerted (CSNAr) mechanism does not proceed via a Meisenheimer intermediate. and build-up of negative charge on the arene ring is minimized. For the deoxyfluorination reaction with the PhenoFluor reagent a concerted mechanism is favored over a stepwise displacement and the resultant minimization of negative charge build-up over the course of …,True,wTopB0cAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,1,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/33840664,5345572124145774326,/scholar?cites=5345572124145774326,,https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/33840664/NEUMANN-DISSERTATION-2016.pdf?sequence=4,0,0,0

TPE PDT is characterized by nonlinear absorption of two relatively low-energy photons of NIR light with the resulting emission of high-energy visible light. This high-energy light can sensitize oxygen to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and singlet oxygen (1O2) which can kill cancer cells. The long-wavelength light used to excite TPE NPs allows for deeper tissue penetration to achieve efficient PDT of deep-seated tumors. Moreover.
