49292,Interleukin-3 and hematopoiesis.,1992,James N Ihle,51,,,65-106,,Considerable information has accumulated over the past several years relating to the biological activities of IL-3 which supports that concept that IL-3 has a unique capacity to support the proliferation and differentiation of a wide spectrum of hematopoietic cells. The pleiotropic activity of IL-3 has in turn elicited considerable enthusiasm for clinical trials of IL-3 in humans. Such clinical trials are ongoing and will certainly reveal a variety of conditions that will benefit from IL-3 treatment alone or in combination with other lymphokines. Of particular note are conditions which would benefit from the proliferation and expansion of early myeloid progenitors. These include bone marrow reconstitutions. aplastic anemias. hematopoietic recovery following chemotherapy. A variety of data demonstrate that hematopoiesis is not dependent upon IL-3. Thus. alternative factors must exist that can also support the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. This observation and the uniquely T cell origin of IL-3 have led to the concept the production of IL-3 has evolved within the immune system as a mechanism by which immunological reactions can broadly affect hematopoiesis. The lack of an essential role in constitutive hematopoiesis would be consistent with the divergence in the structure of the gene that is seen among species. Such a role would also predict that it will be easy to obtain mice in which the gene has been deleted by homologous recombination. Indeed. such mice will be essential to fully define the role that IL-3 has in the development and content of immune responses.

Lyinphokines individually regulate the proliferation and differentiation of a number of lineages of cells. One of the first T cell-derived lymphokines to be extensively characterized was interleukin 2 (IL-2). This growth factor was detected by its ability to induce the proliferation of T cells in vitro. To determine the mechanisms by which lymphokines such as IL-3. IL-2. or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mediate their effects in differentiation and proliferation will involve effort. The integral relationship of various cellular homologs of oncogenes to growth regulation has provided an extraordinary means to identify genes. which are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation.

To determine the possible signal transduction mechanisms involved in IL-3 growth regulation. we have examined the effects of IL-3 on tyrosine phosphorylation. Using a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine. IL-3 was found to specifically and rapidly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins of 70. 56. and 38 kDa and a membrane-associated glycoprotein of 140 kDa. Minor and/or variable detected phosphoproteins of 120. 85. 51. and 28 kDa were also seen.

Continuous mouse bone marrow cultures infected with RNA type C viruses (retroviruses) produce nonadherent hematopoietic cells over a longer duration than control cultures. Marrow cultures derived from strains with spontaneously induced ecotropic endogenous retrovirus demonstrate a greater longevity than those from strains with no replicating virus. Cultures infected with murine leukemia virus also generate a greater number. compared with controls. of cloned permanent suspension cell lines dependent for growth on a 41.000-dalton glycoprotein (interleukin 3 [IL 3]). Some are multipotential with capacity for differentiation to erythroid. neutrophil. eosinophil. and basophil/mast cell types. Other cloned IL 3-dependent cell lines are committed to a single pathway.

Condensation occurs during thymocyte development and proper condensation is dependent on kleisin‐β of the condensin II complex.

With rewards come challenges. Often the deletion of a gene that has accepted functions from biochemical and cell biological experiments results in an “inconsistent” phenotype. Frequently this takes the form of no or mild phenotypes and evokes the response that a redundantly functioning gene exists. Equally frequently there is a dramatic phenotype that challenges the investigators' skills to translate it into gene function and draws them into unknown realms.

We have utilized full-length EVI-1 protein to confirm these consensus sequences and determine the spacial and orientation requirements for binding. Our data demonstrate that full-length EVI-1 can independently bind the consensus sequences in gel mobility shift assays. In binding and amplification reactions only the domain 1 consensus sequence (D1-CONS) was obtained with full-length EVI-1 protein. However. by using constructs in which D1-CONS was anchored. products were obtained in which the domain 2 consensus sequence (D2-CONS) was observed with the spacing and orientation of GACAAGATAATATAAN1-28 CTCATCTTC. Using this consensus sequence we show that EVI-1 can activate transcription from reporter constructs. No transcriptional activation was seen with the reporter construct containing D1-CONS alone while activation was seen with the construct-containing D2-CONS alone. These results indicate that the EVI-1 protein works as a transcriptional activator and the binding of the domain 2 with D2-CONS is essential for its activation.,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:uWiczbcajpAC,63,https://europepmc.org/article/med/7761097,8021483654972874274,/scholar?cites=8021483654972874274,,,0

While in most tissues all Gadd45 family members are expressed. Gadd45γ is the only member that is induced by IL-2. Here we show that the IL-2-induced expression of Gadd45γ is dependent on a signaling pathway mediated by the tyrosine kinase Jak3 and the transcription factors Stat5a and Stat5b (signal transducer and activator of transcription). Previous studies with ectopically overexpressed Gadd45γ in various cell lines implicated its function in negative growth control. To analyze the physiological role of Gadd45γ we used homologous recombination to generate mice lacking Gadd45γ.

These viruses are endogenous in mice and are vertically transmitted (Huebner and Todaro. 1969; Rowe et al.. 1971; Aaronson et al.. 1971). A number of biologically distinguishable C-type viruses occur naturally in various strains of mice. Ecotropic viruses. which include the AKR or Gross-type viruses. are capable of replicating in mouse cells. These viruses have been further differentiated by their preference for replication in various mouse cells into N- or B-tropic viruses (Pincus et al.. 1971). although by hybridization experiments the N and B viruses are closely related (Callahan et al.. 1974).

Blasts from almost one half of the patients (25 out of 52) with AML were responsive to growth factors such as IL-3. G-CSF. or GM-CSF. Alternatively. 37% of AML cases (19 out of 52) showed little (< 2.5 times background) thymidine incorporation in the presence of growth factors; such cases were classified as nonresponsive. All AML cases expressing mixed-lineage characteristics (expression of lymphoid-associated antigens) were non-responsive.

IL-3 was initially defined as a factor present in conditioned media which induces the expression of the enzyme 20αSDH in cultures of splenic lymphocytes from athymic mice. With the availability of homogeneous IL-3 it became apparent that lymphokine is active in a variety of assays and is probably analogous to a number of factors defined by various assay systems. Among these it is possible to define assays specific for IL-3 and those in which IL-3 as well as other lymphokines are active. The specific assays include induction of 20αSDH and the ability to sustain the long-term growth proliferation of a variety of factor-dependent cell lines derived from long-term bone marrow cultures. IL-3 is also active in colony stimulating factor assays which detect several biochemically and serologically distinguishable factors.

49442,Possible immunological mechanisms in C-type viral leukemogenesis in mice,1982,James N Ihle and John C Lee,,,,85-101,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,C-type viruses are etiologically associated with a variety of neoplasms in several different species (Tooze 1973). In general. two distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis appear to be involved. In all sarcomas and a variety of lymphomas. directly oncogenic. acute transforming viruses are involved. These viruses can directly cause transformation both in vivo and in vitro and transformation is due to the presence of oncogenic sequences acquired by the virus from genomic sequences. In most cases. the acquisition of transforming sequences results in the deletion of viral sequences required for replication. resulting in a replication defective virus requiring a “helper” virus for these functions. The mechanisms by which C-type viruses induce the more general forms of leukemia. however. appear to be quite distinct from those associated with sarcomas.

This type of transformation is particularly evident in the ability of oncogenes of the tyrosine protein kinase gene family to abrogate the requirement of hematopoietic cells for growth factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3). We have used this property to study the effect of the human trk oncogene on hematopoietic cells. This oncogene was generated by a genetic rearrangement that fused a non-muscle tropomyosin gene to a tyrosine protein kinase with structural features characteristic of growth factor receptors. The results presented here demonstrate that a replication-defective murine retrovirus expressing the human trk oncogene can abrogate the growth factor requirements of hematopoietic cells through a non-autocrine mechanism. In these trk-transformed cells. many of the cellular proteins which are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following IL-3 stimulation are constitutively phosphorylated. with the notable exception of a 140 kDa membrane.

Our studies identified an immediate early gene that is strongly induced in response to IL-2 in mouse T cells which we named cysteine- serine-rich nuclear protein-1 (CSRNP-1). The human ortholog was previously identified as an AXIN1 induced gene (AXUD1). The protein does not contain sequence defined domains or motifs annotated in public databases. however the gene is a member of a family of three mammalian genes that share conserved regions. including cysteine- and serine-rich regions and a basic domain. they encode nuclear proteins. possess transcriptional activation domain and bind the sequence AGAGTG. Consequently we propose the nomenclature of CSRNP-1. -2 and -3 for the family. To elucidate the physiological functions of CSRNP-1. -2 and -3. we generated mice deficient for each of these genes by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Although the CSRNP proteins have the hallmark of transcription factors and CSRNP-1 expression is highly induced by IL-2. deletion of the individual genes had no obvious consequences on normal mouse development. hematopoiesis or T cell functions.

Berlin. Heidelberg,The mechanisms by which murine retroviruses induce lymphomas are largely unknown. A number of requirements have been defined which play an essential role. In Moloney leukemia virus (MoLV) induced leukemia. one potential component is an immune response (Lee and Ihle. 1981; Lee and Ihle. 1981). This has been speculated to be due to a requirement to generate an appropriate target cell population. which is accomplished by viral antigen-induced production of several lymphokines by antigen-specific helper T cells. These lymphokines subsequently induce the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types. As a consequence of the acute viremia and the presence of antigen-specific helper T cells. the frequency of cells proliferating to T cell-derived lymphokines is 50- to 200-fold higher than in control mice. It is from this expanded population that the lymphomas ultimately arise (Pepersack …,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C,23,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-69860-6_16,1723196279394563964,/scholar?cites=1723196279394563964,,,0

This family of receptors has conserved motifs in the extracellular domain but share only limited similarity in the cytoplasmic domains. Although lacking catalytic domains. a variety of studies demonstrate that the cytokine receptors function by coupling ligand binding to induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent studies have shown that the JAK family of kinases associate with cytokine receptors and are activated by ligand binding. Interaction occurs with the membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain. a region that has been found to be essential for mitogenesis. One of the substrates of tyrosine phosphorylation is the receptor and. in the case of the receptor for Epo. the membrane distal region of the cytoplasmic domain is phosphorylated. Once phosphorylated. this site becomes a binding site for the amino-terminal SH2 domain of hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP). HCP is an important negative regulator of hematopoietic cell growth and its recruitment to the receptor complex is speculated to be important for this effect. The role of HCP is best indicated by the observation that the murine mutation. motheaten. is due to a mutation that results in the inability to make HCP. Motheaten mice die soon after birth due to the overproliferation of a variety of hematopoietic lineages.

Specifically. IL-3 uniquely induces the transient expression of Thy-1 Ag on Thy-1- bone marrow cells during a 2-wk culture period. Thy-1 Ag is expressed on immature myeloid cells that are undergoing lineage restrictions to granulocytes. macrophages. and mast cells. Flow microfluorimetry-separated Thy-1+ cells require the addition of IL-3 or granulocyte/macrophage-CSF to the culture medium for continued growth and. as these cells divide and undergo terminal differentiation they gradually lose Thy-1 Ag expression.

This inhibition was specific for gp71 as demonstrated by the inability of xenogeneic antisera to other viral glycoproteins or structural proteins to inhibit and by the ability of purified antigens to block specifically the inhibitory effect. The ability of antisera to gp71 to inhibit LPS responses. however. is highly dependent on the strain and age of mouse spleen cells used and appears correlated with the expression of endogenous viruses.

Significance for this induction was established from studies demonstrating that introduction of constitutively expressed source of exogenous c-myc or microinjection of purified c-myc protein relieved the requirements for PDGF in the transition from GO into Gl (Armelin et al.. 1984; Kaczmarek et al.. 1985).,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:nZcligLrVowC,10,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-74006-0_40,1470500163651148879,/scholar?cites=1470500163651148879,,,0

These three proteins plus two additional non-ligand-binding proteins of 90 and 55 kDa can be purified by IL-3 affinity chromatography. Comparative two-dimensional analysis of the tryptic digests of these five proteins indicates that the ligand-binding proteins are highly related at the peptide level. Incubation of cells with 125I-IL-3 at 37 degrees C results in rapid time- and energy-dependent internalization and degradation of ligand. Under these conditions only the 140- and 65-70-kDa binding proteins. which can recycle to the surface after internalization. can be identified.

The enhancement of enzymatic activity is evident after 12 hours of incubation with IL-3. reaching a maximum after 24 hours. It is (1) dose dependent.(2) restricted to cells from hematopoietic organs (ie. spleen and bone marrow). and (3) independent of cell proliferation. since irradiation of bone marrow cells does not abolish the arginase enhancing effect of IL-3 in spite of complete inhibition of proliferation.

Interleukin 3 (IL3) is a T cell derived lymphokine which supports the proliferation and differentiation of early hematopoietic stem cells in vitro and has been speculated to play a comparable role in vivo (Ihle. and Weinstein. 1986; Ihle. 1988). A role for IL3 in the mechanisms by which retroviruses induce leukemias has been hypothesized based on several observations. Initially it was observed that there was a correlation between a T cell immune response to retroviruses and the latency and frequency of leukemias (Lee et al.1981a).

49529,Characterization of natural antibodies in mice to endogenous leukemia virus,1976,JN Ihle and JC Lee and MG Hanna Jr,,,,,,[en] The ability of radiation to induce thymic lymphomas in susceptible mice is presumably related to its ability either to induce or activate expression of the endogenous leukemia virus or its ability to immunosuppress the host sufficiently to allow escape of the virus from host regulation. or both. Techniques to quantitatively measure changes in virus expression induced by radiation now exist. In tissue culture it has been demonstrated that radiation can induce at low but significant frequencies spontaneous expression of the virus. This suggests that a similar induction by radiation can be achieved in vivo. The relative role of the immunosuppressive effects of radiation must also be examined. The spontaneous expression of endogenous leukemia viruses induces a chronic humoral response to the virus. which may contribute to the regulation of the pathologic expression of the virus.

In part the difficulty arises from the complexity of the regulation. In T-cell differentiation a variety of experimental approaches have demonstrated a sequence involving the initial commitment of a bone marrow stem cell population. the maturation of this population in the thymus. and finally functional differentiation which occurs following antigenic stimulation. The last step in differentiation resulting in the generation and expansion of fully functional cytotoxic T cells can be demonstrated to be due to interleukin-2 (IL-2).

We also examined various cytokines to test their potential to induce TCR gamma gene expression. All IL-3 dependent cell lines expressed TCR gamma transcripts. The IL-3 induced expression was sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors. This demonstrated that the TCR gamma genes belong to the early growth factor response class. IL-3. IL-4.

49543,The relative roles of interleukins 1. 2. and 3 in the regulation of T cell differentiation.,1984,JN Ihle and J Keller,18,,,399-421,,The initial description and purification of IL 3 was based on its potential relevance in early T cell differentiation. Although the data do not provide conclusive evidence for a role of IL 3 in T cell differentiation. a number of observations provide some indications that a relationship exists. The most intriguing aspects are concerned with the distribution and regulation of expression of 20 alpha SDH. This particular marker is interesting since it may allow studies of aspects of T cell differentiation that have not been possible with more conventional approaches. The available data are consistent with the hypothesis that in the bone marrow there exists a stem cell that in response to IL 3 is induced to differentiate including the induction of expression of 20 alpha SDH and Thy 1+. Phenotypically this induced cell is similar to a medullary thymocyte. although the cells derived in vitro clearly do not have the functional characteristics of medullary thymocytes. It can be rationalized that a bone marrow-induced prothymocyte may require the thymic microenvironment for continued maturation. Irrespective of this. it now becomes necessary to further explore the possibilities by extending the approaches used to define and study early bone marrow-localized pre-T cell populations as well as continuing to define the necessary components of the thymus in the differentiation pathway for T cells. In these areas of research the experience and systems derived from studies of long-term bone marrow cultures will be of considerable value. In addition to the proposed role that IL 3 plays in early T cell differentiation. it is apparent that the stem cell that is induced to differentiate may have …,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:1lhNe0rCu4AC,3,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6442348,16026992026396925866,/scholar?cites=16026992026396925866,,,0

Immune mechanisms may play a part in its pathogenesis. First line treatment is based on plasma exchange. and roughly 85% of cases respond. Refractory and resistant/recidivant forms usually have a poor prognosis despite the association of alternative treatments. There is increasing evidence of the eYcacy of high dose immunosuppression treatment in diseases with possible autoimmune pathogenesis.Patient and methods: In April 1998 a 38 year old woman was diagnosed with severe TTP. She was treated with intensive plasma exchange. achieving complete remission. While she was on a plasmapheresis programme. the disease showed a recidivant and progressive course and became refractory to plasmatic exchange.

49558,Signal transduction in the regulation of hematopoiesis,2001,James N Ihle,,"The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 3rd ed. Philadelphia, PA: WB Saunders Company",,103-25,,The cloning of receptors for most of the known cytokines and characterization of their functions have provided essential and. to some extent. unexpected insights into the mechanisms by which cytokines mediate their effects on cells. Cytokines have three broadly defined functions.(1) Many are essential for signaling the cell to proliferate and therefore interface directly with the cellular events that control or contribute to cell cycle progression and cell cycle checkpoints.(2) Many others induce cellular signals that contribute to the suppression of apoptosis.(3) Many cytokines regulate the expression of cell lineageand maturation stage-specific genes that contribute directly to the events associated with differentiation or to the cellular functions that characterize a differentiated state. The continual challenge in understanding the biochemical consequences of ligand binding is to understand the significance of specific signaling pathways to these functions. As will become obvious in this chapter. the consequences of the activation ofa signaling pathway are rarely known in precise terms.Cytokines function through their interaction with cellular receptors that bind the cytokines with high affinity and. generally. become aggregated as a consequence of ligand binding. Cytokine receptors belong to structurally and functionally related families of proteins that can be defined by the initial type of biochemical reactions that are induced by ligand binding. Many of the ligands that affect hematopoietic cells utilize receptors that couple ligand binding to the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. This response is mediated by receptors that intrinsically have kinase activity of …,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:mUJArPsKIAAC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10171647924337026176&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10171647924337026176,/scholar?cites=10171647924337026176,,,0

Jak-2 tyrosine kinase is rapidly activated as a result of c-Mpl ligation. but its role in antiapoptotic signaling has not been examined in vivo.

Deletion of SOCS3 causes embryonic lethality because of placental failure. and genetic reduction of LIF or the LIF receptor (LIFR) in SOCS3-deficient mice rescues placental defects and embryonic lethality; this indicates that SOCS3 is an essential inhibitor of LIFR signaling. However. the downstream signaling molecule that acts as a link between the LIF receptor and SOCS3 has not been identified. In this study we explored the downstream signaling of LIFR. The administration of LIF to SOCS3-heterozygous pregnant mice promotes trophoblast giant cell differentiation and accelerates placental failure. SOCS3-deficient trophoblast stem cells show enhanced and prolonged Stat3 activation by LIF stimulation. Further. in the trophoblasts of SOCS3-deficient placenta and differentiating cells from the choriocarcinoma-derived cell line Rcho-1 cells. constitutive activation of Stat3 is observed. The forced expression of SOCS3. dominant-negative Stat3 and dominant-negative JAK1 in Rcho-1 cells significantly suppressed the trophoblast giant cell differentiation of these cells. In addition. the number of trophoblast giant cells is significantly reduced concomitant with an increased number of precursor trophoblasts in JAK1-deficient placentas. Finally. JAK1 deficiency rescues placental defects and embryonic lethality in SOCS3-deficient mice. These results indicate that the LIFR signaling is finely coordinated by JAK1.

49604,Hematopoietic growth factors,1999,James N Ihle,,Childhood Leukemias,,72,Cambridge University Press,Hematopoiesis is regulated through the interaction of one or more of approximately 40 hematopoietic growth factors with their cogent receptors. Over the past several years. virtually all of the biologically defined hematopoietic growth factor activities have been cloned and characterized. In addition. virtually all of the receptors for these growth factors have been cloned and extensively characterized with regard to the signal transduction pathways they activate. The availability of such information has led to a number of important generalizations that provide important insights into the evolution and biology of these growth factors. This chapter focuses on these principles and provides references to reviews that cover individual cytokines in considerably more detail than is possible here.Unfortunately. due to the isolation of hematopoietic cytokines in an environment of scant information relating to their origin and functional relationships. the cytokine nomenclature has presented the most arduous task in dealing with the field. In today's world. it has become clear that groups of cytokines are related structurally. presumably reflecting their evolutionary relationships. Indeed. cytokines are related with regard to the families of receptors that they utilize and. in turn. have many functionally similar properties (Fig. 5.1). For example. the vast majority of hematopoietic cytokines (examples include interleukin-2 and erythropoietin-3) are structurally characterized by a four alpha-helical bundle structure and functionally related by the utilization of receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily. In contrast. hematopoietic growth factors such as colony-stimulating factor-1 …,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:rbm3iO8VlycC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=kXCBLnBI4lYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA72&dq=info:gN-5Wr0R_sEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=L3rPj104om&sig=3Pd0HJ6gggCU9pp1DOsYp7ETe84,,,,,0

TEGLUND,1998,JN IHLE and D STRAVOPODIS and E PARGANAS and W THIERFELDER,103,Signalling in the Liver,,72,Springer,Haematopoiesis is regulated through the availability of a variety of cytokines that are variably produced by cells of haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic origins. The majority of the cytokines that affect haematopoiesis utilize functionally and structurally related receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily. These receptors have conserved extracellular motifs that are involved in ligand binding?. The structural similarities support a common evolution from the structurally related fibronectin type III modules. Depending on the cytokine. the receptors are composed of one to three interacting chains that each contribute to ligand-binding affinity and/or signal transduction. The cytoplasmic domains have only limited structural similarity and this region lies within the membrane proximal region of one or more chains. The first essential ligand-induced event is the dimerization/oligomerization of the receptor components. In the case of the single-chain receptor for growth hormone. this occurs through the ability of the single receptor chain to bind two sites on the ligand?. The importance of dimerization is illustrated by the constitutive activation of the Epo receptor by an Arg-Cys mutation which results in constitutive receptor aggregation through the formation of disulphide-linked homodimers3.,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:9DLIHnF0jcYC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15335580798608916165&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

49629,Hematopoietic Signaling by the Cytokine Receptor Superfamily,1995,JN Ihle,,,,101-117,Springer. Boston. MA,Hematopoiesis is regulated through the interaction of a variety of cytokines with receptors of the cytokine receptors superfamily. Although lacking catalytic domains. signaling by this receptor family has been shown to require tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent studies have demonstrated that this is mediated through a novel family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases termed the Janus kinases (Jaks) which currently consists of four members (Jak1. Jak2. Jak3. Tyk2). The Jaks associate with one or more of the receptor subunits and are tyrosine phosphorylated and catalytically activated following ligand binding. Once activated. the Jaks phosphorylate one or more of the receptor subunits creating docking sites for SH2 containing proteins including SHC. the p85 subunit of phosphotidylinositol 3′ kinase (PI3-Kinase) and hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP). The Jaks also phosphorylate cellular substrates …,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-1927-0_10,,,,,0

49698,Serological and biological characterization of ecotropic MuLV expression in radiation-induced leukemias of mice,1977,JN Ihle,,,,,,[en] In the present studies. an attempt was made to examine the expression of MuLV (murine leukemia virus) after radiation by serological techniques as well as to examine the expression of MuLV antigens in thymic lymphomas to determine the influence of endogenous ecotropic viruses in pathogenesis. Although these results have demonstrated a lack of correlation between endogenous ecotropic viruses and radiation leukemia. they unfortunately do not shed any light on what the causative events or viruses might be. In many respects. the data suggest that radiation-induced leukemia in mice is comparable to'spontaneous' leukemias in a variety of species including man for which there is no strong evidence for the involvement of C-type viruses. For this reason. the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms in radiation-induced leukemia in mice should be of particular importance as an extremely relevant experimental model of pathogenesis,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:8332412,,,,,0

In contrast. this antigen is not detected in normal spleen. thymus. lymph nodes. or serum.

Each child had received 3 to 6 courses of chemotherapy that included cyclophosphamide. doxorubicin. etoposide. and cisplatin. Marrow was harvested 2 to 5 weeks after completion of this therapy. when the peripheral blood neutrophil counts had increased to greater than 103/mL. At that time. the marrow samples were judged to be free of malignant cells by standard clinical and marrow morphologic criteria. Nucleated cells (1.5 to 2.5 X IOn/kg of body weight) were harvested from the patients’ iliac crests and collected in sterile bags with acid citrate dextrose.

As an alternative strategy that capitalizes on the efficient cellular entry mechanisms of viruses. we have derived adenovirus-polylysine-DNA complexes whereby foreign DNA is transferred bound to the exterior of the virion. This linkage was accomplished utilizing an antibody bridge in which a monoclonal antibody was rendered competent to carry DNA by the attachment of a polylysine residue. Attachment of the antibody-polylysine to the virus was by virtue of the antibody's specificity for the virion. The resulting vector system mediates high-efficiency gene transfer to target cells in vitro. In addition. this vector design allows greatly enhanced flexibility in terms of the size and design of heterologous sequences that can be transferred. Since this strategy selectively exploits viral entry functions. which are independent of viral gene expression. the potential exists to derive vectors that avoid the hazards deriving from transfer of parent virus genome.,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:RuPIJ_LgqDgC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/41365283/High-Efficiency_Gene_Transfer_Mediated_b20160121-16556-1uv6sph.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41365283/High-Efficiency_Gene_Transfer_Mediated_b20160121-16556-1uv6sph.pdf,0
49725,Role of erythropoietin receptor signaling in Friend virus-induced,,Constance T Noguchi Rehg and James N Ihle and Paul A Ney,,,,,,Friend virus is an acutely oncogenic retrovirus that causes erythroblastosis and polycythemia in mice. Previous studies suggested that the Friend virus oncoprotein. gp55. constitutively activates the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). causing uncontrolled erythroid proliferation. Those studies showed that gp55 confers growth factor independence on an IL-3 dependent cell line (Ba/F3). when the EPOR is coexpressed. Subsequently. we showed that a truncated form of the stem cell kinase receptor (sf-STK) is required for susceptibility to Friend disease. Given the requirement for sf-STK. we sought to establish the in vivo significance of gp55-mediated activation of the EPOR. We found that the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of the EPOR. and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). which acts through these sites. are not required for Friend virus-induced erythroblastosis. The EPOR itself was required for the development of erythroblastosis. but not for gp55-mediated erythroid proliferation. Interestingly. the murine EPOR. which is required for gp55-mediated Ba/F3 cell proliferation. was dispensable for erythroblastosis in vivo. Finally. gp55-mediated activation of the EPOR. and STAT5. are required for Friend virus-induced polycythemia. These results suggest that Friend virus activates both sf-STK and the EPOR to cause deregulated erythroid proliferation and differentiation.,True,TXpoP5YAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Ney/publication/242633307_Running_title_Role_of_EPOR_signaling_in_Friend_disease/links/00b7d537e0bcfef298000000/Running-title-Role-of-EPOR-signaling-in-Friend-disease.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Ney/publication/242633307_Running_title_Role_of_EPOR_signaling_in_Friend_disease/links/00b7d537e0bcfef298000000/Running-title-Role-of-EPOR-signaling-in-Friend-disease.pdf,0

Monogr.,arXiv: 1902.00134,221-584,,One of the main goals of the physics program at the Large Hadron Collider is to elucidate the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking.Relativistic quantum field and gauge theories have been remarkably successful to describe fundamental particles and their interactions. In this context. the seminal work of Brout. Englert [1]. Higgs [2. 3. 4] and Guralnik. Hagen and Kibble [5. 6]. has provided a consistent mechanism for the generation of gauge boson masses. The Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory extended this mechanism proposing a theory of the electroweak interactions [7. 8. 9]. introducing a doublet of complex scalar fields. which couples also to fermions. providing them with a mass which would otherwise be absent. This is now known as the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. A complete and detailed description of the Higgs mechanism can be found at [10]. A salient prediction of the theory is the presence of a Higgs boson. The discovery of the Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV. during the first run of the LHC at reduced centreof-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV. is a landmark result that has reshaped the landscape of High Energy physics [11. 12]. The mass of the Higgs boson is particularly favourable as it allows to measure directly a large number of its couplings. It has also important consequences in terms of probing the self-consistency of the Standard Model both through the global fit of precision observables and through its interpretation as a measure of the Higgs boson self coupling. allowing to extrapolate the SM at higher energies and verify the stability of the vacuum.,True,KN-Dsk4AAAAJ:FQnhRx9bfrkC,113,https://cds.cern.ch/record/2650162,8605673344285401596,/scholar?cites=8605673344285401596,,https://cds.cern.ch/record/2650162,0

Melanoma cells share many characteristics with melanocyte precursors. suggesting that melanoma cells utilize the developmental programs of their normal counterpart for their own progression. The pigmentation system provides an advantageous model to assess survival pathway interactions in the melanocytic lineage. as genetic alterations controlling melanocyte development can be easily detectable by coat color phenotype that do not affect the viability of an animal. By integrating combinatorial gene knockout approaches. cell-based assays and immunohistochemical observations. recent studies have illustrated several genes and pathways that play important roles both in melanocyte specification and maintenance and in melanoma formation and progression.

49785,Dependences of isospin fractionation degree on the mass and beam energy of a colliding system,2004,Wenjun Guo and Jianye Liu and Yongzhong Xing,53,Acta Physica Sinica,10,3316-3320,,[en] Based on the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model. authors have investigated the dependences of isospin fractionation degree (N/Z) n/(N/Z) frag on the mass and the beam energy of colliding system. The (N/Z) n and (N/Z) frag are the neutron proton ratio of the nucleon emission (gas phase) and that of the fragment emission (liquid phase) respectively. The isospin fractionation degree is a sensitive function to the mass and beam energy of the colliding system. The (N/Z) n/(N/Z) frag reduces with increasing mass of the colliding system when the beam energy and neutron proton ratio of the colliding system are fixed. This is due to the larger compression. small heating energy and larger critical temperature of the gas-liquid phase transition for the heavy colliding system. compared to those of the light colliding system. The authors also found that (N/Z) n/(N/Z) frag enhances with increasing beam energy due to the increase of excitation energy of the colliding system which leads to larger nucleon transport and isospin fractionation. But the isospin fractionation only occurs in the energy region for producing the liquid-gas phase transition. In this case. authors propose that (N/Z) n/(N/Z) frag can be directly compared with the experimental data to get the information about symmetry potential,True,KN-Dsk4AAAAJ:rR1SM4wcGAYC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:36026818,,,,,0

Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced. the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20.000-23.000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution. while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example. the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements. both non-coding and coding. Notably. many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes. In coding regions the evolutionary dynamics of protein domains and orthologous groups illustrate processes that distinguish the lineages leading to birds and mammals.

49806,Global regulation of erythroid gene expression by transcription factor GATA-1,2004,John J Welch and Jason A Watts and Christopher R Vakoc and Yu Yao and Hao Wang and Ross C Hardison and Gerd A Blobel and Lewis A Chodosh and Mitchell J Weiss,104,Blood,10,3136-3147,American Society of Hematology,Transcription factor GATA-1 is required for erythropoiesis. yet its full actions are unknown. We performed transcriptome analysis of G1E-ER4 cells. a GATA-1–null erythroblast line that undergoes synchronous erythroid maturation when GATA-1 activity is restored. We interrogated more than 9000 transcripts at 6 time points representing the transition from late burst forming unit–erythroid (BFU-E) to basophilic erythroblast stages. Our findings illuminate several new aspects of GATA-1 function. First. the large number of genes responding quickly to restoration of GATA-1 extends the repertoire of its potential targets. Second. many transcripts were rapidly down-regulated. highlighting the importance of GATA-1 in gene repression. Third. up-regulation of some known GATA-1 targets was delayed. suggesting that auxiliary factors are required. For example. induction of the direct GATA-1 target gene β major globin was …,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,420,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/104/10/3136/18719,18428912042649975972,/scholar?cites=18428912042649975972,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120558692,0

These different functions of the hemoglobins illustrate the acquisition of new roles by a pre-existing structural gene. which requires changes not only in the coding regions but also in the regulatory elements of the genes.

Two conserved miRNAs. miR 144 and miR 451. emerged as direct targets of the critical hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. In vivo. GATA-1 binds a distal upstream regulatory element to activate RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of a single common precursor RNA (pri-miRNA) encoding both mature miRNAs. Zebrafish embryos depleted of miR 451 by using antisense morpholinos form erythroid precursors. but their development into mature circulating red blood cells is strongly and specifically impaired.

49844,The effects of chromatin organization on variation in mutation rates in the genome,2015,Kateryna D Makova and Ross C Hardison,16,,4,213-223,Nature Publishing Group,The variation in local rates of mutations can affect both the evolution of genes and their function in normal and cancer cells. Deciphering the molecular determinants of this variation will be aided by the elucidation of distinct types of mutations. as they differ in regional preferences and in associations with genomic features. Chromatin organization contributes to regional variation in mutation rates. but its contribution differs among mutation types. In both germline and somatic mutations. base substitutions are more abundant in regions of closed chromatin. perhaps reflecting error accumulation late in replication. By contrast. a distinctive mutational state with very high levels of insertions and deletions (indels) and substitutions is enriched in regions of open chromatin. These associations indicate an intricate interplay between the nucleotide sequence of DNA and its dynamic packaging into chromatin. and have important …,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:KbBQZpvPDL4C,155,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3890,3743793034754190900,/scholar?cites=3743793034754190900,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4500049/?src=organic&q=potential,0

Different models for LCR function postulate that the HSs act either independently or synergistically. To test these possibilities. we have constructed a series of expression cassettes in which the gene encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is under the control of DNA fragments containing single and multiple HSs of the LCR. LCR DNA fragments containing only the minimal region needed for position-independent expression (HS cores) or containing cores plus flanking sequences (HS units) were compared to ascertain whether conserved sequences between the HS cores contributed to enhancement.

Despite active experimental and computational research. relationships among sequence. conservation. and function are still poorly understood. We compared transcription factor occupied segments (TFos) for 116 human and 35 mouse TFs in 546 human and 125 mouse cell types and tissues from the Human and the Mouse ENCODE projects. We based the map between human and mouse TFos on a one-to-one nucleotide cross-species mapper. bnMapper. that utilizes whole genome alignments (WGA). Our analysis shows that TFos are under evolutionary constraint. but a substantial portion (25.1% of mouse and 25.85% of human on average) of the TFos does not have a homologous sequence on the other species; this portion varies among cell types and TFs. Furthermore. 47.67% and 57.01% of the homologous TFos sequence shows binding activity on the other species for human and mouse respectively. However. 79.87% and 69.22% is repurposed such that it binds the same TF in different cells or different TFs in the same cells.

Similar histone dimers are found in both conformational states of chromatin. The dimers most frequently found are H2b-H2a. H2b-H3 and H3-H2a; dimers found less frequently are H3-H4. H3-H3 and H2b-H4.

L1Oc repeats have a common 3′ end that terminates in a poly A addition signal and an A-rich tract. but individual repeats have different 5′ ends. indicating a polar truncation from the 5′ end during their synthesis or propagation. As a result of the polar truncations. the 5′ end of L1Oc is present in about 11.000 copies per haploid genome. whereas the 3′ end is present in at least 66.000 copies per haploid genome. One type of L1Oc repeat has internal direct repeats of 78 bp in the 3′ untranslated region. whereas other L1Oc repeats have only one copy of this sequence. The longest repeat sequenced.

Such strong conservation may reveal a region that possesses an important function. When alignments are so long that it is infeasible. or at least undesirable. to inspect them in complete detail. it is helpful to have an automatic process that computes information about the varying degree of conservation along the alignment and displays the information in a graphical representation that is readily assimilated. This paper presents methods for computing several such ‘robustness measures’ at each position of a given alignment.

The family is composed of four genes. arranged 5′-β4-β3-Ψβ2-β1–3′ on the chromosome; Ψβ2 is an inactive pseudogene. Using the technique of hybrid-arrested translation in vitro. we have identified the embryo-specific globin polypeptides encoded by genes β3 and β4. The β3 and β4 globins are replaced by the adult β1 globin halfway through gestation; this corresponds temporally with the switch in site of erythropoiesis from the embryonic yolk sac to the fetal liver.

Inc.,Gene conversion events are often overlooked in analyses of genome evolution. In a conversion event. an interval of DNA sequence (not necessarily containing a gene) overwrites a highly similar sequence. The event creates relationships among genomic intervals that can confound attempts to identify orthologs and to transfer functional annotation between genomes. Here we examine 1.616.329 paralogous pairs of mouse genomic intervals. and detect conversion events in about 7.5% of them. Properties of the putative gene conversions are analyzed. such as the lengths of the paralogous pairs and the spacing between their sources and targets.

However. the question of how DNA is folded and the influence of such folding on nuclear processes remain topics of intensive current research. A longstanding. unanswered question is whether nuclear organization is simply a reflection of nuclear processes such as transcription and replication. or whether chromatin is folded by independent mechanisms and this per se encodes function?

Despite this. it remains challenging to determine evolutionary relationships in gene clusters due to their complex histories involving duplications. deletions. inversions. and conversions. One concept describing these relationships is orthology. Orthologs derive from a common ancestor by speciation. in contrast to paralogs. which derive from duplication. Discriminating orthologs from paralogs is a necessary step in most multispecies sequence analyses. but doing so accurately is impeded by the occurrence of gene conversion events.

50007,Some problem in dealing with chromatin structure,1977,VAUGHN Jackson and P Hoffman and ROSS Hardison and JOYCE Murphy and MARY ELLEN Eichner and ROGER Chalkley,,,,281-300,North-Holland Publ. Co. Amsterdam,Many of the recent ideas concerning chromatin structure have been based on the seminal observation of Hewish and Burgoyne [1] that endogenous nucleolytic digestion of rat liver chromatin leads to the formation of specific size fractions containing DNA of regularly increasing molecular weight. In these early experiments the total amount of digestion was quite limited (2). However. in other studies rather massive digestion has been employed to probe the internal aspects of chromatin substructure (3. 4. 5. 6. 7]. Unfortunately. such extended digestions lead to a concern that the DNA underlying the histones may be damaged and thus lead to a migration of histones (8. 9). Much of this report will deal with a critical investigation of such limit nuclease digestions. particularly concentrating on their relevance to an analysis of chromatin structure. A second approach used to study the internal organization of chromatin has exploited various chemical cross-linking agents. such as formaldehyde [10. 11. 12). methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate [13]. dimethylsuberimidate [14. 15]. 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (16). and tetranitromethane (17). Based on experiments using histones dissociated from DNA. it has been argued that the non-H1 histones are assembled in groups of eight. the members of each group interacting strongly together (18. 19). We have attempted to devise tests of the relevance of this idea to the actual organization of histones on DNA in chromosomal material. The results of these tests also form a part of this report.,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC,4,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9276852512004037611&hl=en&oi=scholarr,9276852512004037611,/scholar?cites=9276852512004037611,,,0

Particularly in genomics and genetics. there are multiple distinct regimes in the genome within each of which the relationships among multivariate features are distinct. Examples include differential gene regulation depending on gene functions and experimental conditions. and varying combinatorial patterns of multiple transcription factors. We developed a software package called MRHMMs (Multivariate Regression Hidden Markov Models and the variantS) that accommodates a variety of HMMs that can be flexibly applied to many biological studies and beyond. MRHMMs supplements existing HMM software packages in two aspects. First.

With this goal in mind. we have developed a tool. called TOAST (two-way orthologous alignment selection tool). for predicting whether two aligned regions from different species are orthologous. i.e.. separated by a speciation event. as opposed to a duplication event. The advantage of restricting alignment to orthologous pairs is that they constitute the aligning regions that are most likely to share the same biological function. and most easily analyzed for evidence of selection.

In a conversion event. an interval of DNA sequence (not necessarily containing a gene) overwrites a highly similar sequence.

Here we examine 1.112.202 paralogous pairs of human genomic intervals. and detect conversion events in about 13.5% of them. Properties of the putative gene conversions are analyzed. such as the lengths of the paralogous pairs and the spacing between their sources and targets.

Here we identify via a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen ZNF410. a pentadactyl DNA-binding protein that in human erythroid cells directly activates only a single gene. the NuRD component CHD4. Specificity is conveyed by two highly evolutionarily conserved clusters of ZNF410 binding sites near the CHD4 gene with no counterparts elsewhere in the genome. Loss of ZNF410 in adult-type human erythroid cell culture systems and xenotransplantation settings diminishes CHD4 levels and derepresses the fetal hemoglobin genes. While previously known to be silenced by CHD4. the fetal globin genes are exposed here as among the most sensitive to reduced CHD4 levels..

50018,Recent natural selection in human noncoding sequences,2007,Heather A Lawson and J Joel Martin and D King and Belinda Giardine and Webb Miller and R Hardison,,Science. Submitted,,,,Genomic DNA sequences associated with human-specific functions should show a signature of positive selection. whereas those needed in all primates should show a signature of negative selection. One test for natural selection (either positive or negative) that has been applied to protein-coding regions requires a ratio of intraspecies polymorphism to interspecies divergence that deviates significantly from the neutral expectation. By applying this test to noncoding regions of human DNA. using ancestral repeats in tiled windows as a model for neutral DNA. we found that about 1.0 to 1.6% of the human genome deviates significantly from neutrality based on comparisons to rhesus (diverging about 23 million years ago) or chimpanzee (diverging about 6 million years ago). respectively. Most of these non-neutral windows show a signal for positive selection. Many of them overlap with genes such as FOXP2 whose coding regions were previously implicated as being targets of positive selection in humans. and others overlap with novel candidates for selection. such as the nerve growth regulator NEGR1. These noncoding regions that are candidates for targets of selection could harbor regulatory regions. such as a predicted cis-regulatory region in the tumor suppressor PDSS2. Non-neutral intronic regions in the FOXP2 gene have protein-binding and modification properties consistent with such a role. Thus novel candidates for selection can be identified in potential cis-regulatory modules.,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,2,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.414.2306&rep=rep1&type=pdf,14512421144746828706,/scholar?cites=14512421144746828706,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.414.2306&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

There are two requisites for the affinity labeling of a steroid receptor. The steroid must bind reversibly at the active site of the receptor and possess a functional group capable of forming a covalent bond with an amino acid residue either within (endo) or adjacent to (exo) the binding site. The first requisite seems relatively easy to fulfill. The progesterone receptor of chick oviduct forms a highly stable (kd ∼ 10-10) complex with progesterone and competition studies show that other steroids form complexes somewhat less stable but with kd ∼ 10-10.

We recently identified heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI. EIF2AK1). as a novel HbF regulator. Because HRI is an erythroid-specific protein kinase. it presents a potential target for pharmacologic intervention. We found that maximal HbF induction required >80% to 85% HRI depletion. Because it remains unclear whether this degree of HRI inhibition can be achieved pharmacologically. we explored whether HRI knockdown can be combined with pharmacologic HbF inducers to achieve greater HbF production and minimize potential adverse effects associated with treatments. Strongly cooperative HbF induction was observed when HRI depletion was combined with exposure to pomalidomide or the EHMT1/2 inhibitor UNC0638. but not to hydroxyurea.

Miyata et al report on their studies in lampreys. a vertebrate far distant from mammals. and infer that a core component of globin gene regulation became active long ago. likely in the Cambrian Period (about 430 to 540 million years ago). 1Comparisons of hemoglobin gene loci across a broad range of mammalian species have revealed much about both their evolutionary histories and their regulation (eg. locations of many cis-regulatory elements were predicted by strong noncoding sequence conservation). However. equivalent studies in vertebrate species more distant from humans and mice are more challenging. mainly because regulatory element sequences evolve rapidly compared with the slower rate of evolution of protein-coding sequences.

To address this we introduce CLIMB (Composite LIkelihood eMpirical Bayes). a statistical methodology that learns patterns of condition-specificity present in genomic data. CLIMB provides a generic framework facilitating a host of analyses. such as clustering genomic features sharing similar condition-specific patterns and identifying which of these features are involved in cell fate commitment. Our approach improves upon existing methods by boosting statistical power to identify meaningful signals while retaining interpretability and computational tractability. We illustrate CLIMB9s value on two sets of hematopoietic data: one studying CTCF ChIP-seq measured in 17 different cell populations. and another examining RNA-seq measured across constituent cell populations in three committed lineages. These analyses demonstrate that CLIMB captures biologically relevant clusters in the data and improves upon commonly-used pairwise comparisons and unsupervised clusterings typical of genomic analyses.,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:zGdJYJv2LkUC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.388504v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/11/18/2020.11.18.388504.full.pdf,0

However. the quality of ChIP-seq datasets vary over a wide range. with a substantial fraction being of intermediate to poor quality. Such experimental variability can lead to many false positives or false negatives. impairing the ability to interpret the data. Thus. it is important to discern and control the factors that contribute to variation in ChIP-seq. In this study. we focus on the sonication step to produce sheared chromatin. a variable controllable by the user and applicable to all ChIP-seq protocols. We systematically varied the amount of shearing of fixed chromatin from a mouse erythroid cell line. carefully measured the distribution of resultant fragment lengths using the Agilent Bioanalzyer 2100. and then immunoprecipitated these batches of chromatin using highly specific antibodies against either TAL1 or CTCF. We found that the level of sonication. which was affected by both the number of sonication cycles. as well as the starting cell number. had a pronounced impact on the quality of resulting ChIP-seq signals. Specifically. over-sonication led to degradation of quality (e.g. increased background and reduction in signal). while the impact of under-sonication of chromatin differed between the two transcription factors. leading to the loss of sites occupied by TAL1 but not those bound by CTCF.

However. the technical noise in epigenomic data sets and the many dimensions (features) examined make it challenging to effectively extract biologically meaningful inferences from these data sets. We developed a package that reduces noise while normalizing the epigenomic data by a novel normalization method. followed by integrative dimensional reduction by learning and assigning epigenetic states. This package. called S3V2-IDEAS. can be used to identify epigenetic states for multiple features. or identify signal intensity states and a master peak list across different cell types for a single feature. We illustrate the outputs and performance of S3V2-IDEAS using 137 epigenomics data sets from the VISION project that provides ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data in hematopoiesis.

By using Hi-C data to identify differentially organized genomic regions. relationships between this organization. gene expression. and cell identity may be established. However. Hi-C data exhibit a unique and challenging spatial structure. as genomic loci can show strong correlations when they are nearby in 3D space within the nucleus or 1D space along the chromosome. Consequently. the development of methods that can accurately detect differences between Hi-C samples while controlling false discoveries has remained difficult. To meet this need. we introduce a spatial modeling approach based on sliding window statistics. Using polymer simulations. we illustrate the improved power and precision of our method to identify differentially interacting genomic regions.

Three GATA factors play distinct roles in hematopoietic differentiation. In order to better understand how these GATA factors function to regulate genes throughout the genome. we are studying the epigenomic and transcriptional landscapes of hematopoietic cells in a model-driven. integrative fashion. We have formed the collaborative multi-lab VISION project to conduct ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON of epigenomic data in mouse and human hematopoiesis. The epigenomic data included nuclease accessibility in chromatin. CTCF occupancy. and histone H3 modifications for twenty cell types covering hematopoietic stem cells. multilineage progenitor cells. and mature cells across the blood cell lineages of mouse. The analysis used the Integrative and Discriminative Epigenome Annotation System (IDEAS). which learns all common combinations of features (epigenetic states) simultaneously in two dimensions - along chromosomes and across cell types. The result is a segmentation that effectively paints the regulatory landscape in readily interpretable views. revealing constitutively active or silent loci as well as the loci specifically induced or repressed in each stage and lineage.

KISS,1989,RC Hardison,2,Current Topics in Plant Physiology,,171,American Society of Plant Physiologists,For almost a century. the hypothesis that amyloplasts initiate gravity perception has been extensively debated and widely accepted. Amyloplasts are typically colorless plastids distended with starch. Amyloplasts specialized primarily for storage usually do not sediment towards gravity. The only plastids that sediment are amyloplasts found in tissues thought responsible for gravity perception. In higher plants. these sites include the central cells of the rootcap and the starch sheath in stems.The initial identification of these tissues as sites of perception did not simply rely upon the circular argument that they contained structures that were consistently sedimented (7). Much evidence has accumulated demonstrating extensive correlations between amyloplast sedimentation and the capacity for gravity perception (22. 24). This paper will analyze selected data from the last decade-including the isolation of a starchless but graviresponsive mutant-that bear on the question of whether gravity perception is plastid-based.,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17356526773208072834&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Part B: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms. pages 1-17,1989,Ross C Hardison and Jean B Margot and G William,,Hemoglobin Switching: 6th Conference,,1,AR Liss,Globin gene families have been widely used as systems to investigate the regulation of gene expression. especially issues concerning tissue specificity and temporal regulation during development. Considerable progress has been made in identifying cis-acting regulatory sequences around the globin genes (reviewed by Collins and Weissman. 1984). including promoter (eg Dierks et al.. 1983; Antoniou et al.. 1988) and enhancer (eg Choi and Engel. 1986; Hesse et al.. 1986; Behringer et al.. 1987; Trudel et al.. 1987) sequences as well as locus-activating or dominant control sequences located further away from the genes (Grosveld et al.. 1987). Recently. specific factors in nuclear extracts have been found to bind to some of these cis-acting sequences (eg Emerson et al.. 1987; Wall et al.. 1988). Many of these regulatory sequences have been conserved during evolution. and it is likely that an extensive study of the patterns of sequence conservation will reveal new candidates for regulatory sequences and provide novel insights into how these sequences are involved in regulation.Globin gene families have also been most informative in studies of genome evolution. For example. the B-like globin gene clusters of mammals appear to have been derived from a common ancestral gene cluster. Based on the results of pair-wise gene sequence comparisons. several laboratories proposed that the ancestral eutherian mammal had a B-like gene cluster containing E-.

This genome has attracted intense interest over the last decade from plant molecular biologists who are working to understand its structure and function as well as the regulation of plastid gene expression.

50061,Physiology. Biochemistry. and Genetics of Nongreen Plastids. CD Boyer. JC Shannon,1989,RC Hardison,2,Current Topics in Plant Physiology,,256,American Society of Plant Physiologists,While analyzing the accumulation of plastid transcripts in maize endosperm. we found that transcripts from some intron-containing ribosomal protein genes are among the most abundant plastid RNAs in total endosperm RNA. For example. extensive hybridization was detected using probes from the rps12 operon. This operon is organized in an unusual manner. The first exon and intron of the rps12 gene are located in the large single copy region of the plastid genome (region I). while the second exon. second intron. third exon and the uninterrupted rps7 gene are located in the inverted repeat region (region II). Not only are the 5'and 3'parts of the rps 12 gene encoded several kilobases apart in the genome. but they are transcribed from opposite strands. In Nicotiana and Marchantia. maturation of the rps 12 transcript has been shown to occur via trans-splicing (1). The structure of this operon in maize suggests that a similar mechanism must operate in maize plastids (2). We observed several transcripts homologous to rps12 operon probes in endosperm RNA. The molecular weights of the two most abundant transcripts were estimated as 4.5 and 2.2 kilobases. When endosperm total RNA was probed with a fragment containing the first exon and intron of rps12. only the 2.2 kilobase transcript was detected. Probes for exon II detected both the 4.5 and 2.2 kilobase transcripts. It thus appears that the 2.2 kilobase transcript has undergone trans-splicing as it contains sequences homologous to both regions of the operon. The 4.5 kilobase transcript is homologous to only region II of the operon and apparently has not undergone trans-splicing.

The parallel adaptation of plastids has largely been achieved by selection of more favourable phenotypes arising from mutation and recombination of nuclear genes. Variation in plastid expression in response to the cellular environment. and modified by the external one. is achieved by changes in size and frequency. and especially by changes in internal structure. The growth in thylakoids and other parts from young proplastid to mature and finally senescing chloroplast follows a sequence of characteristic phases. There are several diversions from the main sequence. but through processes of differentiation. dedifferentiation and redifferentiation. all are seen as connected. The transmission of plastids through the germ line is an example of the recent evolution of alternative patterns of behaviour. The varying functions of plastids are so clearly associated with variation in types of cells that studies of the two should be coupled together.,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7327626125920677460&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
50063,LONI WALKER AND FRED SACK,1989,RC Hardison,2,Current Topics in Plant Physiology,,258,American Society of Plant Physiologists,A great deal of evidence suggests that sedimenting amyloplasts function as statoliths in plant gravity perception (3). The “starch statolith” theory holds that the displacement of and/or pressure from amyloplasts acts as the signal for gravity perception. With the exception of Chara rhizoids. which appear to utilize barium sulfate crystals as statoliths (4). little is known about gravitropism in growing tip cells. Tip cells of dark grown moss protonema of Ceratodon (1) and Physcomitrella (2) are negatively gravitropic.

50064,JARANYA NGERNPRASIRTSIRI,1989,RC Hardison,2,Current Topics in Plant Physiology,,79,American Society of Plant Physiologists,Studies on the light-induced development of chloroplasts from etioplasts or proplastids in young seedlings have encouraged the idea that. among the many types of plastids in plants. amyloplasts and chloroplasts are ontogenetically and evolutionarily closely related (14). Another model system is the light-induced transformation of leucoplasts or amyloplasts into chloroplasts in potato tubers. It must be clearly recognized. however. that amyloplasts in cereal seeds and in some tuberous tissues are not convertible into chloroplasts. even upon illumination. Our recent research efforts have focused on a comparison of genetic mechanisms in amyloplasts with those in chloroplasts using liquid-cultured cells of sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus)(19. 20). We have found that the suppression of gene expression in the amyloplast is related to the methylation of DNA molecules. Specifically we have found that physical maps of amyloplast DNA isolated from white-wild cells of sycamore and of chloroplast DNA from green cells are identical when the DNAs are digested with restriction enzymes that are insensitive to methylation. but different when digested with enzymes that are sensitive to methylation (22. 23). The structure of plastid DNA in sycamore is similar to that in tobacco leaves.,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:k_7cPK9k7w8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1082296278446730300&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0
50065,CHARLES D. BOYER',1989,RC Hardison,2,Current Topics in Plant Physiology,,241,American Society of Plant Physiologists,As can be seen from the preceeding chapters. the study of any nongreen plastid is dictated by several factors. Clearly the ability to isolate the plastid to meet the requirements of the experimental protocol is critical. Similarly the availability of tissues with abundant concentrations of the plastid is important. It is not suprising that the many studies of chromoplast metabolism and ultrastructure have concentrated on a relatively few tissues and species. namely. the corollas of Narcisus and ripening fruit of tomato and pepper. Each of these chromoplasts have been well characterized by ultrastructural and metabolic studies. Thus they were also logical choices for initial studies of the molecular biology of chromoplasts. However. additional tissues need to be identified and developed for further studies in order to expand our knowledge of chromoplasts and to allow a more thorough comparative analysis of chromoplasts.I feel that in selecting additional species for study. other criteria also should be considered. For example. it would be desirable to have multiple tissues from the same species in which chromoplasts normally develop. Similarly. as chromoplasts can develop from proplastids. amyloplasts or chloroplasts (23). chromoplasts derived from different developmental pathways in the same species would be useful. Each of these developmental routes would have various advantages for addressing different questions in plastid biology. For example. the study of transcription and translation in chro moplasts derived from proplastids would not be confounded by chloroplast transcripts of differing stability remaining after chromoplast differentiation.

50066,Complete nucleotide sequence of the rabbit beta-like globin gene cluster: insights into evolution and regulation.,1989,RC Hardison and JB Margot and GW Demers,316,,,1-17,,The general pattern of sequence matches between the beta-like globin gene clusters of rabbits and humans are summarized in Fig. 7. The regions of matching sequences are shaded. and it can be seen that the matches extend from one end of the gene cluster to the other. This provides very strong evidence that the ancestral species had a gene cluster containing the parents to all the contemporary beta-like globin genes in the same arrangement that we observe today. Much of the intergenic DNA has been diverging at a rate consistent with neutral drift. but smaller regions can be detected that are diverging more slowly and which are good candidates for functional sequences. The comparisons between this same gene cluster in mouse and humans show many fewer matches in the intergenic regions (Shehee et al.. 1989). indicating either an earlier split between rodents and primates or a faster rate of divergence in rodents. However. this more divergent sequence may prove particularly valuable in a search for functional sequences. especially in a three-way alignment between the sequenced gene clusters. Every repetitive element in homologous segments of the rabbit and human beta-like globin gene clusters interrupts the homology; no repeat is in the same position in both species. Hence all the repeats have been inserted into the gene clusters after the divergence between lagomorphs and primates. This is true even for the L1 repeats. which are very similar between species in their ORF regions. This pattern of interspersion of repeats in long orthologous regions shows that many members of the LINE and SINE families are recent additions to …,True,waPNWUYAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,0,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2694173,,,,,0

At the molecular level. main nutrient and hormonal signaling pathways impinge on expression of genes encoding for metabolic enzymes. Among the major components of this transcriptional circuitry are the PGC-1α transcriptional complexes. An important regulatory mechanism of this complex is through acetylation and SIRT1-mediated lysine de-acetylation under low nutrient conditions. Activation of SIRT1 can mimic several metabolic aspects of calorie restriction that target selective nutrient utilization and mitochondrial oxidative function to regulate energy balance.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is closely associated with insulin resistance and might contribute to the progression of diabetes 3. 4. Here we used previously generated mice 5 with hepatic insulin resistance owing to the deletion of the genes encoding insulin receptor substrate-1 (Irs-1) and Irs-2 (referred to here as double-knockout (DKO) mice) to establish the molecular link between dysregulated insulin action and mitochondrial function.

HGP is dynamically controlled by a signaling/transcriptional network that regulates the expression/activity of gluconeogenic enzymes. A key mediator of gluconeogenic gene transcription is PGC-1α. PGC-1α's activation of gluconeogenic gene expression is dependent upon its acetylation state. which is controlled by the acetyltransferase GCN5 and the deacetylase Sirt1. Nevertheless. whether other chromatin modifiers—particularly other sirtuins—can modulate PGC-1α acetylation is currently unknown. Herein. we report that Sirt6 strongly controls PGC-1α acetylation.

Diabetes is likely to be an important risk factor for atherosclerosis. as hyperglycemia induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration and may thus contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. This study was performed to investigate whether PGC-1α. a PPARγ coactivator and metabolic master regulator. plays a role in regulating VSMC proliferation and migration induced by high glucose.  Methodology/Principal Findings PGC-1α mRNA levels are decreased in blood vessel media of STZ-treated diabetic rats. In cultured rat VSMCs. high glucose dose-dependently inhibits PGC-1α mRNA expression. Overexpression of PGC-1α either by infection with adenovirus. or by stimulation with palmitic acid. significantly reduces high glucose-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In contrast. suppression of PGC-1α by siRNA mimics the effects of glucose on VSMCs. Finally. mechanistic studies suggest that PGC-1α-mediated inhibition of VSMC proliferation and migration is regulated through preventing ERK1/2 phosphorylation.  Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that PGC-1α is a key regulator of high glucose-induced proliferation and migration in VSMCs. and suggest that elevation of PGC-1α in VSMC could be a useful strategy in preventing the development of diabetic atherosclerosis.,True,DjD492gAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC,56,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004182,12848434404564457438,/scholar?cites=12848434404564457438,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004182,0

The IBAT mass. tissue protein content. mitochondrial protein content. total COX activity and specific GDP binding were significantly increased by the cafeteria diet. The thermogenic response to fasting and refeeding was different between control and cafeteria obese rats. Thus. in control rats. the loss of mitochondrial protein as well as total COX activity are probably the main responses to fasting. whereas in cafeteria obese rats no changes in mitochondrial protein and total COX activity occur during fasting. Furthermore mitochondrial protein and total COX activity were not recovered during refeeding in control rats. and no changes occurred in cafeteria fed rats.

Hope has now become attached to small molecule inhibitors targeting the melanoma oncogene BRAF (V600E) and approaches to unleash the immune system against these tumors. Still. not every patient will be given respite from these treatments. and the ultimate goal of durable disease remission remains elusive. While it is incompletely understood what the functional barriers to achieving durable responses are. eventual relapse is likely a consequence of a variable degree of cancer heterogeneity that enables selective outgrowth of resistant tumor clones. However. identification of alternative molecular targets that could be used for combinatorial exploit holds promises to extend these initial responses. and may afford sustainable treatment.In 2011. the BRAF-targeted inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) was found to improve survival for patients with BRAF (V600E)-mutant melanomas [1]. Most. but not all. BRAF (V600E) melanomas will respond to BRAF-targeted drugs. and yet drug resistance will eventually curb patients’ long-term therapeutic benefit. Understanding the cellular mechanisms that preclude initial treatment efficacy (primary resistance) to oncogenetargeted drugs is expected to pave the way for rational combinatorial drug approaches. In addition to reducing the tumor burden. improving these initial responses could also enhance immune-mediated eradication of divergent tumor clones through broadly increasing cancer antigen presentation.

50204,Elevated O‐GlcNAc Cycling on FOXO1A Mediates Inappropriate Hepatic Gluconeogenesis,2006,Michael Patrick Housley and Joseph Thomas Rodgers and Pere Puigserver and Gerald Warren Hart,20,,5,A955-A955,Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,Hepatic gluconeogenesis. which is normally suppressed by insulin. is abnormally activated in diabetes. The transcription factor FOXO1A controls expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes. PEPCK and Glucose‐6‐Phosphatase. Insulin signaling results in the nuclear exclusion of FOXO1A but post‐translational regulation of transactivation within the nucleus also occurs. Dynamic Modification of proteins by O‐GlcNAc serves as a nutrient and stress sensor and is often competitive with phosphorylation. Anti‐O‐GlcNAc antibodies and lectin studies have shown that FOXO1A is O‐GlcNAcylated. Increased flux into the UDP‐GlcNAc (donor for O‐GlcNAcylation) synthesis pathway increases FOXO1A transcriptional activity in an O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) dependent manner. Hyperglycemia increases O‐GlcNAcylation of FOXO1A in heptaoma cells and this increase is reversed by insulin.

During low oxygen conditions these prolines are no longer hydroxylated and HIF-1α degradation is blocked. Hypoxia-induced miRNA-210 (miR-210) is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1α but its complete role and targets during hypoxia are not well understood. Here. we identify the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like (GPD1L) as a novel regulator of HIF-1α stability and direct target of miR-210. Expression of miR-210 results in stabilization of HIF-1α due to decreased levels of GPD1L resulting in an increase in HIF-1α target genes.

50230,11 Nuclear Chromatin Factors Defining Mitochondrial Bioenergetics,2012,Pere Puigserver and Leonard Guarente,,Mitochondrial Signaling in Health and Disease,,225,CRC Press,Mitochondria are cellular organelles. which uniquely contain their own genetic system in a circular DNA. Biogenesis of mitochondria and activation of mitochondrial functions require a full coordination between the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes—a process that is integrated by the action of nuclear chromatin factors (Poyton and McEwen 1996). A major function of mitochondria is to maintain the bioenergetic cellular state through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) sustained by catabolic pathways (Hatefi 1985; Wallace et al. 2010). Other important cellular processes such as apoptosis also depend on mitochondrial components interacting with cytoplasmic factors leading to cell death (Oberst et al. 2008). Genetic or signaling dysregulation of mitochondria cause a broad myriad of pathologies affecting systemic and tissue-specific functions (Wallace 2005; DiMauro and Hirano 2009). Hence. the inability of mitochondria to adequately respond to nutrient and environmental signals is a whole signature of metabolic instability linked to age-associated diseases. including the metabolic syndrome. neurodegeneration. or cancer. Here. we will discuss nuclear chromatin regulatory components. which impinge on mitochondrial bioenergetic function and maintain a “healthy” cellular and tissue state with implications for organismal survival and longevity.11.2 nUclear tranScriptional control oF Mitochondrial FUnctionMitochondrial organelles contain approximately 1.500 proteins. most of which are encoded by the nuclear genome (Calvo and Mootha 2010).

Here. a summary of the accomplished tasks is provided. Task 1. a detailed analysis of the role of Pc3 and WDR18 on GCN5-mediated transcription on gluconeogenic genes has been performed. Task 2. we have confirmed that Pc3 and WDR18 are part of the PGC-1 GCN5 complex but are not required for its assembly. Task 3. we identified the major acetylation sites on PGC-1 that account for the pro-gluconeogenic effects. Task 4. we have identified the mechanisms whereby GCN5 suppress PGC-1 activity. in part through Pc3 and WDR18. Task 5. we have analyzed the suppressive effects of GCN5 on hepatic glucose metabolism. Task 6. we have identified that additional GCN5 interacting proteins including the Sirtuin 6 activate GCN5 and suppress hepatic glucose output. The final conclusions are that PGC-1 acetylation is a key chemical switch that in response to fedfasting controls liver metabolism.Descriptors:,True,DjD492gAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA551301,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA551301.pdf,0

For example. nutrient deprivation increases genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and glucose production. A key control occurs at the transcriptional level and coordinates the expression of metabolic genes. Among the major components of this transcriptional circuitry are the PGC‐1α transcriptional coactivator complexes. Using skeletal muscle cells as a metabolic model system we found a nutrient sensing pathway that control fatty acid mitochondrial oxidative function. This pathway involves a response to low nutrients and glucose that in a cell‐autonomous manner switches from glucose to fatty acid oxidation via an increase in a specific subset of mitochondrial genes. This coordination switch to fatty acid oxidation and full respiration activities is controlled through a …,True,DjD492gAAAAJ:ldfaerwXgEUC,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.22.1_supplement.114.2,,,,,0

An important molecular component that drives this cellular oxidative process is the transcriptional coactivator PGC‐1a. We have previously identified that deacetylation of PGC‐1a by SIRT1 is increased in response to nutrient restriction and induces hepatic glucose production. More recently. we have also found that SIRT1 strongly deacetylates PGC‐1a in skeletal muscle cells and is required for complete activation of PGC‐1a‐induced mitochondrial and fatty acid utilization genes as well as increased rates of complete fatty acid oxidation.

It also describes the relation of the three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms in the molecule of 2-zinc insulin crystal to the solution properties of insulin (particularly its states of aggregation). to the chemical reaction and chemical modification of the molecule. and to its primary biological activity. Normally the insulin crystals contain two zinc ions to every six molecules of insulin—a hexamer. The slow solution of the crystals provides a method of delaying the action of insulin that closely parallels the methods adopted in the pancreas itself for the storage and release of insulin.

However. the traditional method of drug discovery. based upon random screening and systematic modification of leads by medicinal chemistry techniques. will probably not be abandoned completely because it has a potentially important advantage over more structure-based methods--namely. leads identified in this way are unlikely to show a close resemblance to the natural ligand or substrate. They may. therefore. have advantages in terms of patent novelty. selectivity. or pharmacokinetic profile. However. such leads could then serve as the basis for structure-based. rational modification programs. in which their interactions with target receptors are defined (as we have described) and improved molecules are designed. A final important point to be made about structure-based design in drug discovery is that. while it can be of great use in the initial process of identifying ligands with improved affinity and selectivity in vitro. it can usually say very little about other essential aspects of the drug discovery process. eg the need to achieve an adequate pharmacokinetic profile and low toxicity in vivo.

Sequences similarity dendrograms indicate that the evolution of these receptors occurs at two sites (the G protein-coupling regions and the ligand binding site) and this results in convergent as well as divergent evolution. Amino acid substitution patterns at each position in the alignment discriminate between the internal residues and those that face the lipid and the periodicity in these patterns matches that of the classical alpha-helix. The point at which the fifth transmembrane helix protrudes into the cytoplasm and the point at which the seventh transmembrane helix protrudes on the extracellular side of the bilayer are detected.

Ltd,The recently characterised 299‐residue human XLF/Cernunnos protein plays a crucial role in DNA repair by non‐homologous end joining (NHEJ) and interacts with the XRCC4–DNA Ligase IV complex. Here. we report the crystal structure of the XLF (1–233) homodimer at 2.3 Å resolution. confirming the predicted structural similarity to XRCC4. The XLF coiled‐coil. however. is shorter than that of XRCC4 and undergoes an unexpected reverse in direction giving rise to a short distorted four helical bundle and a C‐terminal helical structure wedged between the coiled‐coil and head domain. The existence of a dimer as the major species is confirmed by size‐exclusion chromatography. analytical ultracentrifugation. small‐angle X‐ray scattering and other biophysical methods. We show that the XLF structure is not easily compatible with a proposed XRCC4:XLF heterodimer. However. we demonstrate interactions …,True,MKr0KQoAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,127,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601942,7572718581974291645,/scholar?cites=7572718581974291645,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/sj.emboj.7601942,0

CP‐69.799 is an oligopeptide transition‐‐state analogue inhibitor that contains a new dipeptide isostere at the P1‐P1′ position. This dipeptide isostere is a nitrogen analogue of the well‐explored hydroxyethylene dipeptide isostere. wherein the tetrahedral P1′ C alpha atom has been replaced by trigonal nitrogen. The inhibitor binds in the extended conformation. filling S4 to S3′ pockets. with hydroxyl group of the P1 residue positioned symmetrically between the two catalytic aspartates of the enzyme. Interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme include 12 hydrogen bonds and extensive van der Waals contacts in all the pockets. except for S3′.

Residues are allotted to one of 216 (or 54) classes of combinations of structural features. These include nine main-chain conformation classes. three classes of side-chain accessibility and eight (or two) classes of side-chain involvement in three types of hydrogen bond. Seven different main-chain conformational classes outside of regions of regular structure were identified in an analysis of the distributions of φ-ψ torsion angles in 84 high-resolution crystallographic structures. Residue substitutions at equivalent positions in the structural alignments are included where the main-chain conformational class is conserved.

They are required for both development and maintenance of vertebrates. demonstrating an exquisite pattern of affinities for both protein and proteoglycan receptors. Recent crystal structures have suggested two models for the complex between FGFs. FGF receptors (FGFRs) and the proteoglycan heparan sulphate that mediates signalling. and have provided insight into how FGFs show differing affinities for the range of FGFRs. However. the physiological relevance of the two different models has not been made clear. Here. we demonstrate that the two complexes can be prepared from the same protein components. confirming that neither complex is the product of misfolded protein samples.

50365,Molecular anatomy: phyletic relationships derived from three-dimensional structures of proteins,1990,Mark S Johnson and Michael J Sutcliffe and Tom L Blundell,30,Journal of molecular evolution,1,43-59,Springer-Verlag,A distance measure that reflects the dissimilarity among structures has been developed on the basis of the three-dimensional structures of similar proteins. this being totally independent of sequence in the sense that only the relative spatial positions of mainchain alpha-carbon atoms need be known. This procedure leads to phyletic relationships that are in general correlated with the sequence phylogenies based on residue type. Such relationships among known protein three-dimensional structures are also a useful aid to their classification and selection in knowledge-based modeling using homologous structures. We have applied this approach to six homologous sets of proteins: immunoglobulin fragments. globins. cytochromesc. serine proteinases. eye-lens gamma crystallins. and dinucleotide-binding domains.,True,MKr0KQoAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,124,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02102452.pdf,17082425511638011103,/scholar?cites=17082425511638011103,,,0

The human lysosomal aspartic proteinase cathepsin D is thought to function in the normal degradation of intracellular and endocytosed proteins but has also emerged as a prognostic indicator of breast tumor invasiveness. Presented here are results from a continuing effort to elucidate the factors that contribute to specificity of ligand binding at individual subsites within the cathepsin D active site.The synthetic peptide Lys‐Pro‐Ile‐Glu‐Phe*Nph‐Arg‐Leu has proven to be an excellent chromogenic substrate for cathepsin D yielding a value of kcat/Km = 0.92 × 10−6 s−1 M−1 for enzyme isolated from human placenta.
