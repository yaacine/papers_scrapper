With such purpose. worts from different kinds of malt (pale. caramel and roasted) were chemically characterized (e.g. antioxidant activity. polyphenols and melanoidins contents) and studied by several chromatographic techniques. Molecular exclusion chromatography experiments showed that adsorption of XN to polyvinylpolypyrrolidone is lower for the high molecular weight fractions. It seems likely that this is due to the reaction between XN and coloured substances that changes chemical properties of XN or. at least. results in the formation of complexes that have different chemical properties. This leads to an inhibition of XN isomerization observed in this work. It was also verified that the melanoidins content was significantly …,True,52to97IAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996910003698,17617060338925788050,/scholar?cites=17617060338925788050,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48074283/Influence_of_malt_on_the_xanthohumol_and20160815-31376-ls5j0n.pdf,0,0,0

A lot of efforts have been made to replace petroleum-based resources. Among renewable resources. vegetable oils present various advantages going from their availability to the large range of possible chemical modifications they permit. Firstly. the vegetable oil chemical composition and the main commercially available vegetable oil precursors are exposed. Concerning vegetable oils-based polyurethanes. research groups first focused on cross-linked systems directly from triglycerides then on thermoplastic ones from fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters. This manuscript focuses on thermoplastic PUs and underlines the literature about the introduction of hydroxyl groups and isocyanate functions onto triglycerides and fatty acid derivatives. Besides. in a view to the isocyanate/alcohol approach. vegetable oil-based thermoplastic PUs and corresponding diols and diisocyanates are described in details.,True,1P_r_jQAAAAJ:mKu_rENv82IC,27,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01373161/,16460285771662169591,/scholar?cites=16460285771662169591,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01373161/document,0,0,0

ADMET copolymerization conducted in bulk yielded a series of copolyesters with various degrees of branching with respect to the feed ratio between the two α.ω-dienes. After hydrogenation. these copolyesters showed thermo-mechanical properties in accordance with the ones of LLDPE and VLDPE with tunable melting points between 50 °C and 90 °C. As expected. and similarly to the “PE-like” polyesters reported in the literature. the presence of ester functions distributed along the polyethylene backbone slightly lowered the crystalline ability of the so-formed polyesters. Nevertheless. these novel bio-based polyesters constitute a good sustainable alternative to olefin-based elastomers (LLDPE and VLDPE). especially for specific applications which require degradability.,True,1P_r_jQAAAAJ:6bLC7aUMtPcC,24,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/gc/c3gc42280a,11228638050204422021,/scholar?cites=11228638050204422021,,https://pubs.rsc.org/no/content/getauthorversionpdf/C3GC42280A,0,0,0

Under milder conditions (100 bar. 70 °C). radical ethylene polymerization is assumed ineffective which has been confirmed in bulk (supercritical ethylene). However. we have shown that the efficiency of this polymerization is strongly dependent on the solvent. This unusual activation by solvent has been rationalized using theoretical considerations.

Desiraju’s article is thought provoking and brings together some of the current thinking on this increasingly topical area (now the subject of a dedicated web resource4). In his letter Desiraju makes two main points that we feel deserve consideration and debate by the community lest they become ‘‘accepted wisdom’’by default. Firstly Desiraju ‘goes out on a limb’to suggest a reason why ‘‘the number of organic Z9. 1 structure has remained stubbornly fixed over the decades’’.

Visualized Exp,,1-12,,Lignin valorization strategies are a key factor for achieving more economically competitive biorefineries based on lignocellulosic biomass. Most of the emerging elegant procedures to obtain specific aromatic products rely on the lignin substrate having a high content of the readily cleavable β-O-4 linkage as present in the native lignin structure. This provides a miss-match with typical technical lignins that are highly degraded and therefore are low in β-O-4 linkages. Therefore. the extraction yields. and the quality of the obtained lignin are of utmost importance to access new lignin valorization pathways. In this manuscript. a simple protocol is presented to obtain lignins with high β-O-4 content by relatively mild ethanol extraction that can be applied to different lignocellulose sources. Furthermore. analysis procedures to determine the quality of the lignins are presented together with a depolymerization protocol that yields specific phenolic 2-arylmethyl-1. 3-dioxolanes. which can be used to evaluate the obtained lignins. The presented results demonstrate the link between lignin quality and potential for the lignins to be depolymerized into specific monomeric aromatic chemicals. Overall. the extraction and depolymerization demonstrates a trade-off between the lignin extraction yield and the retention of the native aryl-ether structure and thus the potential of the lignin to be used as the substrate for the production of chemicals for higher-value applications.,True,cKNdLb0AAAAJ:G36d5HCDkJYC,22,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/75103436/document_9_.pdf,3198685287547615321,/scholar?cites=3198685287547615321,,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/75103436/document_9_.pdf,0,0,0

In general. high-quality oils (up to 29 wt% total monomers) with an average relative composition of 55% alkylphenolics and 27% aromatics were obtained. Detailed structural investigations showed that the S-G aromatic unit content of the lignins was the most important factor positively affecting overall oil yields.

The cascade reaction takes advantage of the ability of the oxidase to produce coniferyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide from eugenol and molecular oxygen. The hydrogen peroxide is used by the peroxidase for the formation of crosslinks that typify lignin. As eugenol oxidase has a broad substrate acceptance profile. also 4‐allylphenol (chavicol) and 4‐allyl‐2.6‐dimethoxyphenol could be used as precursors of the synthetic lignin.

This is currently hindered by the application of fractionation methods that significantly alter the lignin structure to give highly recalcitrant materials. For this reason. it can be highly beneficial to use less-severe fractionation conditions that allow for efficient extraction of lignin with retention of the β-aryl ether (β-O-4) content. Here. we present a detailed study on mild alcohol-based organosolv fractionation with the aim of understanding how to achieve a balance between efficiency of lignin extraction and the structure of the resulting lignin polymers. using walnut shells as model biomass.

Milder fractionation processes allow for the isolation of lignins that are high in β-aryl ether (β-O-4) content. however. at reduced extraction efficiency. The development of improved lignin extraction methods using mild conditions is therefore desired. For this reason. a flow-through setup for mild ethanosolv extraction (120 C) was developed. The influence of acid concentration. ethanol/water ratio. and the use of other linear alcohol co-solvents on the delignification efficiency and the β-O-4 content were evaluated. With walnut shells as model feedstock. extraction efficiencies of over 55% were achieved. yielding lignin with a good structural quality in terms of β-O-4 linking motifs (typically over 60 per 100 aromatic units). For example. lignin containing 66 β-O-4 linking motifs was obtained with an 80: 20 n-propanol/water ratio. 0.18 MH 2 SO 4 with overall a good extraction efficiency of 57% after 5 h. The majority of the lignin was extracted in the first 2 hours and this lignin showed the best structural quality. Compared to batch extractions. both higher lignin extraction efficiency and higher β-O-4 content were obtained using the flow setup.

CAs are produced from cellulose sources such as: cotton. sugar cane bagasse. wood and others. One promissory source of cellulose is bacterial cellulose (BC). In this work. CA was produced from the homogeneous acetylation reaction of bacterial cellulose. Degree of substitution (DS) values can be controlled by the acetylation time.

Comparison of thermal behavior of the samples under combustion (N2/O2) and oxy-combustion (CO2/O2) reveals that replacing N2 by CO2 causes displacement of mass loss steps to higher temperatures and increases some DTG peaks. Higher heat capacity of carbon dioxide and higher partial pressure of CO2 molecules in relation to N2 ones explain these observations.

The mass ratios between Pt and CeO2 (3:1. 2:1. 1:1. 1:2. 1:3) were confirmed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDAX). X-ray diffraction (XRD) structural characterization data shows that the Pt-CeO2/C catalysts are composed of nanosized polycrystalline non-alloyed deposits. from which reflections corresponding to the fcc (Pt) and fluorite (CeO2) structures were clearly observed. The mean crystallite sizes calculated from XRD data revealed that. independent of the mass ratio. a value close to 3 nm was obtained for the CeO2 particles.

These issues in the field of nanomaterials are challenging to address and would greatly benefit from the precision and programmability of biomaterials such as DNA.

The optimal pH range for DNA to guide nanoparticle growth was investigated. In addition to shape control. precise positioning and assembly of nanoparticles are also important.

A notable exception to this paradigm is provided by two GTPases in the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor (SR) that control the co-translational targeting of proteins to cellular membranes. Instead of the classical “GTPase switch.” both the SRP and SR undergo a series of discrete conformational rearrangements during their interaction with one another. culminating in their reciprocal GTPase activation.

However. the precise mechanism by which high fidelity is achieved is not well understood for any protein-targeting pathway. To address this fundamental question. we investigated the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway in Escherichia coli. which delivers proteins to the bacterial inner membrane through recognition of signal sequences on cargo proteins. Fidelity was thought to arise from the inability of SRP to bind strongly to incorrect cargos. Using biophysical assays. we found that incorrect cargos were also rejected through a series of checkpoints during subsequent steps of targeting. Thus. high fidelity of substrate selection is achieved through the cumulative effect of multiple checkpoints; this principle may be generally applicable to other pathways involving selective signal recognition.,True,4fi20e4AAAAJ:OjREftYh6kAC,101,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/757.abstract,1911092384981604230,/scholar?cites=1911092384981604230,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760334/,0,0,0

Previous studies have shown that a universally conserved SRP RNA facilitates an efficient SRP–SR interaction in the presence of a signal sequence bound to SRP. However. a remarkable exception has been found in chloroplast SRP (cpSRP) pathway. in which the SRP RNA is missing. Based on biochemical and structural analyses. it is proposed that free cpSRP receptor (cpFtsY) has already been preorganized into a closed state for efficient cpSRP–cpFtsY association. However. no direct evidence has been reported to support this postulation thus far.

The “GTPase switch” paradigm. in which a GTPase acts as a bimodal switch that is turned “on” and “off” by external regulatory factors. has been used to interpret the regulatory mechanism of many GTPases for more than two decades. Nevertheless. recent work has unveiled an emerging class of “multistate” regulatory GTPases that do not adhere to this classical paradigm. Instead of relying on external nucleotide exchange factors or GTPase activating proteins to switch between the on and off states. these GTPases have the intrinsic ability to exchange nucleotides and to sense and respond to upstream and downstream factors. In contrast to the bimodal nature of the GTPase switch. these GTPases undergo multiple conformational rearrangements. allowing multiple regulatory …,True,4fi20e4AAAAJ:YW75zINC-7AC,38,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi9006989,9626816687883352196,/scholar?cites=9626816687883352196,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883566/,0,0,0

Detection of such conformational changes was enabled by a fluorogenic ligand that fluoresces upon AgHalo forming soluble aggregates.

1148005,Prototype co-Pyrolysis of used lubricant oil and mixed plastic waste to produce a diesel-like fuel,2018,Natacha Phetyim and Sommai Pivsa-Art,11,Energies,11,2973,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The co-pyrolysis of used lubricant oil blended with plastic waste. namely high-density polyethylene (HDPE). polypropylene (PP). and polystyrene (PS). to produce a diesel-like fuel was studied. The proportions of the raw materials were optimized using laboratory scale pyrolysis at atmospheric pressure at a final temperature of 450 C without a catalyst. The ratios of used lubricant oil (Oil) and plastic waste (Oil: HDPE: PP: PS) investigated were 50: 30: 20: 0. 50: 30: 0: 20. 50: 0: 30: 20. and 50: 30: 10: 10 by weight. It was found that the oil produced using an Oil: HDPE: PP: PS ratio of 50: 30: 20: 0 exhibited most of the properties of standard diesel oil as specified by the Ministry of Energy (Thailand). except for its flash point. which was lower than the standard. Therefore. this proportion was utilized for the scaled-up testing in the co-pyrolysis prototype (10 kg/day). Three reactor temperature ranges (less than 400 C. 400–425 C. and 425–450 C) were studied. and the properties of the oil products were analysed. The oil products produced at 400–425 C exhibited diesel-like fuel properties.

Among the 64 triplet codons. only the three nonsense “stop” codons have been used to encode non-native amino acids. Use of quadruplet “frame-shift” suppressor codons provides an abundant alternative but suffers from low suppression efficiency as a result of competing recognition of their first three bases by endogenous host tRNAs or release factors. Deletion of release factor 1 in a genomically recoded strain of E. coli (E. coli C321). in which all endogenous amber stop codons (UAG) are replaced with UAA. abolished UAG mediated translation termination. Here we show that a Methanocaldococcus jannaschii-derived frame-shift suppressor tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair enhanced UAGN suppression efficiency in this recoded bacterial strain. These results demonstrate that efficient quadruplet codons for encoding nonnative amino acids can be generated by eliminating competing triplet codon recognition at the ribosome.With rare exceptions. proteins in all domains of life are biosynthesized from the same 20 canonical amino acids. which are encoded by 61 triplet codons. The expansion of this standard genetic code to allow the site-specific introduction of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms has provided a powerful new tool to both probe and manipulate protein structure and function.[1] The ncAA of interest is encoded by a nonsense or frame-shift codon and is co-translationally incorporated by using a cognate tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase …,True,zeSNxNcAAAAJ:PYBJJbyH-FwC,37,https://xiao.rice.edu/Publication/12.pdf,12193613776627359759,/scholar?cites=12193613776627359759,,https://xiao.rice.edu/Publication/12.pdf,0,0,0

The conductance of such contacts varies in a stepwise fashion with a tendency to quantize near integer multiples of the conductance quantum (G0) but can also deviate significantly from integer values upon molecular adsorption. However. for sensing applications it is first necessary to coat the contact permanently to avoid nonspecific adsorption. Here. we show that marked differences are observed between atomic contacts generated in water. and in water/β-CD. In this latter medium. atomic contacts with unusual properties can be generated.

Conference Proceedings",,903-906,Australian Society of Agronomy Inc,Up to 60% of phosphorus (P) in soil is organic. Because plants generally access organic P via biochemical transformation to orthophosphate (inorganic P)(Marschner et al.. 2011). understanding how organic P is converted to inorganic P may ultimately allow for reductions in orthophosphate fertiliser use. Three analytical techniques to better understand organic P processes were applied to dairy farm soils from treatments within P× K fertiliser trials at three sites in Victoria. Australia: the Northern Irrigation Region (NIR). south-western Victoria (SW Vic). and Gippsland. Analyses included:(i) physicochemical to measure total and available N.

1148136,Nitrogen fluxes in dairy farm soils in response to fertilizer or “urine”,2019,Michael W Heaven and Craig Beverly and Cameron Gourley and Jenny Collins and Sharon Aarons and Michael Adelana and Thabo Thayalakumaran and Evan Dresel,,,,,,Nitrogen (N). a key nutrient for pastures. can be lost into the atmosphere or leached though the soil into groundwater. Leaching of N into water courses is an issue in Victoria and globally (Galloway et al.. 2008). For dairy farms. the rate of emission to the atmosphere. or leaching through to groundwater. is dependent on several factors that include weather conditions. soil characteristics. cultivar response. timing of fertiliser applications. and management of defoliation (Selbie et al.. 2015). N inputs in Australian grazed pasture systems has increased over the last 20 years with average annual N fertiliser application rates of 93 kg/ha (Stott and Gourley. 2016). Purchased feed inputs has likewise grown. with mean supplementary dietary N up to 69% of grazed N intake (Aarons et al.. 2017). The high N intakes (545 g N/cow per day) of Australian dairy cows is in excess of the recommended 400 g N/cow per day. suggesting that N excretion is likely to be high and will primarily occur as urinary N (Castillo et al.. 2000). Dairy cow urinations can apply up to 1000 kg/ha N to the soil surface (Eckard et al.. 2004) and as such. urine input loads on an impacted land basis can be an order of magnitude greater than typical fertiliser application loads. These high urinary N loads are likely to exceed plant requirements leading to the potential for losses to the environment.N can move slowly through the soil profile with research showing that applied N from urine can take up to 6 months to pass through the root zone (Pakrou and Dillon. 2000). Seasonal effects have been shown to significantly change the movement of N (Snow et al... 2011).

1148137,Nitrogen species distribution in groundwater: A review of historical data with recent sampling in the Gippsland (Victoria. Australia),2016,Michael Adelana and Michael Heaven and Mark Holmberg and Matt Kitching and George Croatto,,,,,,In agricultural regions diffuse pollution by nitrate is considered one of the main causes of groundwater quality deterioration. For agricultural systems that are pasture based. the input loads (eg fertiliser. cow dung and urine) can result in loss of nutrients. Hence. shallow groundwater aquifers in agricultural areas are susceptible to nitrate contamination from losses of N by leaching. A review of historical data. together with recent sampling. was carried out in the Gippsland region of Victoria to map distribution of N-species in shallow aquifer systems. This review revealed that there is limited routine monitoring of nitrate in groundwater. Nevertheless. based on the limited historical spatial and temporal groundwater chemistry data available. the concentrations of nitrate and ammonium are generally below Australian water quality (ANZECC) limits in the shallow unconfined aquifer in West Gippsland. However. localized clusters of values higher than the ANZECC limit exist in alluvium near Mitchell River. East Gippsland. In all confined deep aquifer samples the concentrations were found to decrease further. An analysis of groundwater chemistry could not identify a correlation between land use or soil and the concentrations of groundwater nitrate and total nitrogen. Only shallow piezometer samples at Willow Grove. West Gippsland suggested high nitrate reductions under intensely grazed dairy soils.

Structurally distinct RNA and DNA oligonucleotides. aptamers mimic small. protein-binding molecules and exhibit high binding affinity and selectivity. Although their molecular weight is relatively small—approximately one-tenth that of monoclonal antibodies—their complex tertiary folded structures create sufficient recognition surface area for tight interaction with target molecules. Additionally. unlike antibodies. aptamers can be readily chemically synthesized and modified. In addition. aptamers’ long storage period and low immunogenicity are favorable properties for clinical utility. Due to their flexibility of chemical modification. aptamers are conjugated to other chemical entities including chemotherapeutic agents. siRNA. nanoparticles. and solid phase surfaces for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However. as relatively small sized oligonucleotides. aptamers present several challenges for successful clinical translation. Their short plasma half-lives due to nuclease degradation and rapid renal excretion necessitate further structural modification of aptamers for clinical application.

Electrodes are constructed using a Nafion film to encapsulate PSI as well as the hole-scavenging redox mediator Os(bpy)2Cl2. The photoactive electrodes generate photocurrents of 4 μA/cm2 when illuminated with 1.4 mW/cm2 of 676 nm band-pass filtered light. Methyl viologen (MV2+) is present in the electrolyte to scavenge photoelectrons from PSI in the Nafion film and transport charges to the counter electrode. Because MV2+ is positively charged in both reduced and oxidized states. it is able to diffuse through the cation permeable channels of Nafion.

Cathode contamination is inevitable in a single-chamber MFC yet it is impossible to study the magnitude of this effect in the single-chambered format. Therefore to study the effect of contamination at the cathode two-chamber MFCs must be used. The advantages of the two-chamber MFC design used in this study include: the assembled and filled fuel cell is autoclavable and the cathode can easily be moved from the submerged to air exposed position while maintaining sterility. This study was performed with the cathode in two positions: completely submerged in the catholyte and raised to a point where wicking action was used to coat the cathode with catholyte.

To understand the interactions between microorganisms in consortia. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is used to follow the concentrations of various metabolites such as sugars (eg. glucose. maltose). longer chain carbohydrates. and ethanol to optimize consortia conditions for the production of ethanol. It is shown that with proper design A. oryzae can digest food waste simulants into soluble sugars that S. cerevisiae can ferment into ethanol. Depending on the substrate and conditions used. concentrations of 13% ethanol were achieved in 10 days. It is further shown that a direct alcohol fuel cell (FC) can be coupled with these A. oryzae-enabled S. cerevisiae fermentations using a reverse osmosis membrane. This “bio-hybrid FC” continually extracted ethanol from an ongoing consortium. enhancing ethanol production and allowing the bio-hybrid FC to run for at least one week.

Both the local and semilocal exchange correlations result in half-metallicity in edge-passivated ZGNRs at a finite cross-ribbon electric field.

Here we demonstrate homogeneous surface oxidation of atomically thin WSe2 with a self-limiting thickness from single- to trilayers. Exposure to ozone (O3) below 100 °C leads to the lateral growth of tungsten oxide selectively along selenium zigzag-edge orientations on WSe2. With further O3 exposure. the oxide regions coalesce and oxidation terminates leaving a uniform thickness oxide film on top of unoxidized WSe2. At higher temperatures. oxidation evolves in the layer-by-layer regime up to trilayers. The oxide films formed on WSe2 are nearly atomically flat.

The calculations are carried out in full parameter space with explicit inclusion of the static bias and we compare the nature of spin-density-wave (SDW) and charge-density-wave (CDW) insulators under the influence of external electric fields. We find that. although the SDW (U> 2V) and CDW (U< 2V) insulators enter into a conducting state after a certain threshold bias. CDW insulators require much higher bias than the SDW insulators for insulator–metal transitions at zero temperature.

Nontrivial charge polarization induces robust edge states accompanied by fractional charge. In the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. it is known that the strong modulation of electron hopping causes nontrivial charge polarization even in the presence of inversion symmetry. Here. we consider a biatomic honeycomb lattice to introduce such strong modulation. ie. a A 3 B sheet. By tuning the hopping ratio and on-site potential difference between the A and B atoms. we show that the topological phase transition characterized by the Zak phase occurs. Furthermore. we propose that C 3 N and BC 3 are possible realistic materials on the basis of first-principles calculations.

This BDTDA lattice is commensurate with the triangular lattice of Cu (111). with the former being 3× 3 larger than the latter. The formation of the BDTDA monolayer structure. which is significantly different from its bulk form. is attributed to an interaction with the metal surface as well as the intermolecular assembling forces.

These copolymers exhibit potent antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria including methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus with no adverse hemolytic activity. Notably. these polymers also did not result in any measurable resistance development in E. coli.

A panel of PMAs with varied ratios of hydrophobic and cationic side chains were synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action. The PMAs are shown to be active against a panel of pathogenic bacteria. including a drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. compared to the natural antimicrobial peptide magainin which did not display any activity against the same strain. The selected PMAs with 47–63% of methyl groups in the side chains showed minimum inhibitory concentrations of≤ 2–31 µg/mL. but cause only minimal harm to human red blood cells. The PMAs also exhibit rapid bactericidal kinetics. Culturing Escherichia coli in the presence of the PMAs did not exhibit any potential to develop resistance against the PMAs. The antibacterial activities of PMAs against E. coli and S. aureus were slightly reduced in the presence of physiological salts. The activity of PMAs showed bactericidal effects against E. coli and S. aureus in both exponential and stationary growth phases. These results demonstrate that PMAs are a new antimicrobial platform with no observed development of resistance in bacteria. In addition. the PMAs permeabilized the E. coli outer membrane at polymer concentrations lower than their MIC values. but they did not show any effect on the bacterial inner membrane. This indicates that mechanisms other than membrane permeabilization may be the primary factors determining their antimicrobial activity.

This is surprising. since polymeric SMAMPs are heterogeneous in terms of chemical structure (random sequence) and conformation (random coil). in contrast to defined amino acid sequence and intrinsic secondary structure. To understand this better. we compare AMPs with a “minimal” mimic. a well-characterized family of polydisperse cationic methacrylate-based random copolymer SMAMPs. Specifically. we focus on a comparison between the quantifiable membrane curvature generating capacity. charge density. and hydrophobicity of the polymeric SMAMPs and AMPs.

We report modified electrochemical procedure for GQDs synthesis. Graphitic rods were thermal annealing at 1700 °C in vacuum and used for electrochemical quantum dots synthesis. We found that the modified GQDs (GQDs-1700) consist of two while in the structure of pristine (p-GQDs) three graphene layers are measured. The main structural difference between GQDs is the increased structural disorder. caused by a higher amount of the oxygen containing functional groups in the structure of GQDs-1700. The photoluminescence of GQDs-1700 is 4 times more intense. red shifted and with doubled Quantum Yield compared to p-GQDs.

Fluorescent hydrophobic carbon quantum dots are synthesized by bottom-up condensation method and used for deposition of uniform and homogeneous Langmuir-Blodgett thin films on different substrates. It is found that this kind of quantum dots generates singlet oxygen under blue light irradiation. Antibacterial and antibiofouling testing on four different bacteria strains (Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus aureus. Bacillus cereus. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) reveals enhanced antibacterial and antibiofouling activity of hydrophobic carbon dots thin films under blue light irradiation.

The aim of this study was to estimate dietary exposure to cadmium. lead. and mercury from free-living big game (fallow deer. roe deer. red deer. wild boar. and brown bear). and to mercury from small game (pheasant and hare). hunted in Croatia from 1990 to 2012. The exposure assessment was based on available literature data and our own measurements of metal levels in the tissues of the game. by taking into account different consumption frequencies (four times a year. once a month and once a week). Exposure was expressed as percentage of (provisional) tolerable weekly intake [(P) TWI] values set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Consumption of game meat (0.002-0.5% PTWI) and liver (0.005-6% PTWI) assumed for the general population (four times a year) does not pose a health risk to consumers from the general population. nor does monthly (0.02-6% PTWI) and weekly (0.1-24% PTWI) consumption of game meat. However. because of the high percentage of free-living game liver and kidney samples exceeding the legislative limits for cadmium (2-99%) and lead (1-82%). people should keep the consumption of certain game species’ offal as low as possible. Children and pregnant and lactating women should avoid eating game offal altogether. Free-living game liver could be an important source of cadmium if consumed on a monthly basis (3-74% TWI). and if consumed weekly (11-297% TWI). it could even give rise to …,True,iTlxwoYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,38,https://hrcak.srce.hr/126611,5562114831427186216,/scholar?cites=5562114831427186216,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/187087,0,0,0

The strategy involves the synthesis of several novel highly substituted aromatic compounds. such as 12 and 23. The lithium derivative of 12 readily engages in a nucleophilic addition to benzaldehyde 4 to provide the diphenylcarbinol rac‐15. The analogous benzyl ether rac‐16 undergoes an intramolecular Heck reaction to provide the required tetrahydroanthracene rac‐17. which can be transformed into the key tricyclic methyl ether rac‐20. In a second approach. the lithium derivative of 21 is added to the hexasubstituted benzaldehyde 23 to give the diphenylcarbinol rac‐35. Subsequent methylation to rac‐36 followed by an intramolecular Heck reaction provides tricycle rac‐37.

There are several pathways for compressive stress buildup in Sn coatings. which include the following: residual stress generated during plating; stress formation due to interfacial reactions between tin and copper substrate; mechanical stress; and thermal mechanical stress due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the tin layer and substrate during thermal cycling. In order to prevent or reduce whisker growth in tin deposits. compressive stress has to be eliminated or minimized.

1148488,Nonequilibrium viscosity of glass,2009,John C Mauro and Douglas C Allan and Marcel Potuzak,80,Physical Review B,9,094204,American Physical Society,Since glass is a nonequilibrium material. its properties depend on both composition and thermal history. While most prior studies have focused on equilibrium liquid viscosity. an accurate description of nonequilibrium viscosity is essential for understanding the low temperature dynamics of glass. Departure from equilibrium occurs as a glass-forming system is cooled through the glass transition range. The glass transition involves a continuous breakdown of ergodicity as the system gradually becomes trapped in a subset of the available configurational phase space. At very low temperatures a glass is perfectly nonergodic (or “isostructural”). and the viscosity is described well by an Arrhenius form. However. the behavior of viscosity during the glass transition range itself is not yet understood.

In order to quantify the cooling of such volcaniclastics. we have identified and separated two types of glassy fragments from these deposits on Loihi seamount: 1) fine (30–80 μm) limu o Pele bubble wall fragments and 2) coarser (0.8–1.2 mm) dense angular fragments. These pristine basaltic glasses have been subjected to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) from room temperature up to temperatures above their glass transition. Heat capacity (cp. in J g− 1 K− 1) data reveal glassy and liquid regimes separated by clear hysteresis behaviour within the glass transition. The transient cp in the glass transition interval exhibits a deep trough before the peak. indicating very high cooling rates.

The recently experienced demand for stronger and more damage resistant glasses creates opportunities for fundamental studies of the mechanical properties as a function of thermal history. This is because the properties of glassy materials are not only determined by their chemical composition. but also by their thermal history due to the non-equilibrium nature of the glassy state. Hence. understanding the relaxation behavior of the mechanical properties of glass is of great scientific and technological importance.

However. the cellular and molecular mechanism of fungal responses to such radiation remains poorly understood. Using the black yeast Wangiella dermatitidis as a model. we confirmed that ionizing radiation enhanced cell growth by increasing cell division and cell size. Using RNA-seq technology. we compared the transcriptomic profiles of the wild type and the melanin-deficient wdpks1 mutant under irradiation and non-irradiation conditions. It was found that more than 3000 genes were differentially expressed when these two strains were constantly exposed to a low dose of ionizing radiation and that half were regulated at least two fold in either direction. Functional analysis indicated that many genes for amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism and cell cycle progression were down-regulated and that a number of antioxidant genes and genes affecting membrane fluidity were up-regulated in both irradiated strains.

A data center can comprise many thousands of servers and can use as much energy as a small city. The massive amounts of computation power contained in these systems results in many interesting distributed systems and resource management problems. In this thesis we investigate challenges related to data centers. with a particular emphasis on how new virtualization technologies can be used to simplify deployment. improve resource efficiency. and reduce the cost of reliability. all in application agnostic ways. We first study problems that relate to the initial capacity planning required when deploying applications into a virtualized data center. We demonstrate how models of virtualization overheads can be utilized to accurately predict the resource needs of virtualized applications. allowing them to be smoothly transitioned into a data center. We next study how memory similarity can be used to guide placement when adding virtual machines to a data center. and demonstrate how memory sharing can be exploited to reduce the memory footprints of virtual machines. This allows for better server consolidation. reducing hardware and energy costs within the data center.

Therefore. to increase our knowledge about these cellular alterations that occur in the larvae of Neuroptera. we analyzed the cells that constitute the Malpighian tubules of each larval instar of the species Myrmeleon uniformis. with emphasis on nucleolar activity. Malpighian tubules. after being removed. were fixed on a slide using liquid nitrogen and stained by silver impregnation. In addition. total protein of the tubules was quantified. By analyzing the cells in the first instar larval stage. we observed only two silver-stained nucleolar regions. In cells of second instar larvae. there was an increase in the number of stained regions. and in the third instar. the number of nucleolar regions was very large. Agarose gel electrophoresis indicated that third instar larvae had high synthetic activity. where the total amount of proteins was larger in third instar stage than in the other larval stages. Furthermore. the most abundant proteins displayed molecular weights of about 32-43 kDa and were probably precursors of silk fibers. Thus. the results obtained showed that nucleolar alterations occur in the cells of the Malpighian tubules of larval instars of M. uniformis and this is directly related to the production of silk fibers used by the pupa to ensure the completion of metamorphosis.,True,guuMp1EAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,1,https://repositorio.unesp.br/handle/11449/117563,2384184506181368610,/scholar?cites=2384184506181368610,,https://repositorio.unesp.br/bitstream/handle/11449/117563/WOS000340383600047.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The mechanism of propulsion is via the Pt catalysed decomposition of H2O2 and it is understood that the Pt surface is highly susceptible to poisoning by sulphur-containing molecules. Here. we show that important extracellular thiols as well as basic organic molecules can significantly hamper the motion of catalytic microjet engines. This is due to two different mechanisms: (i) molecules such as dimethyl sulfoxide can quench the hydroxyl radicals produced at Pt surfaces and reduce the amount of oxygen gas generated and (ii) molecules containing –SH. –SSR. and –SCH3 moieties can poison the catalytically active platinum surface. inhibiting the motion of the jet engines.

Herein. we will show that with the introduction of a Ni segment into the Au/Ni/Pt nanotube design followed by consequent magnetization a permanent change in the magnetic domain orientation of the Ni segment can be induced. Consequently. this results in the presence of a permanent magnet within the nanojet with its north/south domains oriented along the tube axis. Such a magnetized nanojet orients itself according to the external magnetic field and propels itself toward or away from the source of the magnetic field depending on its orientation. This behavior is similar to that of the magnetotactic bacteria.

Here we describe a method for fabrication of concentric bimetallic microjets via an electrochemical deposition route. These microjet engines consist of an inner platinum layer which is responsible for the catalytic decomposition of H2O2. which subsequently results in bubble-propelled movement. The outer copper layer allows for further functionalization of the microjet engines. These microjet engines are able to move at speeds of ∼7 bodylengths s-1 at fuel concentrations as low as 0.2% (wt.) of H2O2. The described method obviates the need to use physical vapor deposition (sputtering) and thus is applicable in any low-end equipped laboratory.

Using an electrochemical deposition method. the bubble-ejecting nanojets were grown within the alumina template. which is commercially available. These fabricated nanosized devices have typical dimensions of 300 nm (diameter) by 4.5 μm (length). and they are able to move in a hydrogen peroxide fuel solution with velocities up to approximately 40 body lengths per second. They are also capable of exhibiting various modes of movement such as straight. screw-like and circular motions. in a similar manner comparable to larger micro-sized jets.

1148670,Geometric asymmetry driven Janus micromotors,2014,Guanjia Zhao and Martin Pumera,6,Nanoscale,19,11177-11180,Royal Society of Chemistry,The production and application of nano-/micromotors is of great importance. In order for the motors to work. asymmetry in their chemical composition or physical geometry must be present if no external asymmetric field is applied. In this paper. we present a “coconut” micromotor made of platinum through the partial or complete etching of the silica templates. It was shown that although both the inner and outer surfaces are made of the same material (Pt). motion of the structure can be observed as the convex surface is capable of generating oxygen bubbles.

The influence of the fuel concentration from 1 to 3 wt% of H2O2 in 0.5% steps and of the glycerol fraction from 0 to 64% in aqueous solution on the directionality of the microjets motions is examined systematically. We show that with decreasing Reynolds numbers of the system (that is. with increasing viscosity or decreasing velocity of the microjets). the directionality of the motion shifts from circular to linear motion. This translates to a shorter travel time towards a designated target for the microjets despite moving at a slower speed. since the movements are linear instead of circular.

It is unclear how these two ANGPTL proteins interact to regulate LPL activity. ANGPTL3 inhibits LPL activity and increases serum TG independent of ANGPTL8. These effects are reversed with an ANGPTL3 blocking antibody. Here. we show that ANGPTL8. although it possesses a functional inhibitory motif. is inactive by itself and requires ANGPTL3 expression to inhibit LPL and increase plasma TG. Using a mutated form of ANGPTL3 that lacks LPL inhibitory activity. we demonstrate that ANGPTL3 activity is not required for its ability to activate ANGPTL8. Moreover. coexpression of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 leads to a far more efficacious increase in TG in mice than ANGPTL3 alone. suggesting the major inhibitory activity of this complex derives from ANGPTL8.

FSHR extracellular domain (ECD) is predicted to have 8–9 αβ or leucine-rich repeat motif elements. The objective of this study was to identify elements of the FSHR ECD involved in ligand binding. Preincubation of recombinant hFSHR ECD with rabbit antisera raised against synthetic peptides of hFSHR ECD primary sequence abolished follitropin binding primarily in the region of amino acids 150–254. Accessibility of hFSHR ECD after hormone binding. captured by monoclonal antibodies against either ECD or FSH. was decreased for the region of amino acids 150–220 but additionally for amino acids 15–100.

Explicit proton and charge delocalization of the excess proton transport. via the Grotthuss hopping mechanism. were treated using the self-consistent multistate empirical valence bond (SCI-MS-EVB) method. The nature of the sulfonate−hydronium ion pair was characterized through analysis of free-energy profiles.

The membrane is “prepared” by starting with the Nafion chains placed on a cylinder having the water inside it. Minimizing the energy of the system leads to a filamentary hydrophilic domain whose structure depends on the degree of hydration. At 5 wt % water the system does not have enough water molecules to solvate all the ions that could be formed by the dissociation of the −SO3Na groups. As a result. the −SO3Na groups aggregate with the water to form very small droplets that do not join into a continuous phase. The size of the droplets is between 5 and 8 Å.

Yet a severe global glaciation during marine isotope stage (MIS) M2 interrupted this phase of global warmth ∼3.30 million years ago. and is seen as a premature attempt of the climate system to establish an ice-age world. Here we propose a conceptual model for the glaciation and deglaciation of MIS M2 based on geochemical and palynological records from five marine sediment cores along a Caribbean to eastern North Atlantic transect. Our records show that increased Pacific-to-Atlantic flow via the Central American Seaway weakened the North Atlantic Current and attendant northward heat transport prior to MIS M2. The consequent cooling of the northern high latitude oceans permitted expansion of the continental ice sheets during MIS M2. despite near-modern atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Sea level drop during this glaciation halted the inflow of Pacific water to the Atlantic via the Central American Seaway. allowing the build-up of a Caribbean Warm Pool. Once this warm pool was large enough. the Gulf Stream–North Atlantic Current system was reinvigorated. leading to significant northward heat transport that terminated the glaciation. Before and after MIS M2. heat transport via the North Atlantic Current was crucial in maintaining warm climates comparable to those predicted for the end of this century.,True,OIseCM0AAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,84,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081508,12170355803570815292,/scholar?cites=12170355803570815292,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081508,0,0,0

We show that soil moisture index (MI). a modeled parameter that also takes potential evapotranspiration into account. is correlated to the 6-methyl brGDGT distribution but does not significantly control the distribution of 5-methyl brGDGTs. Instead. temperature remains the primary control on 5-methyl brGDGTs. We propose the following global calibrations: MAAT soil= 40.01× MBT 5 me′− 15.25 (n= 350. R 2= 0.60.

Global mean temperatures were also substantially warmer than those of the present day. As such. the study of early Eocene climate provides insight into how a super-warm Earth system behaves and offers an opportunity to evaluate climate models under conditions of high greenhouse gas forcing. The Deep Time Model Intercomparison Project (DeepMIP) is a systematic model–model and model–data intercomparison of three early Paleogene time slices: latest Paleocene. Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) and early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO). A previous article outlined the model experimental design for climate model simulations. In this article. we outline the methodologies to be used for the compilation and analysis of climate proxy data. primarily proxies for temperature and CO2. This paper establishes the protocols for a concerted and coordinated effort to compile the climate proxy records across a wide geographic range. The resulting climate “atlas” will be used to constrain and evaluate climate models for the three selected time intervals and provide insights into the mechanisms that control these warm climate states.

However. poor correlation between total arsenic concentration in hair and water sources have been found in previous studies. Exclusive determination of endogenous arsenic in the hair. excluding external contamination has become an analytical challenge. Arsenic speciation in hair appears as a new possibility for analytical assessing in As-exposure studies.

1148957,High-temperature hydraulic high-pressure nebulization: a recent nebulization principle for sample introduction. Invited lecture,1996,Harald Berndt and Jorge Yáñez,11,Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry,9,703-712,Royal Society of Chemistry,High-temperature hydraulic high-pressure nebulization (HT-HHPN) is a recent development in the field of high-efficiency nebulization techniques in atomic spectrometry. Typically in HHPN. the liquid to be nebulized is forced through a highly turbulent hydraulic nozzle of diameter ≤ 20 µm by means of an HPLC pump at a pressure of >20 MPa (200 bar); in this study the liquid was heated to temperatures up to 300 °C. The residence time of the liquid inside the critical part of the nozzle is less than 100 ns.

To assess the weight of the variables pH and amount of catalyst. a factorial design was used when planning the experiments. Methylmercury was determined by the difference between total mercury and inorganic mercury. The optimal conditions for methylmercury removal are low amounts of catalyst and an alkaline pH. Under optimal conditions. more than 95% of methylmercury removal was achieved after 2 min irradiation. Methylmercury can be removed in the presence of nitrogen or oxygen under different mechanism pathways. In the presence of nitrogen. the reaction proceed by forming water soluble compounds. such as methanol or more oxidised moieties.

This loss can be reduced using a process of up-conversion whereby two or more sub-band-gap photons generate a single above-gap exciton. Traditional approaches to up-conversion. such as nonlinear two-photon absorption (2PA) or triplet fusion. suffer from low efficiency at solar light intensities. a narrow absorption bandwidth. nonoptimal absorption energies. and difficulties for implementing in practical devices. Here we show that these deficiencies can be alleviated using the effect of Auger up-conversion in thick-shell PbSe/CdSe quantum dots.

Eremomastax speciosa and the stem bark of Polyscias fulva. collected in Cameroon.  Methods Chemiluminescence was used to analyze the antioxidant activities of plant extracts against hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anion. Comet assays were used to analyze the protection against antioxidant-induced DNA damage induced in white blood cells after treating with hydrogen peroxide. Flow cytometry was used to measure γδ T cells proliferation and anti-inflammatory activity of γδ T cells and of immature dendritic cells (imDC) in the presence of different concentrations of plant extracts.  Results Ethanol extracts showed strong antioxidant properties against both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. Cassia alata showed the highest antioxidant activity. The effect of plant extracts on γδ T cells and imDC was evidenced by the dose dependent reduction in TNF-α production in the presence of Cassia alata. Carica papaya. Eremomastax speciosa Eleusine indica. and Polyscias fulva. γδ T cells proliferation was affected to the greatest extent by Polyscias fulva.

The aim was to determine if neonatal exposure to permethrin (PERM) pesticide. at a low dosage that does not produce signs of obvious abnormalities. could represent a risk for the onset of diseases later in the life. Neonatal rats (from postnatal day 6 to 21) were treated daily by gavage with a dose of PERM (34 mg/kg) close to the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). and hippocampal morphology and function of synapses were investigated in adulthood. Fear conditioning. passive avoidance and Morris water maze tests were used to assess cognitive skills in rats. whereas electron microscopy analysis was used to investigate hippocampal morphological changes that occurred in adults. In both contextual and tone fear conditioning tests. PERM-treated rats showed a decreased freezing. In the passive avoidance test. the consolidation of the inhibitory avoidance was time-limited: the memory was not impaired for the first 24 h. whereas the information was not retained 72 h following training. The same trend was observed in the spatial reference memories acquired by Morris water maze. In PERM-treated rats. electron microscopy analysis revealed a decrease of synapses and surface densities in the stratum moleculare of CA1. in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the mossy fibers of the hippocampal areas together with a decrease of perforated synapses in the stratum moleculare of CA1 and in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.

NADH increased the autoxidation rate of myoglobin. Both a drop in pH and partial deoxygenation markedly stimulated the autoxidation process and the influence of NADH. A correlation between met-Mb formation rate and NADH oxidation rate was always observed. The increased rate of Mb autoxidation caused by NADH was inhibited by catalase and pyruvate but not by l-lactate. The antioxidant activity versus H2O2 of both pyruvate and lactate was evidenced by chemiluminescence experiments. The antioxidant activity of lactate disappeared completely in the presence of myoglobin or apo-myoglobin. whereas it was only reduced for pyruvate.

In his report submitted in 1835 and published in 1836 Berzelius reviewed a number of earlier findings on chemical change in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. and showed that these findings could be rationally co-ordinated by the introduction of the concept of catalysis. In a short paper summarising his ideas on catalysis as a new force. he wrote (I):“It is. then. proved that several simple or compound bodies. soluble and insoluble. have the property of exercising on other bodies an action very different from chemical affinity. By means of this action they produce. in these bodies. decompositions of their elements and different recombinations of these same elements to which they remain indifferent.”,True,ZdQKUdUAAAAJ:Xtec1x7NZGAC,92,https://www.technology.matthey.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/pmr-v19-i2-064-069.pdf,9313302120223408504,/scholar?cites=9313302120223408504,,https://www.technology.matthey.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/pmr-v19-i2-064-069.pdf,0,0,0

Early ideas of Liebig found little favour with Berzelius. Ostwald and others. The adsorption theory of Faraday became generally accepted. although alternative views were proposed over a long period. Langmuir put the concepts of Faraday into definite form. and his formulations and developments of them have been used up to the present.The discovery that a combustible gas can be oxidised by atmospheric oxygen on the surface of a platinum wire without the production of flame and yet with production of enough heat to keep the platinum incandescent was made by Huniphry Davy during his researches which led to the miners’ safety lamp. and has already been described (1. 2. 3. 4). J. W. Dobereiner later developed a spongy platinum catalyst which caused hydrogen and atmospheric oxygen to combine at room temperature. thereby making the catalyst become red hot.

Of the several kinds of fuel cell technology. proton exchange membrane fuel cells and alkaline fuel cells have been the subject of intense research and development because their low operating temperature allows instant start-up. in contrast to other types of fuel cells. The biggest hurdle with these fuel cells has been the effective achievement of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode. which requires high amounts of catalyst to decrease high overpotentials.[1] Although carbon-supported platinum-based materials have proven the most promising catalysts for the ORR. Pt has several disadvantages such as low durability due to dissolution. susceptibility to the methanol crossover effect. limited supply. high cost and facile carbon monoxide poisoning.[2] The commercialisation of fuel cell technologies has thus been hampered and the drive to find highly efficient but non-precious metal or metal-free alternatives is ever-increasing. As the most prominent development in this initiative. heteroatom-doped nanostructured carbon materials have emerged with excellent potential.

A bottom-up colloidal approach was employed to accurately control TANC monodispersity and composition. TANCs were found to be effective at inactivating Escherichia coli (E. coli) in water. The presence of Ag in the nanocomposites induced a decrease in TiO2 band gap energy. which favoured valence to conduction band electron transfer and allowed for electron excitation using visible light. Aggregation of ultra-fine particles was prevented through the use of a long-chain polymer as evidenced by electrophoretic mobility studies. The TANCs catalyzed oxidation of bacterial membranes and cell death or disinfection.

In this study effects of certain isolated fractions from root-bark of Berberis aristata on blood glucose levels were determined in normal and alloxan-diabetic rabbits. In normal rabbits. ethanolic fraction in 0.5. 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg produced significant decrease (P< 0.05 or 0.001) at 8 and 12 hrs. Its acidified-basified fraction showed significant lowering of blood sugar at 2. 4. 8 and 12 hrs. The chloroform: methanol fraction also produced significant hypoglycaemic effect at these intervals. In alloxan-diabetic rabbits. ethanolic fraction in doses similar to normal animals produced significant decrease in blood glucose at 2. 4. 8 and 12 hrs. Also. acidified-basified fraction of the root-bark in 100 and 125mg/kg doses produced significant decrease in the levels at 2. 4 and 8 hrs. In these animals. its chloroform: methanol fraction (4 and 5mg/kg) produced significant effect at 8 and 12 hrs. while at the dose 6mg/kg body weight was found to be significant decrease blood glucose level at 2 and 4 hrs and highly significant decrease blood glucose level at 8 and 12 hrs interval. Gliclazide in 500mg/kg produced significant decrease blood glucose level at 2. 4. 8 and 12 hrs in normal rabbits only but not in alloxan-diabetics. Thus our data showed that the test fractions of B. aristata root-bark produce significant hypoglycaemia in both. normal and diabetic rabbits.

LCW enables large-area patterning of microstructures and nanostructures of soluble materials. either organic or inorganic. including biological compounds in buffer solutions or compounds for cell guidance. LCW exploits the capillary forces of menisci established under the protrusions of a stamp placed in contact with a liquid film. In the space confined by each meniscus. the self-organization of the deposited solute yields highly ordered structures that replicate the motif of the stamp protrusions. The method does not require any particular infrastructure and can be accomplished by using simple tools such as compact discs or microscopy grids. Compared with other printing methods. LCW is universal for soluble materials. as it does not require chemical binding or other specific interactions between the solute and the surface.

All five containers exhibit good water solubility and weak self-association (Ks ≤ 624 M–1). We constructed phase solubility diagrams to extract Krel and Ka values for the container·drug complexes. The acyclic CB[n]-type containers generally display significantly higher Ka values than HP-β-CD toward drugs. Containers 1a–1e bind the steroidal ring system and aromatic moieties of insoluble drugs.

The contribution of indium to the acidity nature of the samples seems to be important taking into account that the number of Brönsted acid sites was reduced after the In exchange. In the same way new and strong electron-donor acceptor sites were generated. The PAC results indicate that there exists an important fraction of the indium present in the active sample coordinated as in the In2O3 case. while another one corresponding to …,True,S3o3t2EAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920586199002175,17447314986349875597,/scholar?cites=17447314986349875597,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48636346/s0920-5861_2899_2900217-520160907-23367-xsqvpw.pdf,0,0,0

We found that the newly synthesized hybrid composites exhibited significantly enhanced H2 storage. The approach that we have followed includes synthesis of nanostructures with the experimental study of its adsorption capacity and storage properties. In summary. we have shown that CMK‐3 ordered porous carbon modified with Pt nanoclusters is a promising material for hydrogen uptake. The samples were characterized by X‐ray diffraction. N2 isotherms. X‐ray photoelectron spectra and transmission electron microscopy. The nanoparticles of Pt (~1.7 nm) incorporated onto the nanostructured carbon CMK‐3 showed higher hydrogen uptake at low and high pressures (3.3 wt% of H2 sorption at 10 bar and 77 K) than CMK‐3.

Here. a side‐chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP) is incorporated as a dopant into the perovskite film to achieve perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high efficiency and long‐term stability. SCLCP doping increases the grain size in the crystalline perovskite film by controlled solvent evaporation and reduced grain boundaries. which slow the material degradation and reduce the charge recombination. Using this approach. the PSC power conversion efficiency (PCE) is significantly boosted from 18.0% (nondoped) to 20.63% for the SCLCP‐doped perovskite film with much improved air stability. Furthermore. the trap state density in the SCLCP‐doped films is decreased because the SCLCP effectively passivates the perovskite grain surface.

Several ligand exchange reactions of the catalytic precursor [PdCl4]2− and nucleophilic attack of water at Pd-coordinated ethene (hydroxypalladation) were looked at in great molecular level detail. This work underlines the key role of the trans effect of Pd-coordinated ethene in the structure and dynamics of solvated Pd(II) complexes. Irrespective of Cl or water ligation at the trans position. the hydroxypalladation proceeds through an anti mechanism where an outer-sphere water attacks an ethene carbon atom in an anti fashion.

1149429,Exploring high dimensional free energy landscapes: Temperature accelerated sliced sampling,2017,Shalini Awasthi and Nisanth N Nair,146,The Journal of Chemical Physics,9,094108,AIP Publishing LLC,Biased sampling of collective variables is widely used to accelerate rare events in molecular simulations and to explore free energy surfaces. However. computational efficiency of these methods decreases with increasing number of collective variables. which severely limits the predictive power of the enhanced sampling approaches. Here we propose a method called Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling (TASS) that combines temperature accelerated molecular dynamics with umbrella sampling and metadynamics to sample the collective variable space in an efficient manner. The presented method can sample a large number of collective variables and is advantageous for controlled exploration of broad and unbound free energy basins. TASS is also shown to achieve quick free energy convergence and is practically usable with ab initio molecular dynamics techniques.,True,yR99mt8AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,25,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4977704,17660583330291718519,/scholar?cites=17660583330291718519,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08240,0,0,0

Moreover. this mechanism is in consensus with the observed kinetic isotope effects. This report further confirms the outer-sphere (anti) hydroxypalladation mechanism.

A method based on electrospray mass spectrometry was developed for the determination of 4‐HNE at cellular levels. Quantification was carried out by using HNE‐d11 as internal standard; the mass chromatograms were acquired in the single ion monitoring mode (SIM) on the [M + H]+ monoisotopic species for HNE and HNE‐d11. With this approach a higher precision and lower detection limit and biological sample size than those typical of the methods so far employed are achieved. Furthermore the determination of the analyte from the cell extract is directly performed without the need of any HNE derivatization.

Eng,5,1-4,,Stainless steels (SS) were invented to overcome the problem of corrosion which is a major concern of food and many other industries. The alloy of steel containing iron-chromium-nickel is known as stainless steels. Stainless steels typically contain between 9 and 30 percent chromium and varying amounts of nickel. molybdenum. copper. sulfur. titanium. niobium. etc.. may be added to obtain the desired mechanical properties and service life. Stainless steel is considered noble metal for use in dairy industry. Stainless steels are classified based on the chemical composition and it provides information to overcome many types of corrosion. Some of the limitations of SS employed in food and dairy industry are attack by lactic and malic acids at elevated temperature and poor thermal conductivity. However. these limitations may be overcome by carefully selection and fabrication. optimized operating condition. care and maintenance of the equipment. Stainless steels of various grades are widely used as engineering material for the fabrication of equipment. Stainless steels are corrosive resistant but under certain conditions the materials can stain and can corrode.

Some of the unresolved. critical issues related to the rational development of FDDS include (1) the quantitative efficiency of floating delivery systems in the fasted and fed states;(2) the role of buoyancy in enhancing gastro residence time (GRT) of FDDS; and (3) the correlation between prolonged GRT and sustained release/pharmacokinetic characteristics.

1149494,Metal oxide photoanodes for water splitting,2011,J Augustynski and BD Alexander and R Solarska,303,Topics in current chemistry,,1-38,,Solar hydrogen production through photocatalytically assisted water splitting has attracted a great deal of attention since its first discovery almost 30 years ago. The publication of investigations into the use of TiO2 photoanodes has continued apace since and a critical review of current trends is reported herein. Recent advances in the understanding of the behaviour of nanoparticulate TiO2 films is summarized along with a balanced report into the utility and nature of titania films doped with non-metallic elements and ordered. nanostructured films such as those consisting of nanotubes. Both of these are areas that have generated a not insignificant degree of activity. One goal of doping TiO2 has been to extend the photoresponse of the material to visible light. A similar goal has seen a resurgence in interest in Fe2O3 photoanodes. Herein. the influence of dopants on the photocurrent density observed at Fe2O3 photoanodes and. in this regard. the role of silicon has attracted much attention. and a little debate. Finally. we look beyond the binary oxides. Photoanodes made from new materials such as mixed metal oxides. perovskite structured semiconductors. metal (oxy) nitrides or composite electrodes offer the potential to either tailor the optical band gap or tune the conduction or valence band energetics.

The SERRS spectra of [Ru(bpm)3]2+ were found to change slightly with a change in applied potential. The relative intensity of the ν(C6C6‘) band was found to be dependent on both excitation wavelength and applied potential. This was ascribed to an active charge transfer (CT) mechanism operating synergistically with the electromagnetic mechanism. No such CT activity was observed in [Ru(bpz)3]2+.

The binding of a series of monovalent and divalent cations was assessed by 1H NMR. circular dichroism. fluorescence and molecular modelling. In contrast to previous studies on cations binding by 18-membered α-cyclopeptoid hexamers. the 21-membered cyclopeptoid cP1 did not complex monovalent cations (Na+. K+.

Here we have prepared two series of Pd/ZnO catalysts. both by immobilisation of PVA-protected Pd colloids and by Pd impregnation of PdCl2 to investigate structure activity relationships for direct CO2 hydrogenation. Very different performances were found for the different preparation methods. and the Pd loading and pre-reduction of the catalysts were shown to be important factors for optimising methanol yield. The crucial factor for high methanol yield is the formation of a Pd–Zn alloy. either during the reaction itself. or better by high temperature pre-reduction. The formation of the alloy greatly reduces CO production by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

Moreover. it has Lewis acid sites and very weak BAS (bridged hydroxyls). Such ZrO2 was used as a matrix for niobium oxide species loaded as 0.3 and 1 monolayers. NbOx loading decreases basicity (both LBS and BBS) and the number of Lewis acid sites (LAS) and leads to an increase in the number of Brønsted acid sites (BAS). The loading with a 0.3 monolayer of NbOx leads to a very attractive support/catalyst because of the generation of active oxygen atoms at the interface between the NbOx and ZrO2 phases. Niobio-zirconia supports were modified by impregnation with chloroplatinic acid (1 wt% of Pt).

Efficient drug delivery requires both high cellular uptake of the nanoparticles and release of the drug from the nanoparticles. Release of hydrophobic drugs from PACA nanoparticles is primarily governed by nanoparticle degradation. and this process has been poorly studied at the cellular level. Here we use the hydrophobic model drug Nile Red 668 (NR668) to investigate intracellular degradation of PACA nanoparticles by measuring changes in NR668 fluorescence emission and lifetime. as the spectral properties of NR668 depend on the hydrophobicity of the dye environment. We also assess the potential of poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) and poly(octyl cyanoacrylate) (POCA) nanoparticles for intracellular drug delivery in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 and rat brain endothelial cell line RBE4 and the role of endocytosis pathways in PACA nanoparticle uptake in those cell lines. Fluorescence lifetime imaging. emission spectra analysis and Förster resonance energy transfer indicated that the intracellular degradation was in line with the degradation found by direct methods such as gas chromatography and scanning electron microscopy. showing that PBCA has a faster degradation rate compared to POCA. The combined P(BCA/OCA) nanoparticles had an intermediate degradation rate. The uptake of POCA and PBCA nanoparticles was much higher in RBE4 than in PC3 cells.

Recharging the Li–O 2 battery depends on oxidizing solid lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2). which is formed on discharge within the porous cathode. However. transporting charge between Li 2 O 2 particles and the solid electrode surface is at best very difficult and leads to voltage polarization on charging. even at modest rates. This is a significant problem facing the non-aqueous Li–O 2 battery. Here we show that incorporation of a redox mediator. tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). enables recharging at rates that are impossible for the cell in the absence of the mediator. On charging. TTF is oxidized to TTF+ at the cathode surface; TTF+ in turn oxidizes the solid Li 2 O 2. which results in the regeneration of TTF.

In many instances. the key to a successful process operation is how well the solids transfer and control system has been designed. This is particularly true in a transport gasifier and circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustors. which are dependent upon the rapid and reliable circulation of solids to maintain a constant solids concentration in the CFB. Proper design and operation of solids returning systems are essential to the performance and operation of CFB combustion systems.

In this study. a transient method was applied which readily allows one to identify operational features and critical transitions. The method is based on stopping the solids flow rate into the riser when riser is operating in fully dense transport regime. The analysis of transient pressure drop data across the riser during a solids flow cut-off experiment against its time derivative demonstrate the three distinct operating regimes that exist as the gas deplete the solid out of the riser. The transient was compared to data taken under steady state operations using statistically designed experiments.

The present work focuses on modeling the transient behavior of large CFB units. whose flow characteristics were shown to yield C-shaped voidage profiles using cork as the fluidizing material and air at ambient conditions. The riser is modeled in two ways: 1) as a set of well-mixed tanks connected in series; 2) as a 1-D axisymetric cluster flow. The tanks-in-series model visualizes the riser as consisting of a series of well-mixed vessels. When the gas flow rate is constant and solids flow rate changes as a sine wave function. the voidages along the riser indicate a family of sine waves with significant phase shifts.

As results one obtains a formula for the number of crystals in the drop and another formula for their average size. The parameters in these formulae include either explicitly or implicitly the protein mass. temperature. pH. and ionic strength. which are the independent variables known experimentally to influence the overall rate of protein crystallization.,True,Sv7wNFkAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022024899001347,1268063744149264939,/scholar?cites=1268063744149264939,,,0,0,0
1149741,Convective diffusion in protein crystal growth,1986,JK Baird and EJ Meehan Jr and AL Xidis and SB Howard,76,Journal of Crystal Growth,3,694-700,North-Holland,We considered a protein crystal in the form of a flat plate suspended in its parent solution so that the normal to the largest face was perpendicular to the acceleration due to gravity. For simplicity. the protein concentration in the solution adjacent to the plate was taken to be the equilibrium solubility. The bulk of the solution was supersaturated. however. which gave rise to a horizontal concentration gradient driving fluid toward the plate. We also took into account the diffusion of the dissolved protein with respect to the moving fluid. In the boundary layer next to the plate. we solved the Navier-Stokes equation and the equation for convective diffusion to determine the flow velocity and the protein mass flux. We found that. because of the convection. the local rate of growth of the plate varied strongly with depth.

1149742,A generalized statement of the law of mass action,1999,James K Baird,76,Journal of chemical education,8,1146,Division of Chemical Education,When expressed in a generalized form in terms of thermodynamic activities. the law of mass action can be made to take into account the non-ideal behavior of reactants in solution in a way that is consistent with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Specifically. when combined with the principle of detailed balance. the generalized law of mass action predicts the thermodynamically exact result linking the forward and reverse rate constants. the equilibrium activities. and the equilibrium constant. For a reaction approaching equilibrium. it predicts in agreement with non-equilibrium thermodynamics a proportionality between the net reaction rate and the instantaneous Gibbs free energy of reaction. In the case of an irreversible reaction between ions in solution. the generalized law leads to the Brönsted-Bjerrum equation connecting the rate constant to the ionic strength.

Without integrating the JMAK equation explicitly. we use dimensional analysis to derive a general formula for the half-life for decay of the protein supersaturation. This formula includes a dimensioned group and an arbitrary dimensionless function.

This gives an equation for the time decay of the supersaturation and a formula for the half-life in which all arbitrary dimensionless functions are evaluated.

Most importantly. the recent development and novel concepts for improving the hydro-stability and separating performance of silica membranes for desalination are critically examined. Research into silica based membranes for desalination has focussed on three primary methods for improving the hydro-stability. These include incorporating carbon templates into the microporous silica both as surfactants and hybrid organic-inorganic structures and incorporation of metal oxide nanoparticles into the silica matrix. The literature examined identified that only metal oxide silica membranes have demonstrated high salt rejections under a variety of feed concentrations. reasonable fluxes and unaltered performance over long-term operation.

The sols prepared in pH 6 resulted in the lowest concentration of silanol (Si–OH) species to improve hydrostability and the optimized conditions for film coating. The membrane was tested to desalinate 0.3–15 wt% synthetic sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions at a feed temperature of 22 C followed by long term membrane performance of up to 250 h in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. Results show that the water flux (and salt rejection) decrease with increasing salt concentration delivering an average value of 9.5 kg m–2 h–1 (99.6%) and 1.55 kg m–2 h–1 (89.2%) from the 0.3 and 15 wt% saline feed solutions. respectively. Furthermore. the permeate salt concentration was measured to be less than 600 ppm for testing conditions up to 5 wt% saline feed solutions. achieving below the recommended standard for potable water. Long term stability shows that the membrane performance in water flux was stable for up to 150 h. and slightly reduced from thereon. possibly due to the blockage of large hydrated ions in the micropore constrictions of the silica matrix. However. the integrity of the silica matrix was not affected by the long term testing as excellent salt rejection of> 99% was maintained for over 250 h.

This effect stemmed from alternating the reducing and oxidising (redox) state of the cobalt particles embedded in the ES40 matrix. The reduced membranes gave the best H 2 permeances of 1× 10− 6 mol m− 2 s− 1 Pa− 1 and H 2/N 2 permselectivities of 65. The reduction process tailored a molecular gap attributed to changes in the specific volume between the reduced cobalt (Co (OH) 2 and CoO) particles in the ES40 structure. thus allowing for the increased diffusion of gases.

Incorporating anti-counterfeiting tags with physical unclonable functions (PUFs) into products is a promising solution for their authentication. PUFs are unique random physical patterns of taggants that cannot be copied and must be fabricated by a stochastic process that affords a large number of robust PUF tags. A PUF tag has a physical pattern that. if read with an appropriate analytical tool. can be recorded and stored. The PUF tag is then the ‘key’. whereas the stored pattern is the ‘lock’. This combination forms PUF keys that provide unbreakable encryption and combat counterfeiting.

A large variety of naturally occurring fluorescent components in tissue results in broad emission that overlaps the emission of typical fluorescent dyes used for tissue labeling. In addition. autofluorescence is characterized by complex fluorescence intensity decay composed of multiple components whose lifetimes range from sub-nanoseconds to a few nanoseconds. For these reasons. the real fluorescence signal of the probe is difficult to separate from the unwanted autofluorescence.

In addition. the nanosecond background autofluorescence is a significant interference during fluorescence measurements in cellular environment. Therefore. red fluorophores with longer lifetimes will be immensely helpful. Azaoxa-triangulenium fluorophores ADOTA and DAOTA are red emitting small organic molecules with high quantum yield. long fluorescence lifetime and high limiting anisotropy. In aqueous environment. ADOTA and DAOTA absorption and emission maxima are respectively 540 nm and 556 nm. and 556 nm and 589 nm. Their emission extends beyond 700 nm.

Strong halide binding to europium gives rise to changes in the relative intensity of the hypersensitive ΔJ = 2 transition compared to the rest of the europium emission spectrum. combined with quenching of the overall intensity of emission as a consequence of non-radiative quenching by the bound halide. The weaker interaction with the rotaxane pocket mediates a subsequent recovery of intensity of the europium centered luminescence despite the considerable separation between the …,True,FaR6HM4AAAAJ:r56sNq9gaawC,38,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2013/sc/c2sc21614k,387971935364566461,/scholar?cites=387971935364566461,,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2013/sc/c2sc21614k,0,0,0

Previously. only alkyl-substituted triazatriangulenium derivatives (R3-TATA+) were known. a consequence of the low reactivity of anilines in the aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction leading to the formation of the TATA+ core. The synthesis of Ar3-TATA+ was achieved by heating the tris(2.6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium ion (DMP3C+) in various anilines in the presence of NaH. In the solvent-free reaction all three aryl substituents could be introduced despite the low reactivity of the anilines. The symmetric Ar3-TATA+ derivatives with Ar = phenyl (2). 4-methoxyphenyl (3). and 4-bromophenyl (4) were synthesized. Single crystal structures of 2 and 4 were obtained as BF4– salts. where torsional angles larger than 80° were observed between the TATA+ chromophore and the aryl substituents.

On another front. redox-controlled dimerization of radical cations has recently been recognized as an important tool in supramolecular chemistry. Here we show that π-extended TTFs based on the indenofluorene core. prepared by Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reactions. undergo reversible and stepwise one-electron oxidations and that the detectable. intermediate radical cation forms remarkably strong intermolecular MV ([neutral·cation]) and π-dimer ([cation·cation]) complexes with near-infrared radical cation absorptions.

These arise as a consequence of changes in the substitution pattern on the periphery of the molecule. at a substantial distance from the binding pocket. Herein. we explore these remote substituent effects and explain the observed behaviour through discussion of the way in which remote substituents can influence and control the global structure of a molecule through their demands upon conformational space. Peripheral modifications to a binuclear lanthanide motif derived from α.α′-bis(DO3 Ayl)-m-xylene are shown to result in dramatic changes to the binding constant for isophthalate. In this system. the parent compound displays considerable conformational flexibility. yet can be assumed to bind to isophthalate through a well-defined conformer. Addition of steric bulk remote from the binding site restricts conformational mobility. giving rise to an increase in binding constant on entropic grounds as long as the ideal binding conformation is not excluded from the available range of conformers.,True,FaR6HM4AAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,31,https://dro.dur.ac.uk/13864,12699912569636632151,/scholar?cites=12699912569636632151,,https://dro.dur.ac.uk/13864/1/13864.pdf,0,0,0

The symmetry gives rise to a degeneracy of the main electronic transition. In low polarity solvents significant splitting of this degenerate transition is observed and assigned to ion pair formation. Ion pairing of the 2.6.10-tris(dioctylamino)trioxatriangulenium ion with Cl−. BF4−. PF6− and TRISPHAT anions was studied using absorption spectroscopy. A clear correlation is found between the size of the anion and the splitting of the ATOTA+ transitions.

In accord with the model of Scherer and McGrady. the Cα−Cβ bond densities no longer show cylindrical symmetry in the vicinity of the Ti atom and differ markedly from those of the other C−C bonds. At the points along the Cα−Cβ bond where the deviation is maximal the electron density is elongated toward the metal center. The distortion is supported by parallel theoretical calculations. A calculation on an Mo complex in which the agostic interaction is absent supports the Scherer and McGrady criterion for agostic interactions.

However. the effect of doping and dopant concentration on the carrier dynamics and photoelectrochemical performance remains unclear. In this work. we examined the effects of Mo doping on the charge separation dynamics and photocurrent performance in BiVO4 photoanodes. We show that the photocurrent of BiVO4 photoanodes increases with increasing concentration of the Mo dopant. which can be attributed to both the improved carrier mobility resulting from increased electron density and charge separation efficiency due to the diminishing of trap states upon Mo doping.

The adsorption at lower pHs is faster due to the greater electrostatic attraction between the POEA and the SL covered substrate. but a lower amount of POEA is deposited due to charge repulsion of additional POEA chains and conformational steric hindrance. At higher pHs the adsorption of POEA takes longer but it is greater due to the contribution of hydrogen bonding interactions. lower charge repulsion between POEA chains and a more compact polymer conformation. Adsorption of POEA/SL multilayers could be carried out in different types of substrates.

Both parameters present significant influence on the sensors response. Depending upon the concentration of NaCl solutions. thicker films exhibit higher sensitivity to NaCl in comparison to thinner films according to impedance spectroscopy studies. The larger surface roughness of thicker films seems to be the main reason for such a behavior. Meanwhile. as the area of the gold electrodes is increased more sensitive sensors are obtained. At two different frequencies. namely 100 Hz and 1 kHz. the response of the sensors are found to be linear or exponentially dependent on the NaCl concentration.

Such capabilities allow rapid “fingerprinting” of samples with a ten-fold reduction of the required sample amounts with respect to conventional approaches. and permit extensive. robust and expeditious assignment of small-to-medium sized proteins (up to ca. 300 residues). and the determination of inter-nuclear proximities. relative orientations of secondary structural elements. protein-cofactor interactions. local and global dynamics.Fast MAS and 1H detection techniques …,True,Jf6wNIsAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090780717302884,8415308147141715937,/scholar?cites=8415308147141715937,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01744878/document,0,0,0

Further advances in such bioapplications may depend on improved understanding of CNTs physical and chemical properties as well as control over their biocompatibility. Herein we performed a systematic study to show how acid oxidation treatment changes CNTs physical and chemical properties and leads to improved CNTs biocompatibility. Specifically. by incubating CNTs in a strong acid mixture we created a user-defined library of CNTs samples with different characteristics as recorded using Raman energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. atomic force microscopy. or solubility tests.

Although the fibrogenic potential of CNTs is well established. there is a lack of consensus regarding the contribution of physicochemical attributes of CNTs on the underlying fibrotic outcome. We designed an experimentally validated in vitro fibroblast culture model aimed at investigating the effect of fiber length on single-walled CNT (SWCNT)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. The fibrogenic response to short and long SWCNTs was assessed via oxidative stress generation. collagen expression and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) production as potential fibrosis biomarkers. Long SWCNTs were significantly more potent than short SWCNTs in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) response. collagen production and TGF-β release. Furthermore. our finding on the length-dependent in vitro fibrogenic response was validated by the in vivo lung fibrosis outcome. thus supporting the predictive value of the in vitro model. Our results also demonstrated the key role of ROS in SWCNT-induced collagen expression and TGF-β activation. indicating the potential mechanisms of length-dependent SWCNT-induced fibrosis. Together. our study provides new evidence for the role of fiber length in SWCNT-induced lung fibrosis and offers a rapid cell-based assay for fibrogenicity testing of nanomaterials with the ability to predict pulmonary fibrogenic response in vivo.

The study of these interfaces in molecular crystal – polymer composites is difficult using traditional techniques such as electron microscopy or X-ray scattering because of weak or detrimental interactions between the probe and materials. Here. the interface between acetaminophen and a poly(ester urethane) copolymer is analyzed using ellipsometry. infrared spectroscopy. and neutron reflectometry. These materials were chosen for their relevance to pharmaceutical tablets and plastic-bonded explosives. The acetaminophen was shown to dissolve into the polymer coating and creates an interphase region between the two materials; this mixing is almost certainly produced by typical formulation conditions. and likely affects mechanical response of …,True,LopW-uoAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032386111005052,10101060159340532005,/scholar?cites=10101060159340532005,,,0,0,0

Effective cooperation between bacteria in co-culture during initial days was observed at controlled pH 7.0. However. at pH above 6.5 dark fermentation phase was redirected from H2 formation towards production of formic acid. lactic acid and ethanol (which are not coupled with hydrogen production) with simultaneous lower starch removal efficiency. This resulted in decrease in the hydrogen production rate. The highest H2 production in co-culture process (3.23 L H2/Lmedium – after 11 days) was achieved at OLR of 1.5 gstarch/L/day. and it was twofold higher than for dark fermentation process (1.59 L H2/Lmedium).

What is often required is a probe which is sensitive to possibly new features in the microscopic structure while remaining insensitive to those aspects of the structure which are essentially common to the class of materials being studied. In considering a blend of two known polymers. for example. a technique such as conventional crystallography provides a wealth of information on the already known atomic structure of the chemical monomers. buried in which may be new information on whether or not the blend is actually thermodynamically stable. Small-angle neutron scattering SANS is a technique in which the microscopic length scale probed in the sample may be chosen to suit the property being studied while remaining insensitive to much finer or much coarser details. Since most materials are essentially transparent to neutrons of the wavelengths typically used 5–20 Å. bulk samples may be studied. and sample environments are easily varied over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. Further. the need to site these instruments at suitable pulsed or steadystate reactor sources has offered SANS users routine access to state-of-the-art centralized facilities such as millikelvin refrigerators or high-field cryomagnets.

The macro-patterning produces menisci features in the impregnating liquid layer which interact with a droplet via a capillary mechanism similar to the Cheerios effect. These interactions control the droplet motion and positioning on an otherwise completely slippery surface. We present experimental results using a V-shape channel geometry as a model system. The interaction between deformations on the lubricant layer induced by the droplet and the underlying V-shape geometry leads to both local and global equilibrium positions for the droplet within the channel. We present a mathematical model to quantify the transition from local equilibrium states to the global equilibrium state and show that the latter can be described on the basis of a force balance along the apparent contact line of the droplet …,True,Jut8z7gAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,34,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/sm/c7sm00290d,8163095924744666225,/scholar?cites=8163095924744666225,,https://dro.dur.ac.uk/22017/1/22017.pdf,0,0,0

Ring structures are fabricated using a reactive ion etching process which is compatible with CMOS fabrication technology. Three methods of reducing electrical coupling between the drive and the sense are considered. The modes of vibration of the ring are measured as a function of frequency and drive amplitude and interpreted in terms of the modes of an ideal structure. Unwanted asymmetry in the ring structure resulting from the fabrication process is responsible for both a frequency mismatch and a large mechanical coupling between the principal modes of the ring and this limits the response as a gyroscope.

Using methylamine and hydroxylamine in place of ammonia. the pKa value of the deprotonated amine substrate as expressed in the V/K profiles was shifted to a lower pKa value for hydroxylamine and a higher pKa value for methylamine. These data indicate that the amine substrate must be deprotonated for binding. Hydroxylamine is at least as good a substrate as ammonia judged by the kinetic parameters whereas methylamine is a poor …,True,lsSaiaAAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818614656,7351919780090744708,/scholar?cites=7351919780090744708,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818614656,0,0,0

The few examples of monomeric phosphinoborane compounds known and the extent of boron-phosphorus x-bonding interaction in them have been recently reviewed by Power. 1 In phosphinoborane compounds. as in the isoelectronic silenes and disilenes. formation of a double bond is much less favorable than two single bonds. As a result. the amphoteric phosphinoborane compounds form cyclic oligomers containing four-coordinate boron and phosphorus with BP single bonds. unless stabilized by electronic or steric effects of the substituents. Our interest in compounds containing a phosphorusboron bond lies in their potential application as single-source precursors for the organometallic …,True,lsSaiaAAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,19,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/om00032a011,15249093513333295435,/scholar?cites=15249093513333295435,,,0,0,0

Mw>120.000) form of emeraldine base (EB) may be dissolved at concentrations exceeding 20% (w/w) in organic solvents for periods of time sufficient to dry-wet spin solid fibers. This result is due to the combination of a gel-inhibitor (GI) with the polymer/solvent solution. The GI/EB complex disrupts hydrogen bond formation between EB chains in the concentrated EB solutions and thereby lowers the solution viscosity and increases the gelation time. The as spun fiber exhibits good mechanical strength and high conductivities. and both physical properties are further improved by drawing the fiber to four times its initial length. Doping the fibers with inorganic mineral acids significantly reduces fiber strength. while doping with certain organic acids. such as benzene phosphinic acid. preserves mechanical properties and high conductivity values.

The hollow fibers used in the column are non-selective and wetable by the process fluid. In the column with a 36.5 cm length. more than 25% enrichment of iso-butane is obtained from a iso-/n-butane (55/45%) mixture while ∼8% enrichment of propylene is obtained from a propylene/propane (65/35%) mixture. Because of a slightly larger relative volatility of iso-/n-butane than that of propane/propylene. a wider and a more stable operational range is obtained for the former pair. The pressure drop of the hollow fiber packings on both vapor and liquid sides is also discussed. Within the loading range (F-factor < 2.0 Pa0.5). a pressure drop of less than 10 mbar/m is obtained in vapor …,True,JUoCiBwAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738810004722,8008818903798891090,/scholar?cites=8008818903798891090,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48404844/Light_hydrocarbon_distillation_using_hol20160829-30587-ggfvg6.pdf,0,0,0

By varying trace amounts of water. we investigated the impact of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) on PANI chain conformation in solutions of AMPSA/dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) or AMPSA/orthophosphoric acid. UV–vis–NIR spectral changes of these PANI solutions reveal that a competition between H-bond formation and protonation among PANI. AMPSA and water is an on-going process. The H-bonds between the PANI and AMPSA molecules can cause a large red shift in the πb → πq electron transition (the quinoid peak) from ∼630 nm into the near IR (NIR) region. Absent protonation peak (410–490 nm) and blue color of the solution suggest that the H-bond interaction. instead of protonation. is sufficient to cause PANI …,True,JUoCiBwAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379677906002128,7719367532572512062,/scholar?cites=7719367532572512062,,,0,0,0

By simply varying the ratio of initial proton and aniline concentration. a wide range of product morphologies can be synthesized. The intermediates form visible aggregates that can be separated by centrifugation or filtration. In addition to UV‐Vis monitoring of the intermediate aggregates. OCP and pH measurements are used to monitor the reaction process. GPC measurements show that the corresponding final products formed typically are not homogeneous.

In this study. we used hollow fibers as structured packing materials in the propane/propylene distillation. We investigate the effects of morphology and compatibility of hollow fibers on separation efficiency and operation stability in the distillation process. While a hydrophobic micro-porous membrane may seem preferable for this application. an asymmetric membrane with sub-micron pore size on the liquid side may be more suitable for long-term stability of the distillation operation.

Repurposing existing drugs that may have unanticipated activities as potential countermeasures is one way to meet this important goal. since currently approved drugs already have well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in patients. as well as manufacturing and distribution networks. Therefore. approved drugs could rapidly be made available for a new indication in an emergency.   Methodology/Principal Findings A large systematic effort to determine whether existing drugs can be used against high containment bacterial and viral pathogens is described. We assembled and screened 1012 FDA-approved drugs for off-label broad-spectrum efficacy against Bacillus anthracis; Francisella tularensis; Coxiella burnetii; and Ebola.

A series of 116 compounds containing four different alkyl linkers and various aromatic substitutions with hydrogen bond accepting capability was synthesized. The series showed broad potency against the drug-resistant W2 strain of P. falciparum. In particular. a novel series containing variations of the α-aminocresol motif gave eight compounds with IC50 values more potent than 5 nM against the W2 strain. Such simple modifications. significantly altering the pKa and sterics of the basic side chain in chloroquine analogues. may prove to be part of a strategy for overcoming the problem of worldwide resistance to affordable antimalarial drugs. ,True,Z6hwpMgAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,109,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm0600951,286053376308711585,/scholar?cites=286053376308711585,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1524878/,0,0,0

Further. an EBOV window study suggested we could dose pyronaridine 2 or 24 hrs post-exposure to result in similar efficacy. Analysis of cytokine and chemokine panels suggests that pyronaridine may act as an immunomodulator during an EBOV infection. Our studies with pyronaridine clearly demonstrate potential utility for its repurposing as an antiviral against EBOV and merits further study in larger animal models with the added benefit of already being used as a treatment against malaria.,True,Z6hwpMgAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,21,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007890&rev=2,14450125812988238131,/scholar?cites=14450125812988238131,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007890&rev=2,0,0,0

Over the past two decades. ionic liquids (ILs) have gained enormous attention from the scientific community. and the number of reported articles in the literature has grown exponentially. Nevertheless. IL “greenness” is often challenged. mainly due to their poor biodegradability. biocompatibility. and sustainability. An alternative to ILs are deep eutectic solvents (DES).

In this work. we have considered mixtures of choline chloride (CC) or betaine (Bet) with 3 sugar molecules (glucose (Glu). xylose (Xyl) and sucrose (Suc)) and 2 carboxylic acids (citric (CA) and tartaric (Tart) acids). The formation of NADESs was investigated by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The CC mixtures give origin to NADESs for 1:1 M ratio with the sugar molecules and for 2:1. 1:1 and 1:2 with the carboxylic acids. while Bet mixtures only formed NADES with the carboxylic acids.

However. the bleeding control remains the main challenge since the majority of currently available hemostatic agents (HAs) used in other surgical specialities are inefficient in LPN. This hurried the search for effective HAs adapted for LPN surgical peculiarities. which resulted on the emergence of different types of topical HAs. The most promising are the natural origin HAs because of their inherent biodegradability. biocompatibility. and lowest toxicity. These properties turn them top interests' candidates as HAs in …,True,iOX1-igAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,2,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbm.b.34637,2582424073865517251,/scholar?cites=2582424073865517251,,,0,0,0

These are called Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents – NADES and are envisaged to play a major role on the chemical engineering processes of the future. Nonetheless. there is a significant lack of knowledge of its fundamental and basic properties. which is hindering their industrial applications. For this reason it is important to extend the knowledge on these systems. boosting their application development [1]. In this work. we have developed and characterized NADES based on choline chloride. organic acids. amino acids and sugars. Their density. thermal behavior. conductivity and polarity were assessed for different compositions. The conductivity was measured from 0 to 40 °C and the temperature effect was well described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation. The morphological characterization of the crystallizable materials was done by polarized optical microscopy that provided also evidence of homogeneity/phase separation. Additionally. the rheological and thermodynamic properties of the NADES and the effect of water content were also studied. The results show these systems have Newtonian behavior and present significant viscosity decrease with temperature and water content. due to increase on the molecular mobility. The anhydrous systems present viscosities that range from higher than 1000Pa.s at 20°C to less than 1Pa.s at 70°C.

1150400,Therapeutic deep eutectic solvents as solubility enhancers for different active pharmaceutical ingredients,2015,JC Silva and Ivo Manuel Ascensão Aroso and F Mano and I Sa-Nogueira and S Barreiros and RL Reis and Alexandre Paiva and Ana Rita C Duarte,,,,,Mary Ann Liebert,In recent years. deep eutectic solvents (DES) have emerged as a sustainable alternative to ionic liquids mainly due to their lower production costs and higher biodegradability/ biocompatibility(1). DES are defined as a mixture of organic compounds with a melting point significantly lower than that of either individual component(2). When based in natural compounds such as aminoacids. organic acids. sugars or choline derivatives. DES are so called natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) which fully comply with green technology principles(3). NADES constituted by bioactive substances or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). which we define as therapeutic deep eutectic solvents (THEDES). are a promising source for several pharmaceutical and biomedical applications due to their increased ability to dissolve model drugs by increasing their solubility. permeation and absorption. In this work. we synthetized several THEDES based in choline chloride (ChCl) or menthol conjugated with three different APIs: acetylsalicylic acid (AA). benzoic acid (BA) and phenylacetic acid (PA) with different molar ratios (ChCl:AA 1:1. ChCl:PA 1:1. Menthol:AA 3:1. Menthol:BA 3:1. Menthol:PA 2:1. Menthol:PA 3:1). All THEDES produced were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical microscopy. Dissolution studies performed in PBS for 24 hours shown that THEDES increased significantly the dissolution of all APIs studied compared to the control (APIs only). This increased solubility was even more noticeable for the cases of THEDES with menthol in their composition. In overall. our results suggest the great promise of using THEDES …,True,iOX1-igAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,1,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/38328,5598159047302847455,/scholar?cites=5598159047302847455,,,0,0,0

The human salivary α-amylase was more strongly inhibited by the hydrolysable than by the condensed tannin. with the concentrations for 50% inhibition (IC50) being 47.0 and 285.4 μM. respectively. The inhibitory capacities of both tannins on the pancreatic α-amylase were also different. with IC50 values being 141.1 μM for the hydrolysable tannin and 248.1 μM for the condensed tannin. The kinetics of the inhibition presented complex patterns in that for both inhibitors more than one molecule can bind simultaneously to either the free enzyme of the substrate-complexed enzyme (parabolic mixed inhibition). Both tannins were able to inhibit the intestinal starch absorption. Inhibition by the hydrolysable tannin was concentration-dependent. with 53% inhibition at the dose of 58.8 μmol/kg and 88% inhibition at the dose of 294 μmol/kg. For the condensed tannin. inhibition was not substantially different for doses between 124.4 μmol/kg (49%) and 620 μmol/kg (57%). It can be concluded that both tannins. but especially the hydrolysable one. could be useful in controlling the postprandial glycemic levels in diabetes.,True,XQwR8MoAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,30,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2017/5724902.pdf,1280587181532324407,/scholar?cites=1280587181532324407,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2017/5724902.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. propanethiol addition to 3‐(pyridin‐3‐yl or pyrimidin‐2‐yl)propenoate gives a β‐carbon adduct. while addition to the corresponding more π‐deficient N‐oxides gives the α‐adduct or a mixture of α‐ and β‐adducts. This adds to the number of carbon–carbon bond‐forming reactions at the α‐position of Michael receptors documented recently. Density functional calculations reveal that the regioselectivity is due to a combination of reduction of the barrier for α‐addition and increase of the barriers for β‐addition and carbonyl addition as the π‐deficient character of the aromatic substituent is increased.

The barriers for different methyls have a range of 7.5 kcal/mol. which at 300 K would correspond to a five-order-of-magnitude range in correlation time.

The kinetics of these processes in high Faradaic efficiency tungsten trioxide (WO3) photoanodes (>85%) are monitored herein by transient diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and correlated with transient photocurrent data for electron extraction.

Using transient optical spectroscopy. we follow the charge carrier recombination kinetics in these samples. from picoseconds to seconds. and examine how differing oxygen vacancy concentrations impact upon these kinetics. We find that samples with an intermediate concentration of vacancies (∼2% of oxygen atoms) afford the greatest photoinduced charge carrier densities. and the slowest recombination kinetics across all timescales studied.

The vertices and edges of RBR graphs exclusively correspond to those atoms and skeleton bonds which are present in both the final and initial heterocyclic rings. The simple bicyclic structure of these graphspermits us to suggest an original and effective hierarchic classification for simple heterocyclic rearrangements.

London: ResearchStudies Press,We meet with periodicity when something is repeated in time or in space. Periodic processes-like the rotations of planets. changes of seasons. high and low tides-are examples of global (all-pervading) periodicity in our solar system and in nature. Ancient astronomers and astrologers used some of these periodicities to regulate the activities of individuals and even of nations. Periodicity is an essential part of our life. as evidenced by the beating of our hearts and our eating. sleeping. and waking patterns. Geometrical or physical objects that are repeated in space (such as infinite mosaics or atoms in crystals) express other familiar examples of periodicity. Because periodicity is such an important phenomenon. scientists have been interested in it for several centuries. Mathematicians describe periodicity in terms of periodic functions such as F (X)= F (X+ nT). where X is a time or space coordinate. F (X) is a function describing something variable that repeats its value after every addition of the constant value T (the period) to the argument X. and n is an integer. The classical periodic functions Y= sin X and Y= cos X behave in this way. with clear alternations of maxima and minima. It is easy to imagine regular processes that are'almost periodic'with a variable period T (for instance. if one eats or sleeps irregularly) or with changes in the amplitude of F (X). as in the damped saw-tooth curves shown in Figure 1.

A well-known class of psychotropic indole compounds (eg. psillocine. psylocibine and pindolole) belongs to the family of 5-hydroxy (alkoxy) indoles. An isostructural class of indolizines bearing 5-OR group (A in Scheme 1) may serve as the biomimetics of such indoles. This class can be designed by a mental rearrangement of the indole ring nitrogen into bridgehead positions.The entire class of 5-alkoxy (hydroxyl) indolizines is poorly investigated since there is lack of synthetic methodologies leading to this scaffold. Rare examples of preparation of the members of class A include their synthesis from pyrrole derivatives1–3 and by means of photolytic C-5 oxidation of the indolizine ring. 4 Structure B with the desired motif was prepared via 1. 3-dipolar cycloaddition. 5 The most common strategy to indolizine ring (the Chichibabin cyclization) failed for the case of 6-methoxy-2-picoline. 6 It is. however. possible to annelate the pyrrole ring to pyridine by condensation of the Guresci pyridone with α-bromoketones7. 8 leading to 5-indolizinones C. which are stable tautomers of desired 5-hydroxyindolizines D. We found9 that pyridone-like derivatives C can be converted into 5-chloroindolizines E. which react with MeONa leading to 5-methoxy-6-cyanoindolizines F.

The influence of donor and acceptor substituents on the total energy and charges may be treated according to the simple alternation rule. In the series of isomers (substituted or azaindolizines) the lower energies are observed for those molecules. where acceptor substituents are arranged consonant to the polarity of the chain N−C5−C6−C7−C8−C9−C1−C2−C3 of the indolizine.

The peptides were studied in pure water and 30% (vol/vol) TFE/water mixtures at 300 K. The simulations suggest that the stabilizing effect of TFE is induced by the preferential aggregation of TFE molecules around the peptides. This coating displaces water. thereby removing alternative hydrogen-bonding partners and providing a low dielectric environment that favors the formation of intrapeptide hydrogen bonds. Because TFE interacts only weakly with nonpolar residues. hydrophobic interactions within the peptides are not disrupted. As a consequence.

In the presence of 30 % (v/v) 2.2.2‐trifluoroethanol (TFE). it adopts a partial helical conformation involving the C‐terminal amino acids 6–14. This conformational change. known as the TFE effect. is studied here in terms of the solvation state of the peptide at different TFE concentrations by means of intermolecular homo‐ and heteronuclear NOE measurements. When an aqueous solution of bombesin is titrated with TFE. a continual decrease in the water/peptide interactions and a concomitant increase in the TFE/peptide interactions is observed. and at 30 % (v/v) TFE no homonuclear NOEs between water and the peptide can be detected. The conformational transition of the bombesin molecule is thus accompanied by a complete surface covering with TFE.

In the present study. we use melittin as a model to gain insight into the details of the atomistic interactions of HFIP with the peptide. We have performed extensive comparative molecular dynamics simulations (up to 100 nsec) in the absence and in the presence of HFIP. In agreement with recent NMR experiments. the simulations show rapid loss of tertiary structure in water at pH 2 but much higher helicity in 35% HFIP. The MD simulations also indicate that melittin adopts a highly dynamic global structure in 35% HFIP solution with two α‐helical segments sampling a wide range of angular orientations.

To address this problem usually specific block copolymers are synthesized to facilitate protein insertion. Within this study in a reverse approach we match the protein to the polymer instead of matching the polymer to the protein. To increase the FhuA Δ1-159 hydrophobic surface by 1 nm. the last 5 amino acids of each of the 22 β-sheets. prior to the more regular periplasmatic β-turns. were doubled leading to an extended FhuA Δ1-159 (FhuA Δ1-159 Ext).

It has been suggested that they might act in “biomimetic” analogy to the active site of glycosidases. where also two carboxylic groups are present. and it is assumed that one residue acts as proton donor and the other one as proton acceptor. In the present paper. a series of structurally distinct carboxylic acids were experimentally assessed as catalysts in the hydrolysis of cellobiose under fully identical acidic conditions. The results clearly show a pH-dependent activity profile in bulk aqueous solutions without any evidence for a cooperative mechanism. In contrast. the protein environment at the active site in glycosidases was found to be essential for the cooperative action of the two carboxylic acid groups.

Antioxidative effects of PPG on lipid peroxidation induced by FeSO4-edetic acid in linoleic acid were measured by thiobarbituric acid method. Chelating activities of PPG for Fe2+ were tested by differential spectrum method. The reaction rates (A532. min-1) of lipid peroxidation were 0.0046 in the control. 0.0021 in verbascoside group. and 0.0008 in isoverbascoside group. The chelating activity of isoverbascoside was 2-fold stronger than that of verbascoside. Permethyl verbascoside showed neither antioxidative nor chelating activities. The inhibitory effects of PPG with phenolic hydroxy groups on lipid peroxidation are owing to their chelating properties. Under physiological condition PPG-Fe2+ chelates are sufficiently stable.

The more reasonable mean activation energies could be obtained after peak separation for each individual steps. In fact. the activation energy for the post integrated process is almost equivalent with that of the second step. indicating that the total activation energy at the main decomposition process is dominated by thermolysis of CL-20 molecular. Besides. it has been found that the decomposition of C4 matrix does not affect the decomposition of normal ε-CL-20. resulting in identical activation energy and reaction model.

1150685,Thermal behavior and decomposition kinetics of RDX and RDX/HTPB composition using various techniques and methods,2016,Mohamed Abd-Elghany and Ahmed Elbeih and Saeed Hassanein,13,Central European Journal of Energetic Materials,,,,EN In this paper. the thermal behavior and decomposition kinetics of trinitrohexahydrotriazine (RDX) and its polymer bonded explosive (PBX) containing a hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) based polyurethane binder in the ratio 80% RDX/20% HTPB were investigated using various experimental techniques and analytical methods. The HTPB polyurethane matrix contains other additives and was cured using hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Vacuum Stability Test (VST) and Ignition Delay Techniques were applied both isothermally and non-isothermally. The kinetic parameters were determined using both the isoconversional (model free) and the model-fitting methods. For comparison. Advanced Kinetics and Technology Solution (AKTS) software was also used. It was found that the addition of an HTPB-based polyurethane matrix to pure RDX decreased its decomposition temperature. It was also found that RDX/HTPB has a lower activation energy than pure RDX. The polyurethane matrix had a significant effect on the decomposition mechanism of RDX resulting in different reaction models. It was concluded that the activation energies obtained using the Ozawa. Flynn. and Wall (OFW) and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods were very close to the results obtained via the AKTS software lying in the range 218.3-220.2 kJ• mol− 1.

The method is based on removing the impurities from a solution of alpha HNIW (ε-HNIW) by a chemical reaction to obtain pure epsilon form. For comparison. selected different published methods for recrystallization of HNIW to obtain the epsilon form were studied. All the selected methods are based on solvent-antisolvent technique. The optimum parameters. such as type of solvent and anti-solvent. volume ratio of solvent to anti-solvent. rate of addition. speed of stirring. etc.. were applied to enhance the crystal size and shape of ε-HNIW. Checking the polymorphs of the obtained HNIW was done by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thermal stability of the prepared samples was studied by using differential thermal analysis technique (DTA). Qualitative analysis of the crystal size and shape was done using scanning electron microscope (SEM) devise. Quantitative measurement of the crystals sizes for the studied samples was determined by Laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer. Impact sensitivity was measured by falling hammer test. The results indicate that all the applied methods of recrystallization give ε-HNIW. The impact sensitivity of HNIW decreases by obtaining small particles with regular shape.

Since enzyme inhibitors have traditionally served this purpose. we present here an efficient systems-based inhibitor design strategy. enabled by bioinformatic and NMR structural developments. First. we parse the oxidoreductase gene family into structural subfamilies termed pharmacofamilies. which share pharmacophore features in their cofactor binding sites. Then we identify a ligand for this site and use NMR-based binding site mapping (NMR SOLVE) to determine where to extend a combinatorial library. such that diversity elements are directed into the adjacent substrate site. The cofactor mimic is reused in the library in a manner that parallels the reuse of cofactor domains in the oxidoreductase gene family.

We have solved the crystal structure of the synthesized SiH 4 (H 2) 2 by first-principles calculations and revealed that SiH 4 molecules in the formation of SiH 4 (H 2) 2 remain nearly unaltered with Si atoms forming a peculiar tetragonal lattice. which can also be viewed as a distorted face-centered-cubic lattice. We have provided direct evidences on that H 2 molecules in SiH 4 (H 2) 2 occupy the interstitial sites. and more intriguingly are orientationally disordered. Our argument has been supported by the excellent mutual agreement between theoretical and experimental equation of states. Raman. and x-ray diffraction data. The current study has strong implications on other high-pressure van der Waals compounds. eg. H 2 OH 2. CH 4-H 2.

Here. a novel all-sp3 hybridized tetragonal carbon. namely the P carbon. was predicted by the evolutionary particle swarm structural search. It demonstrated a low density among all-sp3 carbons. due to the corresponding distinctive microporous structure. P carbon is thermodynamically stable than the known C60 and could be formed through the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) compression. P carbon is a direct bandgap semiconductor displaying a strong and superhard nature.

We here report first-principles structural search on solid Cl2 at high pressures through our developed particle-swarm optimization algorithm. We successfully reproduced the known molecular Cmca phase (phase I) at low pressure and found that it remains stable up to a high pressure 142 GPa. At 150 GPa. our structural searches identified several energetically competitive. structurally similar. and modulated structures. Analysis of the structural results and their similarity with those in solid Br2 and I2. it was suggested that solid Cl2 adopts an incommensurate modulated structure with a modulation wave close to 2/7 in a narrow pressure range 142–157 GPa.

However. the simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the I4/mmm structure cannot explain all the diffraction peaks observed at 90 GPa. In this article. we apply the recently developed particle swarm optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction to propose that at 63 GPa TiH2 presents a further phase transition from I4/mmm to P4/nmm. which we have also confirmed is dynamically and enthalpically stable up to 294 GPa.

Ivanov and Leonardo Basile and Juan-Carlos Idrobo and Malcolm Guthrie,55,Angewandte Chemie International Edition,,12040-12044,,Acetonitrile (CH3CN) is the simplest and one of the most stable nitriles. Reactions usually occur on the C≡N triple bond. while the C−H bond is very inert and can only be activated by a very strong base or a metal catalyst. It is demonstrated that C−H bonds can be activated by the cyano group under high pressure. but at room temperature. The hydrogen atom transfers from the CH3 to CN along the CH⋅⋅⋅N hydrogen bond. which produces an amino group and initiates polymerization to form a dimer. 1D chain. and 2D nanoribbon with mixed sp2 and sp3 bonded carbon. Finally. it transforms into a graphitic polymer by eliminating ammonia. This study shows that applying pressure can induce a distinctive reaction which is guided by the structure of the molecular crystal.

A pressure-induced softening transverse acoustic (TA) phonon mode at the L point of the Brillouin zone is identified and the phonon softening pressure was predicted to be~ 4.92 GPa. which coincides with the experimentally observed second-order phase transition pressure of~ 5.3 GPa from fcc to distorted fcc. Moreover. no elastic instability is found under compression. Analysis of the calculated results suggests that the TA phonon instability is the driving force for this second-order phase transition. Furthermore. the current electron–phonon coupling (EPC) calculations suggest that the experimental observation of elevated superconducting transition temperature T c with pressure is from the increased EPC strength and …,True,lLnVHo4AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,16,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/19/42/425234/meta,12223762080855359387,/scholar?cites=12223762080855359387,,,0,0,0

The structural evolution with pressure of the Mg–C systems clearly shows a systematic trend with a progressive increase of electron donation from the Mg to C. To accommodate the electrons. the C valence sp orbitals rebybridized continually and adopted different modes of chemical bonding.
