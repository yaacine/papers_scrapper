The BigEarthNet consists of 590. 326 Sentinel-2 image patches. each of which is a section of i) 120 × 120 pixels for 10m bands; ii) 60×60 pixels for 20m bands; and iii) 20×20 pixels for 60m bands. Unlike most of the existing archives. each image patch is annotated by multiple land-cover classes (i.e.. multi-labels) that are provided from the CORINE Land Cover database of the year 2018 (CLC 2018). The BigEarthNet is significantly larger than the existing archives in remote sensing (RS) and thus is much more convenient to be used as a training source in the context of deep learning.

Traditional fully supervised algorithms fail to handle this problem where there is low between-class variance and high within-class variance for the classes of interest with small sample sizes. We study an even more extreme scenario named zero-shot learning (ZSL) in which no training example exists for some of the classes. ZSL aims to build a recognition model for new unseen categories by relating them to seen classes that were previously learned. We establish this relation by learning a compatibility function between image features extracted via a convolutional neural network and auxiliary information that describes the semantics of the classes of interest by using training samples from the seen classes …,True,beJ28JMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,41,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8071030/,4663110767681462795,/scholar?cites=4663110767681462795,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03323,0,0,0

BigEarthNet is made up of 590.326 image patches annotated with multi-labels provided by the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map of 2018 based on its most thematic detailed Level-3 class nomenclature. Initial research demonstrates that some CLC classes are challenging to be accurately described by considering only Sentinel-2 images. To increase the effectiveness of BigEarthNet. in this paper we introduce an alternative class-nomenclature to allow DL models for better learning and describing the complex spatial and spectral information content of the Sentinel-2 images. This is achieved by interpreting and arranging the CLC Level-3 nomenclature based on the properties of Sentinel-2 images in a new nomenclature of 19 classes. Then. the new class-nomenclature of BigEarthNet is used within state-of-the-art DL models in the context of multi-label classification.

In this study. we introduce an entire fuzzy system to tune dynamically the firefly parameters in order to keep the exploration and exploitation in balance in each of the searching steps. A serious concern of EAs is to be stuck in local optimum solutions. The proposed fuzzy controller helps the firefly algorithm to converge to the optimal solution and escape from local optimums. To evaluate the efficiency of the fuzzy-based firefly algorithm. we conduct experiments on a set of high dimensional benchmark functions.

1282987,Pose estimator and tracker using temporal flow maps for limbs,2019,Jihye Hwang and Jieun Lee and Sungheon Park and Nojun Kwak,,,,1-8,IEEE,For human pose estimation in videos. it is significant how to use temporal information between frames. In this paper. we propose temporal flow maps for limbs (TML) and a multi-stride method to estimate and track human poses. The proposed temporal flow maps are unit vectors describing the limbs' movements. We constructed a network to learn both spatial information and temporal information end-to-end. Spatial information such as joint heatmaps and part affinity fields is regressed in the spatial network part. and the TML is regressed in the temporal network part. We also propose a data augmentation method to learn various types of TML better. The proposed multi-stride method expands the data by randomly selecting two frames within a defined range. We demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently estimates and tracks human poses on the PoseTrack 2017 and 2018 datasets.,True,NpivtnsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8851734/,17482925635262419311,/scholar?cites=17482925635262419311,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09500,0,0,0

Unlike most previous approaches such as concept-based methods or rule-based structured models. the proposed method uses image captioning model to construct sentential queries for visual information. In detail. our approach exploits multiple captions generated by visual features in each image withDensecap'. Then. the similarities between captions of adjacent images are calculated. which is used to track semantically similar captions over multiple frames. Besides introducing this novel idea of'tracking by captioning'. the proposed method is one of the first approaches that uses a language generation model learned by neural networks to construct semantic query describing the relations and properties of visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. we have created a new evaluation dataset. which contains about 348 segments of scenes in 20 movie-trailers.

In this paper. we propose a novel handheld device that assists mobile phone users to walk more safely outdoors. The proposed system is implemented on a smart phone and uses its back camera to detect the current outdoor context. eg traffic intersections. roadways. and sidewalks. finally alerts the user of unsafe situations using sound and vibration from the phone. The outdoor context awareness is performed by three steps: preprocessing. feature extraction. and context recognition. First. it improves the image contrast while removing image noise. and then it extracts the color and texture descriptors from each pixel. Next. each pixel is classified as an intersection. sidewalk. or roadway using a support vector machine-based classifier. Then. to support the real-time performance on the smart phone. a multi-scale classification is applied to input image. where the coarse layer first discriminates the boundary pixels from the background and the fine layer categorizes the boundary pixels as sidewalk. roadway. or intersection.

We explore unusual poses that are rare which occupy a small portion in a pose dataset. In order to identify a rare pose without additional learning. a simple    -means clustering algorithm is applied to a given dataset.

In order to improve the performance on the rare poses. we proposed three methods for the problem of data scarcity. which are  addition of rare pose duplicates. addition of synthetic rare pose data and weighted loss based on the distance from the cluster.

The problem is challenging since it requires not only generating chemically valid molecular structures but also optimizing their chemical properties in the meantime. Inspired by the recent progress in deep generative models. in this paper we propose a flow-based autoregressive model for graph generation called GraphAF.

Experimental results show that GraphAF is able to generate 68% chemically valid molecules even without chemical knowledge rules and 100% valid molecules with chemical rules. The training process of GraphAF is two times faster than the existing state-of-the-art approach GCPN. After fine-tuning the model for goal-directed property optimization with reinforcement learning.

In contrast. knowledge embedding (KE) methods can effectively represent the relational facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) with informative entity embeddings. but conventional KE models cannot take full advantage of the abundant textual information.

Experimental results show that KEPLER achieves state-of-the-art performances on various NLP tasks. and also works remarkably well as an inductive KE model on KG link prediction. Furthermore. for pre-training and evaluating KEPLER. we construct Wikidata5M . a large-scale KG dataset with aligned entity descriptions. and benchmark state-of-the-art KE methods on it.

The Ideal Observer (IO) performance has been advocated to provide a figure-of-merit for use in assessing and optimizing imaging systems because the IO sets an upper performance limit among all observers. When joint signal detection and localization tasks are considered. the IO that employs a modified generalized likelihood ratio test maximizes observer performance as characterized by the localization receiver operating characteristic (LROC) curve. Computations of likelihood ratios are analytically intractable in the majority of cases. Therefore. sampling-based methods that employ Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have been developed to approximate the likelihood ratios. However. the applications of MCMC methods have been limited to relatively simple object models …,True,FYs57jwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9139307/,3876518753273721406,/scholar?cites=3876518753273721406,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/42/9273282/09139307.pdf,0,0,0
1283008,Learning stochastic object models from medical imaging measurements using Progressively-Growing AmbientGANs,2020,Weimin Zhou and Sayantan Bhadra and Frank J Brooks and Hua Li and Mark A Anastasio,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.00033,,,,It has been advocated that medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms should be assessed and optimized by use of objective measures of image quality that quantify the performance of an observer at specific diagnostic tasks. One important source of variability that can significantly limit observer performance is variation in the objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be described by stochastic object models (SOMs). A SOM is a generative model that can be employed to establish an ensemble of to-be-imaged objects with prescribed statistical properties. In order to accurately model variations in anatomical structures and object textures. it is desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system. Deep generative neural networks. such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold great potential for this task. However. conventional GANs are typically trained by use of reconstructed images that are influenced by the effects of measurement noise and the reconstruction process. To circumvent this. an AmbientGAN has been proposed that augments a GAN with a measurement operator. However. the original AmbientGAN could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures. such as progressive growing. which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized medical image data. To circumvent this. in this work. a new Progressive Growing AmbientGAN (ProAmGAN) strategy is developed for establishing SOMs from medical imaging measurements. Stylized numerical studies corresponding to common medical imaging modalities are …,True,FYs57jwAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00033,16714327979148275910,/scholar?cites=16714327979148275910,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00033,0,0,0

Supervised deep learning methods have been investigated to implement numerical observers for task-based image quality assessment. However. labeling large amounts of experimental data to train deep neural networks is tedious. expensive. and prone to subjective errors. Computer-simulated image data can potentially be employed to circumvent these issues; however. it is often difficult to computationally model complicated anatomical structures. noise sources. and the response of real-world imaging systems. Hence. simulated image data will generally possess physical and statistical differences from the experimental image data they seek to emulate.

Our DSA-RNN learns to (1) distribute soft-attention to candidate objects dynamically to gather subtle cues and (2) model the temporal dependencies of all cues to robustly anticipate an accident. Anticipating accidents is much less addressed than anticipating events such as changing a lane. making a turn. etc.. since accidents are rare to be observed and can happen in many different ways mostly in a sudden. To overcome these challenges. we (1) utilize state-of-the-art object detector [3] to detect candidate objects. and (2) incorporate full-frame and object-based appearance and motion features in our model.

Fault diagnosis task (FDT) is treated as an independent task. and rich correlation information contained in different tasks is ignored. Therefore. this article explores the possibility of using speed identification task (SIT) and load identification task (LIT) as two auxiliary tasks to improve the performance of the FDT and proposes a multitask one-dimensional convolutional neural network (MT-1DCNN). Specifically. the MT-1DCNN utilizes trunk network to learn shared features required for every task and then processes different tasks through multiple task-specific branches. In this way. the MT-1DCNN can utilize features learned by related tasks to improve the performance of the FDT.

Cham,Automatic segmentation of skin lesion in dermatoscope images is important for clinic diagnosis and assessment of melanoma. However. due to the large variations of scale. shape and appearance of the lesion area. accurate and automatic segmentation of skin lesion is faced with great challenges. In this paper. we first introduce the pyramid attention module for global multi-scale features aggregation. The module selectively integrates different multi-scale features associated with lesion by optimizing the features of each scale and suppressing the irrelevant noise. Based on this module. we propose an automatic framework for skin lesion segmentation. In addition. the widely used loss function based on dice coefficient is independent of the relative size of the segmented target. which leads to the insufficient attention of the network to small-scale samples.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have recently become the state-of-the-art automated OARs image segmentation method. However. due to the low contrast of head and neck organism tissues in CT. the fully automatic segmentation may still need to be refined to become accurate and robust enough for clinical use. We propose a deep learning-based multi-organ interactive segmentation method to improve the results obtained by an automatic CNN and to reduce user interactions during refinement for higher accuracy.

Despite recent progress in applying deep learning to the segmentation of multiple natural image scenarios. addressing of the intervertebral disc segmentation with a small-sized training set are still challenging problems. In this paper. a new framework with fully dilated separable convolution (FDS-CNN) is proposed for the automated segmentation of the intervertebral disc using a small-sized training set. Firstly. a fully dilated separable convolutional network is designed to effectively prevent the loss of context information by reducing the number of down-sampling.

Globally. 1.62 billion people are affected by Hb diseases. Clinical assessment of hemoglobin levels. using the cyan-methemoglobin method is reliable. but the process is not portable. results are not immediately available. and this test is unaffordable. and cost-ineffective for most patients in low-and middle-income countries who might benefit. When medical facilities and financial resources are available. frequent repeated testing is less than convenient under this method. In the presence of serious illness. with demands for repeated testing. the delays in obtaining results and the associated blood loss are particular drawbacks of this testing method. In these multiple circumstances. the potential advantages of a non-invasive. point-of-care (POC) method for hemoglobin measurement are clear. There are currently commercial non-invasive POC tools available for non-invasive Hb measurements.

Previously. the detection of disease used to take a significant amount of time and was less reliable. Machine learning (ML) techniques employed in recent biomedical researches are making revolutionary changes by gaining higher accuracy with more concise timing. At present. it is even possible to automatically detect diseases from the scanned images with the help of ML. In this research. we have taken such an attempt to detect retinal diseases from optical coherence tomography (OCT) X-ray images. Here. we propose a deep learning (DL) based approach in detecting retinal diseases from OCT images which can identify three conditions of the retina. Four different models used in this approach are compared with each other. On the test set. the detection accuracy is 98.00\% for a vanilla convolutional neural network (CNN) model. 99.07\% for Xception model. 97.00\% for ResNet50 model. and 99.17\% for MobileNetV2 model. The MobileNetV2 model acquires the highest accuracy. and the closest to the highest is the Xception model.

Though a large amount of efforts have been made. precise retrieval on video shots with certain topics has been largely ignored. At the same time. due to the popularity of novel time-sync comments. or so-called"" bullet-screen comments"". video semantics could be now combined with timestamps to support further research on temporal video labeling. In this paper. we propose a novel video understanding framework to assign temporal labels on highlighted video shots.

Indeed. many previous works suggested that the simple nearest-neighbor classification is effective and difficult to beat. However. we usually need to determine the distance metric (e.g.. Euclidean distance and Dynamic Time Warping) for different domains. and current evidence shows that there is no distance metric that is best for all time series data. Thus. the choice of distance metric has to be done empirically. which is time expensive and not always effective. To automatically determine the distance metric. in this paper. we investigate the distance metric learning and propose a novel Convolutional Nonlinear Neighbourhood Components Analysis model for time series classification.

The goal is to leverage the knowledge gained from previous tasks to do better on the new task than without using the previous knowledge. This is a lifelong learning setting. This paper proposes a novel deep learning model for lifelong sentiment classification. The key novelty of the proposed model is that it uses two networks: a knowledge retention network for retaining domain-specific knowledge learned in the past. and a feature learning network for classification feature learning.

Among all matching methods. attention mechanism plays an important role in capturing the semantic relations and properly aligning the elements of two sentences. Previous methods utilized attention mechanism to select important parts of sentences at one time. However. the important parts of the sentence during semantic matching are dynamically changing with the degree of sentence understanding. Selecting the important parts at one time may be insufficient for semantic understanding. To this end. we propose a Dynamic Re-read Network (DRr-Net) approach for sentence semantic matching. which is able to pay close attention to a small region of sentences at each step and re-read the important words for better sentence semantic understanding.

Discarding noisy labels avoids a harmful memorization. while the associated image content can still be exploited in a semi-supervised learning (SSL) setup. Clean samples are usually identified using the small loss trick. ie they exhibit a low loss. However. we show that different noise distributions make the application of this trick less straightforward and propose to continuously relabel all images to reveal a discriminative loss against multiple distributions. SSL is then applied twice. once to improve the clean-noisy detection and again for training the final model. We design an experimental setup based on ImageNet32/64 for better understanding the consequences of representation learning with differing label noise distributions and find that non-uniform out-of-distribution noise better resembles real-world noise and that in most cases intermediate features are not affected by label noise corruption.

Accurate estimation of grass and clover biomass yield enables smart decisions in optimizing fertilization and seeding density. resulting in increased productivity and positive environmental impact. Grass and clover are usually planted together. since clover is a nitrogen-fixing plant that brings nutrients to the soil. Adjusting the right percentages of clover and grass in a field reduces the need for external fertilization. Existing approaches for estimating the grass-clover composition of a field are expensive and time consuming-random samples of the pasture are clipped and then the components are physically separated to weigh and calculate percentages of dry grass. clover and weeds in each sample. There is growing interest in developing novel deep learning based approaches to non-destructively extract pasture phenotype indicators and biomass yield predictions of different plant species from agricultural imagery collected from the field. Providing these indicators and predictions from images alone remains a significant challenge. Heavy occlusions in the dense mixture of grass. clover and weeds make it difficult to estimate each component accurately. Moreover. although supervised deep learning models perform well with large datasets. it is tedious to acquire large and diverse collections of field images with precise ground truth for different biomass yields.

1283065,Remote photoplethysmography with constrained ICA using periodicity and chrominance constraints,2018,Richard Macwan and Yannick Benezeth and Alamin Mansouri,17,Biomedical engineering online,1,22,BioMed Central,Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has been in the forefront recently for measuring cardiac pulse rates from live or recorded videos. It finds advantages in scenarios requiring remote monitoring. such as medicine and fitness. where contact based monitoring is limiting and cumbersome. The blood volume pulse. defined as the pulsative flow of arterial blood. gives rise to periodic changes in the skin color which are then quantified to estimate a temporal signal. This temporal signal can be analysed using various methods to extract the representative cardiac signal. We present a novel method for measuring rPPG signals using constrained independent component analysis (cICA). We incorporate a priori information into the cICA algorithm to aid in the extraction of the most prominent rPPG signal. This a priori information is implemented using two constraints: first. based on periodicity using autocorrelation. and second. a chrominance-based constraint exploiting the physical characteristics of the skin.

1283066,Remote heart rate variability for emotional state monitoring,2018,Yannick Benezeth and Peixi Li and Richard Macwan and Keisuke Nakamura and Randy Gomez and Fan Yang,,,,153-156,IEEE,Several researches have been conducted to recognize emotions using various modalities such as facial expressions. gestures. speech or physiological signals. Among all these modalities. physiological signals are especially interesting because they are mainly controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It has been shown for example that there is an undeniable relationship between emotional state and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). In this paper. we present a methodology to monitor emotional state from physiological signals acquired remotely. The method is based on a remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) algorithm that estimates remote Heart Rate Variability (rHRV) using a simple camera. We first show that the rHRV signal can be estimated with a high accuracy (more than 96% in frequency domain).

This technique is increasingly used in many application fields thanks to its simplicity and affordability. The basic idea is that the arterial blood flow shows regularity due to the heartbeat. This regularity is manifested by very small periodic variations in the color of the skin. which can be isolated and quantified by signal and image processing methods. In this context. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is largely used to separate the signal due to arterial flow from signals from other sources (skin. lighting. etc.). However. basic ICA is considered blind. i.e. it uses no a priori knowledge of the sources leading to issues in identification of the separated sources.

The remote measurement of the Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) signal is also possible. but this is much more complicated because it is then necessary to detect the peaks on the temporal rPPG signal. which is usually quite noisy and has a lower temporal resolution than PPG signals obtained by contact equipment. Since the PRV signal is vital for various applications such as remote recognition of stress and emotion. the improvement of PRV measurement by rPPG is a critical task. Contact based PRV measurement has already been investigated. but the research on remotely measured PRV is very limited. In this paper. we propose to use the Periodic Variance Maximization (PVM) method to extract the rPPG signal and event-related Two-Window algorithm to improve the peak detection for PRV measurement. We have made several contributions. Firstly. we show that the newly proposed PVM method and Two-Window algorithm can be used for PRV measurement in the non-contact scenario. Secondly. we propose a method to adaptively determine the parameters of the Two-Window method. Thirdly. we compare the algorithm with other attempts for improving the non-contact PRV measurement such as the Slope Sum Function (SSF) method and the Local Maximum method. We calculated several features and compared the accuracy based on the ground truth provided by contact equipment.

As multiple noise sources can pollute the estimated signal. post-processing techniques. such as bandpass filtering. are generally used. However. it is often possible to see alterations in the filtered signal that have not been suppressed. although an experienced eye can easily identify them. From this observation. we propose in this work to use an LSTM network to filter the rPPG signal. The network is able to learn the characteristic shape of the rPPG signal and especially its temporal structure. which is not possible with the usual signal processing-based filtering methods.

Remote photoplethysmography is increasingly being used for non-contact measurement of heart rate from videos which is one of the most common biomedical property required for most medical diagnosis. One of the common techniques for performing remote photoplethysmography involves using Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods to extract the cardiac signal from video data. In this context. the objective of this thesis is to develop different methods in the field of extraction and separation of sources by improving upon traditional BSS methods. These novel semiblind source extraction methods are integrated with biophysical constraints. and applied to the application of remote photoplethysmography measurement. In addition. one of these methods is extended to measure the spatial distribution of photoplethysmographic signals of the skin. Remote photoplethysmography aims to measure biophysical parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability by quantifying the periodic changes in skin color due to the rhythmic beating of the heart. These changes manifest in the image data obtained from simple video cameras. which is processed to generate a temporal signal representing the cardiac signal. We have improved existing methods by incorporating the ubiquitous property of quasiperiodicity of biophysical signals such as cardiac and neurological signals.

Challenges in modeling human motion include high dimensional prediction as well as extremely complicated dynamics. We present a novel approach to human motion modeling based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The hierarchical structure of CNN makes it capable of capturing both spatial and temporal correlations effectively. In our proposed approach. a convolutional long-term encoder is used to encode the whole given motion sequence into a long-term hidden variable. which is used with a decoder to predict the remainder of the sequence. The decoder itself also has an encoder-decoder structure. in which the short-term encoder encodes a shorter sequence to a short-term hidden variable. and the spatial decoder maps the long and short-term hidden variable to motion predictions. By using such a model. we are able to capture both invariant and dynamic information of human motion. which results in more accurate predictions.

We argue that 3D human pose estimation from a monocular input is an inverse problem where multiple feasible solutions can exist. In this paper. we propose a novel approach to generate multiple feasible hypotheses of the 3D pose from 2D joints. In contrast to existing deep learning approaches which minimize a mean square error based on an unimodal Gaussian distribution. our method is able to generate multiple feasible hypotheses of 3D pose based on a multimodal mixture density networks. Our experiments show that the 3D poses estimated by our approach from an input of 2D joints are consistent in 2D reprojections. which supports our argument that multiple solutions exist for the 2D-to-3D inverse problem.

1283083,Weakly Supervised Generative Network for Multiple 3D Human Pose Hypotheses,2020,Chen Li and Gim Hee Lee,,,,,,3D human pose estimation from a single image is an inverse problem due to the inherent ambiguity of the missing depth. Several previous works addressed the inverse problem by generating multiple hypotheses. However. these works are strongly supervised and require ground truth 2D-to-3D correspondences which can be difficult to obtain. In this paper. we propose a weakly supervised deep generative network to address the inverse problem and circumvent the need for ground truth 2D-to-3D correspondences. To this end. we design our network to model a proposal distribution which we use to approximate the unknown multi-modal target posterior distribution. We achieve the approximation by minimizing the KL divergence between the proposal and target distributions. and this leads to a 2D reprojection error and a prior loss term that can be weakly supervised. Furthermore. we determine the most probable solution as the conditional mode of the samples using the mean-shift algorithm. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets--Human3. 6M.

Unlike conventional methods doing feature extraction and feature matching separately. we pair patches from sensed and reference images. and then learn the mapping directly between these patch-pairs and their matching labels for later registration. This end-to-end architecture allows us to optimize the whole processing (learning mapping function) through information feedback when training the network. which is lacking in conventional methods. In addition. to alleviate the small data issue of remote sensing images for training. our proposal introduces a self-learning by learning the mapping function using images and their transformed copies.

We consider the reason is twofold: 1. the weaker discriminative feature learned by conventional methods; 2. the significant appearance difference between two images domains. To tackle these problems. we propose an aggregated feature difference learning network (AFD-Net). Unlike other methods that merely rely on the high-level features. we find the feature differences in other levels also provide useful learning information. Thus. the multi-level feature differences are aggregated to enhance the discrimination. To make features invariant across different domains. we introduce a domain invariant feature extraction network based on instance normalization (IN). In order to optimize the AFD-Net. we borrow the large margin cosine loss which can minimize intra-class distance and maximize inter-class distance between matching and non-matching samples.

Cham, Cross-spectral image patch matching is a challenging problem due to the significant difference between two images caused by different imaging mechanisms. We consider cross-spectral image patches can be matched because there exists a shared semantic feature space among them. in which the semantic features from different spectral images will be more independent of the spectral domains. To learn this shared feature space. we propose a progressive comparison of spatially connected feature metric learning with a feature discrimination constrain (SCFDM). The progressive comparison of spatially connected feature network keeps the property of each spectral domain in its corresponding low-level feature space. and interacts the cross-spectral features in a high-level feature space.

The method identifies the effect of CO2 changes on patent applications via R&D investment using the following six factors: production. energy intensity. fuel mix. CO2 emission coefficient. R&D reaction. and R&D efficiency. Using the data from 2004 to 2012. we apply the proposed method to the four countries (France. Germany.

1283128,A decomposition-construction approach for solving the home health care scheduling problem,2019,Marouene Chaieb and Jaber Jemai and Khaled Mellouli,,Health care management science,,1-23,Springer US,Solving NP-hard Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COP) is a complex process as it deals with difficult cases essentially when using classical modeling techniques that may fail in handling real-life problems efficiently. In this context. Hierarchical Optimization Models (HOM) can be viewed as an effective alternative for modeling numerous difficult optimization problems. Their efficiency is explained by their ability to relax the COP complexity by decomposing it hierarchically into a set of weaker and easier interconnected subproblems.

In addition. the diversity of hierarchical optimization problems requires different types of multilevel relations between sub-problems. Thus. the approximate and accurate representations and solutions can be integrated. That is. to address the how partial solutions of sub-problems can be reintegrated to build a solution for the main problem.

The main desired quality of such approaches is to overcome the lack of information availability in the beginning of the solving process. That is by proposing flexible partial solutions anticipating future requests. In this paper. we propose a neural model based on Hierarchical self-organizing maps (HSOM) for solving the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP). The DVRP consists of finding routes for a set of vehicles to serve customer's dynamically issued requests while minimizing routing costs and satisfying some constraints.

Thus. the process to solve the main initial COP may pass through solving intermediate problems and then combining the obtained partial solutions to find initial problem’s global solutions. Such intermediate problems are supposed to be easier to handle than the initial problem. To be modeled using the hierarchical optimization framework. the master problem should satisfy a set of desirable conditions. These conditions are related to some characteristics of problems which are: multi-objectives problem. over constrained problems. conditions on data and problems with partial nested decisions.

Detection of splicing forgery remains a challenging task in image forensics. Base on the fact that images from different origins should have different amount of noise produced by image sensors or post processing by software. in this paper we proposed a novel detection method by analyzing noise discrepancy to expose and locate splicing forgery in digital images.

Connected dominating set (CDS) has been considered as an efficient solution to solve such a problem by constructing a virtual backbone network to achieve the scalability and efficiency of wireless networks. In this paper. we propose an efficient connected dominating set clustering based routing protocol with dynamic channel selection (CRD) in multi-channel cognitive radio MANETs to obtain high packet delivery ratio (PDR). low control overheads. low delay and low energy consumption when node is moving in high speed. Moreover. CRD protocol can apply for Vehicular Ad Hoc Network. IoT and 5G. The proposed CRD protocol includes clustering and routing phases under multi-channel cognitive radio approach. In the clustering phase. we propose CDS selection. CDS size reduction and CDS based clustering algorithms to formulate clusters and provide a set of intermediate nodes which is latter used as a route searching space for the routing phase. In the routing phase. a sending channel based focus region selection (CFS) algorithm is adopted dynamically to establish an efficient route from a set of intermediate nodes that avoids the affected region of a primary user. The CRD routing protocol is then implemented in environmental conditions close to reality (OMNET++ platform) to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional AODV protocol in terms of PDR. control overhead. delay and energy consumption.

The secondary transmitters including source and relays must adjust their transmit power to satisfy interference power constraints required by multiple primary receivers (PRs).

With emerging multilingualism in urban India. often bilingual. trilingual or even more languages need to be supported. This demands development of a multilingual OCR system which can work seamlessly across Indic scripts. In our approach the script is identified at word level. prior to the recognition of the word. An end-to-end RNN based architecture which can detect the script and recognize the text in a segmentation-free manner is proposed for this purpose. We demonstrate the approach for 12 Indian languages and English. It is observed that. even with the similar architecture. performance on Indian languages are poorer compared to English.

Reasons for this limitation includes the lack of resources (e.g. not enough examples with natural variations. lack of documentation available about the possible font/style variations) and the architecture which necessitates hard segmentation of word images followed by an isolated symbol recognition. Variations among scripts. latent symbol to UNICODE conversion rules. non-standard fonts/styles and large degradations are some of the major reasons for the unavailability of robust solutions. In this paper. we propose a web based OCR system which (i) follows a unified architecture for seven Indian languages. (ii) is robust against popular degradations.

Our approach is inspired by the advancements in mid-level features. We represent the text images using mid-level features which are pooled from densely computed local features. Once text images are represented using the proposed mid-level feature representation. we use an off-the-shelf classifier to identify the script of the text image. Our approach is efficient and requires very less labeled data. We evaluate the performance of our method on a recently introduced CVSI dataset. demonstrating that the proposed approach can correctly identify script of 96.70% of the text images.

Both these problems have been attempted in the past with representations computed from the distribution of connected components or characters (e.g. texture. n-gram). Often these features are computed from a larger segment (a paragraph or a page). We argue that one can predict the script or language with minimal evidence (e.g. given only a word or a line) very accurately with the help of a pre-trained RNN. We propose a simple and generic solution for the task of script and language identification which do not require any special tuning. Our method represents the word images as a sequence of feature vectors. and employ the RNNs for the identification.

Most modern web browsers counter phishing attacks using a blacklist of confirmed phishing URLs. However. one major disadvantage of the blacklist method is that it is ineffective against newly generated phishes. Machine learning based techniques that rely on features extracted from URL (e.g.. URL length and bag-of-words) or web page (e.g.. TF-IDF and form fields) are considered to be more effective in identifying new phishing attacks. The main benefit of using URL based features over page based features is that the machine learning model can classify new URLs on-the-fly even before the page is loaded by the web browser. thus avoiding other potential dangers such as drive-by download attacks and cryptojacking attacks.In this work. we focus on …,True,mtaDclEAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC,6,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20951-3_21,5585883953551399115,/scholar?cites=5585883953551399115,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harshal_Tupsamudre/publication/333812784_Everything_Is_in_the_Name_-_A_URL_Based_Approach_for_Phishing_Detection/links/5d5e911e92851c376371bd26/Everything-Is-in-the-Name-A-URL-Based-Approach-for-Phishing-Detection.pdf,0,0,0

However. wrist-worn activity monitoring is challenging due to the wide degree of freedom for the hand movements. as well as similarity of hand movements in different activities such as varying intensities of cycling. To strengthen the ability of wrist-worn sensors in detecting human activities more accurately. motion signals can be complemented by physiological signals such as optical heart rate (HR) based on photoplethysmography. In this paper. an activity monitoring framework using an optical HR sensor and a triaxial wrist-worn accelerometer is presented. We investigated a range of daily life activities including sitting. standing. household activities and stationary cycling with two intensities. A random forest (RF) classifier was exploited to detect these activities based on the wrist motions and optical HR. The highest overall accuracy of 89.6±3.9% was achieved with a forest of a size of 64 trees and 13-s signal segments with 90% overlap. Removing the HR-derived features decreased the classification accuracy of high-intensity cycling by almost 7%. but did not affect the classification accuracies of other activities. A feature reduction utilizing the feature importance scores of RF was also carried out and resulted in a shrunken feature set of only 21 features. The overall accuracy of the classification utilizing the shrunken feature set was 89.4±4.2%. which is almost equivalent to the above-mentioned peak overall accuracy.

Toronto. Canada,Background: Clinical characterization of motion in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) is challenging: symptom progression. suitability of medication. and level of independence in the home environment can vary across time and patients. Appointments at the neurological outpatient clinic provide a limited understanding of the overall situation. In order to follow up these variations. longer-term measurements performed outside of the clinic setting could help optimize and personalize therapies. Several wearable sensors have been used to estimate the severity of symptoms in PD; however. longitudinal recordings. even for a short duration of a few days. are rare. Home recordings have the potential benefit of providing a more thorough and objective follow-up of the disease while providing more information about the possible need to change medications or consider invasive treatments.Objective: The primary objective of this study is to collect a dataset for developing methods to detect PD-related symptoms that are visible in walking patterns at home.

Their deep architecture extracts low- and high-level features from images. thus improving the model's performance. In this paper. we propose a method for image demosaicking based on deep convolutional neural networks. Demosaicking is the task of reproducing full color images from incomplete images formed from overlaid color filter arrays on image sensors found in digital cameras. Instead of producing the output image directly. the proposed method divides the demosaicking task into an initial demosaicking step and a refinement step. The initial step produces a rough demosaicked image containing unwanted color artifacts. The refinement step then reduces these color artifacts using deep residual estimation and multi-model fusion producing a higher quality image.

With infectious disease backgrounds usually being more complex. appropriate surveillance schemes must be in order. One such procedure is through the use of control charts. However. with most background processes following a zeroinflated Poisson (ZIP) distribution as brought about by the extra variability due to excess zeros. the control charting procedures must be properly developed to address this issue. Hence in this paper. drawing inspiration from the development of combined control charting procedures for simultaneously monitoring each ZIP parameter individually in the context of statistical process control (SPC). several combined exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control charting procedures were proposed (Bernoulli-ZIP and CRL-ZTP EWMA charts). Through an extensive simulation study involving multiple parameter settings and outbreak model considerations (ie. different shapes. magnitude. and duration). some key results were observed. These include the applicability of performing combined control charting procedures for disease surveillance with a ZIP background using EWMA techniques.

This is necessary for supporting resource allocation and intervention planning in disease control programs. Currently. there is no known concrete and unambiguous computational representation of factors that influence tuberculosis (TB) treatment adherence behavior that is useful for prediction. This study developed a computer-based conceptual model for capturing and structuring knowledge about the factors that influence TB treatment adherence behavior in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).MethodsAn extensive review of existing categorization systems in the literature was used to develop a …,True,XsozZogAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,11,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854235/,9732021935384442515,/scholar?cites=9732021935384442515,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854235/,0,0,0

Cham,This paper proposes an improved Generalized Regression Neural Network (KGRNN) for the diagnosis of type II diabetes. Diabetes. a widespread chronic disease. is a metabolic disorder that develops when the body does not make enough insulin or is unable to use insulin effectively. Type II diabetes is the most common type and accounts for an estimated 90% of cases. The novel KGRNN technique reported in this study uses an enhanced K-Means clustering technique (CVE-K-Means) to produce cluster centers (centroids) that are used to train the network. The technique was applied to the Pima Indian diabetes dataset. a widely used benchmark dataset for Diabetes diagnosis. The technique outperforms the best known GRNN techniques for Type II diabetes diagnosis in terms of classification accuracy and computational time and obtained a classification accuracy of 86% with 83% sensitivity and 87 …,True,XsozZogAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,8,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-95171-3_52,7064285889610281607,/scholar?cites=7064285889610281607,,,,0,0,0

1283242,Features of Speech Audio for Accent Recognition,2020,Yuvika Singh and Anban Pillay and Edgar Jembere,,,,1-6,IEEE,An accent is the distinctive way words are pronounced. Every speaker has an accent. which varies by gender. age. formality. social class. geographical region. and native language. Accent recognition is an important task as it can help improve Automatic Speech Recognition by first identifying the accent and then transferring to a Speech Recognizer that is trained for a particular accent group. Accent recognition is a complex problem due to the numerous characteristics that set accents apart. Accents differ by voice quality. phoneme pronunciation. and prosody. Since it is difficult to extract these exact features. existing work uses alternate features such as spectral features. which captures the frequency of speech. Such features include the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). Spectrogram. Chromagram. Spectral Centroid. and Spectral Roll-off. which are extracted from raw audio samples.

We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient. the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in precision medicine. where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing. this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer: each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (eg for each position in the genome where variations are observed). and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units).

In this paper. we start with the idea that a model must be able to understand individual objects and relationships between objects in order to generate complex scenes well. Our layout-to-image-generation method. which we call Object-Centric Generative Adversarial Network (or OC-GAN). relies on a novel Scene-Graph Similarity Module (SGSM). The SGSM learns representations of the spatial relationships between objects in the scene. which lead to our model's improved layout-fidelity. We also propose changes to the conditioning mechanism of the generator that enhance its object instance-awareness. Apart from improving image quality. our contributions mitigate two failure modes in previous approaches:(1) spurious objects being generated without corresponding bounding boxes in the layout. and (2) overlapping bounding boxes in the layout leading to merged objects in images. Extensive quantitative evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate the impact of our contributions. with our model outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches on both the COCO-Stuff and Visual Genome datasets.

To allow for test-time transfer. each class is annotated with semantic information. commonly in the form of attributes or text descriptions. While classical zero-shot learning does not explicitly forbid using information from other datasets. the approaches that achieve the best absolute performance on image benchmarks rely on features extracted from encoders pretrained on Imagenet. This approach relies on hyper-optimized Imagenet-relevant parameters from the supervised classification setting. entangling important questions about the suitability of those parameters and how they were learned with more fundamental questions about representation learning and generalization. To remove these distractors. we propose a more challenging setting: Zero-Shot Learning from scratch (ZFS). which explicitly forbids the use of encoders fine-tuned on other datasets.

The current convention is to approach this task with cycle-consistent GANs: using a discriminator to encourage the generator to change the image to match the target domain. while training the generator to be inverted with another mapping. While ending up with paired inverse functions may be a good end result. enforcing this restriction at all times during training can be a hindrance to effective modeling. We propose an alternate approach that directly restricts the generator to performing a simple sparse transformation in a latent layer. motivated by recent work from cognitive neuroscience suggesting an architectural prior on representations corresponding to consciousness. Our biologically motivated approach leads to representations more amenable to transformation by disentangling high-level abstract concepts in the latent space.

IBM TrueNorth chip received tremendous attentions in society. However. one of the known issues in TrueNorth design is the limited precision of synaptic weights. each of which can be selected from only four integers.

We start with the fundamental knowledge including what are adversarial examples. how to realize such attacks. and common defense methods. Adversarial training enhances models’ resilience to adversarial attacks by taking both regular and adversarial examples for training. However. applying adversarial examples under a single adversarial strength provide defense in a very limited effective range. We propose a multiple-strength adversarial training method. A random walk algorithm is adopted to optimize the selection of adversarial strengths. which is closely related to the design cost and training time.

State-of-the-art defensive techniques add various adversarial examples in training to improve models' adversarial robustness.

Quantization is a useful technique in deploying neural networks on hardware platforms and saving computation costs with negligible performance loss. However. recent research reveals that neural network models. no matter full-precision or quantized. are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work. we analyze both adversarial and quantization losses and then introduce criteria to evaluate them. We propose a boundary-based retraining method to mitigate adversarial and quantization losses together and adopt a nonlinear mapping method to defend against white-box gradient-based adversarial attacks. The evaluations demonstrate that our method can better restore accuracy after quantization than other baseline methods on both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

1283302,A numerical framework for computing steady states of size-structured population models and their stability,2017,Inom Mirzaev and David M Bortz,14,Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering,4,1-20,,Structured population models are a class of general evolution equations which are widely used in the study of biological systems. Many theoretical methods are available for establishing existence and stability of steady states of general evolution equations. However. except for very special cases. finding an analytical form of stationary solutions for evolution equations is a challenging task. In the present paper. we develop a numerical framework for computing approximations to stationary solutions of general evolution equations. which can also be used to produce existence and stability regions for steady states. In particular. we use the Trotter-Kato Theorem to approximate the infinitesimal generator of an evolution equation on a finite dimensional space. which in turn reduces the evolution equation into a system of ordinary differential equations. Consequently. we approximate and study the asymptotic behavior of stationary solutions. We illustrate the convergence of our numerical framework by applying it to a linear Sinko-Streifer structured population model for which the exact form of the steady state is known. To further illustrate the utility of our approach. we apply our framework to nonlinear population balance equation. which is an extension of well-known Smoluchowksi coagulation-fragmentation model to biological populations. We also demonstrate that our numerical framework can be used to gain insight about the theoretical stability of the stationary solutions of the evolution equations.

As an extension of our previous work. we introduce a graph-based framework to calculate steady state solutions of biochemical reaction networks with synthesis and degradation. Our approach is based on a labeled directed graph  and the associated system of linear non-homogeneous differential equations with first-order degradation and zeroth-order synthesis. We also present a theorem which provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the dynamics to engender a unique stable steady state. Although the dynamics are linear. one can apply this framework to nonlinear systems by encoding nonlinearity into the edge labels.

The Python package egtplot represents an attempt to make simple. visual analysis of a particular class of evolutionary games–those with three players and which can be represented by a payoff matrix. Using egtplot. these games can be visualized as static images or as animations with a variety of parameters to control what information is presented in the graphic.EGT is a reformulation of classical game theory wherein the players of the game are members of a population. These members do not choose a strategy. but instead are born with their strategy ingrained. ie. they cannot change strategy during the game. In biological terms. the strategies might represent discrete species or genotypes. hawks and doves being a classic example. Payoffs the players gain or lose based on their interactions with other players increase or decrease their fitness. thereby influencing the number or proportion of members playing that strategy in the next generation. As such. the populations of strategies can wax and wane as they outcompete or are outcompeted by other strategies.,True,F9t2Q6gAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,4,https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00735.pdf,9830657330635265172,/scholar?cites=9830657330635265172,,,https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00735.pdf,0,0,0
1283305,Considerations for the interpretation of bias measures of word embeddings,2019,Inom Mirzaev and Anthony Schulte and Michael Conover and Sam Shah,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.08379,,,,Word embedding spaces are powerful tools for capturing latent semantic relationships between terms in corpora. and have become widely popular for building state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithms. However. studies have shown that societal biases present in text corpora may be incorporated into the word embedding spaces learned from them. Thus. there is an ethical concern that human-like biases contained in the corpora and their derived embedding spaces might be propagated. or even amplified with the usage of the biased embedding spaces in downstream applications. In an attempt to quantify these biases so that they may be better understood and studied. several bias metrics have been proposed. We explore the statistical properties of these proposed measures in the context of their cited applications as well as their supposed utilities. We find that there are caveats to the simple interpretation of these metrics as proposed. We find that the bias metric proposed by Bolukbasi et al. 2016 is highly sensitive to embedding hyper-parameter selection. and that in many cases. the variance due to the selection of some hyper-parameters is greater than the variance in the metric due to corpus selection. while in fewer cases the bias rankings of corpora vary with hyper-parameter selection. In light of these observations. it may be the case that bias estimates should not be thought to directly measure the properties of the underlying corpus. but rather the properties of the specific embedding spaces in question. particularly in the context of hyper-parameter selections used to generate them. Hence. bias metrics of spaces generated with …,True,F9t2Q6gAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08379,9769141887264975582,/scholar?cites=9769141887264975582,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08379,0,0,0
1283306,Stability of steady states for a class of flocculation equations with growth and removal,2015,Inom Mirzaev and David M Bortz,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.07127,,,,Flocculation is the process whereby particles (ie. flocs) in suspension reversibly combine and separate. The process is widespread in soft matter and aerosol physics as well as environmental science and engineering. We consider a general size-structured flocculation model. which describes the evolution of flocs in an aqueous environment. Our work provides a unified treatment for many size-structured models in the environmental. industrial. medical. and marine engineering literature. In particular. our model accounts for basic biological phenomena in a population of microorganisms including growth. death. sedimentation. predation. renewal. fragmentation and aggregation. Our central goal in this paper is to rigorously investigate the long-term behavior of this generalized flocculation model. Using results from fixed point theory we derive conditions for the existence of continuous. non-trivial stationary solutions. We further apply the principle of linearized stability and semigroup compactness arguments to provide sufficient conditions for local exponential stability of stationary solutions as well as sufficient conditions for instability.The end results of this analytical development are relatively simple inequality-criteria which thus allows for the rapid evaluation of the existence and stability of a non-trivial stationary solution. To our knowledge. this work is the first to derive precise existence and stability criteria for such a generalized model.

Classical change-point detection procedures. such as CUSUM.

Instead we propose a new method for change-point detection based on Inductive Conformal Martingales. which requires only the independence and identical distribution of observations. We compare the proposed approach to standard methods. as well as to change-point detection oracles. which model a typical practical situation when we have only imprecise (albeit parametric) information about pre-and post-change data distributions.

In this paper. we extend the framework from classification (where probabilities are predicted for a discrete number of labels) to regression (where labels form a continuum). We show how Venn Predictors can be applied on top of any regression method to obtain calibrated predictive distributions. without requiring assumptions beyond iid of calibration and test sets. This is contrasted with methods such as Bayesian Linear Regression. for which the calibration guarantee instead relies on specific probabilistic assumptions on the distribution of the data. The adaptation of Venn Machine to regression required a theoretical analysis of the transductive and inductive forms of the predictor. We identify potential consistency problems and provide solutions for them. Finally. to illustrate their advantages. we apply regression Venn Predictors to the medical problem of predicting the survival time after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. a potentially risky procedure that improves blood flow to a patient’s heart.

To ensure a dataset coverage. we use an adversarial loss function that penalizes for incorrect reproductions of a given texture.

In this work. we propose self-supervising control on top of human teleoperated play data as a way to scale up skill learning. Play has two properties that make it attractive compared to conventional task demonstrations. Play is cheap. as it can be collected in large quantities quickly without task segmenting. labeling. or resetting to an initial state. Play is naturally rich. covering∼ 4x more interaction space than task demonstrations for the same amount of collection time. To learn control from play. we introduce Play-LMP. a self-supervised method that learns to organize play behaviors in a latent space. then reuse them at test time to achieve specific goals. Combining self-supervised control with a diverse play dataset shifts the focus of skill learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to the full continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find that this combination generalizes well empirically—after self-supervising on unlabeled play. our method substantially outperforms individual expert-trained policies on 18 difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a simulated robotic tabletop environment. We additionally find that play-supervised models. unlike their expert-trained counterparts. are more robust to perturbations and exhibit retrying-till-success behaviors. Finally. we find that our agent organizes its latent plan space around functional tasks. despite never being trained with task labels.

We propose a model-based reinforcement learning framework leveraging a combination of video prediction with GANs and online tree-search methods. Our method attempts to combine the near-horizon benefits of a learned dynamics model with the farhorizon benefits of a value network. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is generally able to produce visually-realistic predictions and achieve performance results somewhat comparable to state-of-the-art such as DQN.,True,LIJQ_ZYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,3,http://tedxiao.me/pdf/gans_drl.pdf,11169516040071335852,/scholar?cites=11169516040071335852,,,http://tedxiao.me/pdf/gans_drl.pdf,0,0,0

1283352,Frame Rate Upscaling with Deep Neural Networks,2016,Ted Xiao and Raul Puri and Gautham Kesineni,,"Term Paper for CS294-129 Deep Neural Networks, Fall",,,,Frame interpolation is a computer vision task that is largely performed on real world video data to increase the number of frames per second. Video streaming could benefit greatly from this technique. as it could allow for streaming of lower frame rate video that could then be interpolated to generate more frames and produce smoother high-framerate video. Currently approaches leave a lot to be desired in that the images produced are blurry and look like simple averages of already existing frames due to linear interpolation techniques. This is passable in real video (non-animated). as the blurry image helps evoke a sense of motion. However. 2D animated videos have sharp. defined individual frames; blurry interpolated images do not fit with the overall style of the videos. and are easily detected by the human eye.Furthermore. enhancing these techniques to photorealistic levels could have huge potential in animation. By computing the surrounding frames and interpolating the middle ones. computational effort to produce both live and pre-rendered animations could be greatly reduced. What we attempt to achieve in this project is to use deep learning to enhance the quality of interpolated frames. We want to develop a robust algorithm for both real world and 2D video frame rate upscaling.,True,LIJQ_ZYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1,http://tedxiao.me/pdf/CS294_Report.pdf,17588607251533848289,/scholar?cites=17588607251533848289,,,http://tedxiao.me/pdf/CS294_Report.pdf,0,0,0

1283355,Goal-Driven Dynamics Learning via Bayesian Optimization,2017,Ted Xiao,,,,,,Complex robotics systems have been the subject of much research and study. Beyond theoretical insight into control and learning models. there seems to be much promise in bringing practical wide-scale robotics to society in the foreseeable future. However. there are still many areas that require more study before applications are deployed in a robust and safe manner. As learning and control approaches are gradually being brought from controlled lab conditions to uncontrolled real-world scenarios. there is a need for methods that work well in complex environments that may have unknown dynamics. For instance. real-world conditions involve environments without accurate a priori models. such as situations with human interaction.Advances in machine learning. reinforcement learning. and optimal control have all contributed towards learning and controlling unknown systems. In general. there are two main regimes for approaching this problem: model-based and model-free learning approaches. In model-based methods. the system dynamics are modelled and then used in conjunction with optimal control methods to produce policies or controllers. The dynamics can be modelled through a variety of methods. such as deep learning [3] or traditional systems identification [4]. In model-free methods. the policy is directly learned. Both methods have their benefits. but but we believe that there is significant promise in the intersection between model-free and model-based methods. where existing theory in optimal control can be leveraged while still using the benefits of robust deep learning methods.

However. most of these studies focus on supervised learning models. As deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been deployed in a number of real-world systems. such as indoor robot navigation. whether trained DRL policies can leak private information requires in-depth study. To explore such privacy breaches in general. we mainly propose two methods: environment dynamics search via genetic algorithm and candidate inference based on shadow policies. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate such privacy vulnerabilities in DRL under various settings. We leverage the proposed algorithms to infer floor plans from some trained Grid World navigation DRL agents with LiDAR perception. The proposed algorithm can correctly infer most of the floor plans and reaches an average recovery rate of 95.83% using policy gradient trained agents. In addition. we are able to recover the robot configuration in continuous control environments and an autonomous driving simulator with high accuracy.

Instead. we propose to leverage the input point cloud as much as possible. by only adding connectivity information to existing points. Particularly. we predict which triplets of points should form faces.

Unlike prior works on neural radiance fields that consider per-scene optimization on densely captured images. we propose a generic deep neural network that can reconstruct radiance fields from only three nearby input views via fast network inference. Our approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo) for geometry-aware scene reasoning. and combines this with physically based volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network on real objects in the DTU dataset. and test it on three different datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize across scenes (even indoor scenes. completely different from our training scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only three input images. significantly outperforming concurrent works on generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover. if dense images are captured. our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned; this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and substantially less optimization time than NeRF.,True,cTGxuQQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15595,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15595,0,0,0

The challenge gets greater when a novel task is given with only a few labeled examples. a problem known as incremental few-shot learning.

Given a new task. the novel feature extracted from the meta-trained modules is mixed with the base feature obtained from the pretrained model. The process of combining two different features provides TAR and is also controlled by meta-trained modules. The TAR contains effective information for classifying both novel and base categories. The base and novel classifiers quickly adapt to a given task by utilizing the TAR.

1283397,Neural structural correspondence learning for domain adaptation,2016,Yftah Ziser and Roi Reichart,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.01588,,,,Domain adaptation. adapting models from domains rich in labeled training data to domains poor in such data. is a fundamental NLP challenge. We introduce a neural network model that marries together ideas from two prominent strands of research on domain adaptation through representation learning: structural correspondence learning (SCL.(Blitzer et al.. 2006)) and autoencoder neural networks. Particularly. our model is a three-layer neural network that learns to encode the nonpivot features of an input example into a low-dimensional representation. so that the existence of pivot features (features that are prominent in both domains and convey useful information for the NLP task) in the example can be decoded from that representation. The low-dimensional representation is then employed in a learning algorithm for the task. Moreover. we show how to inject pre-trained word embeddings into our model in order to improve generalization across examples with similar pivot features. On the task of cross-domain product sentiment classification (Blitzer et al.. 2007). consisting of 12 domain pairs. our model outperforms both the SCL and the marginalized stacked denoising autoencoder (MSDA.(Chen et al.. 2012)) methods by 3.77% and 2.17% respectively. on average across domain pairs.,True,37SMCrsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,63,https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01588,3384940431343755107,/scholar?cites=3384940431343755107,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01588,0,0,0
1283398,Pivot based language modeling for improved neural domain adaptation,2018,Yftah Ziser and Roi Reichart,,,,1241-1251,,Representation learning with pivot-based methods and with Neural Networks (NNs) have lead to significant progress in domain adaptation for Natural Language Processing. However. most previous work that follows these approaches does not explicitly exploit the structure of the input text. and its output is most often a single representation vector for the entire text. In this paper we present the Pivot Based Language Model (PBLM). a representation learning model that marries together pivot-based and NN modeling in a structure aware manner. Particularly. our model processes the information in the text with a sequential NN (LSTM) and its output consists of a representation vector for every input word. Unlike most previous representation learning models in domain adaptation. PBLM can naturally feed structure aware text classifiers such as LSTM and CNN. We experiment with the task of cross-domain sentiment classification on 20 domain pairs and show substantial improvements over strong baselines.,True,37SMCrsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,50,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1112.pdf,3202929449997260467,/scholar?cites=3202929449997260467,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1112.pdf,0,0,0

In this work we consider this problem. and propose a framework that builds on pivot-based learning. structure-aware Deep Neural Networks (particularly LSTMs and CNNs) and bilingual word embeddings. with the goal of training a model on labeled data from one (language. domain) pair so that it can be effectively applied to another (language. domain) pair. We consider two setups. differing with respect to the unlabeled data available for model training. In the full setup the model has access to unlabeled data from both pairs. while in the lazy setup. which is more realistic for truly resource-poor languages. unlabeled data is available for both domains but only for the source language. We design our model for the lazy setup so that for a given target domain. it can train once on the source language and then be applied to any target language without re-training. In experiments with nine English-German and nine English-French domain pairs our best model substantially outperforms previous models even when it is trained in the lazy setup and previous models are trained in the full setup.,True,37SMCrsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,12,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1022.pdf,10686722584920051925,/scholar?cites=10686722584920051925,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1022.pdf,0,0,0

1283423,Predicting DNA-binding locations and orientation on proteins using knowledge-based learning of geometric properties,2011,Chien-Chih Wang and Chien-Yu Chen,9,,1,1-9,BioMed Central,DNA-binding proteins perform their functions through specific or non-specific sequence recognition. Although many sequence- or structure-based approaches have been proposed to identify DNA-binding residues on proteins or protein-binding sites on DNA sequences with satisfied performance. it remains a challenging task to unveil the exact mechanism of protein-DNA interactions without crystal complex structures. Without information from complexes. the linkages between DNA-binding proteins and their binding sites on DNA are still missing. While it is still difficult to acquire co-crystallized structures in an efficient way. this study proposes a knowledge-based learning method to effectively predict DNA orientation and base locations around the protein’s DNA-binding sites when given a protein structure. First. the functionally important residues of a query protein are predicted by a sequential pattern mining tool. After that. surface residues falling in the predicted functional regions are determined based on the given structure. These residues are then clustered based on their spatial coordinates and the resultant clusters are ranked by a proposed DNA-binding propensity function. Clusters with high DNA-binding propensities are treated as DNA-binding units (DBUs) and each DBU is analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) to predict potential orientation of DNA grooves. More specifically. the proposed method is developed to predict the direction of the tangent line to the helix curve of the DNA groove where a DBU is going to bind.

The appearance of a human face changes substantially over time. resulting in significant intraclass variations. As opposed to current techniques for ageinvariant face recognition. which either directly extract ageinvariant features for recognition. or first synthesize a face that matches target age before feature extraction. we argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly so that they can leverage each other. To this end. we propose a deep Age-Invariant Model (AIM) for face recognition in the wild with three distinct novelties. First. AIM presents a novel unified deep architecture jointly performing cross-age face synthesis and recognition in a mutual boosting way. Second. AIM achieves continuous face rejuvenation/aging with remarkable photorealistic and identity-preserving properties. avoiding the requirement of paired data and the true age of testing samples. Third. we develop effective and novel training strategies for end-to-end learning the whole deep architecture. which generates powerful age-invariant face representations explicitly disentangled from the age variation. Extensive experiments on several cross-age datasets (MORPH. CACD and FG-NET) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AIM model over the state-of-the-arts. Benchmarking our model on one of the most popular unconstrained face recognition datasets IJB-C additionally verifies the promising generalizability of AIM in recognizing faces in the wild.,True,OmyNx3IAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,42,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4961,10278068661343693261,/scholar?cites=10278068661343693261,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/4961/4834,0,0,0

Specifically. 3D-PIM incorporates a simulator with the aid of a 3D Morphable Model (3D MM) to obtain shape and appearance prior for accelerating face normalization learning. requiring less training data. It further leverages a globallocal Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with multiple critical improvements as a refiner to enhance the realism of both global structures and local details of the face simulator’s output using unlabelled real data only. while preserving the identity information.

Spectacular progress in this field has resulted in saturation on verification and identification accuracies for those benchmark datasets. In this paper. we propose a unified learning framework named Transferred Deep Feature Fusion (TDFF) targeting at the new IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A) face recognition dataset released by NIST face challenge. The IJB-A dataset includes real-world unconstrained faces from 500 subjects with full pose and illumination variations which are much harder than the LFW and YTF datasets. Inspired by transfer learning. we train two advanced deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) with two different large datasets in source domain. respectively. By exploring the complementarity of two distinct DCNNs. deep feature fusion is utilized after feature extraction in target domain. Then. template specific linear SVMs is adopted to enhance the discrimination of framework. Finally. multiple matching scores corresponding different templates are merged as the final results. This simple unified framework exhibits excellent performance on IJB-A dataset. Based on the proposed approach. we have submitted our IJB-A results to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for official evaluation.

This data assimilation technique is described in Sagi and Murtagh (2016). in which it was used to study the inter-annual variability in ozone depletion during the entire Odin operational time and in both hemispheres. Our study focuses on the Arctic region. where two O3 destruction mechanisms play an important role. involving halogen and nitrogen chemical families (i.e. NOx  =  NO and NO2). respectively. The temporal evolution and geographical distribution of O3 loss in the low and middle stratosphere have been investigated between 2002 and 2013. For the first time. this has been done based on the study of a series of winter–spring seasons over more than a decade. spanning very different dynamical conditions. The chemical mechanisms involved in O3 depletion are very sensitive to thermal conditions and dynamical activity. which are extremely variable in the Arctic stratosphere. We have focused our analysis on particularly cold and warm winters. in order to study the influence this has on ozone loss. The winter 2010/11 is considered as an example for cold conditions. This case. which has been the subject of many studies. was characterised by a very stable vortex associated with particularly low temperatures. which led to an important halogen-induced O3 loss occurring inside the vortex in the lower stratosphere. We found a loss of 2.1 ppmv at an altitude of 450 K in the end of March 2011 …,True,aVvMonQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,8,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/1791/2017/,5381641666549782458,/scholar?cites=5381641666549782458,,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/17/1791/2017/acp-17-1791-2017.pdf,0,0,0

Although SMILES measurements only cover latitudes from 38° S to 65° N. the combination of data assimilation methods and an isentropic advection model allows us to quantify the ozone depletion in the 2009/2010 Arctic polar winter by making use of the instability of the polar vortex in the northern hemisphere. Ozone data from both SMILES and Odin/SMR (Sub-Millimetre Radiometer) for the winter were assimilated into the Dynamical Isentropic Assimilation Model for OdiN Data (DIAMOND). DIAMOND is an off-line wind-driven transport model on isentropic surfaces. Wind data from the operational analyses of the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) were used to drive the model. In this study. particular attention is paid to the cross isentropic transport of the tracer in order to accurately assess the ozone loss. The assimilated SMILES ozone fields agree well with the limitation of noise induced variability within the SMR fields despite the limited latitude coverage of the SMILES observations. Ozone depletion has been derived by comparing the ozone field acquired by sequential assimilation with a passively transported ozone field initialized on 1 December 2009. Significant ozone loss was found in different periods and altitudes from using both SMILES and SMR data: The initial depletion occurred at the end of January below 550 K with an accumulated loss of 0.6–1.0 ppmv (approximately 20%) by 1 April.

SAR target recognition is an important task in security and defense areas. however. it is still challenging due to insufficient labeled SAR images. In order to solve this problem. we propose a ZSL based SAR target recognition. The conventional ZSL transfers information of observed labels in order to recognize unseen objects. The proposed ZSL replaces the labels with optical images corresponding to SAR targets. The proposed method employs ZSL in conjunction with dimension reduction to match different types of unseen images in a compact feature space with high accuracies.

France and Finland. was launched on 20 February 2001 and continues to produce profiles of chemical species relevant to understanding the middle and upper atmosphere. Long-term observations of stratospheric ozone are useful for trend analysis of chemical ozone loss. This study concerns ozone loss over both poles utilizing 12 years of ozone data from Odin/Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR). We have applied the data assimilation technique described by Rösevall et al.(2007) with a number of improvements to study the inter-annual variability during the entire Odin period. The chemical ozone losses at potential temperature levels between 425 K and 950 K.(corresponding to an altitude range of 15 to 40 km approximately 90 hPa and 7 hPa in pressure). are derived. Two SMR ozone products retrieved from the emission lines centred at 501 GHz and 544 GHz were used. An internal comparison of the two analyses using 501 GHz and 544 GHz ozone has been carried out by inspecting the vortex mean ozone in March and October during 2002–2013 and 2003–2012 in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. respectively. Ozone derived from data assimilation using the two data sets match within 10% at the levels studied. while below 550 K in the Southern Hemispheremore than 50% of the difference is found. Here. 544 GHz ozone is 0.5 parts per million volume (ppmv) lower than 501 GHz ozone because of better sensitivity in 544 GHz ozone in the lower stratosphere.

Scarce labeled data and limited viewing direction are critical issues in SAR target recognition. The RLS is a designed space in which rolling of latent features corresponds to 3D rotation of an object. Thus latent features of an arbitrary view can be inferred using those of different views. This characteristic further enables us to augment data from limited viewing in RLS.

This has led to an increased focus on specific model properties for interpretability. We focus on incorporating monotonic trends. and propose a novel gradient-based point-wise loss function for enforcing partial monotonicity with deep neural networks. While recent developments have relied on structural changes to the model. our approach aims at enhancing the learning process. Our model-agnostic point-wise loss function acts as a plug-in to the standard loss and penalizes non-monotonic gradients. We demonstrate that the point-wise loss produces comparable (and sometimes better) results on both AUC and monotonicity measure. as opposed to state-of-the-art deep lattice networks that guarantee monotonicity. Moreover. it is able to learn differentiated individual trends and produces smoother conditional curves which are important for personalized decisions. while preserving the flexibility of deep networks.,True,f9XxjywAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,12,https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10662,7778298971186557354,/scholar?cites=7778298971186557354,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10662,0,0,0

We then use bilingual bootstrapping. wherein. a model trained using the seed annotated data of L1 is used to annotate the untagged data of L2 and vice versa using parameter projection. The untagged instances of L1 and L2 which get annotated with high confidence are then added to the seed data of the respective languages and the above process is repeated. Our experiments show that such a bilingual bootstrapping algorithm when evaluated on two different domains with small seed sizes using Hindi (L1) and Marathi (L2) as the language pair performs better than monolingual bootstrapping and significantly reduces annotation cost.,True,5XwRV4IAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,20,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1057.pdf,4841645413587635638,/scholar?cites=4841645413587635638,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1057.pdf,0,0,0

This question might seem frivolous. even preposterous to anybody sensible. However. our long time research on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) shows that in almost all disambiguation algorithms. the sense distribution parameter P (S/W). where P is the probability of the sense of a word W being S. plays the deciding role. The widely reported accuracy figure of around 60% for all-words-domainindependent WSD is contributed to mainly by P (S/W). as one ablation test after another reveals.The story with human annotation is different though. Our experience of working with human annotators who mark with WordNet sense ids. general and domain specific corpora brings to light the interesting fact that producing sense ids without looking at the context is a heavy cognitive load. Sense annotators do form hypothesis in their minds about the possible sense of a word (‘most frequent sense’bias). but then look at the context for clues to accept or reject the hypothesis. Such clues are minimal. just one or two words. but are critical nonetheless. Without these clues the annotator is left in an indecisive state as to whether or not to put down the first sense coming to his mind. The task becomes all the more cognitively challenging. if the senses are fine grained and seem equally probable. These facts increase the annotation time by a factor of almost 1.5.,True,5XwRV4IAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,11,https://research.vu.nl/files/3628717/gwc2012.pdf#page=84,17636067405664508625,/scholar?cites=17636067405664508625,,,https://research.vu.nl/files/3628717/gwc2012.pdf#page=84,0,0,0
1283460,Eating your own cooking: automatically linking wordnet synsets of two languages,2012,Salil Joshi and Arindam Chatterjee and Arun Karthikeyan Karra and Pushpak Bhattacharyya,,,,239-246,,Linked wordnets are invaluable linked lexical resources. Wordnet linking involves matching a particular synset (concept) in one wordnet to a synset in another wordnet. We have developed an automatic wordnet linking system that is divided into a number of stages. Starting with a synset in the first language (also referred to as the source language). our algorithm generates a list of candidate synsets in the second language (also referred to as the target language). In consecutive stages. a heuristic is used to prune and rank this list. The winner synset is then chosen as the linkage for the source synset. The candidate synsets are generated using a bilingual dictionary (BiDict). Further. the earlier heuristics which we developed used BiDict to rank these candidate synsets. However. development of a BiDict is cumbersome and requires human labor. Furthermore. in several cases sparsity of the BiDict handicaps the ranking algorithm to a great extent. We have thus devised heuristics to eliminate the requirement of BiDict during the ranking process by using the already linked synsets. Once sufficient number of linked synsets are available. these heuristics outperform our heuristics which use a BiDict. These heuristics are based on observations made from linking techniques applied by lexicographers. Our wordnet linking system can be used for any pair of languages. given either a BiDict or sufficient number of already linked synsets. The interface of the system is easy to comprehend and use. In this paper. we present this interface along with the developed heuristics.,True,5XwRV4IAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,6,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C12-3030.pdf,1328197049408983138,/scholar?cites=1328197049408983138,,,https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C12-3030.pdf,0,0,0

This P (Sense| W ord) statistic is obtained after training the model on an annotated corpus. The performance of WSD algorithms do not match the efficiency and quality of human annotation. It is therefore important to know the role of the contextual clues in WSD. Human beings in turn. actuate the task of disambiguating the sense of a word. by gathering hints from the context words in the neighbourhood of the word. Contextual clues thus form the basic building block for the human sense disambiguation task. The need was thus felt for a tool. which could help us get a deeper insight into the human mind. while disambiguating polysemous words. As mentioned earlier. in the human mind. sense disambiguation highly depends on finding clues in corpus text. which finally lead to a winner sense.

Cham,Accurate segmenting nuclei instances is a crucial step in computer-aided image analysis to extract rich features for cellular estimation and following diagnosis as well as treatment. While it still remains challenging because the wide existence of nuclei clusters. along with the large morphological variances among different organs make nuclei instance segmentation susceptible to over-/under-segmentation. Additionally. the inevitably subjective annotating and mislabeling prevent the network learning from reliable samples and eventually reduce the generalization capability for robustly segmenting unseen organ nuclei.

To do this. it is important to consider the overall tissue micro-environment by assessing the cell-level information along with the morphology of the gland. However. current automated methods for CRC grading typically utilise small image patches and therefore fail to incorporate the entire tissue micro-architecture for grading purposes. To overcome the challenges of CRC grading. we present a novel cell-graph convolutional neural network (CGC-Net) that converts each large histology image into a graph. where each node is represented by a nucleus within the original image and cellular interactions are denoted as edges between these nodes according to node similarity. The CGC-Net utilises nuclear appearance features in addition to the spatial location of nodes to further boost the performance of the algorithm. To enable nodes to fuse multi-scale information. we introduce Adaptive GraphSage. which is a graph convolution technique that combines multi-level features in a data-driven way. Furthermore. to deal with redundancy in the graph. we propose a sampling technique that removes nodes in areas of dense nuclear activity. We show that modeling the image as a graph enables us to effectively consider a much larger image (around 16x larger) than traditional patch-based approaches and model the complex structure of the tissue micro-environment. We construct cell graphs with an average of over 3.000 nodes on a large CRC histology image dataset and report state-of-the-art results as compared to recent patch-based …,True,7blugpkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,23,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/html/VRMI/Zhou_CGC-Net_Cell_Graph_Convolutional_Network_for_Grading_of_Colorectal_Cancer_ICCVW_2019_paper.html,2757535527727472375,/scholar?cites=2757535527727472375,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/VRMI/Zhou_CGC-Net_Cell_Graph_Convolutional_Network_for_Grading_of_Colorectal_Cancer_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0
1283481,Sfcn-opi: Detection and fine-grained classification of nuclei using sibling fcn with objectness prior interaction,2018,Yanning Zhou and Qi Dou and Hao Chen and Jing Qin and Pheng-Ann Heng,32,Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,,,Cell nuclei detection and fine-grained classification have been fundamental yet challenging problems in histopathology image analysis. Due to the nuclei tiny size. significant inter-/intra-class variances. as well as the inferior image quality. previous automated methods would easily suffer from limited accuracy and robustness. In the meanwhile. existing approaches usually deal with these two tasks independently. which would neglect the close relatedness of them. In this paper. we present a novel method of sibling fully convolutional network with prior objectness interaction (called SFCN-OPI) to tackle the two tasks simultaneously and interactively using a unified end-to-end framework. Specifically. the sibling FCN branches share features in earlier layers while holding respective higher layers for specific tasks. More importantly. the detection branch outputs the objectness prior which dynamically interacts with the fine-grained classification sibling branch during the training and testing processes. With this mechanism. the fine-grained classification successfully focuses on regions with high confidence of nuclei existence and outputs the conditional probability. which in turn benefits the detection through back propagation. Extensive experiments on colon cancer histology images have validated the effectiveness of our proposed SFCN-OPI and our method has outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.,True,7blugpkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,22,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11900,14369755553972094244,/scholar?cites=14369755553972094244,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/11900/11759,0,0,0

In this paper. we argue that a more effective way of building visual features for ZSL is to extract them through captioning. in order not just to classify an image but. instead. to describe it. However. modern captioning models rely on a massive level of supervision. eg up to 15 extended descriptions per instance provided by humans. which is simply not available for ZSL benchmarks. In the latter in fact. the available annotations inform about the presence/absence of attributes within a fixed list only. Worse. attributes are seldom annotated at the image level. but rather. at the class level only: because of this. the annotation cannot be visually grounded.

The key innovation of MGAE is that it advances the autoencoder to the graph domain. so graph representation learning can be carried out not only in a purely unsupervised setting by leveraging structure and content information. it can …,True,o_g_tB0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,95,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3132847.3132967,14288765010948651741,/scholar?cites=14288765010948651741,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shirui_Pan2/publication/320882195_MGAE_Marginalized_Graph_Autoencoder_for_Graph_Clustering/links/5b76157b45851546c90a3d74/MGAE-Marginalized-Graph-Autoencoder-for-Graph-Clustering.pdf,0,0,0
1283516,Attributed graph clustering: A deep attentional embedding approach,2019,Chun Wang and Shirui Pan and Ruiqi Hu and Guodong Long and Jing Jiang and Chengqi Zhang,,,,3670--3676,,Graph clustering is a fundamental task which discovers communities or groups in networks. Recent studies have mostly focused on developing deep learning approaches to learn a compact graph embedding. upon which classic clustering methods like k-means or spectral clustering algorithms are applied. These two-step frameworks are difficult to manipulate and usually lead to suboptimal performance. mainly because the graph embedding is not goal-directed. ie. designed for the specific clustering task. In this paper. we propose a goal-directed deep learning approach. Deep Attentional Embedded Graph Clustering (DAEGC for short). Our method focuses on attributed graphs to sufficiently explore the two sides of information in graphs. By employing an attention network to capture the importance of the neighboring nodes to a target node. our DAEGC algorithm encodes the topological structure and node content in a graph to a compact representation. on which an inner product decoder is trained to reconstruct the graph structure. Furthermore. soft labels from the graph embedding itself are generated to supervise a self-training graph clustering process. which iteratively refines the clustering results. The self-training process is jointly learned and optimized with the graph embedding in a unified framework. to mutually benefit both components. Experimental results compared with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our method.,True,o_g_tB0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,46,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06532,9339462731391383529,/scholar?cites=9339462731391383529,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06532,0,0,0

The different choosing of membership function will conduce to different results. even the difference is greatly obvious. Aiming at this actuality. the authors studied the influence of choosing different membership function on the fuzzy probability calculative results. We choose three representative membership functions: descending semi-trapezia distribution. quadratic parabola distribution and ridge distribution. The difference of fuzzy probability calculating caused by these three different distributions is analyzed theoretically; and then some general criterion about how to choose the membership function for calculating the fuzzy probability of underground continuous wall is concluded.

1283539,Learning Deep Features for Shape Correspondence with Domain Invariance,2021,Praful Agrawal and Ross T Whitaker and Shireen Y Elhabian,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.10493,,,,Correspondence-based shape models are key to various medical imaging applications that rely on a statistical analysis of anatomies. Such shape models are expected to represent consistent anatomical features across the population for population-specific shape statistics. Early approaches for correspondence placement rely on nearest neighbor search for simpler anatomies. Coordinate transformations for shape correspondence hold promise to address the increasing anatomical complexities. Nonetheless. due to the inherent shape-level geometric complexity and population-level shape variation. the coordinate-wise correspondence often does not translate to the anatomical correspondence. An alternative. group-wise approach for correspondence placement explicitly models the trade-off between geometric description and the population's statistical compactness. However. these models achieve limited success in resolving nonlinear shape correspondence. Recent works have addressed this limitation by adopting an application-specific notion of correspondence through lifting positional data to a higher dimensional feature space. However. they heavily rely on manual expertise to create domain-specific features and consistent landmarks. This paper proposes an automated feature learning approach. using deep convolutional neural networks to extract correspondence-friendly features from shape ensembles. Further. an unsupervised domain adaptation scheme is introduced to augment the pretrained geometric features with new anatomies. Results on anatomical datasets of human scapula. femur. and pelvis bones demonstrate that …,True,blaqqaoAAAAJ:N5tVd3kTz84C,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10493,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10493,0,0,0
1283540,Person-in-WiFi: Fine-grained person perception using WiFi,2019,Fei Wang and Sanping Zhou and Stanislav Panev and Jinsong Han and Dong Huang,,,,5452-5461,,Fine-grained person perception such as body segmentation and pose estimation has been achieved with many 2D and 3D sensors such as RGB/depth cameras. radars (eg RF-Pose). and LiDARs. These solutions require 2D images. depth maps or 3D point clouds of person bodies as input. In this paper. we take one step forward to show that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D sensors: WiFi antennas. Specifically. we used two sets of WiFi antennas to acquire signals. ie. one transmitter set and one receiver set. Each set contains three antennas horizontally lined-up as a regular household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a transmitter antenna. penetrates through and reflects on human bodies. furniture. and walls. and then superposes at a receiver antenna as 1D signal samples. We developed a deep learning approach that uses annotations on 2D images. takes the received 1D WiFi signals as input. and performs body segmentation and pose estimation in an end-to-end manner. To our knowledge. our solution is the first work based on off-the-shelf WiFi antennas and standard IEEE 802.11 n WiFi signals. Demonstrating comparable results to image-based solutions. our WiFi-based person perception solution is cheaper and more ubiquitous than radars and LiDARs. while invariant to illumination and has little privacy concern comparing to cameras.,True,BNOAmiwAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,23,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Wang_Person-in-WiFi_Fine-Grained_Person_Perception_Using_WiFi_ICCV_2019_paper.html,11651714987648340610,/scholar?cites=11651714987648340610,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Wang_Person-in-WiFi_Fine-Grained_Person_Perception_Using_WiFi_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Collecting precisely labeled data for Parkinson's symptoms. such as tremor. is difficult. Therefore. algorithms for monitoring should only require weakly-labeled training data.

In particular. we analyze PD tremor detection performance as training segments increase in length from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. and labels thereby become less precise.

This affects the volume and the picture quality of the captured light. With less light. phones perform worse than digital Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras as opposed to image quality tests. Post processing is then used to enhance the quality of the image. Dark conditions and fast movement in mobile imaging are difficult. In dark conditions. longer exposure period collects more light. which can cause movement blurred objects.

Our baseline detection model is a 2DUNet trained to produce a csPCa heatmap followed by a 3D detector. We experimented with the integration of zonal prior information by fusing the output of an anisotropic 3DUNet trained to produce either a deterministic or probabilistic map for each prostate zone.

State of the art automatic prostate segmentation is performed with convolution neural networks (CNNs). Exention of our previously developed anisotropic single plane CNN to handle multi-planar input is expected to decrease segmentation problems caused by the low inter-plane resolution of t2-weighted images.

Clinical Priori and Decoupled False Positive Reduction,2021,Anindo Saha and Matin Hosseinzadeh and Henkjan Huisman,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.03244,,,,We present a novel multi-stage 3D computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) model for automated localization of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in bi-parametric MR imaging (bpMRI). State-of-the-art attention mechanisms drive its detection network. which aims to accurately discriminate csPCa lesions from indolent cancer and the wide range of benign pathology that can afflict the prostate gland. In parallel. a decoupled residual classifier is used to achieve consistent false positive reduction. without sacrificing high detection sensitivity or computational efficiency. Furthermore. a probabilistic anatomical prior. which captures the spatial prevalence of csPCa and its zonal distinction. is computed and encoded into the CNN architecture to guide model generalization with domain-specific clinical knowledge.For 486 institutional testing scans. the 3D CAD system achieves  and  detection sensitivity at 0.50 and 1.46 false positive (s) per patient. respectively. along with  AUROC in patient-based diagnosis  significantly outperforming four baseline architectures (USEResNet.

For 296 external testing scans. the ensembled CAD system shares moderate agreement with a consensus of expert radiologists (; ) and independent pathologists (; ); demonstrating a strong ability to localize histologically-confirmed malignancies and generalize beyond the radiologically-estimated annotations of the 1950 training-validation cases used in this study.,True,2PmpIMUAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03244,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03244,0,0,0

Facial electromyograms (EMGs) analysis is a complicated field in biomedical signal processing where accuracy and low computational cost are significant concerns. In this paper. a very fast versatile elliptic basis function neural network (VEBFNN) was proposed to classify different facial gestures. The effectiveness of different facial EMG time-domain features was also explored to introduce the most discriminating. In this study. EMGs of ten facial gestures were recorded from ten subjects using three pairs of surface electrodes in a bi-polar configuration. The signals were filtered and segmented into distinct portions prior to feature extraction. Ten different time-domain features. namely. Integrated EMG. Mean Absolute Value. Mean Absolute Value Slope. Maximum Peak Value. Root Mean Square. Simple Square Integral. Variance. Mean Value. Wave Length. and Sign Slope Changes were extracted from the EMGs. The statistical relationships between these features were investigated by Mutual Information measure. Then. the feature combinations including two to ten single features were formed based on the feature rankings appointed by Minimum-Redundancy-Maximum-Relevance (MRMR) and Recognition Accuracy (RA) criteria. In the last step. VEBFNN was employed to classify the facial gestures.

Cham,One of the major differences between medical doctor training and machine learning is that doctors are trained to recognize normal/healthy anatomy first. Knowing the healthy appearance of anatomy structures helps doctors to make better judgement when some abnormality shows up in an image. In this study. we propose a normal appearance autoencoder (NAA). that removes abnormalities from a diseased image. This autoencoder is semi-automatically trained using another partial convolutional in-paint network that is trained using healthy subjects only. The output of the autoencoder is then fed to a segmentation net in addition to the original input image. i.e. the latter gets both the diseased image and a simulated healthy image where the lesion is artificially removed.

The investigated extension of the classical flexible job shop problem allows the precedences between the operations to be given by an arbitrary directed acyclic graph instead of a linear order. The problem consists of designating the operations to the machines and sequencing them in compliance with the supplied precedences. The goal in the present work is the minimization of the makespan.

Attention mechanisms are a powerful way to steer focus onto different sections of the video.

1283622,Physics Object Localization with Point Cloud Segmentation Networks,2021,ATLAS PUB Note,,,,,,In modern particle physics experiments. the identification and trajectory of physics object. eg leptons and jets. depends on a complex pipeline of feature extraction. search. and machine learning algorithms. Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer a possibility of streamlining this process. This note describes the production of a dataset that the ATLAS collaboration is releasing for community use. It is formatted like popular point-cloud datasets. eg ShapeNet or S3DIS. which have been used to research new network topologies and applications. This dataset broadens the domain of these public datasets to include high energy physics detectors and encourages new deep learning research. The note also describes the application and performance of the PointNet++ and DGCNN networks. as well as the GravNet and GarNet networks developed by the HEP community. These networks predict to what type of physics object each detector readout channel is associated. eg electron. jet. or neither in this case. In the analysis. the performance is measured using the mean Intersection over Union scores. The result suggests that these networks could be used as a method to narrow the search space in a traditional reconstruction pipeline. The dataset is derived from simulated  production in association with jets. Each event is represented as a list of non-zero ATLAS detector readouts. including the detector channel readout position. raw readout value. and some truth information. The truth information indicates if a channel is associated to an electron. jet. or neither. There is also tracking information included to facilitate track studies.,True,doipCdsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://cds.cern.ch/record/2753414,,,,,https://cds.cern.ch/record/2753414/files/ATL-PHYS-PUB-2021-002.pdf,0,0,0

One of the most popular forms of the DNN is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN effectively learns features on images by learning a weighted sum of local neighborhoods of pixels. creating filtered versions of the image. Point cloud analysis seems like it would benefit from this useful model. However. point clouds are much less structured than images. Many analogues to CNNs for point clouds have been proposed in the literature. but they are often much more constrained networks than the typical CNN. This is a matter of necessity: common point cloud benchmark datasets are fairly small and thus require strong regularization to mitigate overfitting.

In these deep neural network applications. music data is often converted into a spectrogram and treated as a single-channel image input.

As a result. we improve accuracy and accelerate training. We evaluate this method in a genre classification task with a variety of CNN architectures. Compared to single-channel inputs. we achieve an average of a 2.7% increase in accuracy across all trained models using a 3-channel source-separated model and a 2.2% increase using a 4-channel model.

1283627,Structure-Constrained Basis Pursuit for Compressively Sensing Speech,2016,Miguel Dominguez,,,,,,"Compressed Sensing (CS) exploits the sparsity of many signals to enable sampling below the Nyquist rate. If the original signal is sufficiently sparse. the Basis Pursuit (BP) algorithm will perfectly reconstruct the original signal. Unfortunately many signals that intuitively appear sparse do not meet the threshold for"" sufficient sparsity"". These signals require so many CS samples for accurate reconstruction that the advantages of CS disappear. This is because Basis Pursuit/Basis Pursuit Denoising only models sparsity. We developed a"" Structure-Constrained Basis Pursuit"" that models the structure of somewhat sparse signals as upper and lower bound constraints on the Basis Pursuit Denoising solution. We applied it to speech. which seems sparse but does not compress well with CS. and gained improved quality over Basis Pursuit Denoising. When a single parameter (ie the phone) is encoded. Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE) decreases by between 16.2% and 1.00% when sampling with CS between 1/10 and 1/2 the Nyquist rate. respectively. When bounds are coded as a sum of Gaussians.

If compositionality is indeed a natural property of language. we may expect it to appear in communication protocols that are created by neural agents in language games. In this paper. we propose an effective neural iterated learning (NIL) algorithm that. when applied to interacting neural agents. facilitates the emergence of a more structured type of language. Indeed. these languages provide learning speed advantages to neural agents during training. which can be incrementally amplified via NIL. We provide a probabilistic model of NIL and an explanation of why the advantage of compositional language exist.

Therefore. a color transfer based on look-up table (LUT) was used to replace the false color appearance with a colormap derived from a daytime reference image obtained from a public database using the GPS coordinates of the vehicle. Because of the computational demand in deriving the colormap from the reference image. we created an additional local database of colormaps. Reference images from the public database were compared to a compact local database to retrieve one of a limited number of colormaps that represented several driving environments.

1283646,A Color Night Vision System for Vehicle Navigation,2013,Hemin Ali Qadir,,,,,,Nowadays. one of the most interesting research areas in computer vision and image processing is color night vision. Infrared (IR) thermal and low-light-level (LLL) visible cameras are the most popular night time imaging systems which are widely used for military. surveillance. reconnaissance. and security [1]. A thermal camera provides information of objects radiating thermal energy in a dark area. a busy background. and seeing though fog. but they are not capable of capturing background like trees. leaves and grass in nature scene while a low-light-level visible camera provides information of the background reflecting visible near infrared light in great detail [2. 3].Thermal cameras and visible cameras are not sufficiently capable when used individually [4]. It can be very difficult to distinguish a background of a target in the scene using only Infrared cameras for night time imagery [6]. A creative idea to achieve better description of a scene at night is to combine thermal and visible images into single fused image. In the single fused image. all perceptually important information that is present in the individual thermal and visible images is preserved. Compared to individual image modality. reliability and capability of human and machine perception can be improved with fused imagery [6].,True,6TUI_VQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hemin_Ali_Qadir/publication/323535195_A_Color_Night_Vision_System_For_Vehicle_Navigation/links/5a9a69abaca2721e3f2df8fb/A-Color-Night-Vision-System-For-Vehicle-Navigation.pdf,11112191625838331267,/scholar?cites=11112191625838331267,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hemin_Ali_Qadir/publication/323535195_A_Color_Night_Vision_System_For_Vehicle_Navigation/links/5a9a69abaca2721e3f2df8fb/A-Color-Night-Vision-System-For-Vehicle-Navigation.pdf,0,0,0

Recently. there have been many efforts to develop models for real-time polyp detection. but work is still required to develop real-time detection algorithms with reliable results. We use single-shot feed-forward fully convolutional neural networks (F-CNN) to develop an accurate real-time polyp detection system. F-CNNs are usually trained on binary masks for object segmentation. We propose the use of 2D Gaussian masks instead of binary masks to enable these models to detect different types of polyps more effectively and efficiently and reduce the number of false positives. The experimental results showed that the proposed 2D Gaussian masks are efficient for detection of flat and small polyps with unclear boundaries between background and polyp parts.

1283649,Development of Image Processing Algorithms for the Automatic Screening of Colon Cancer,2020,Hemin Ali Qadir Qadir,,,,,University of Oslo,Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers among both genders and its incidence rate is continuously increasing. CRC starts from small non-cancerous growths of tissue on the wall of the colon (large bowel) or rectum. Most polyps are harmless. but some can develop into CRC over time. Currently. colonoscopy is the golden standard method for the detection and removal of precancerous polyps. Colonoscopy. however. is an operator-dependent procedure and requires skilled endoscopists. Studies have shown that the polyp miss rate is around 25\% for certain cases. This miss rate has drawn the attention of engineers and computer scientists. including our group. for decades to develop a computer-aided polyp detection system that can help clinicians reduce this polyp miss rate during colonoscopy. This thesis has primarily contributed towards the investigation of the difficulties and challenges to develop an accurate automatic polyp detection and segmentation using deep learning approaches. Experimental results showed that deep learning is a promising approach to computerize colon polyp detection and segmentation. and it offers various approaches to improve the overall performance of the detection. In general. a massive amount of training data is the key to achieve desirable performance as there are already excellent CNN-based feature extractors. However. there is a lack of available training data. and manual polyp labeling of video frames is difficult and time-consuming.

1283666,Contextual multi-armed bandits under feature uncertainty,2017,Se-Young Yun and Jun Hyun Nam and Sangwoo Mo and Jinwoo Shin,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.01347,,,,We study contextual multi-armed bandit problems under linear realizability on rewards and uncertainty (or noise) on features. For the case of identical noise on features across actions. we propose an algorithm. coined {\em NLinRel}. having  regret bound for  rounds.  actions. and -dimensional feature vectors. Next. for the case of non-identical noise. we observe that popular linear hypotheses including {\em NLinRel} are impossible to achieve such sub-linear regret. Instead. under assumption of Gaussian feature vectors. we prove that a greedy algorithm has  regret bound with respect to the optimal linear hypothesis. Utilizing our theoretical understanding on the Gaussian case. we also design a practical variant of {\em NLinRel}. coined {\em Universal-NLinRel}. for arbitrary feature distributions. It first runs {\em NLinRel} for finding thetrue'coefficient vector using feature uncertainties and then adjust it to minimize its regret using the statistical feature information. We justify the performance of {\em Universal-NLinRel} on both synthetic and real-world datasets.,True,Sq9y3NMAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01347,3469625884297577787,/scholar?cites=3469625884297577787,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01347,0,0,0

We introduce a simple yet effective approach to improving cGANs by measuring the discrepancy between the data distribution and the model distribution on given samples. The proposed measure. coined the gap of log-densities (GOLD). provides an effective self-diagnosis for cGANs while being efficienty computed from the discriminator. We propose three applications of the GOLD: example re-weighting. rejection sampling. and active learning. which improve the training. inference. and data selection of cGANs. respectively.

1283669,MASKER: Masked Keyword Regularization for Reliable Text Classification,2021,Seung Jun Moon* and Sangwoo Mo* and Kimin Lee and Jaeho Lee and Jinwoo Shin,,,,,,Pre-trained language models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on various text classification tasks. eg. sentiment analysis. natural language inference. and semantic textual similarity. However. the reliability of the fine-tuned text classifiers is an often underlooked performance criterion. For instance. one may desire a model that can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) samples (drawn far from training distribution) or be robust against domain shifts. We claim that one central obstacle to the reliability is the over-reliance of the model on a limited number of keywords. instead of looking at the whole context. In particular. we find that (a) OOD samples often contain in-distribution keywords. while (b) cross-domain samples may not always contain keywords; over-relying on the keywords can be problematic for both cases. In light of this observation. we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method. coined masked keyword regularization (MASKER). that facilitates context-based prediction. MASKER regularizes the model to reconstruct the keywords from the rest of the words and make low-confidence predictions without enough context. When applied to various pre-trained language models (eg. BERT. RoBERTa. and ALBERT). we demonstrate that MASKER improves OOD detection and cross-domain generalization without degrading classification accuracy.

However. without a clear consensus on"" how to choose."" the layerwise sparsities are mostly selected algorithm-by-algorithm. often resorting to handcrafted heuristics or an extensive hyperparameter search. To fill this gap. we propose a novel importance score for global pruning. coined layer-adaptive magnitude-based pruning (LAMP) score; the score is a rescaled version of weight magnitude that incorporates the model-level  distortion incurred by pruning. and does not require any hyperparameter tuning or heavy computation. Under diverse datasets and models. LAMP consistently outperforms popular existing schemes for layerwise sparsity selection. Furthermore. we observe that LAMP continues to outperform baselines even in weight-rewinding setups. while the connectivity-oriented layerwise sparsity (the strongest baseline overall) performs worse than a simple global magnitude-based pruning in this case.",True,Sq9y3NMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07611,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07611,0,0,0
1283671,Multi-Channel CNN-Based Object Detection for Enhanced Situation Awareness,2017,Shuo Liu and Zheng Liu,,,,,,Object Detection is critical for automatic military operations. However. the performance of current object detection algorithms is deficient in terms of the requirements in military scenarios. This is mainly because the object presence is hard to detect due to the indistinguishable appearance and dramatic changes of object's size which is determined by the distance to the detection sensors. Recent advances in deep learning have achieved promising results in many challenging tasks. The state-of-the-art in object detection is represented by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). such as the fast R-CNN algorithm. These CNN-based methods improve the detection performance significantly on several public generic object detection datasets. However. their performance on detecting small objects or undistinguishable objects in visible spectrum images is still insufficient. In this study. we propose a novel detection algorithm for military objects by fusing multi-channel CNNs. We combine spatial. temporal and thermal information by generating a three-channel image. and they will be fused as CNN feature maps in an unsupervised manner. The backbone of our object detection framework is from the fast R-CNN algorithm. and we utilize cross-domain transfer learning technique to fine-tune the CNN model on generated multi-channel images. In the experiments. we validated the proposed method with the images from SENSIAC (Military Sensing Information Analysis Centre) database and compared it with the state-of-the-art.

1283688,DIAGNOSIS OF MALIGNANT MELANOMA BY NEURAL NETWORK ENSEMBLE-BASED SYSTEM UTILISING HAND-CRAFTED SKIN LESION FEATURES,2019,Michał Grochowski and Agnieszka Mikołajczyk and Arkadiusz Kwasigroch,,Metrology and Measurement Systems,1,,,EN Malignant melanomas are the most deadly type of skin cancer. yet detected early have high chances of successful treatment. In the last twenty years. the interest in automatic recognition and classification of melanoma dynamically increased. partly because of appearing public datasets with dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. Automated computer-aided skin cancer detection in dermatoscopic images is a very challenging task due to uneven sizes of datasets. huge intra-class variation with small interclass variation. and the existence of many artifacts in the images. One of the most recognized methods of melanoma diagnosis is the ABCD method. In the paper. we propose an extended version of this method and an intelligent decision support system based on neural networks that uses its results in the form of hand-crafted features. Automatic determination of the skin features with the ABCD method is difficult due to the large diversity of images of various quality. the existence of hair. different markers and other obstacles. Therefore. it was necessary to apply advanced methods of pre-processing the images. The proposed system is an ensemble of ten neural networks working in parallel. and one network using their results to generate a final decision.

One of the critical drawbacks of current cancer therapeutics has been the lack of the target-selectivity. as these drugs should have an effect exclusively on cancer cells while not perturbing healthy ones. In addition. their mechanism of action should be sufficiently fast to avoid the invasion of neighbouring healthy tissues by cancer cells. The use of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and other traditional therapies. such as surgery and radiotherapy. leads to off-target interactions with serious side effects.

Although it is known that HER2 dimerization involves a specific region of its extracellular domain. the so-called “dimerization arm”. the mechanism of dimerization inhibition remains uncertain. However. uncovering how antibody interactions lead to inhibition of HER2 dimerization is of key importance in understanding its role in tumour progression and therapy. Herein. we employed several computational modelling techniques for a molecular-level understanding of the interactions between HER and specific anti-HER2 antibodies. namely an antigen-binding (Fab) fragment (F0178) and a single-chain variable fragment from Trastuzumab (scFv). Specifically. we investigated the effects of antibody-HER2 interactions on the key residues of “dimerization arm” from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of unbound HER (in a total of 1 µs). as well as ScFv: HER2 and F0178: HER2 complexes (for a total of 2.5 µs). A deep surface analysis of HER receptor revealed that the binding of specific anti-HER2 antibodies induced conformational changes both in the interfacial residues. which was expected. and in the ECDII (extracellular domain). in particular at the “dimerization arm”. which is critical in establishing protein–protein interface (PPI) interactions.

We then explore if the performance can be further improved by providing task specific knowledge in different manners or by employing different strategies for using the available knowledge. We present three different modes of passing knowledge and five different models of using knowledge including the standard BERT MCQ model. We also propose a novel architecture to deal with situations where information to answer the MCQ question is scattered over multiple knowledge sentences.

Winograd's``councilmen''example in his 1972 paper and McCarthy's Mr. Hug example of 1976 highlights the role of external knowledge in NL understanding. While Machine Learning has been the go-to approach in NL processing as well as NL question answering (NLQA) for the last 30 years. recently there has been an increasingly emphasized thread on NLQA where external knowledge plays an important role. The challenges inspired by Winograd's councilmen example. and recent developments such as the Rebooting AI book. various NLQA datasets. research on knowledge acquisition in the NLQA context. and their use in various NLQA models have brought the issue of NLQA using``reasoning''with external knowledge to the forefront.

While modern decompilers can reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation. inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing. we propose a novel solution to infer variable names in decompiled code based on Masked Language Modeling. Byte-Pair Encoding. and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes\textit {raw} decompiler output. the less semantically meaningful code. as input. and enriches it using our proposed\textit {finetuning} technique.

Theis and Fabian and Felix Krahmer,,medRxiv preprint doi:10.1101/2020.04.30.20085290,,,,Background: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. demand for diagnostic testing has increased drastically. resulting in shortages of necessary materials to conduct the tests and overwhelming the capacity of testing laboratories. The supply scarcity and capacity limits affect test administration: priority must be given to hospitalized patients and symptomatic individuals. which can prevent the identification of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals and hence effective tracking and tracing policies. We describe optimized group testing strategies applicable to SARS-CoV-2 tests in scenarios tailored to the current COVID-19 pandemic and assess significant gains compared to individual testing.  Methods: We account for biochemically realistic scenarios in the context of dilution effects on SARS-CoV-2 samples and consider evidence on specificity and sensitivity of PCR-based tests for the novel coronavirus. Because of the current uncertainty and the temporal and spatial changes in the prevalence regime. we provide analysis for a number of realistic scenarios and propose fast and reliable strategies for massive testing procedures.  Findings: We find significant efficiency gaps between different group testing strategies in realistic scenarios for SARS-CoV-2 testing. highlighting the need for an informed decision of the pooling protocol depending on estimated prevalence. target specificity. and high- vs. low-risk population.

By using a simple signal model for audio signals. specific properties of Gabor scattering are studied. It is shown that. for each layer. specific invariances to certain signal characteristics occur. Furthermore. deformation stability of the coefficient vector generated by the feature extractor is derived by using a decoupling technique which exploits the contractivity of general scattering networks. Deformations are introduced as changes in spectral shape and frequency modulation. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples and experiments. Numerical evidence is given by evaluation on a synthetic and a “real” dataset. that the invariances encoded by the Gabor scattering transform lead to higher performance in comparison with just using Gabor transform. especially when few training samples are available.

1283772,Rudder: A Cross Lingual Video and Text Retrieval Dataset,2021,Rishabh Dabral and Ganesh Ramakrishnan and Preethi Jyothi,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.05457,,,,Video retrieval using natural language queries requires learning semantically meaningful joint embeddings between the text and the audio-visual input. Often. such joint embeddings are learnt using pairwise (or triplet) contrastive loss objectives which cannot give enough attention to'difficult-to-retrieve'samples during training. This problem is especially pronounced in data-scarce settings where the data is relatively small (10% of the large scale MSR-VTT) to cover the rather complex audio-visual embedding space. In this context. we introduce Rudder-a multilingual video-text retrieval dataset that includes audio and textual captions in Marathi. Hindi. Tamil. Kannada. Malayalam and Telugu. Furthermore. we propose to compensate for data scarcity by using domain knowledge to augment supervision. To this end. in addition to the conventional three samples of a triplet (anchor. positive. and negative). we introduce a fourth term-a partial-to define a differential margin based partialorder loss. The partials are heuristically sampled such that they semantically lie in the overlap zone between the positives and the negatives. thereby resulting in broader embedding coverage. Our proposals consistently outperform the conventional max-margin and triplet losses and improve the state-of-the-art on MSR-VTT and DiDeMO datasets. We report benchmark results on Rudder while also observing significant gains using the proposed partial order loss. especially when the language specific retrieval models are jointly trained by availing the cross-lingual alignment across the language-specific datasets.,True,hLZNpkMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05457,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05457,0,0,0

Specifically. it involves detecting the humans and objects in the clip as well as the interactions between them. Conventionally. the problem has been formulated as a space-time graph inference problem over the video clip features. In this work. we explore alternate spatial approaches for detecting Human-Object Interactions. We consider a hierarchical setup that decouples spatial and temporal aspects of the problem and analyse the impacts of a variety of design choices for the spatial networks. Particularly. to capture spatial relationships in the scene. we analyze the effectiveness of the traditionally used Graph Convolutional Networks against Convolutional Networks and Capsule Networks. Unlike current approaches. we avoid using ground truth data like depth maps or 3D human pose during inference. thus increasing generalization across non-RGBD datasets as well. We demonstrate a comprehensive analysis of the exploration. both quantitatively and qualitatively. while achieving state-of-the-art results in human-object interaction detection (88.9% and 92.6%) and anticipation tasks of CAD-120 and competitive results on image based HOI detection (47.2%) in V-COCO dataset. setting a new benchmark for visual features based approaches.,True,hLZNpkMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Dabral_Exploration_of_Spatial_and_Temporal_Modeling_Alternatives_for_HOI_WACV_2021_paper.html,,,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Dabral_Exploration_of_Spatial_and_Temporal_Modeling_Alternatives_for_HOI_WACV_2021_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Inferring the topics of this type of messages becomes a critical and challenging task for many applications. Due to the length of short texts. conventional topic models (e.g.. latent Dirichlet allocation and its variants) suffer from the severe data sparsity problem which makes topic modeling of short texts difficult and unreliable. Recently. word embeddings have been proved effective to capture semantic and syntactic information about words. which can be used to induce similarity measures and semantic correlations among words.

Recently. deep learning networks have been widely used for various medical image segmentation tasks. with U - Net and generative adversarial nets (GANs) being some of the commonly used ones. Foreground-background class imbalance is a common occurrence in medical images. and U-Net has difficulty in handling class imbalance because of its cross entropy (CE) objective function. Similarly. GAN also suffers from class imbalance because the discriminator looks at the entire image to classify it as real or fake. Since the discriminator is essentially a deep learning classifier. it is incapable of correctly identifying minor changes in small structures.

These solutions require 2D images. depth maps or 3D point clouds of person bodies as input. In this paper. we take one step forward to show that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D sensors: WiFi antennas.

Each set contains three antennas horizontally lined-up as a regular household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a transmitter antenna. penetrates through and reflects on human bodies. furniture. and walls. and then superposes at a receiver antenna as 1D signal samples. We developed a deep learning approach that uses annotations on 2D images. takes the received 1D WiFi signals as input. and performs body segmentation and pose estimation in an end-to-end manner. To our knowledge. our solution is the first work based on off-the-shelf WiFi antennas and standard IEEE 802.11 n WiFi signals.

Moreover. the down-sampling operations. such as pooling and striding. lose spatial details of the salient objects. In this paper. we propose a simple yet effective Siamese Edge-Enhancement Network (SE2Net) to preserve the edge structure for salient object detection. Specifically. a novel multi-stage siamese network is built to aggregate the low-level and high-level features. and parallelly estimate the salient maps of edges and regions. As a result. the predicted regions become more accurate by enhancing the responses at edges. and the predicted edges become more semantic by suppressing the false positives in background. After the refined salient maps of edges and regions are produced by the SE2Net. an edge-guided inference algorithm is designed to further improve the resulting salient masks along the predicted edges. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets have been conducted. which show that our method is superior than the state-of-the-art approaches.,True,LKPpmXQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,7,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00048,5518725464842603225,/scholar?cites=5518725464842603225,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00048,0,0,0

As our best survey. past work recognizes human action by categorizing one complete distortion series into one action. which we term as series-level action recognition. In this paper. we introduce a much more fine-grained and challenging action recognition task into WiFi sensing domain. ie. sample-level action recognition. In this task. every WiFi distortion sample in the whole series should be categorized into one action. which is a critical technique in precise action localization. continuous action segmentation. and real-time action recognition. To achieve WiFi-based sample-level action recognition. we fully analyze approaches in image-based semantic segmentation as well as in video-based frame-level action recognition. then propose a simple yet efficient deep convolutional neural network. ie.

BodyPIN can track the current user's legal identity throughout a computer system's execution. In case the authentication fails. the consequent accesses will be denied to protect the system. The recent rich wireless-based user identification designs cannot be applied to BodyPIN directly. because they identify a user's various activities. rather than the user herself.

It is a key problem in computer vision and robotics. with applications including self-driving cars. Structure-from-Motion. SLAM. and Mixed Reality. Traditionally. the localization problem has been tackled using 3D geometry. Recently. end-to-end approaches based on convolutional neural networks have become popular. These methods learn to directly regress the camera pose from an input image. However. they do not achieve the same level of pose accuracy as 3D structure-based methods. To understand this behavior. we develop a theoretical model for camera pose regression. We use our model to predict failure cases for pose regression techniques and verify our predictions through experiments. We furthermore use our model to show that pose regression is more closely related to pose approximation via image retrieval than to accurate pose estimation via 3D structure. A key result is that current approaches do not consistently outperform a handcrafted image retrieval baseline. This clearly shows that additional research is needed before pose regression algorithms are ready to compete with structure-based methods.,True,d5DqmRoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,125,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Sattler_Understanding_the_Limitations_of_CNN-Based_Absolute_Camera_Pose_Regression_CVPR_2019_paper.html,11724607917672549353,/scholar?cites=11724607917672549353,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Sattler_Understanding_the_Limitations_of_CNN-Based_Absolute_Camera_Pose_Regression_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0

State-of-the-art approaches for accurate visual localization use scene-specific representations. resulting in the overhead of constructing these models when applying the techniques to new scenes. Recently. learned approaches based on relative pose estimation have been proposed. carrying the promise of easily adapting to new scenes. However. they are currently significantly less accurate than state-of-the-art approaches. In this paper. we are interested in analyzing this behavior.

We use the crowd and smartphones to collect an image and the geographical position of power distribution grid devices. Since power distribution lines are usually underground and cannot be mapped. we use spatial data analytics on the collected data in combination with other open data sources to infer the topology of the distribution grid.

This task is notoriously challenging due to the drastic viewpoint and appearance differences between the two domains. We show that we can address this discrepancy explicitly by learning to synthesize realistic street views from satellite inputs. Following this observation. we propose a novel multi-task architecture in which image synthesis and retrieval are considered jointly. The rationale behind this is that we can bias our network to learn latent feature representations that are useful for retrieval if we utilize them to generate images across the two input domains. To the best of our knowledge. ours is the first approach that creates realistic street views from satellite images and localizes the corresponding query street-view simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.

Recently emerged correspondence networks propose to perform those steps inside a single network but suffer from low matching resolution due to the memory bottleneck. In this work. we propose a new perspective to estimate correspondences in a detect-to-refine manner. where we first predict patch-level match proposals and then refine them. We present a novel refinement network Patch2Pix that refines match proposals by regressing pixel-level matches from the local regions defined by those proposals and jointly rejecting outlier matches with confidence scores. which is weakly supervised to learn correspondences that are consistent with the epipolar geometry of an input image pair. We show that our refinement network significantly improves the performance of correspondence networks on image matching. homography estimation. and localization tasks.

1283838,Deep fictitious play for finding Markovian Nash equilibrium in multi-agent games,2020,Jiequn Han and Ruimeng Hu,,,,221-245,PMLR,We propose a deep neural network-based algorithm to identify the Markovian Nash equilibrium of general large -player stochastic differential games. Following the idea of fictitious play. we recast the -player game into  decoupled decision problems (one for each player) and solve them iteratively. The individual decision problem is characterized by a semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. to solve which we employ the recently developed deep BSDE method. The resulted algorithm can solve large -player games for which conventional numerical methods would suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Multiple numerical examples involving identical or heterogeneous agents. with risk-neutral or risk-sensitive objectives. are tested to validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in large group games. Even for a fifty-player game with the presence of common noise. the proposed algorithm still finds the approximate Nash equilibrium accurately. which. to our best knowledge. is difficult to achieve by other numerical algorithms.,True,GqfhYYkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,10,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v107/han20a.html,8631524045792773645,/scholar?cites=8631524045792773645,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v107/han20a/han20a.pdf,0,0,0
1283839,Convergence of deep fictitious play for stochastic differential games,2020,Jiequn Han and Ruimeng Hu and Jihao Long,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.05519,,,,Stochastic differential games have been used extensively to model agents' competitions in Finance. for instance. in P2P lending platforms from the Fintech industry. the banking system for systemic risk. and insurance markets. The recently proposed machine learning algorithm. deep fictitious play. provides a novel efficient tool for finding Markovian Nash equilibrium of large -player asymmetric stochastic differential games [J. Han and R. Hu. Mathematical and Scientific Machine Learning Conference. 2020]. By incorporating the idea of fictitious play. the algorithm decouples the game into  sub-optimization problems. and identifies each player's optimal strategy with the deep backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) method parallelly and repeatedly. In this paper. under appropriate conditions. we prove the convergence of deep fictitious play (DFP) to the true Nash equilibrium.

Specifically at each stage. we propose the strategy of letting individual player optimize her own payoff subject to the other players' previous actions. equivalent to solve  decoupled stochastic control optimization problems. which are approximated by DNNs. Therefore. the fictitious play strategy leads to a structure consisting of  DNNs. which only communicate at the end of each stage. The resulted deep learning algorithm based on fictitious play is scalable. parallel and model-free.{\it ie}. using GPU parallelization. it can be applied to any -player stochastic differential game with different symmetries and heterogeneities ({\it eg}. existence of major players). We illustrate the performance of the deep learning algorithm by comparing to the closed-form solution of the linear quadratic game. Moreover. we prove the convergence of fictitious play under appropriate assumptions. and verify that the convergent limit forms an open-loop Nash equilibrium.

Conventional optical flow computation is based on camera sensors only. which makes it prone to failure in conditions with low illumination. On the other hand. LiDAR sensors are independent of illumination. as they measure the time-of-flight of their own emitted lasers. In this work we propose a robust and real-time CNN architecture for Moving Object Detection (MOD) under low-light conditions by capturing motion information from both camera and LiDAR sensors. We demonstrate the impact of our algorithm on KITTI dataset where we simulate a low-light environment creating a novel dataset"" Dark-KITTI"". We obtain a 10.1% relative improvement on Dark-KITTI. and a 4.25% improvement on standard KITTI relative to our baselines.

An autonomous vehicle has to estimate collision risk with other interacting objects in the environment and calculate an optional trajectory. Collision risk is typically higher for moving objects than static ones due to the need to estimate the future states and poses of the objects for decision making. This is particularly important for near-range objects around the vehicle which are typically detected by a fisheye surround-view system that captures a 360 view of the scene. In this work. we propose a CNN architecture for moving object detection using fisheye images that were captured in autonomous driving environment. As motion geometry is highly non-linear and unique for fisheye cameras. we will make an improved version of the current dataset public to encourage further research. To target embedded deployment. we design a lightweight encoder sharing weights across sequential images.

Optical flow is typically computed to detect moving objects and to estimate depth using triangulation. In this paper. our motivation is to leverage the existing dense optical flow to improve the performance of semantic segmentation. To provide a systematic study. we construct four different architectures which use RGB only. flow only. RGBF concatenated and two-stream RGB+ flow. We evaluate these networks on two automotive datasets namely Virtual KITTI and Cityscapes using the state-of-the-art flow estimator FlowNet v2. We also make use of the ground truth optical flow in Virtual KITTI to serve as an ideal estimator and a standard Farneback optical flow algorithm to study the effect of noise. Using the flow ground truth in Virtual KITTI. two-stream architecture achieves the best results with an improvement of 4% IoU. As expected. there is a large improvement for moving objects like trucks. vans and cars with 38%. 28% and 6% increase in IoU.

Four of such cameras form a surround-view system that provides a complete and detailed view of the vehicle. These cameras are directly exposed to harsh environmental settings and can get soiled very easily by mud. dust. water. frost. Soiling on the camera lens can severely degrade the visual perception algorithms. and a camera cleaning system triggered by a soiling detection algorithm is increasingly being deployed. While adverse weather conditions. such as rain. are getting attention recently. there is only limited work on general soiling. The main reason is the difficulty in collecting a diverse dataset as it is a relatively rare event. We propose a novel GAN based algorithm for generating unseen patterns of soiled images. Additionally. the proposed method automatically provides the corresponding soiling masks eliminating the manual annotation cost. Augmentation of the generated soiled images for training improves the accuracy of soiling detection tasks significantly by 18% demonstrating its usefulness.

It enables the detection of unseen objects during training (e.g.. moose or a construction truck) based on their motion and independent of their appearance. Although pixel-wise motion segmentation has been studied in autonomous driving literature. it has been rarely addressed at the instance level. which would help separate connected segments of moving objects leading to better trajectory planning. As the main issue is the lack of large public datasets. we create a new InstanceMotSeg dataset comprising of 12.9K samples improving upon our KITTIMoSeg dataset. In addition to providing instance level annotations. we have added 4 additional classes which is crucial for studying class agnostic motion segmentation. We adapt YOLACT and implement a motion-based class agnostic instance segmentation model which would act as a baseline for the dataset. We also extend it to an efficient multi-task model which additionally provides semantic instance segmentation sharing the encoder. The model then learns separate prototype coefficients within the class agnostic and semantic heads providing two independent paths of object detection for redundant safety.

Leveraging the proposed lightweight Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for depth inference and encoding. we provide the network with previously marginalized sparse features from VIO to increase the accuracy of initial depth prediction and generalization capability. The compact encoded depth maps are then updated jointly with navigation states in a sliding window estimator in order to provide the dense local scene geometry. We additionally propose a novel method to obtain the CVAE's Jacobian which is shown to be more than an order of magnitude faster than previous works. and we additionally leverage First-Estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to avoid recalculation. As opposed to previous works relying on completely dense residuals. we propose to only provide sparse measurements to update the depth code and show through careful experimentation that our choice of sparse measurements and FEJs can still significantly improve the estimated depth maps. Our full system also exhibits state-of-the-art pose estimation accuracy. and we show that it can run in real-time with single-thread execution while utilizing GPU acceleration only for the network and code Jacobian.,True,CePv8agAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10133,2148736777537431346,/scholar?cites=2148736777537431346,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10133,0,0,0

LI-Calib adopts a continuous-time trajectory formulation based on B-Spline. which is more suitable for fusing high-rate or asynchronous measurements than discrete-time based approaches.% Additionally. LI-Calib decomposes the space into cells and identifies the planar segments for data association. which renders the calibration problem well-constrained in usual scenarios without any artificial targets. We validate the proposed calibration approach on both simulated and real-world experiments.

Drip irrigation was named in Israel in 1959. The green house based modern agriculture industries are the recent requirement in every part of agriculture in India. In this technology. the humidity and temperature of plants are precisely monitored and controlled. Water is very precious to all the humans and as well as to the plants. trees. The major amount of fresh water is utilized by the agricultural industry for irrigation. By using drip irrigation the water will be maintained at the constant level ie the water will reach the roots by going drop by drop. This is very important because this can only ensure the survival of the plants. Water can be applied at a single point on the land surface through devices called emitters or as a line source from either closely spaced emitters or tubes with continuous or equally spaced openings that discharge water a drop at a time. If the field is irrigated heavily with water. there are chances that the plant may die because of excessive irrigation. The water could also wash them away during irrigation if very strong force of water is released at the same time. On the other hand. if there is insufficient water. then also there are chances that the plants may die due to lack of water. So. it is very important for the farmer to maintain the content on the field. In this paper the design of a Microcontroller based drip irrigation mechanism is proposed. which is a real time feedback control system for monitoring and controlling all the activities of drip irrigation system more efficiently.

Technol,1,105-109,,To get efficient use of large amounts of body sensor data. a human movement data using clustering. and a technique to analyze sensed physiological signals are used. Recent years have witnessed a large influx of applications in the field of cyber–physical systems. An important class of these systems is body sensor networks (BSNs) where lightweight embedded processors and communication systems are tightly coupled with the human body. One major obstacle is managing repositories that store the large amount of sensing data. To address this issue. we propose a data mining approach inspired by the experience in the areas of text and natural language processing. BSNs can provide researchers. care providers and clinicians access to tremendously valuable information extracted from data that are collected in users’ natural environment. With this information. one can monitor the progression of a disease. identify its early onset. or simply assess user’s wellness. We represent sensor readings with a sequence of characters. called motion transcripts. Transcripts reduce complexity of the data significantly while maintaining morphological and structural properties of the physiological signals. These transitions are efficiently captured using the concept of n-grams. To facilitate a lightweight and fast mining approach. we reduce the overwhelmingly large number of n-grams via information gain (IG) feature selection.

Prior to the development of UAVs. Manned Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) were in use. Later to overcome the demerits of MAVs. UAVs were introduced. Some significant advantages of UAVs over MAVs are it is less expensive. secure and movable. Two major issues in UAVs are:-collisions and obstacles. Obstacle avoidance models can be either static or dynamic and collision occurs due to variable shaped obstacles. Traditional static UAV models are not efficient against polygon obstacle shapes with dynamic obstacles. In this proposed model. a novel dynamic obstacle avoidance model with dynamic routing algorithm is proposed.

Existing methods of adversarial domain adaptation mainly align the global images across the source and target domains. However. it is obvious that not all regions of an image are transferable. while forcefully aligning the untransferable regions may lead to negative transfer. Furthermore. some of the images are significantly dissimilar across domains. resulting in weak image-level transferability. To this end. we present Transferable Attention for Domain Adaptation (TADA). focusing our adaptation model on transferable regions or images.

Due to the lack of ground truth. our method is fully self-supervised. yet it produces precise depth with a subpixel precision of 1/30th of a pixel; it does not suffer from the common over-smoothing issues of previous approaches; it preserves the edges; and it explicitly handles occlusions. We introduce a novel reconstruction loss that is more robust to noise and texture-less patches. and is invariant to illumination changes. The proposed loss is optimized using a window-based cost aggregation with an adaptive support weight scheme. This cost aggregation is edge-preserving and smooths the loss function. which is key to allow the network to reach compelling results. Finally we show how the task of predicting invalid regions. such as occlusions. can be trained end-to-end without ground-truth. This component is crucial to reduce blur and particularly improves predictions along depth discontinuities.

Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a widely used BS technique which provides a good compromise between robustness to the background variations and real-time constraints. However. GMM does not support the spatial relationship among neighbouring pixels and it uses a fixed learning rate for every pixel during the parameter update. On the other hand.

A novel method is proposed here for extracting target objects from real time video and then tracking them under varying illumination condition. It operates on video imagery taken from multiple video cameras. Each camera is connected to an infrared sensor and is distributed around the site to get the complete picture of the suspicious activities of intruders. By using an array of infrared sensors. each video camera is made event-driven. Thus a camera starts recording only after being triggered with the output of nearby infrared sensor. Thus it becomes a compressed sensing system. Our proposed method uses homomorphic filtering to overcome varying illumination condition.

Shortening acquisition time and reducing the motion-artifact are two of the most critical issues in MRI. As a promising solution. high-quality MRI image restoration provides a new approach to achieve higher resolution without costing additional acquisition time or modification on the pulse sequences. Recently. as to the rise of deep learning. convolutional neural networks have been proposed for super-resolution (SR) image generation and motion-artifact reduction (MAR) for MRI. Recent studies suggest that using perceptual feature space loss and k space loss to capture the perceptual information and high-frequency information of images. respectively. However. the quality of reconstructed SR and MAR MR images is limited because the most important details of the informative area in the MR image. the edges and the structure. cannot be very well restored. Besides. lots of the SR approaches are trained by using low-resolution images generated by applying bicubic or blur-downscale degradation. which cannot represent the real process of MRI measurement. Such inconsistencies lead to performance degradation in the reconstruction of SR images as well. This study reveals that using the L1 loss of SSIM and gradient map edge quality loss could force the deep learning model to focus on studying the features of edges and structure details of MR images. thus generating SR images with more accurate. fruitful information and reduced motion-artifact.

Voice impersonators possess a great deal of flexibility over their voices which allows them to imitate various people or characters. The question as to how impersonators are able transform their voices and what linguistic and acoustic parameters they rely on is still relatively unexplored. Understanding how they are able to transform their voices holds the key for many applications. such as. speaker recognition. voice transformation. voice disguise detection and speech coding etc. In the first part of the thesis. the extent to which professional voice artists are able to modulate their voices in order to produce distinct and natural sounding voice identities was investigated. For this purpose. a database of voice impersonations was first constructed using data from three professional voice artists (one male. two females). Each artist produced 9 different voice identities including their natural voice. The data included synchronous speech and electroglottograph signals. The electroglottograph signals provide useful insights into the complex periodic movements of the vocal folds. An acoustic and linguistic analysis was then performed to understand how various glottal parameters such as pitch. vocal fold timing (open quotient through electroglottograph signals). speech rate and vocal tract formants are manipulated by the artists. The analysis revealed that the artists utilized variation in both their glottal and vocal tract characteristics for impersonating different ages and genders.

Most of the methods using cellular automata (CA) for image denoising involve the manual design of the rules that define the behaviour of the automata. This is a complex and not straightforward operation. In order to tackle this problem. this paper proposes to use evolutionary methods to obtain the CA set of rules which produces the best possible denoising under different noise models or/and image sources. This is implemented using a spatio-temporal neighbourhood for each pixel. which significantly improves the results with respect to simple spatio or temporal set of neighbours. The proposed method is tested to reduce the noise in low-dose X-ray image sequences.

This includes fracture characterization using fractal theory and distribution of fracture aperture as determined by X-ray CT scanning of rough fracture surfaces. Voronoi grids or Perpendicular Bisector. PEBI. are then generated using a newly developed algorithm that conforms to fracture patterns as observed on fractured outcrop. Once the fractures and matrix have been gridded. the simulator is benchmarked against conventional commercial simulators. Voronoi grids are generated in a way to align Voronoi edges along fractures. Special treatment has to be taken to populate Voronoi nodes in order to avoid the distortion of Voronoi grids around fracture tips and fracture intersection points. A connection list including geologic information of Voronoi grids can then be generated as an input mesh file to simulate fluid flow using a finite volume discretization based reservoir simulator. Simple gas injection simulation examples show that discrete fractures with variable aperture in individual fractures and non-uniform orientation of the fracture system might be a barrier to fluid flow or enhance conductivity depending on aperture distribution and orientation of the fracture system relative to injector-producer pairs.,True,SVgrso4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianlei_john_Sun/publication/270559333_Utilization_of_Voronoi_Gridding_for_Simulation_of_Heterogeneous_Discrete_Fracture_Networks_Using_Outcrop_and_X-ray_CT/links/56445fd608ae451880a717f5.pdf,17515695444842640523,/scholar?cites=17515695444842640523,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianlei_john_Sun/publication/270559333_Utilization_of_Voronoi_Gridding_for_Simulation_of_Heterogeneous_Discrete_Fracture_Networks_Using_Outcrop_and_X-ray_CT/links/56445fd608ae451880a717f5.pdf,0,0,0

The temporal context includes the leading and trailing word sequences of a word. We assume that there exist spoken word pairs in the training database. We pad the word pairs with their original temporal context to form fixed-length speech segment pairs. We obtain the acoustic word embeddings through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained on the speech segment pairs with a triplet loss. Shifting a fixed-length analysis window through the search content. we obtain a running sequence of embeddings. In this way. searching for the spoken query is equivalent to the matching of acoustic word embeddings. The experiments show that our proposed acoustic word embeddings learned with temporal context are effective in QbE speech search. They outperform the state-of-the-art frame-level feature representations and reduce run-time computation since no dynamic time warping is required in QbE speech search. We also find that it is important to have sufficient speech segment pairs to train the deep CNN for effective acoustic word embeddings.,True,eQwn2vEAAAAJ:5Ul4iDaHHb8C,19,https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03621,18379204780489892356,/scholar?cites=18379204780489892356,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03621,0,0,0

Multi-object adaptive optics is one such technique. In this paper. different implementations of a tomographic reconstructor based on a machine learning architecture named “CARMEN” are presented. Basic concepts of adaptive optics are introduced first. with a short explanation of three different control systems used on real telescopes and the sensors utilised. The operation of the reconstructor. along with the three neural network frameworks used. and the developed CUDA code are detailed. Changes to the size of the reconstructor influence the training and execution time of the neural network.

1284059,Object detection and classification by decision-level fusion for intelligent vehicle systems,2017,Sang-Il Oh and Hang-Bong Kang,17,Sensors,1,207,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,To understand driving environments effectively. it is important to achieve accurate detection and classification of objects detected by sensor-based intelligent vehicle systems. which are significantly important tasks. Object detection is performed for the localization of objects. whereas object classification recognizes object classes from detected object regions. For accurate object detection and classification. fusing multiple sensor information into a key component of the representation and perception processes is necessary. In this paper. we propose a new object-detection and classification method using decision-level fusion. We fuse the classification outputs from independent unary classifiers. such as 3D point clouds and image data using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The unary classifiers for the two sensors are the CNN with five layers. which use more than two pre-trained convolutional layers to consider local to global features as data representation. To represent data using convolutional layers. we apply region of interest (ROI) pooling to the outputs of each layer on the object candidate regions generated using object proposal generation to realize color flattening and semantic grouping for charge-coupled device and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors. We evaluate our proposed method on a KITTI benchmark dataset to detect and classify three object classes: cars. pedestrians and cyclists.

However. as endoscopic ultrasonography has limitations when measuring the exact depth in a clinical setting as endoscopists often depend on gross findings and personal experience. The present study aimed to develop a model optimized for EGC detection and depth prediction. and we investigated factors affecting artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis. We employed a visual geometry group (VGG)-16 model for the classification of endoscopic images as EGC (T1a or T1b) or non-EGC. To induce the model to activate EGC regions during training. we proposed a novel loss function that simultaneously measured classification and localization errors. We experimented with 11.539 endoscopic images (896 T1a-EGC. 809 T1b-EGC. and 9834 non-EGC). The areas under the curves of receiver operating characteristic curves for EGC detection and depth prediction were 0.981 and 0.851. respectively. Among the factors affecting AI prediction of tumor depth. only histologic differentiation was significantly associated. where undifferentiated-type histology exhibited a lower AI accuracy. Thus. the lesion-based model is an appropriate training method for AI in EGC. However. further improvements and validation are required. especially for undifferentiated-type histology.

1284062,Multiple Objects Fusion Tracker Using a Matching Network for Adaptively Represented Instance Pairs,2017,Sang-Il Oh and Hang-Bong Kang,17,Sensors,4,883,,Multiple-object tracking is affected by various sources of distortion. such as occlusion. illumination variations and motion changes. Overcoming these distortions by tracking on RGB frames. such as shifting. has limitations because of material distortions caused by RGB frames. To overcome these distortions. we propose a multiple-object fusion tracker (MOFT). which uses a combination of 3D point clouds and corresponding RGB frames. The MOFT uses a matching function initialized on large-scale external sequences to determine which candidates in the current frame match with the target object in the previous frame. After conducting tracking on a few frames. the initialized matching function is fine-tuned according to the appearance models of target objects. The fine-tuning process of the matching function is constructed as a structured form with diverse matching function branches. In general multiple object tracking situations. scale variations for a scene occur depending on the distance between the target objects and the sensors. If the target objects in various scales are equally represented with the same strategy. information losses will occur for any representation of the target objects. In this paper. the output map of the convolutional layer obtained from a pre-trained convolutional neural network is used to adaptively represent instances without information loss. In addition. MOFT fuses the tracking results obtained from each modality at the decision level to compensate the tracking failures of each modality using basic belief assignment. rather than fusing modalities by selectively using the features of each modality.

A three-layer neural network was designed to extract the frequency of sinusoidal waves that had been combined with white noise at a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 dB. One hundred thousand waves were prepared for training and testing the model. We designed a neural network that could achieve a mean squared error of 4 × 10−5 for normalized frequencies. This model was written for the range 1 kHz ≤ f ≤ 10 kHz but also shown how to easily be generalized to other ranges. The algorithm is easy to rewrite and the final results are highly accurate.

Here. we introduce a new method for amplifying second and third harmonic generation from magnetic metamaterials. We show numerically that by using a grating structure under the metamaterial. the grating and the metamaterial form a resonator which leads to a higher absorption in the metamaterial. By this method we could increase the absorption of the structure in the magnetic resonance up to 25% of the initial value. This leads to the generation of second and third harmonic signals with a higher efficiency from this metamaterial-based nonlinear media. We confirmed this idea in the nanostrip metamaterials and saw the amplitude of the second harmonic generation was doubled and the amplitude of the third harmonic generation increased by a factor of 4 in comparison to the same structure without …,True,FHEGCOYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030401817302523,17138211340776541169,/scholar?cites=17138211340776541169,,,,0,0,0

We show that the current loop formed in the magnetic resonant frequency acts as a source for nonlinear effects. The current loop that has a circular shape can be divided into two orthogonal parts. where each of these parts acts as a source for generating a harmonic signal parallel to itself.

However. the TCM method has not yet been applied to a kV-CBCT system on a LINAC machine. The purpose of this study is to investigate if a TCM method would be desirable in a kV-CBCT system for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) or not. We have developed an attenuation–based TCM method using prior knowledge from planning CT images of patients. The TCM method can provide optimized dose reductions without degrading image quality for kV-CBCT imaging. Here. we investigate whether or not our suggested TCM method is desirable to use in kV-CBCT systems to confirm and revise the exact position of a patient for IGRT. Patients go through diagnostic CT scans for RT planning; therefore. using information from prior CT images can enable estimations of the total X-ray attenuation through a patient’s body in a CBCT setting for radiation treatment. Having this planning CT image allows to use the proposed TCM method in RT. The proposed TCM method provides a minimal amount of current for each projection. as well as total current. required to reconstruct the current modulated CBCT image with an image quality similar to that of CBCT.

1284097,Algorithmic guarantees for inverse imaging with untrained network priors,2019,Gauri Jagatap and Chinmay Hegde,,,,,,Deep neural networks as image priors have been recently introduced for problems such as denoising. super-resolution and inpainting with promising performance gains over hand-crafted image priors such as sparsity and low-rank. Unlike learned generative priors they do not require any training over large datasets. However. few theoretical guarantees exist in the scope of using untrained neural network priors for inverse imaging problems. We explore new applications and theory for untrained neural network priors. Specifically. we consider the problem of solving linear inverse problems. such as compressive sensing. as well as non-linear problems. such as compressive phase retrieval. We model images to lie in the range of an untrained deep generative network with a fixed seed. We further present a projected gradient descent scheme that can be used for both compressive sensing and phase retrieval and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for its convergence.

Fourier ptychography is an image acquisition scheme that uses an array of images to produce high-resolution images in microscopy as well as long-distance imaging. to mitigate the effects of diffraction blurring. The number of measurements is typically much larger than the size of the signal (image or video) to be reconstructed. which translates to high storage and computational requirements. The issue of high sample complexity can be alleviated by utilizing structural properties of the image (or video). In this article. we first discuss a range of sub-sampling schemes which can reduce the amount of measurements in Fourier ptychography setups; however. this makes the problem ill-posed.

Our algorithms are based on the technique of alternating minimization: estimating the activation patterns of each ReLU for all given samples. interleaved with weight updates via a least-squares step. The main focus of our paper are 1-hidden layer networks with  hidden neurons and ReLU activation. We show that under standard distributional assumptions on the  dimensional input data. our algorithm provably recovers the trueground truth'parameters in a linearly convergent fashion. This holds as long as the weights are sufficiently well initialized; furthermore. our method requires only  samples. We also analyze the special case of 1-hidden layer networks with skipped connections. commonly used in ResNet-type architectures. and propose a novel initialization strategy for the same. For ReLU based ResNet type networks. we provide the first linear convergence guarantee with an end-to-end algorithm.

1284103,High dynamic range imaging using deep image priors,2020,Gauri Jagatap and Chinmay Hegde,,,,,,Traditionally. dynamic range enhancement for images has involved a combination of contrast improvement (via gamma correction or histogram equalization) and a denoising operation to reduce the effects of photon noise. More recently. modulo-imaging methods have been introduced for high dynamic range photography to significantly expand dynamic range at the sensing stage itself. The transformation function for both of these problems is highly non-linear. and the image reconstruction procedure is typically non-convex and ill-posed. A popular recent approach is to regularize the above inverse problem via a neural network prior (such as a trained autoencoder). but this requires extensive training over a dataset with thousands of paired regular/HDR image data samples.In this paper. we introduce a new approach for HDR image reconstruction using neural priors that require no training data.

1284118,Linear-scale filterbank for deep neural network-based voice activity detection,2017,Youngmoon Jung and Younggwan Kim and Hyungjun Lim and Hoirin Kim,,,,1-5,IEEE,Voice activity detection (VAD) is an important preprocessing module in many speech applications. Choosing appropriate features and model structures is a significant challenge and an active area of current VAD research. Mel-scale features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and log Mel-filterbank (LMFB) energies have been widely used in VAD as well as speech recognition. The reason for feature extraction in Mel- frequency scale to be one of the most popular methods is that it mimics how human ears process sound. However. for certain types of sound. in which important characteristics are reflected more in the high frequency range. a linear-scale in frequency may provide more information than the Mel- scale. Therefore. in this paper. we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based VAD system using linear-scale feature.

Basically. MAP adaptation needs a data storage for speaker adaptive (SA) model as much as speaker independent (SI) model needs. Modern speech recognition systems have a huge number of parameters and deal with millions of users. To reduce the data storage for SA models. in this paper. we propose a constrained maximum likelihood estimation-based speaker adaptation with L1 regularization.

TTS) system consists of separate modules. such as a text analysis module. an acoustic modeling module. and a speech synthesis module. This causes two problems: 1) expert knowledge of each module is required. and 2) errors generated in each module accumulate passing through each module. An end-to-end TTS system could avoid such problems by synthesizing voice signals directly from an input string. In this study. we implemented an end-to-end Korean TTS system using Google's Tacotron. which is an end-to-end TTS system based on a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism. We used 4392 utterances spoken by a Korean female speaker. an amount that corresponds to 37% of the dataset Google used for training Tacotron. Our system obtained mean opinion score (MOS) 2.98 and degradation mean opinion score (DMOS) 3.25. We will discuss the factors which affected training of the system.

1284133,Scaling Neural Networks Through Sparsity,2018,Louis Kirsch,,,,,Tech. rep,Contemporary neural network architectures are several orders of magnitude smaller than a human brain. But we need extraordinary large neural networks if knowledge about the entire interaction history of a reinforcement agent should be distilled into the network. In the simplest case. this may be a policy to gain maximum reward in a certain environment. Much larger networks will be required if predictive understanding about the environment should be included. such as a detailed model of the environment. This predictive understanding helps to solve new. currently unknown. tasks beyond learning to maximize the reward on the current task. Thus. even if we could find the right learning algorithm that exhibits similar behavior to biological intelligence. it is unlikely that current small neural networks would scale to human intelligence.Furthermore. the current deep learning revolution can in large parts be attributed to larger neural networks and increased data set sizes [11]. Hence. it is conceivable that larger neural network architectures that learn from large amounts of data from many different tasks already exhibit intelligent behavior without much further development of new learning algorithms and inductive biases. We conclude that our goal should be to explore the limit of extremely large or even infinitely sized neural networks. With current GPU hardware. we quickly reach computational and memory limits [15. 4. 19].

While there has been a lot of excitement around the possibilities and future impact. a major issue has always been to actually define intelligence. It is obvious that such a definition is critical in order to measure our progress towards this goal and to devise strategies to reach it. The situation has changed dramatically with the introduction of universal artificial intelligence by Hutter [2]. Based on this theory Legg [3] has been able to devise a formal measurement of intelligence that fits with most existing treatments and definitions.In this chapter. we summarize this theory and present the maximally intelligent agent AIXI [2]. We will see that AIXI is incomputable but might nevertheless be a guiding theory for future practical approximations. Based on this insight. we investigate how this affects deep learning and propose a critical set of challenges that should be addressed to practically implement intelligent agents.,True,w8AkOEAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://louiskirsch.com/assets/publications/contemporary-challenges-in-artificial-intelligence.pdf,,,,,http://louiskirsch.com/assets/publications/contemporary-challenges-in-artificial-intelligence.pdf,0,0,0

1284138,Differentiable Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Time Series Classification,2017,Louis Kirsch,,,,,,In the last few years. deep learning revolutionized many areas of machine learning. One very important area is time series classification. Time series are produced everywhere in real world scenarios. such as industrial or medical sensor data. The success in deep learning is largely based on training through backpropagation. Nevertheless. backpropagation can only be applied to weights training. since architecture construction is not differentiable. As a result. state of the art architectures are commonly handcrafted. This thesis addresses the problem of automatically designing architectures for time series classification in an efficient manner. Existing solutions for constructing architectures algorithmically. such as evolutionary or reinforcement learning methods. are much more computationally expensive. We address the problem by introducing a regularization technique for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that enables joint training of network weights and architecture through backpropagation. Skip connections and a special two-phased training are introduced to enable a stable optimization. We evaluate the approach on the UCR archive. yielding competitive results compared to state of the art in time series classification. and outperforming on datasets where handcrafted architectures do not match the complexity of the dataset. iii,True,w8AkOEAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,http://louiskirsch.com/assets/projects/bachelor-thesis.pdf,,,,,http://louiskirsch.com/assets/projects/bachelor-thesis.pdf,0,0,0

Szemerédi’s regularity lemma has emerged over time as a fundamental tool in different branches of graph theory. combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Roughly. it states that every graph can be approximated by the union of a small number of random-like bipartite graphs called regular pairs. In other words. the result provides us a way to obtain a good description of a large graph using a small amount of data. and can be regarded as a manifestation of the all-pervading dichotomy between structure and randomness.

Few existing works have addressed active learning for object detection. Most of these methods are based on multiple models or are straightforward extensions of classification methods. hence estimate an image's informativeness using only the classification head. In this paper. we propose a novel deep active learning approach for object detection. Our approach relies on mixture density networks that estimate a probabilistic distribution for each localization and classification head's output. We explicitly estimate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass of a single model. Our method uses a scoring function that aggregates these two types of uncertainties for both heads to obtain every image's informativeness score.

1284149,Learning Intra-Batch Connections for Deep Metric Learning,2021,Jenny Seidenschwarz and Ismail Elezi and Laura Leal-Taixé,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.07753,,,,The goal of metric learning is to learn a function that maps samples to a lower-dimensional space where similar samples lie closer than dissimilar ones. In the case of deep metric learning. the mapping is performed by training a neural network. Most approaches rely on losses that only take the relations between pairs or triplets of samples into account. which either belong to the same class or to two different classes. However. these approaches do not explore the embedding space in its entirety. To this end. we propose an approach based on message passing networks that takes into account all the relations in a mini-batch. We refine embedding vectors by exchanging messages among all samples in a given batch allowing the training process to be aware of the overall structure. Since not all samples are equally important to predict a decision boundary. we use dot-product self-attention during message passing to allow samples to weight the importance of each neighbor accordingly.

However. a persistent challenge in DNA methylome analysis is the accurate identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between samples. Sensitive and specific identification of DMRs among different conditions requires accurate and efficient algorithms. and while various tools have been developed to tackle this problem. they frequently suffer from inaccurate DMR boundary identification and high false positive rate.

Therefore in this paper. we present a hybrid image-based positioning system that is intended to provide seamless position solution in six degrees of freedom (6DoF) for location-based services in both outdoor and indoor environments. It mainly uses visual sensor input to match with geo-referenced images for image-based positioning resolution. and also takes advantage of multiple onboard sensors. including the built-in GPS receiver and digital compass to assist visual methods. Experiments demonstrate that such a system can greatly improve the position accuracy for areas where the GPS signal is negatively affected (such as in urban canyons). and it also provides excellent position accuracy for indoor environments.

Governments. companies and other organizations have lost a lot of money and many others have closed down due to the activities of dubious hackers and attackers. As data is the life wire of every organization. there is the need to remotely and securely store the data generated daily by these organizations in order to enable them recover quickly in the event of attach and hack. Cloud storage is needed here for the remote data storage. For many establishments. data security is one of their major concern when sending their files into the cloud. They worry about their files being seen or even compromised by malicious and dubious people because that’s what happened in the past. User accounts have been hacked. cloud storage systems failed. files and personal data were exposed. So how can you effectively prevent that from happening even if your account gets hacked or something happens to your cloud storage provider. Data encryption techniques are required to protect the integrity of the stored data. In the past. many businesses felt comfortable allowing the cloud providers to manage all their data. believing that security risks could be managed through contracts. controls and audits.

One of their primary benefits is that they learn image features rather than relying on hand-crafted features. thereby reducing the amount of knowledge engineering that must be performed. However. another form of knowledge engineering bias exists in how objects are labelled in images. thereby limiting CNNs to classifying the set of object types that have been predefined by a domain expert.

To overcome this limitation. we develop a graph-theoretic method that inherits the power of deep learning while at the same time utilizing the correlations among the articles.

Most smartphone and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR)-based indoor localization studies have used an operation between step count and stride length to estimate the distance traveled via generalized formulas based on the manually designed features of the measured sensory signal. In contrast. we have applied a different approach to learn the velocity of the pedestrian by using a segmented signal frame with our proposed hybrid multiscale convolutional and recurrent neural network model. and we estimate the distance traveled by computing the velocity and the moved time. We measured the inertial sensor and global position service (GPS) position at a synchronized time while walking outdoors with a reliable GPS fix. and we assigned the velocity as a label obtained from the displacement between the current position and a prior position to the corresponding signal frame. Our proposed real-time and automatic dataset construction method dramatically reduces the cost and significantly increases the efficiency of constructing a dataset. Moreover. our proposed deep learning model can be naturally applied to all kinds of time-series sensory signal processing. The performance was evaluated on an Android application (app) that exported the trained model and parameters. Our proposed method achieved a distance error of< 2.4% and> 1.5% on indoor experiments.

In addition to choosing the appropriate clustering methods. particular attention should be paid to the choice of the features describing patterns in order to improve the clustering performance. This paper presents a novel feature descriptor. referred as Histogram of Structure Tensors (HoST). allowing to capture the local information of an image. The basic idea is that a local pattern could be described by the distribution of the structure tensors orientations and shapes. The proposed HoST descriptor has two major advantages. On the first hand. it captures the dominant orientations in a local spatial region taking into account of the local shape of the edges structure. In fact. it is based on the structure tensor that represents a very interesting concept for characterizing the local shape. On the other hand. the use of the histogram concept makes the proposed descriptor so effective and useful when a reduced feature representation is required.In this paper. the proposed HoST descriptor is addressed to the pattern clustering task. An extensive experimental validation demonstrates its performance when compared to other existing feature descriptors such as Local Binary Patterns and Histogram of Oriented Gradients.

As circadian regulation is key to controlling metabolism. understanding the impact of exercise performed at different times of the day is relevant for physiology and homeostasis.

In healthcare. intelligible models not only help clinicians to understand the problem and create more targeted action plans. they also help to gain the clinicians’ trust. Caruana et al. demonstrated generalized additive models with pairwise interactions can be applied to real healthcare problems such as pneumonia risk with high accuracy. 2 Through a graphical representation of each model feature’s learned contribution to the predicted risk. the intelligible model helps to visualize learned patterns and identify new patterns or confirm what clinicians already know. In this study. we applied the same idea and created a “generalized additive neural network” to help visualize feature patterns related to risk of in-hospital mortality. Methods: Data used in these experiments came from UCLA Medical Center with IRB approval. The data consists of 59.985 patients with 47 features extracted at the end of surgery. These features include intraoperative vital signs. interventions. and anesthesia events. Data included all surgical procedures performed since March 1. 2013.

Cham, Representing 3D shape in deep learning frameworks in an accurate. efficient and compact manner still remains an open challenge. Most existing work addresses this issue by employing voxel-based representations. While these approaches benefit greatly from advances in computer vision by generalizing 2D convolutions to the 3D setting. they also have several considerable drawbacks. The computational complexity of voxel-encodings grows cubically with the resolution thus limiting such representations to low-resolution 3D reconstruction. In an attempt to solve this problem. point cloud representations have been proposed. Although point clouds are more efficient than voxel representations as they only cover surfaces rather than volumes. they do not encode detailed geometric information about relationships between points.

1284273,Bidirectional variational inference for non-autoregressive text-to-speech,2020,Yoonhyung Lee and Joongbo Shin and Kyomin Jung,,International Conference on Learning Representations,,,,Although early text-to-speech (TTS) models such as Tacotron 2 have succeeded in generating human-like speech. their autoregressive architectures have several limitations:(1) They require a lot of time to generate a mel-spectrogram consisting of hundreds of steps.(2) The autoregressive speech generation lacks robustness due to its error propagation property. In this paper. we propose a novel non-autoregressive TTS model called BVAE-TTS. which eliminates the architectural limitations and generates a mel-spectrogram in parallel. BVAE-TTS adopts a bidirectional-inference variational autoencoder (BVAE) that learns hierarchical latent representations using both bottom-up and top-down paths to increase its expressiveness. To apply BVAE to TTS. we design our model to utilize text information via an attention mechanism. By using attention maps that BVAE-TTS generates. we train a duration predictor so that the model uses the predicted duration of each phoneme at inference. In experiments conducted on LJSpeech dataset. we show that our model generates a mel-spectrogram 27 times faster than Tacotron 2 with similar speech quality. Furthermore. our BVAE-TTS outperforms Glow-TTS. which is one of the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive TTS models. in terms of both speech quality and inference speed while having 58% fewer parameters.,True,xzJSvJcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://openreview.net/pdf/db03d769745da96b32be80606e358d64a7641d2b.pdf,11700307022581985386,/scholar?cites=11700307022581985386,,,https://openreview.net/pdf/db03d769745da96b32be80606e358d64a7641d2b.pdf,0,0,0

To resolve the limitation. we propose a novel deep bidirectional language model called Transformer-based Text Autoencoder (T-TA). The T-TA computes contextual language representations without repetition and has benefits of the deep bidirectional architecture like BERT. In run-time experiments on CPU environments. the proposed T-TA performs over six times faster than the BERT-based model in the reranking task and twelve times faster in the semantic similarity task.

1284275,Effective sentence scoring method using bidirectional language model for speech recognition,2019,Joongbo Shin and Yoonhyung Lee and Kyomin Jung,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.06655,,,,In automatic speech recognition. many studies have shown performance improvements using language models (LMs). Recent studies have tried to use bidirectional LMs (biLMs) instead of conventional unidirectional LMs (uniLMs) for rescoring the -best list decoded from the acoustic model. In spite of their theoretical benefits. the biLMs have not given notable improvements compared to the uniLMs in their experiments. This is because their biLMs do not consider the interaction between the two directions. In this paper. we propose a novel sentence scoring method considering the interaction between the past and the future words on the biLM. Our experimental results on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the biLM with the proposed sentence scoring outperforms the uniLM for the -best list rescoring. consistently and significantly in all experimental conditions. The analysis of WERs by word position demonstrates that the biLM is more robust than the uniLM especially when a recognized sentence is short or a misrecognized word is at the beginning of the sentence.,True,xzJSvJcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06655,10894493954202318277,/scholar?cites=10894493954202318277,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.06655,0,0,0

To address action recognition problems. this paper presents a framework that jointly models multiple complex actions and motion units at different hierarchical levels.

The ML-HDP model formulates the co-occurrence relationship of actions and motion units. and enables highly accurate recognition. In particular. our topic model possesses the three-level representation in action understanding. where low-level local features are connected to high-level actions via mid-level atomic actions.

Due to this situation. there is an increasing request for the distributed processing of large-scale video data. In an intelligent video analytics platform. a submitted unstructured video undergoes through several multidisciplinary algorithms with the aim of extracting insights and making them searchable and understandable for both human and machine. Video analytics have applications ranging from surveillance to video content management. In this context. various industrial and scholarly solutions exist. However. most of the existing solutions rely on a traditional client/server framework to perform face and object recognition while lacking the support for more complex application scenarios. Furthermore. these frameworks are rarely handled in a scalable manner using distributed computing. Besides. existing works do not provide any support for low-level distributed video processing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

To interpret these large-scale data. several methods have been proposed to infer latent dynamic structure from high-dimensional datasets. One recent line of work uses recurrent neural networks in a sequential autoencoder (SAE) framework to uncover dynamics. SAEs are an appealing option for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems. and enable a precise link between neural activity and behavior on a single-trial basis. However. the very large parameter count and complexity of SAEs relative to other models has caused concern that SAEs may only perform well on very large training sets. We hypothesized that with a method to systematically optimize hyperparameters (HPs). SAEs might perform well even in cases of limited training data. Such a breakthrough would greatly extend their applicability. However. we find that SAEs applied to spiking neural data are prone to a particular form of overfitting that cannot be detected using standard validation metrics. which prevents standard HP searches. We develop and test two potential solutions: an alternate validation method ("" sample validation"") and a novel regularization method ("" coordinated dropout"").

1284294,Unsupervised spike sorting based on discriminative subspace learning,2014,Mohammad Reza Keshtkaran and Zhi Yang,,,,3784-3788,IEEE,Spike sorting is a fundamental preprocessing step for many neuroscience studies which rely on the analysis of spike trains. In this paper. we present two unsupervised spike sorting algorithms based on discriminative subspace learning. The first algorithm simultaneously learns the discriminative feature subspace and performs clustering. It uses histogram of features in the most discriminative projection to detect the number of neurons. The second algorithm performs hierarchical divisive clustering that learns a discriminative 1-dimensional subspace for clustering in each level of the hierarchy until achieving almost unimodal distribution in the subspace. The algorithms are tested on synthetic and in-vivo data. and are compared against two widely used spike sorting methods. The comparative results demonstrate that our spike sorting methods can achieve substantially higher accuracy in lower dimensional feature …,True,qua_8o0AAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,7,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6944447/,1142348891315992428,/scholar?cites=1142348891315992428,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5275,0,0,0

It does not require any interference reference signal and can reliably track interference changes in frequency. phase. and amplitude. The method includes three major steps. First. it employs a robust frequency estimator to obtain the fundamental frequency of the interference. Second. a series of discrete-time oscillators are used to generate interference harmonics. where harmonic phase and amplitude are obtained using the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. Third. the estimated interference harmonics are removed without distorting the neural signals at the interference frequencies.

Recently. a lot of analytical methods have been applied to electroencephalograms (EEGs) in order to quantitatively detect the fatigue state but their accuracy still is not satisfactory. To extract fatigue-related features from the captured information through the ongoing raw EEG signals. for the first time. non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). local NMF (LNMF). sparse NMF (SNMF) and discriminant NMF (DNMF) methods were utilized. EEG signals were recorded from 32 channels before and after two hours severe mental activity from seventeen healthy subjects. After preprocessing the raw EEGs. they were arranged in matrices to be decomposed into discriminative subspaces. Support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify these two mental states.

However. the sheer volume of data and its dynamical complexity are critical barriers to uncovering and interpreting these dynamics. Deep learning methods are a promising approach due to their ability to uncover meaningful relationships from large. complex. and noisy datasets. When applied to high-D spiking data from motor cortex (M1) during stereotyped behaviors. they offer improvements in the ability to uncover dynamics and their relation to subjects9 behaviors on a millisecond timescale. However. applying such methods to less-structured behaviors. or in brain areas that are not well-modeled by autonomous dynamics. is far more challenging. because deep learning methods often require careful hand-tuning of complex model hyperparameters (HPs). Here we demonstrate AutoLFADS. a large-scale. automated model-tuning framework that can characterize dynamics in diverse brain areas without regard to behavior. AutoLFADS uses distributed computing to train dozens of models simultaneously while using evolutionary algorithms to tune HPs in a completely unsupervised way. This enables accurate inference of dynamics out-of-the-box on a variety of datasets. including data from M1 during stereotyped and free-paced reaching. somatosensory cortex during reaching with perturbations. and frontal cortex during cognitive timing tasks.

In this paper we extend their work and achieve two contributions. Firstly. we propose a novel feature definition and introduce a feature shape mask to represent it. The defined features are scale-invariant which means the features can be rescaled easily and reduce the performance degradation introduced by rounding. The feature shape mask can be computed efficiently and expanded conveniently. which can simulate feature shapes used by others and thus enriches the haar-like feature pool. Secondly. we present an improved cascade-structured classifier which is called fuzzy cascade classifier. The cascade-structured classifier owns the disadvantage of neglecting confidence of the prior stage classifiers while only using the binary output of prior stages. Motivated by fuzzy theory. we expand the output of each stage to three states: face. non-face. and potential face and set probability being face to each candidate window to make full use of the information of prior stages.

To speed up the process. we integrate motion energy into the cascade-structured classifier. Motion energy can represent moving the extent of the candidate regions. which is used to reject most of the candidate windows and thus accelerates the evaluation procedure. According to the face presence situation. we divide the system state into three modes. and process input images with an intensity detector. or motion integrated dynamic detector. or else keep the pre-results.

In a 3TConv the 3D convolutional filter is obtained by learning a 2D filter and a set of temporal transformation parameters. resulting in a sparse filter where the 2D slices are sequentially dependent on each other in the temporal dimension. We demonstrate that 3TConv learns temporal transformations that afford a direct interpretation. The temporal parameters can be used in combination with various existing 2D visualization methods. We also show that insight about what the model learns can be achieved by analyzing the transformation parameter statistics on a layer and model level. Finally. we implicitly demonstrate that. in popular ConvNets. the 2DConv can be replaced with a 3TConv and that the weights can be transferred to yield pretrained 3TConvs. pretrained 3TConvnets leverage more than a decade of work on traditional 2DConvNets by being able to make use of features that have been proven to deliver excellent results on image classification benchmarks.,True,EyH9zNoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15983,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15983,0,0,0

These apparent traits determine. to a large extent. how other people will behave towards them. Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to perform automated personality attribution (eg. job interviews). It is important that we understand the driving factors behind the predictions. in humans and in deep neural networks. This paper explicitly studies the effect of the image background on apparent personality prediction while addressing two important confounds present in existing literature; overlapping data splits and including facial information in the background.

Ras,,,,,,In an existing particle filter tracking system at Thales Research & Technology it is required for a deep neural network to perform person re-identification on image pairs. maximizing the TPR and minimizing the FPR. in a situation where we have a relatively small gallery size. Current available literature on the use of deep learning in person re-identification focus on improving large dataset benchmarks with large gallery sizes. while improving the CMC ranking on individual benchmarks using very deep neural networks. While CMC ranking is a good test of the discriminative ability of a network. not much is known about the TPR and FPR performance of smaller deep neural networks in situations with small gallery sizes. In this study we found that as the gallery size increases. the ranking performance of the network goes down while the TPR and FPR remain similar. We show that a relatively small neural network can achieve similar performance on benchmark as very deep neural network. assuming that the gallery is small enough (≤300 IDs). We achieve a performance of 50% on ViPER. 56% on PRID450 and 21% on Market1501.

On one hand. these models require accurate data. which would have an immense impact on public health. On the other hand. results from these models could compromise the privacy of an individual’s health status even without directly using health data. In addition. privacy could also be affected if systems hosting these models are compromised through security breaches. Students ought to be trained in evaluating the effectiveness of different protocols in ensuring privacy while providing useful data to the models. There is a lacuna in current cybersecurity education in training students in the context of both the above types of mobile health applications. The objective of this paper is to describe novel educational material to augment current cybersecurity courses for undergraduate and graduate students. We develop material to teach about fundamental concepts and issues related to security and privacy in mobile health applications and describe a cloud-based hands-on lab that lets students explore the consequences of different solution strategies.

This raises the needs to incorporate new features for detecting novel phish websites and optimizing the existing anti-phishing techniques. In this light. 58 new hybrid features were proposed in this paper and their prediction susceptibilities were evaluated by using feature co-occurrence criterion and a baseline machine learning algorithm. Empirical test and analysis showed the significant outcomes of the proposed features on detection performance.

Hence. researchers have developed anti-ransomware tools to assist the Windows platform at thwarting ransomware attacks. protecting the information. preserving the users’ privacy. and securing the inter-related information systems through the Internet. Furthermore. they utilized machine learning to devote useful anti-ransomware tools that detect sophisticated versions. However. such anti-ransomware tools remain sub-optimal in efficacy. partial to analyzing ransomware traits. inactive to learn significant and imbalanced data streams. limited to attributing the versions’ ancestor families. and indecisive about fusing the multi-descent versions. In this paper. we propose a hybrid machine learner model. which is a multi-tiered streaming analytics model that classifies various ransomware versions of 14 families by learning 24 static and dynamic traits. The proposed model classifies ransomware versions to their ancestor families numerally and fuses those of multi-descent families statistically. Thus. it classifies ransomware versions among 40K corpora of ransomware. malware. and good-ware versions through both semi-realistic and realistic environments. The supremacy of this ransomware streaming analytics model among competitive anti-ransomware technologies is proven experimentally and justified critically with the average of 97% classification accuracy. 2.4% mistake rate. and 0.34% miss rate under comparative and realistic test.,True,_JuUBVkAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/9/3210/htm,16000154906296551619,/scholar?cites=16000154906296551619,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/9/3210/htm,0,0,0

These all rely on fidelity and speed of detection and delineation algorithm. Despite intensive research. segmentation has remained a challenging problem due to the diverse image content. resolution. shape. and noise. This paper presents a fast positron emission tomography tumor segmentation method using superpixels. Principal component analysis is applied on the superpixels and their average value. The distance vector of each superpixel from the average is computed in the principal components coordinate system. Finally. k-means clustering is applied on the distance vector to recognize tumor and non-tumor superpixels. The proposed approach is implemented in MATLAB 2016A. and promising accuracy with execution time of 2.35±0.26 s is achieved.

Previously. to perform a 3D reconstruction. specialized hardwares were required. Such systems were often very expensive and was only available for industrial or research purpose. With the rise of the availability of high-quality low cost 3D sensors. it is now possible to design inexpensive complete 3D scanning systems. The objective of this work was to design an acquisition and processing system that can perform 3D scanning and reconstruction of objects seamlessly. In addition. the goal of this work also included making the 3D scanning process fully automated by building and integrating a turntable alongside the software. This means the user can perform a full 3D scan only by a press of a few buttons from our dedicated graphical user interface. Three main steps were followed to go from acquisition of point clouds to the finished reconstructed 3D model. First. our system acquires point cloud data of a person/object using inexpensive camera sensor. Second. align and convert the acquired point cloud data into a watertight mesh of good quality. Third. export the reconstructed model to a 3D printer to obtain a proper 3D print of the model.,True,imbYFrcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02247,9126183682810722579,/scholar?cites=9126183682810722579,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02247,0,0,0

One of the essential aspects that interests researchers is how to estimate the quality of transmitted voice over VoIP for several purposes such as design and technical issues. Two methodologies are used to evaluate the voice. which are subjective and objective methods. In this study. the authors propose a non-intrusive machine learning-based (NIML) objective method to estimate the quality of voice. In particular. they build a training set of parameters – from the network and the voice itself – along with the quality of voices as labels. The voice quality is estimated using the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) method as an intrusive algorithm.

This paper deals with utilizing thermal-infrared cameras. as opposed to conventional cameras as the primary sensor to capture images of the robot's surroundings. For localization. the images need to be further processed before feeding them to a navigational system. The main motivation of this paper was to develop an edge detection methodology capable of utilizing the low-SNR poor output from such a thermal camera and effectively detect smooth edges of the surrounding environment. The enhanced edge detector proposed in this paper takes the raw image from the thermal sensor. denoises the images. applies Canny edge detection followed by CSS method. The edges are ranked to remove any noise and only edges of the highest rank are kept. Then. the broken edges are linked by computing edge metrics and a smooth edge of the surrounding is displayed in a binary image.

Two-photon microscopy enables imaging deeper into tissue using near-infrared light. The use of image analysis and computer vision tools to detect and extract information from the images is still challenging due to the degraded microscopy volumes by blurring and noise during the image acquisition and the complexity of subcellular structures presented in the volumes. In this thesis we describe methods for segmentation and detection of fluorescence microscopy images in 3D. We segment tubule boundaries by distinguishing them from other structures using three dimensional steerable filters. These filters can capture strong directional tendencies of the voxels on a tubule boundary. We also describe multiple three dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to segment nuclei. Training the CNNs usually require a large set of labeled images which is extremely difficult to obtain in biomedical images. We describe methods to generate synthetic microscopy volumes and to train our 3D CNNs using these synthetic volumes without using any real ground truth volumes. The locations and sizes of the nuclei are detected using of our CNNs. known as the Sphere Estimation Network.

1284408,Localization recall precision (LRP): A new performance metric for object detection,2018,Kemal Oksuz and Baris Can Cam and Emre Akbas and Sinan Kalkan,,,,504-519,,"Average precision (AP). the area under the recall-precision (RP) curve. is the standard performance measure for object detection. Despite its wide acceptance. it has a number of shortcomings. the most important of which are (i) the inability to distinguish very different RP curves. and (ii) the lack of directly measuring bounding box localization accuracy. In this paper. we propose"" Localization Recall Precision (LRP) Error"". a new metric specifically designed for object detection. LRP Error is composed of three components related to localization. false negative (FN) rate and false positive (FP) rate. Based on LRP. we introduce the"" Optimal LRP""(oLRP). the minimum achievable LRP error representing the best achievable configuration of the detector in terms of recall-precision and the tightness of the boxes. In contrast to AP. which considers precisions over the entire recall domain. oLRP determines the"" best"" confidence score threshold for a class. which balances the trade-off between localization and recall-precision. In our experiments. we show that oLRP provides richer and more discriminative information than AP. We also demonstrate that the best confidence score thresholds vary significantly among classes and detectors. Moreover. we present LRP results of a simple online video object detector and show that the class-specific optimized thresholds increase the accuracy against the common approach of using a general threshold for all classes. Our experiments demonstrate that LRP is more competent than AP in capturing the performance of detectors.

1284409,Generating positive bounding boxes for balanced training of object detectors,2020,Kemal Oksuz and Baris Can Cam and Emre Akbas and Sinan Kalkan,,,,894-903,,Two-stage deep object detectors generate a set of regions-of-interest (RoIs) in the first stage. then. in the second stage. identify objects among the proposed RoIs that sufficiently overlap with a ground truth (GT) box. The second stage is known to suffer from a bias towards RoIs that have low intersection-over-union (IoU) with the associated GT boxes. To address this issue. we first propose a sampling method to generate bounding boxes (BB) that overlap with a given reference box more than a given IoU threshold. Then. we use this BB generation method to develop a positive RoI (pRoI) generator that. for the second stage. produces RoIs following any desired spatial or IoU distribution. We show that our pRoI generator is able to simulate other sampling methods for positive examples such as hard example mining and prime sampling. Using our generator as an analysis tool. we show that (i) IoU imbalance has an adverse effect on performance.(ii) hard positive example mining improves the performance only for certain input IoU distributions. and (iii) the imbalance among the foreground classes has an adverse effect on performance and that it can be alleviated at the batch level. Finally. we train Faster R-CNN using our pRoI generator and. compared to conventional training. obtain better or on-par performance for low IoUs and significant improvements when trained for higher IoUs for Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets.

Average Precision (AP) is limited in (i) including localisation quality.(ii) interpretability and (iii) applicability to outputs without confidence scores. Panoptic Quality (PQ). a measure proposed for evaluating panoptic segmentation (Kirillov et al.. 2019). does not suffer from these limitations but is limited to panoptic segmentation. In this paper. we propose Localisation Recall Precision (LRP) Error as the performance measure for all visual detection tasks. LRP Error. initially proposed only for object detection by Oksuz et al.(2018). does not suffer from the aforementioned limitations and is applicable to all visual detection tasks. We also introduce Optimal LRP (oLRP) Error as the minimum LRP error obtained over confidence scores to evaluate visual detectors and obtain optimal thresholds for deployment. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of LRP with AP and PQ. and use 35 state-of-the-art visual detectors from four common visual detection tasks (ie object detection. keypoint detection. instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation) to empirically show that LRP provides richer and more discriminative information than its counterparts.

New York. NY 10001. USA India,This paper gives an overview of some classical Growing Neural Networks (GNN) using soft competitive learning. In soft competitive learning each input signal is characterized by adapting in addition to the winner also some other neurons of the network. The GNN is also called the ANN with incremental learning. The artificial neural networks (ANN) mapping capability depends on the number of layers and the number of hidden layers in the structure of ANN. There is no formal way of computing network structure. Network structure is usually selected by trial-and-error method but it is time consuming process. Basically. we make use of two mechanisms that may modify the structure of the network: growth and pruning. In this paper. the competitive learning is firstly introduced; secondly the SOM topology and limitations of SOM are illustrated.

With the view point that the fog computing paradigm will be the future of computing technology. we look at its strong characteristics and propose a novel approach to enable a new kind of service called Offload As A Service (OaaS). Offload computation has been an active research area for many years and provides the capability to extend mobile resources limitations in terms of CPU. GPU. memory. storage and battery energy. Fog computing paradigm is a good synergy for offload computation technology with its low delay and close proximity features …,True,wcrHL0EAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00607-017-0551-z,18025345769971050104,/scholar?cites=18025345769971050104,,,http://networking.khu.ac.kr/gallery/entry/layouts/net/publications/data/2017)OaaS%20offload%20as%20a%20service%20in%20fog%20networks.pdf,0,0,0
1284449,Toward service selection game in a heterogeneous market cloud computing,2015,Cuong T Do and Nguyen H Tran and Chuan Pham and Md Golam Rabiul Alam and Choong Seon Hong,,,,44-52,IEEE,We take the first step to study the price competition in a heterogeneous market cloud computing formed by public provider and cloud broker. all of which are also known as cloud service providers. We formulate a price competition between cloud broker and public provider as a two-stage non-cooperative game. In stage one. where cloud service providers set their service prices to maximize their revenue. we use the Nash equilibrium concept to study the equilibria for the price setting game. Cloud users can select the services (from the cloud broker or public provider) that provide them the best payoff in terms of performance (i.e.. delay) and price. To that end. cloud users can adapt their service selection behavior by observing the variations in price and quality of service offered by the different cloud service providers. For the service selection game of cloud users in stage two. we use the evolutionary game model to …,True,wcrHL0EAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,11,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7140275/,11099148005609683088,/scholar?cites=11099148005609683088,,,http://networking.khu.ac.kr/gallery/entry/document_srl/138/page/layouts/net/publications/data/Toward%20Service%20Selection%20Game%20in%20a%20Heterogeneous%20Market%20Cloud%20Computing.pdf,0,0,0

However. mobile devices join and leave cloud services more frequently than traditional computers. which causes energy inefficiency in a cloud data center. Waste. in the form of energy and cooling requirements. particularly occurs when a mobile device disconnects from a service. but the cloud servers. known as virtual machines (VMs). continue running. The VMs should transition to lower-power states instead remaining active. However. transition to a lower-power state causes a service delay when users reconnect to the service because VMs in a lower-power state are not ready to serve. Therefore. an efficient energy policy must not only maximize energy savings but also minimize service delays. In this paper. we propose two approaches to energy efficiency: an Instant Energy Policy (IEP) that can …,True,wcrHL0EAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,9,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002002551500122X,13756602531192604040,/scholar?cites=13756602531192604040,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46701953/Prediction-Based_Energy_Policy_for_Mobil20160622-9736-1dbp1vl.pdf,0,0,0

Effective power consumption control can improve significantly benefit for providers. In this paper. we derive from CloudNFV architecture. an open platform for implementing Network Functions Virtualization based on cloud computing and Software Defined Networking. to obtain an optimal power control strategy toward reducing CO 2  emissions and maximize total utility of active resources. We propose a consolidation function for determining the On/Off strategy of each server and use live migration method to rearrange virtual machines in active resource components.

Despite complexities of i) the couplings between pricing. load balancing and SUs' spectrum access decision. and ii) the heterogeneity of primary users' traffic and SUs types. we propose to solve the joint load balancing and pricing problem to maximize operator' revenue in a monopoly market. In this market. we first show there exists a unique SUs' equilibrium arrival rate to the monopolist's channels. and then we show that the joint problem can be solved efficiently by exploiting its convex structure. We next propose a low-complexity algorithm that enable the operator to maximize its revenue.,True,wcrHL0EAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,7,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7036945/,6936565131021324976,/scholar?cites=6936565131021324976,,,http://networking.khu.ac.kr/gallery/entry/layouts/net/publications/data/Load%20Balancing%20and%20Pricing%20for%20Spectrum%20Access%20Control%20in%20Cognitive%20Radio%20Networks.pdf,0,0,0
1284453,Deep autoencoder for recommender systems: parameter influence analysis,2018,Dai Hoang Tran and Zawar Hussain and Wei Emma Zhang and Nguyen Lu Dang Khoa and Nguyen H Tran and Quan Z Sheng,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.00415,,,,Recommender systems have recently attracted many researchers in the deep learning community. The state-of-the-art deep neural network models used in recommender systems are typically multilayer perceptron and deep Autoencoder (DAE). among which DAE usually shows better performance due to its superior capability to reconstruct the inputs. However. we found existing DAE recommendation systems that have similar implementations on similar datasets result in vastly different parameter settings. In this work. we have built a flexible DAE model. named FlexEncoder that uses configurable parameters and unique features to analyse the parameter influences on the prediction accuracy of recommender systems. This will help us identify the best-performance parameters given a dataset. Extensive evaluation on the MovieLens datasets are conducted. which drives our conclusions on the influences of DAE parameters. Specifically. we find that DAE parameters strongly affect the prediction accuracy of the recommender systems. and the effect is transferable to similar datasets in a larger size. We open our code to public which could benefit both new users for DAE--they can quickly understand how DAE works for recommendation systems. and experienced DAE users--it easier for them to tune the parameters on different datasets.,True,wcrHL0EAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00415,6249180989079112841,/scholar?cites=6249180989079112841,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00415,0,0,0

It is based on an efficient audio feature matching system which exploits the reciprocal nearest neighbors to produce a per-match similarity score. Temporal consistency is taken into account based on the audio matches. and boundary estimation allows the precise localization of the matching segments. The method is mainly intended for video retrieval based on their audio track. as typically evaluated in the copy detection task of TRECVID evaluation campaigns. The evaluation conducted on music retrieval shows that our system is comparable to a reference audio fingerprinting system for music retrieval. and significantly outperforms it on audio-based video retrieval. as shown by our experiments conducted on the dataset used in the copy detection task of TRECVID'2010 campaign.,True,-eG_3GgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,22,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6288391/,16493386756117233067,/scholar?cites=16493386756117233067,,,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00661581/file/babaz.pdf,0,0,0

We have developed a segmentation algorithm for finding tattoos in an image. Our basic idea is split-merge: split each tattoo image into clusters through a bottom-up process. learn to merge the clusters containing skin and then distinguish tattoo from the other skin via top-down prior in the image itself. Tattoo segmentation with unknown number of clusters is transferred to a figureground segmentation. We have applied our segmentation algorithm on a tattoo dataset and the results have shown that our tattoo segmentation system is efficient and suitable for further tattoo classification and retrieval purpose.,True,-eG_3GgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,18,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8063/80630L/Unsupervised-tattoo-segmentation-combining-bottom-up-and-top-down-cues/10.1117/12.884368.short,17384472922854507869,/scholar?cites=17384472922854507869,,,http://ww2.cs.fsu.edu/~nzhao/publication/nzhao2011spie.pdf,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,Duplicates or near-duplicates mining in video sequences is of broad interest to many multimedia applications. How to design an effective and scalable system. however. is still a challenge to the community. In this paper. we present a method to detect recurrent sequences in large-scale TV streams in an unsupervised manner and with little a priori knowledge on the content. The method relies on a product k-means quantizer that efficiently produces hash keys adapted to the data distribution for frame descriptors. This hashing technique combined with a temporal consistency check allows the detection of meaningful repetitions in TV streams. When considering all frames (about 47 millions) of a 22-day long TV broadcast. our system detects all repetitions in 15 minutes. excluding the computation of the frame descriptors. Experimental results show that our approach is a promising way to deal with very large …,True,-eG_3GgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,11,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33863-2_27,16073072262137352906,/scholar?cites=16073072262137352906,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-33863-2_27.pdf,0,0,0
1284826,Product tree quantization for approximate nearest neighbor search,2015,Jiangbo Yuan and Xiuwen Liu,,,,2035-2039,IEEE,The product quantization (PQ) performance degrades on read-world data due to the severity of dependence between feature groups. Meanwhile. tree structured vector quantization (TSVQ) often supply lower distortion than other structured vector quantizers; yet it is prohibitive to learning compact codes like PQ does considering its codebook storage. In this paper. we propose a hybrid model dubbed as product tree quantization (PTQ) that aims to relax the PQ constraints while to retain the tree-structured codebooks with reasonable size. We first show that our methods can achieve significantly better quantization performance on several large scale benchmarks. We then demonstrate the advantage for very large scale ANN search; for instance. on a 1-billion scale dataset. we have achieved on average 4% improvement in accuracy than the existing state of the art methods.,True,-eG_3GgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,10,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7351158/,18209307804926232906,/scholar?cites=18209307804926232906,,,,0,0,0

As the K-means algorithm is exponential both in computation and storage in terms of required bits to encode cluster centers. approaches with low computation and storage complexity have been actively studied both for signal compression under real-time constraints and for clustering of large scale high-dimensional datasets. By generating cluster centers via Cartesian products of cluster centers in multiple groups or multiple stages. product and residual K-means trees reduce computation and storage complexity. making it possible to cluster large scale datasets.

The proposed Embedded k-Means algorithm is a two-level clustered index structure which consists of two groups of centroids; additionally. an inverted file is used for recording of the assignments. The coarse-to-fine structure achieves high search efficiency using multi-assignment operations on the coarse level. At the query stage. pruning strategies are utilized to balance the trade-off between search qualities and speeds. Our algorithm is able to explore the neighborhood space of a given query efficiently.

1284847,A robot visual homing model that traverses conjugate gradient TD to a variable λ TD and uses radial basis features,2011,Abdulrahman Altahhan,,"Advances in Reinforcement Learning, A. Mellouk, Ed. Vienna: InTech Education and Publishing",,225-254,,The term ‘homing’refers to the ability of an agent–either animal or robot-to find a known goal location. It is often used in the context of animal behaviour. for example when a bird or mammal returns ‘home’after foraging for food. or when a bee returns to its hive. Visual homing. as the expression suggests. is the act of finding a home location using vision. Generally it is performed by comparing the image currently in view with ‘snapshot’images of the home stored in the memory of the agent. A movement decision is then taken to try and match the current and snapshot images (Nehmzow 2000). A skill that plays a critical role in achieving robot autonomy is the ability to learn to operate in previously unknown environments (Arkin 1998; Murphy 2000; Nehmzow 2000). Furthermore. learning to home in unknown environments is a particularly desirable capability. If the process was automated and straightforward to apply. it could be used to enable a robot to reach any location in any environment. and potentially replace many existing computationally intensive homing and navigation algorithms. Numerous models have been proposed in the literature to allow mobile robots to navigate and home in a wide range of environments. Some focus on learning (Kaelbling. Littman et al. 1998; Nehmzow 2000; Asadpour and Siegwart 2004; Szenher 2005; Vardy and Moller 2005). whilst others focus on the successful application of a model or algorithm for a specific environment and ignore the learning problem (Simmons and Koenig 1995; Thrun 2000.; Tomatis.

1284848,Robot visual homing using conjugate gradient temporal difference learning. radial basis features and a whole image measure,2010,Abdulrahman Altahhan,,,,1-10,IEEE,This work describes a robot visual homing model that employs. for the first time. the conjugate gradient Temporal Difference (TD-conj) method. TD-conj was proved to be equivalent to a gradient TD method with a variable λ. denoted as (TD(λ t (conj) )). when both are used with function approximation techniques. This fact is employed in the model to improve its performance. Based on visual input that is passed through radial basis layer. the model takes advantage of the model-free interactive-learning capability of reinforcement learning (RL) by using a whole image measure to recognize the goal. without the aid of special landmarks. Therefore. unlike other models. this model refrains from artificially manipulating the environment or assuming a priori knowledge about it. two typical constraints that widely restrict the applicability of existing models in realistic scenarios.

1284849,Td (0)-replay: An efficient model-free planning with full replay,2018,Abdulrahman Altahhan,,,,1-7,IEEE,In this paper we present a novel reinforcement learning method that allows for full replay of all past experience in every step of a reinforcement learning agent life with reasonable overhead. In particular. we show how to deduce an efficient equivalent backward view by replaying the full past experience online using TD(0) error for a linear model. We call the resultant methods TD(0)-Replay and Sarsa(0)-Replan. respectively. We emphasise the already established link between replaying and planning in our algorithm design by comparing it with an Extensive Dyna Planning algorithm. where we show that our method can outperform this expensive form of planning methods. We test the new methods on two different domain problems; Random Walk to test TD(0)-Replay prediction capabilities and Dyna Maze to test Sarsa(0)-Replan planning capabilities where we show that our algorithms dominate other replaying and …,True,fdJzeY0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8489300/,18073754807672394914,/scholar?cites=18073754807672394914,,,http://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/4849/1/TDReplay%20IJCNN%2018%204.pdf,0,0,0
1284850,Manifold locality constrained low-rank representation and its applications,2016,Cong-Zhe You and Xiao-Jun Wu and Vasile Palade and Abdulrahman Altahhan,,,,3264-3271,IEEE,Low-rank representation (LRR) and its variations have recently attracted a great deal of attention because of its effectiveness in exploring low-dimensional subspace structures embedded in data. LRR-related algorithms have many applications in computer vision. signal processing. semi-supervised learning and pattern recognition. However. most of the existing LRR methods fail to take into account the non-linear geometric structures within data. thus the locality and the similarity information among data may be missing in the learning process. which have been shown to be beneficial for discriminative tasks. To improve LRR in this regard. we propose a manifold locality constrained low-rank representation framework (MLCLRR) for data representation. By taking the local manifold structure of the data into consideration. the proposed MLCLRR method not only can represent the global low-dimensional structures. but …,True,fdJzeY0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7727616/,1111257544920407260,/scholar?cites=1111257544920407260,,,,0,0,0
1284851,Deep feature-action processing with mixture of updates,2015,Abdulrahman Altahhan,,,,1-10,Springer. Cham,This paper explores the possibility of combining an actor and critic in one architecture and uses a mixture of updates to train them. It describes a model for robot navigation that uses architecture similar to an actor-critic reinforcement learning architecture. It sets up the actor as a layer seconded by another layer which deduce the value function. Therefore. the effect is to have similar to a critic outcome combined with the actor in one network. The model hence can be used as the base for a truly deep reinforcement learning architecture that can be explored in the future. More importantly this work explores the results of mixing conjugate gradient update with gradient update for the mentioned architecture. The reward signal is back propagated from the critic to the actor through conjugate gradient eligibility trace for the second layer combined with gradient eligibility trace for the first layer. We show that this mixture …,True,fdJzeY0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,3,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-26561-2_1,17370095615976387893,/scholar?cites=17370095615976387893,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdulrahman_Altahhan/publication/282007052_Deep_Feature-Action_Processing_with_Mixture_of_Updates/links/5601348308aeba1d9f84f0b4.pdf,0,0,0
1284852,Navigating a robot through big visual sensory data,2015,Abdulrahman Altahhan,53,Procedia Computer Science,,478-485,Elsevier,This paper describes a reinforcement learning architecture that is capable of incorporating deeply learned feature representation of a robot's unknown working environment. An autoencoder is used along with convolutional and pooling layers to deduce the reduced feature representation based on a set of images taken by the agent. This representation is used to discover and learn the best route to navigate to a goal. The features are fed to an actor layer that can learn from a value function calculated by a second output layer. The policy is ɛ-greedy and the effect is similar to actor-critic architecture where temporal difference error is back propagated from the critic to the actor. This compact architecture helps in reducing the overhead of setting up a desired fully fledged actor-critic architecture that typically needs extra processing time. Hence. the model is ideal for dealing with lots of data coming from visual sensor that …,True,fdJzeY0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915018281,3103196101473363344,/scholar?cites=3103196101473363344,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915018281/pdf?md5=bc4708cc92075bcdad99cb5b67264799&pid=1-s2.0-S1877050915018281-main.pdf&_valck=1,0,0,0
