45526,A greedy algorithm for aligning DNA sequences,2000,Zheng Zhang and Scott Schwartz and Lukas Wagner and Webb Miller,7,Journal of Computational biology,1-2,203-214,Mary Ann Liebert. Inc.,For aligning DNA sequences that differ only by sequencing errors. or by equivalent errors from other sources. a greedy algorithm can be much faster than traditional dynamic programming approaches and yet          produce an alignment that is guaranteed to be theoretically optimal. We introduce a new greedy alignment algorithm with particularly good performance and show that it computes the same alignment as does          a certain dynamic programming algorithm. while executing over 10 times faster on appropriate data. An implementation of this algorithm is currently used in a program that assembles the UniGene database          at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.      ,True,7lp2ziEAAAAJ:o4Qvs5Y5TLQC,4525,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10665270050081478,1831082504589366451,/scholar?cites=1831082504589366451,,http://www.alliot.org/BIO/PDF/10665270050081478.pdf,0

Here. we found that bacteria produce diverse D-amino acids as well. which accumulate at millimolar concentrations in supernatants of stationary phase cultures. In Vibrio cholerae. a dedicated racemase produced D-Met and D-Leu. whereas Bacillus subtilis generated D-Tyr and D-Phe. These unusual D-amino acids appear to modulate synthesis of peptidoglycan. a strong and elastic polymer that serves as the stress-bearing component of the bacterial cell wall. D-Amino acids influenced peptidoglycan composition. amount. and strength. both by means of their incorporation into the polymer and by regulating enzymes that synthesize and modify it.

45586,The evolution of gene collectives: How natural selection drives chemical innovation,2008,Michael A Fischbach and Christopher T Walsh and Jon Clardy,105,,12,4601-4608,National Academy of Sciences,DNA sequencing has become central to the study of evolution. Comparing the sequences of individual genes from a variety of organisms has revolutionized our understanding of how single genes evolve. but the challenge of analyzing polygenic phenotypes has complicated efforts to study how genes evolve when they are part of a group that functions collectively. We suggest that biosynthetic gene clusters from microbes are ideal candidates for the evolutionary study of gene collectives; these selfish genetic elements evolve rapidly. they usually comprise a complete pathway. and they have a phenotype—a small molecule—that is easy to identify and assay. Because these elements are transferred horizontally as well as vertically. they also provide an opportunity to study the effects of horizontal transmission on gene evolution.

Caenorhabditis elegans secretes a mixture of small molecules (collectively termed dauer pheromone) that regulates entry into the alternate dauer larval stage and also modulates adult behavior via as yet unknown receptors. Here. we identify two heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate dauer formation in response to a subset of dauer pheromone components.

In one of the closest living relatives of animals. the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. we find that rosette colony development is induced by the prey bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis and its close relatives in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Here we show that a rosette inducing factor (RIF-1) produced by A. machipongonensis belongs to the small class of sulfonolipids. obscure relatives of the better known sphingolipids that play important roles in signal transmission in plants. animals. and fungi. RIF-1 has extraordinary potency (femtomolar. or 10−15 M) and S. rosetta can respond to it over a broad dynamic range—nine orders of magnitude.

To deepen our understanding of TRP channel physiology. we require more diverse pharmacological tools. Citral. a bioactive component of lemongrass. is commonly used as a taste enhancer. as an odorant in perfumes. and as an insect repellent. Here we report that citral activates TRP channels found in sensory neurons (TRPV1 and TRPV3. TRPM8. and TRPA1). and produces long-lasting inhibition of TRPV1–3 and TRPM8. while transiently blocking TRPV4 and TRPA1. Sustained citral inhibition is independent of internal calcium concentration. but is state-dependent. developing only after TRP channel opening. Citral's actions as a partial agonist are not due to cysteine modification of the channels nor are they a consequence of citral's stereoisoforms. The isolated aldehyde and alcohol cis and trans enantiomers (neral. nerol. geranial. and geraniol) each reproduce citral's actions. In juvenile rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. prolonged citral inhibition of native TRPV1 channels enabled the separation of TRPV2 and TRPV3 currents. We find that TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels are present in a high proportion of these neurons (94% respond to 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate). consistent with our immunolabeling experiments and previous in situ hybridization studies. The TRPV1 activation requires residues in transmembrane segments two through four of the voltage-sensor domain. a region previously implicated in capsaicin activation of TRPV1 and analogous menthol activation of TRPM8.

Recent studies indicate that one potentially rich source of novel natural products is Actinobacterial symbionts associated with social and solitary Hymenoptera. Here we test this possibility by examining two species of solitary mud dauber wasps. Sceliphron caementarium and Chalybion californicum. We performed enrichment isolations from 33 wasps and obtained more than 200 isolates of Streptomyces Actinobacteria. Chemical analyses of 15 of these isolates identified 11 distinct and structurally diverse secondary metabolites. including a novel polyunsaturated and polyoxygenated macrocyclic lactam. which we name sceliphrolactam. By pairing the 15 Streptomyces strains against a collection of fungi and bacteria. we document their antifungal and antibacterial activity. The prevalence and anti-microbial properties of Actinobacteria associated with these two solitary wasp species suggest the potential role of these Streptomyces as antibiotic-producing symbionts. potentially helping defend their wasp hosts from pathogenic microbes.

Objective: In this study we investigated the activation of the AKT pathway and its downstream effectors. glycogen synthase kinase-3b and Forkhead box O (FOXO)-1 by progesterone as a mechanism of proliferation and survival of leiomyoma cells. Inhibitors of the AKT pathway were used to demonstrate the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. AKT. and FOXO1 in contributing to cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results: Treatment of leiomyoma cells with R5020 over a period of 72 h resulted in higher cell numbers compared with untreated cells. When cells were treated with 100 nm R5020 for 1 and 24 h. the levels of phospho (Ser 473)-AKT increased. This increase was inhibited when cells were cotreated with RU486.

The work by Schoch et al.(1) stated that “the proposal will satisfy most fungal biologists but not all”(1).I am among those biologists who are not so satisfied and not really surprised either. because ITS has been the most widely used marker for species identifications in mycology since the development of the first universal primers to amplify this DNA region in fungi. Its use as an unofficial fungal species barcode has also been criticized (2). It was also criticized because of its limits. including intraspecific variation. This aspect was discussed in the work by Schoch et al.(1) from different perspectives except one: the methodological dimension of revealing intraspecific variation in the ITS region.

Bacteria are not considered among the major factors influencing coccolithophore physiology. Here we show through a laboratory model system that the bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens. a well-studied member of the Roseobacter group. intimately interacts with E. huxleyi. While attached to the algal cell. bacteria initially promote algal growth but ultimately kill their algal host. Both algal growth enhancement and algal death are driven by the bacterially-produced phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Bacterial production of indole-3-acetic acid and attachment to algae are significantly increased by tryptophan. which is exuded from the algal cell. Algal death triggered by bacteria involves activation of pathways unique to oxidative stress response and programmed cell death. Our observations suggest that bacteria greatly influence the physiology and metabolism of E. huxleyi. Coccolithophore-bacteria interactions should be further studied in the environment to determine whether they impact micro-algal population dynamics on a global scale.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17473.001,True,7lp2ziEAAAAJ:2u1QkWOsl3MC,107,https://elifesciences.org/articles/17473,10534362972377167794,/scholar?cites=10534362972377167794,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/17473.pdf,0

Here we use the pyro-sequencing of PCR amplicons derived from both nonribosomal peptide adenylation domains and polyketide ketosynthase domains to compare biosynthetic diversity in soil microbiomes from around the globe. We see large differences in domain populations from all except the most proximal and biome-similar samples. suggesting that most microbiomes will encode largely distinct collections of bacterial secondary metabolites. Our data indicate a correlation between two factors. geographic distance and biome-type. and the biosynthetic diversity found in soil environments. By assigning reads to known gene clusters we identify hotspots of biomedically relevant biosynthetic diversity.

This PBP-receptor system strongly discriminates between ligands with subtle structural differences. but it has proved difficult to distinguish the degree of discrimination of the PBP from that of the G protein-coupled receptor. The three-dimensional structures of the PBP of Bombyx mori. the silkworm moth. both with and without its cognate ligand bombykol ([E.Z]-10.12-hexadecadienol). have been determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR.

Most of its structure has been defined by spectroscopic and degradative studies. but the configurations of several stereochemical centers are unknown. and its mode of inhibition of serine proteinases is not understood.

45803,Catecholate siderophores protect bacteria from pyochelin toxicity,2012,Conrado Adler and Natalia S Corbalán and Mohammad R Seyedsayamdost and María Fernanda Pomares and Ricardo E de Cristóbal and Jon Clardy and Roberto Kolter and Paula A Vincent,7,PloS one,10,e46754,Public Library of Science,Background Bacteria produce small molecule iron chelators. known as siderophores. to facilitate the acquisition of iron from the environment. The synthesis of more than one siderophore and the production of multiple siderophore uptake systems by a single bacterial species are common place. The selective advantages conferred by the multiplicity of siderophore synthesis remains poorly understood. However. there is growing evidence suggesting that siderophores may have other physiological roles besides their involvement in iron acquisition.   Methods and Principal Findings Here we provide the first report that pyochelin displays antibiotic activity against some bacterial strains. Observation of differential sensitivity to pyochelin against a panel of bacteria provided the first indications that catecholate siderophores. produced by some bacteria. may have roles other than iron acquisition. A pattern emerged where only those strains able to make catecholate-type siderophores were resistant to pyochelin. We were able to associate pyochelin resistance to catecholate production by showing that pyochelin-resistant Escherichia coli became sensitive when biosynthesis of its catecholate siderophore enterobactin was impaired. As expected. supplementation with enterobactin conferred pyochelin resistance to the entE mutant. We observed that pyochelin-induced growth inhibition was independent of iron availability and was prevented by addition of the reducing agent ascorbic acid or by anaerobic incubation. Addition of pyochelin to E. coli increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) while addition of ascorbic acid or enterobactin reduced …,True,7lp2ziEAAAAJ:ukw-9cB-YDkC,67,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046754,2375592744291526666,/scholar?cites=2375592744291526666,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046754,0

We show that a single mutational step is sufficient to turn a symbiotic bacterium from an inedible but host-beneficial secondary metabolite producer into a host food source. The bacteria’s host is a “farmer” clone of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum that carries and disperses bacteria during its spore stage. Associated with the farmer are two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens. only one of which serves as a food source. The other strain produces diffusible small molecules: pyrrolnitrin. a known antifungal agent. and a chromene that potently enhances the farmer’s spore production and depresses a nonfarmer’s spore production.

CTM enabled p53 to transactivate target genes. restored MDM2 negative regulation. and selectively inhibited the growth of cancer cells harboring mutant p53 R175H in vitro and in vivo.

The real pathogenic agent is a bacterium. Erwinia amyloVora. that colonizes the external surfaces of the plants’ flowers. buds. and leaves. A closely related bacterium. E. herbicola (syn. Pantoea agglomerans). also colonizes the same plant surfaces1-3 and produces antibiotics that effectively control E. amyloVora. 4. 5 E. herbicola has been studied as a biological control agent for E. amyloVora in orchards where trees are currently treated with copper compounds or streptomycin. 2. 6-10 Establishing the molecular nature of the E. herbicola antibiotics has been hampered by a complex biosynthetic pattern in which a single strain of E. herbicola produces multiple antibiotics. and different strains produce different multiple antibiotic complexes. Most of the antibiotics seem to share a common feature: antibiotic activity can be suppressed by the addition of an amino acid to the test medium. 11-13 The complexity of the E. herbicola antibiotics is not known since the only characterization available is the pattern of amino acids that suppress antibiotic activity. As a first step. we elected to decipher the molecular structure and genetics of one antibiotic using an approach based on cloning and heterologously expressing individual biosynthetic pathways.

Parasites retain a heme biosynthesis pathway but do not require its activity during infection of heme-rich erythrocytes. where they can scavenge host heme to meet metabolic needs. Nevertheless. heme biosynthesis in parasite-infected erythrocytes can be potently stimulated by exogenous 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). resulting in accumulation of the phototoxic intermediate protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Here we use photodynamic imaging. mass spectrometry. parasite gene disruption. and chemical probes to reveal that vestigial host enzymes in the cytoplasm of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes contribute to ALA-stimulated heme biosynthesis and that ALA uptake depends on parasite-established permeability pathways. We show that PPIX accumulation in infected erythrocytes can be harnessed for antimalarial chemotherapy using luminol-based chemiluminescence and combinatorial stimulation by low-dose artemisinin to photoactivate PPIX to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen. This photodynamic strategy has the advantage of exploiting host enzymes refractory to resistance-conferring mutations.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09143.001,True,7lp2ziEAAAAJ:OlbiQ0ttILcC,42,https://elifesciences.org/articles/09143,1419252714959550978,/scholar?cites=1419252714959550978,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/09143.pdf,0

Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [GAR+]. although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown.

This trait had the defining genetic properties of [GAR+]. and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source. Lactic acid also induced [GAR+]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from S. cerevisiae ~200 million years ago. and in which glucose repression evolved independently.

Recently. other condensation enzymes. such as the ATP-grasp ligases. have been recognized as important players in natural product biosynthesis. In this study. sequence based searching for homologues of DdaF. the ATP-grasp amide ligase from dapdiamide biosynthesis. led to the identification of a previously unannotated biosynthetic gene cluster in Pseudoalteromonas tunicata. Heterologous expression of the cluster in Escherichia coli allowed for the production and structure determination of two new 3-formyl tyrosine metabolites.,True,7lp2ziEAAAAJ:dAp6zn-oMfAC,32,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja9097862,15650137227557194616,/scholar?cites=15650137227557194616,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ja9097862,0
46051,FeeM. an N-acyl amino acid synthase from an uncultured soil microbe: structure. mechanism. and acyl carrier protein binding,2006,Ryan M Van Wagoner and Jon Clardy,14,Structure,9,1425-1435,Cell Press,Attempts to access antibiotics by capturing biosynthetic genes and pathways directly from environmental DNA. which is overwhelmingly derived from uncultured bacteria. have revealed a large and previously unknown family of N-acyl amino acid synthases (NASs). The structure of the NAS FeeM reveals structural similarity to the GCN5-related N-acyl transferases and acylhomoserine lactone synthases. The overall structure has a central β sheet with α helices on both sides. A bound product at a cleft in the β sheet identifies the active site and the structural basis for catalysis. and sequence conservation in this region indicates a bias for recognition over speed. FeeM interacts with an acyl carrier protein (FeeL). and the structure. mutagenesis. and enzymatic measurements reveal that a small hydrophobic pocket in α helix 5 dominates binding of FeeM to FeeL. The structural and mechanistic analyses suggest that the …,True,7lp2ziEAAAAJ:Zh0EY9V9P6UC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606003273,15362050784906212590,/scholar?cites=15362050784906212590,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212606003273,0
