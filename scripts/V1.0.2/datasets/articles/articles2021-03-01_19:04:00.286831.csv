Here. we investigate the biodistribution of radio-labelled SWNTs in mice by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET). ex vivo biodistribution and Raman spectroscopy. It is found that SWNTs that are functionalized with phospholipids bearing polyethylene-glycol (PEG) are surprisingly stable in vivo. The effect of PEG chain length on the biodistribution and circulation of the SWNTs is studied. Effectively PEGylated SWNTs exhibit relatively long blood circulation times and low uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES).

Significance of IVDs in the Clinic IVD test is a crucial component of clinical care that performs a diagnostic test on biological samples that have been taken from a living body. such as blood. urine. and tissue. 1 Such tests are usually performed to determine or confirm the presence of disease in an individual.“In vitro” literally means “within the glass”. which indicates that the test was historically conducted in glass test tubes. In contrast. in vivo tests. literally “within the living”. are conducted within a whole. living organism including human body. 2 IVD tests have received much public attention because of their distinct features in the medical profession.

For these larger proteins (> 10 kDa). conventional 2D NMR experiments such as COSY and HOHAHA/TOCSY yield spectra that typically exhibit extensive resonance overlap in the aliphatic region. Moreover. because for these slowly tumbling macromolecules the natural ‘H linewidth (1/rT2) is often significantly larger than many of the ‘H-‘H couplings. the sensitivity of these homonuclear J correlation experiments is relatively low. Isotopic labeling with 13C results in a significant decrease in the proton transverse relaxation time. T2. making homonuclear J correlation techniques even less sensitive. Therefore. separating the overlapping homonuclear ‘H COSY or HOHAHA spectra in a 3D experiment according to the chemical-shift frequencies of attached 13C nuclei (4. 5) is inefficient for macromolecules.

One approach. named 3D CCHTOCSY-REVINEPT (1)) starts with 13C magnetization which is transferred via isotropic mixing (6. 7) to other 13C spins within the same amino acid. followed by a reverse INEPT-type transfer (8. 9) to directly attached protons.

Alignment can be induced in a number of ways including the magnetic field itself4 or the use of a liquid crystalline medium. 5 In general. alignment arising from the former is very small and cannot be exploited on a routine basis. 2. 4 Moderate degrees of alignment. while retaining the resolution. sensitivity. and simplicity obtained in the isotropic phase. can be obtained by dissolving macromolecules in a very dilute liquid crystalline phase6 of lipid bicelles. 7 For biological macromolecules. the liquid crystalline medium must possess a number of key features; it has to be miscible with water. it should not bind to the macromolecule of interest. it should be stable at dilute concentrations over long periods of time. and it should only induce moderate degrees of alignment.

The molecular target of fumagillin is methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2). A 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of free and inhibited human MetAP-2 shows a covalent bond formed between a reactive epoxide of fumagillin and histidine-231 in the active site of MetAP-2. Extensive hydrophobic and water-mediated polar interactions with other parts of fumagillin provide additional affinity. Fumagillin-based drugs inhibit MetAP-2 but not MetAP-1. and the three-dimensional structure also indicates the likely determinants of this specificity.

For certain applications. such as molecularbased memory or logic circuitry. the devices are simply molecular-based analogues of devices with more conventional silicon-based circuitry. In those cases. molecular-electronics components may have the advantages of less manufacturing complexity. lower power consumption. and easier scaling. The field of molecular electronics is evolving rapidly. and even though there are no commercial applications as yet. the science coming out of this research is spectacular. Consider the circuits of nanowires shown in the electron micrograph in Figure 1 (Melosh et al.. 2003). The smallest (100-element) crossbar in this image is patterned at a density approaching 1012/cm2. and the wire diameter is approximately 8 nm. With species like boron or arsenic. at a doping level of 1018/cm3. a similar 8-nm diameter micrometer-long segment of silicon wires would have 20 to 30 dopant atoms; a junction of two crossed wires would contain approximately 0.1 to 0.2 dopant atoms. Thus. conventional field-effect transistors fabricated at these wiring densities might exhibit nonstatistical and perhaps unpredictable behavior.

J,,352,,Polyynes and grains (presumably carbonaceous) appear to be intimately associated in the circumstellar shells of late-type. carbon-rich stars such as IRC+ 10 216. These observations have prompted laboratory experiments which have shown that when graphite is vaporized and the resulting gaseous carbon species allowed to condense. long chain molecules (CC) invariably form at the same time as larger spheroidal carbon clusters (CC.) and macroscopic carbonaceous particles. When the condensation occurs in the presence of hydrogen and nitrogen the long chain cyanopolyynes. actually observed by radioastronomy in IRC+ 10 216 and interstellar clouds such as TMC 1. are readily produced.

For Ve > 350 Å3. the phase diagram is dominated by extended. low-dimensional structures that. at high pressures. compress into a two-dimensional foamlike phase.

In principle. the thermal conductivity κ and the electrical conductivity σ may be independently optimized in semiconducting nanostructures because different length scales are associated with phonons (which carry heat) and electric charges (which carry current). Phonons are scattered at surfaces and interfaces. so κ generally decreases as the surface-to-volume ratio increases. In contrast. σ is less sensitive to a decrease in nanostructure size. although at sufficiently small sizes it will degrade through the scattering of charge carriers at interfaces 4.

Two distinct photophysical regimes were found. The first applies to clusters with 34 atoms or more. all of which dissociate to produce even numbered fragments. Large even clusters fragment by the loss of the high energy species C2. odd ones lose a C atom. The second regime applies to clusters composed of 31 or less atoms. all of which fragment by the loss of C3. These two regimes are sharply separated by C+32 which fragments to produce small cluster ions in the 10–19 atom size range.

A comparison of the Arrhenius dependence of the reaction rate against the calculated diffusion coefficient based on Knudsen diffusion suggests a critical temperature of 550 °C which must be exceeded for exfoliation to occur.

A restriction fragment of the rDNA containing the IVS and portions of the adjacent rRNA sequences (exons) was inserted downstream from the lac UV5 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Transcription of this template by purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro produced a shortened version of the prerRNA. which was then deproteinized. When incubated with monovalent and divalent cations and a guanosine factor. this RNA underwent splicing. The reactions that were characterized included the precise excision of the IVS. attachment of guanosine to the 5′ end of the IVS. covalent cyclization of the IVS and ligation of the exons.

Large labeled training datasets. expensive and tedious to produce. are required to optimize millions of parameters in deep network models. Lagging behind the growth in model capacity. the available datasets are quickly becoming outdated in terms of size and density. To circumvent this bottleneck. we propose to amplify human effort through a partially automated labeling scheme. leveraging deep learning with humans in the loop. Starting from a large set of candidate images for each category. we iteratively sample a subset. ask people to label them. classify the others with a trained model. split the set into positives. negatives. and unlabeled based on the classification confidence. and then iterate with the unlabeled set. To assess the effectiveness of this cascading procedure and enable further progress in visual recognition research. we construct a new image dataset. LSUN. It contains around one million labeled images for each of 10 scene categories and 20 object categories. We experiment with training popular convolutional networks and find that they achieve substantial performance gains when trained on this dataset.,True,dsggzj8AAAAJ:LyfU2ZyOMwkC,644,https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03365,10594621173020200702,/scholar?cites=10594621173020200702,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03365,0,0,0

1093218,Adaptive dynamic programming for control: algorithms and stability,2012,Huaguang Zhang and Derong Liu and Yanhong Luo and Ding Wang,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,There are many methods of stable controller design for nonlinear systems. In seeking to go beyond the minimum requirement of stability. Adaptive Dynamic Programming in Discrete Time approaches the challenging topic of optimal control for nonlinear systems using the tools of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The range of systems treated is extensive; affine. switched. singularly perturbed and time-delay nonlinear systems are discussed as are the uses of neural networks and techniques of value and policy iteration. The text features three main aspects of ADP in which the methods proposed for stabilization and for tracking and games benefit from the incorporation of optimal control methods:• infinite-horizon control for which the difficulty of solving partial differential Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations directly is overcome. and proof provided that the iterative value function updating sequence converges to the infimum of all the value functions obtained by admissible control law sequences;• finite-horizon control. implemented in discrete-time nonlinear systems showing the reader how to obtain suboptimal control solutions within a fixed number of control steps and with results more easily applied in real systems than those usually gained from infinite-horizon control;• nonlinear games for which a pair of mixed optimal policies are derived for solving games both when the saddle point does not exist. and. when it does. avoiding the existence conditions of the saddle point. Non-zero-sum games are studied in the context of a single network scheme in which policies are obtained guaranteeing system stability and minimizing the individual …,True,dsggzj8AAAAJ:27jnQnxMyUIC,290,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HcO5aoyn2FUC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=info:j4rfwX0Ns6gJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lnH0ouB5G1&sig=ltHc9ZuT65lZ-xepnVEvc56iBa8,12156074652977826447,/scholar?cites=12156074652977826447,,"https://cuuduongthancong.com/ggddl/6598668/1447147561-%7B51619ecd%7D-adaptive-dynamic-programming-for-control_-algorithms-and-stability-[zhang,-liu,-luo-_-wang-2012-12-14].pdf",0,0,0

After studying the adversary's behavior patterns. we present countermeasures to this problem. We propose a location-privacy routing protocol (LPR) that is easy to implement and provides path diversity. Combining with fake packet injection. LPR is able to minimize the traffic direction information that an adversary can retrieve from eavesdropping. By making the directions of both incoming and outgoing traffic at a sensor node uniformly distributed. the new defense system makes it very hard for an adversary to perform analysis on locally gathered information and infer the direction to which the receiver locates.

With the objective to minimize the total completion time (or makespan). such an issue is very hard to solve effectively due to the NP-hardness and the constraint on the intermediate buffer. In this paper. an effective hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed for permutation flow shop scheduling with limited buffers.

These enzymes are typically thermostable. or resistant to irreversible inactivation at high temperatures. and thermophilic. i.e. optimally active at elevated temperatures between 60 and 125 °C. Enzyme thermostability encompasses thermodynamic stability and kinetic stability. Thermodynamic stability is defined by the enzyme's free energy of stabilization (ΔGstab) and by its melting temperature (Tm). An enzyme's kinetic stability is often expressed as its halflife (t1/2) at defined temperature. ΔGstab of thermophilic proteins is 5–20 kcal/mol higher than that of mesophilic proteins. The thermostability mechanisms for thermozymes are varied and depend on the enzyme; nevertheless. some common features can be identified as contributing to stability.

We show that muscle stem cells (satellite cells) from aged mice tend to convert from a myogenic to a fibrogenic lineage as they begin to proliferate and that this conversion is mediated by factors in the systemic environment of the old animals. We also show that this lineage conversion is associated with an activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in aged myogenic progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Furthermore. components of serum from aged mice that bind to the Frizzled family of proteins. which are Wnt receptors. may account for the elevated Wnt signaling in aged cells.

To identify new molecular targets in NSCLCs. we performed the combined analysis of massively parallel whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing for cancer and paired normal tissue of a 33-yr-old lung adenocarcinoma patient. who is a never-smoker and has no familial cancer history. The cancer showed no known driver mutation in EGFR or KRAS and no EML4-ALK fusion. Here we report a novel fusion gene between KIF5B and the RET proto-oncogene caused by a pericentric inversion of 10p11.22–q11.21.

Using this procedure. the formation of putrid odors was correlated with a shift in flora from a predominantly gram-positive flora to one having an unusually high number of gram-negative anaerobes. Some of the conditions contributing to this shift in flora are the stagnation of saliva. a depletion of available carbohydrates. and a rise in pH.

The term is given to a phenomenon that is manifest in nonlinear systems whereby generally feeble input information (such as a weak signal) can be be amplified and optimized by the assistance of noise. The effect requires three basic ingredients:(i) an energetic activation barrier or. more generally. a form of threshold;(ii) a weak coherent input (such as a periodic signal);(iii) a source of noise that is inherent in the system. or that adds to the coherent input. Given these features. the response of the system undergoes resonance-like behavior as a function of the noise level; hence the name stochastic resonance.

Within the framework of nonstationary stochastic processes. we present a careful numerical study of the stochastic resonance effect. without restrictions on the modulation amplitude and frequency. In particular. in the regime of intermediate driving frequencies which has not yet been covered by theories. we have discovered a secondary resonance at smaller values of the noise strength.,True,0Dt1AtUAAAAJ:S0RksyIsHSIC,755,https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.44.8032,2787719437609835237,/scholar?cites=2787719437609835237,,http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/Papers/123.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,The general subject of colored noise driven dynamical flows is rooted in the study of the motion of small particles suspended in a fluid and moving under the influence of random forces that result from collisions with molecules of the fluid induced by thermal fluctuations. In short. the phenomenon of Brownian motion [l]. In the earliest studies of Brownian motion. the damping of the motion of the suspended particles was very large compared to that of the fluid molecules. so that inertial effects could be neglected. Moreover. the thermal fluctuations occur on a time scale that is very much shorter than that of the Brownian particle. It is then a good approximation to assume that the random forces are uncorrelated delta functions as perceived by the particle on its own. much slower time scale. This assumption considerably simplifies the problem. because it allows one to treat the stochastic dynamical motions as a Markovian …,True,0Dt1AtUAAAAJ:PPrs6GlykQcC,610,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9780470141489#page=245,11381058783302904811,/scholar?cites=11381058783302904811,,http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/theo1/hanggi/Papers/160.pdf,0,0,0

The working expressions are given solely in terms of the quantities entering the generalized Langevin equation for the particle dynamics. The theory covers the whole range of damping strength and is applicable to an arbitrary memory friction. This solves what is commonly known as the Kramers turnover problem.
