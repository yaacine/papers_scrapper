110800,Protein prenylation: molecular mechanisms and functional consequences,1996,Fang L Zhang and Patrick J Casey,65,,1,241-269,Annual Reviews,Prenylation is a class of lipid modification involving covalent addition of either farnesyl (15-carbon) or geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) isoprenoids to conserved cysteine residues at or near the C-terminus of proteins. Known prenylated proteins include fungal mating factors. nuclear lamins. Ras and Ras-related GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). the subunits of trimeric G proteins. protein kinases. and at least one viral protein. Prenylation promotes membrane interactions of most of these proteins. which is not surprising given the hydrophobicity of the lipids involved. In addition. however. prenylation appears to play a major role in several protein-protein interactions involving these species. The emphasis in this review is on the enzymology of prenyl protein processing and the functional significance of prenylation in cellular events. Several other recent reviews provide more detailed coverage of aspects of prenylation that …,True,vl3U7kMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2289,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.bi.65.070196.001325,17905569124908937709,/scholar?cites=17905569124908937709,,,0,0,0

110802,Protein lipidation in cell signaling,1995,Patrik J Casey,268,,5208,221-225,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The ability of cells to communicate with and respond to their external environment is critical for their continued existence. A universal feature of this communication is that the external signal must in some way penetrate the lipid bilayer surrounding the cell. In most cases of such signal acquisition. the signaling entity itself does not directly enter the cell but rather transmits its information to specific proteins present on the surface of the cell membrane. These proteins then communicate with additional proteins associated with the intracellular face of the membrane. Membrane localization and function of many of these proteins are dependent on their covalent modification by specific lipids. and it is the processes involved that form the focus of this article.,True,vl3U7kMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,958,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/268/5208/221.abstract,12883167343933683761,/scholar?cites=12883167343933683761,,,0,0,0

The enzyme was purified ∼60.000-fold from rat brain cytosol through use of a chromatography step based on the enzyme's ability to bind to a hexapeptide containing the consensus sequence (Cys-AAX) for farnesylation. The purified enzyme migrated on gel filtration chromatography with an apparent molecular weight of 70.000–100.000. High resolution SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed two closely spaced ∼50 kd protein bands in the final preparation.

110804,Protein prenyltransferases,1996,Patrick J Casey and Miguel C Seabra,271,,10,5289-5292,Baltimore [etc.],Prenylation is a type of lipid modification involving covalent addition of either farnesyl (15-carbon) or more commonly geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) isoprenoids via thioether linkages to cysteine residues at or near the C terminus of intracellular proteins. The attached lipid is required for proper function of the modified protein. either as a mediator of membrane association or a determinant for specific protein-protein interactions. Prenylated proteins play crucial roles in such vital cellular processes as signal transduction and intracellular trafficking pathways. This review focuses primarily on the enzymology of protein prenylation; the reader is directed to several other reviews for a more detailed description of related aspects not covered here (1–7). The enzymes responsible for isoprenoid addition to proteins have been identified and characterized at a molecular level both in mammalian systems and in lower eukaryotes. Three distinct protein prenyltransferases can be classified in two functional classes: the CAAX prenyltransferases. identified by their lipid substrate and termed protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) 1 and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I); and the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase or protein geranylgeranyltransferase type II (GGT-ase-II)(Table I). FTase and GGTase-I are designated CAAX prenyltransferases since they act on proteins containing an invariant cysteine residue fourth from the C terminus in the context of a prenylation motif commonly referred to as the “CAAX box”(1. 3).

With a model peptide substrate it was demonstrated that direct activation of the kinase could not account for this effect. G protein beta gamma subunits were shown to interact directly with the COOH-terminal region of beta ARK. and formation of this beta ARK-beta gamma complex resulted in receptor-facilitated membrane localization of the enzyme. The beta gamma subunits of transducin were less effective at both enhancing the rate of receptor phosphorylation and binding to the COOH-terminus of beta ARK. suggesting that the enzyme preferentially binds specific beta gamma complexes.

110820,Protein prenylation: unique fats make their mark on biology,2016,Mei Wang and Patrick J Casey,17,,2,110,Nature Publishing Group,The modification of eukaryotic proteins by isoprenoid lipids. which is known as prenylation. controls the localization and activity of a range of proteins that have crucial functions in biological regulation. The roles of prenylated proteins in cells are well conserved across species. underscoring the biological and evolutionary importance of this lipid modification pathway. Genetic suppression and pharmacological inhibition of the protein prenylation machinery have provided insights into several cellular processes and into the aetiology of diseases in which prenylation is involved. The functional dependence of prenylation substrates. such as RAS proteins. on this modification and the therapeutic potential of targeting the prenylation process in pathological conditions accentuate the need to fully understand this form of post-translational modification.,True,vl3U7kMAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC,249,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm.2015.11.pdf?origin=ppub,6291654355973075610,/scholar?cites=6291654355973075610,,,0,0,0

A prototype is S-palmitoylation (fatty acylation). in which a protein undergoes acylation with a hydrophobic 16 carbon lipid chain.

We recently described a simple and robust methodology to rapidly identify S-nitrosylation sites in proteins via resin-assisted capture (RAC) and provided an initial description of the applicability of the technique to S-acylated proteins (acyl-RAC).

Here we show that β-catenin is a component of interphase centrosomes and that stabilization of β-catenin. mimicking mutations found in cancers. induces centrosome splitting. Centrosomes are held together by a dynamic linker regulated by Nek2 kinase and its substrates C-Nap1 (centrosomal Nek2-associated protein 1) and Rootletin. We show that β-catenin binds to and is phosphorylated by Nek2. and is in a complex with Rootletin. In interphase. β-catenin colocalizes with Rootletin between C-Nap1 puncta at the proximal end of centrioles. and this localization is dependent on C-Nap1 and Rootletin.

We have investigated the regulation of PI 3-kinase present in platelet cytosol. and we show that this activity can be stimulated by a mixed preparation of G-protein beta gamma-subunits. This stimulation is reversed by preincubation of the beta gamma-subunits with GDP-liganded alpha-subunits. The beta gamma-stimulated activity is inhibited by wortmannin. a recently identified inhibitor of PI 3-kinase in other systems. In addition. the activity associates with PDGF receptor phosphotyrosyl peptide and monoclonal antibody designed to interact with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. We suggest that this beta gamma-sensitive activity is related to previously identified forms of PI 3-kinase.,True,vl3U7kMAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,171,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819894188,6362126702177441483,/scholar?cites=6362126702177441483,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819894188,0,0,0

This postisoprenylation processing is thought to be important for the association of Ras proteins with membranes. Blocking postisoprenylation processing. by inhibiting Rce1. has been suggested as a potential approach for retarding cell growth and blocking cellular transformation. The objective of this study was to develop a cell culture system for addressing these issues. We generated mice with a conditional Rce1 allele (Rce1flox) and produced Rce1flox/flox fibroblasts.

This addition is necessary for the biological function of the modified proteins.

The purified protein contains zinc,1993,Wen-Ji Chen and John F Moomaw and Laurie Overton and Thomas A Kost and PJ Casey,268,Journal of Biological Chemistry,13,9675-9680,Elsevier,The mammalian enzyme protein farnesyltransferase is a heterodimeric protein that catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl isoprenoid to a cysteine in ras proteins. Since oncogenic forms of ras proteins require the farnesyl group for transforming activity. the structure and mechanism of this enzyme are important to define. However. such studies have been difficult to approach because of the low abundance of the enzyme in mammalian tissues and hence the problems of obtaining large quantities of the protein.

Ras proteins must be targeted to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane for biological activity. This targeting requires a series of C-terminal posttranslational modifications initiated by the addition of an isoprenoid lipid in a process termed prenylation. A search for factors involved in the intracellular trafficking of Ras has identified a specific and prenylation-dependent interaction between tubulin/microtubules and K-Ras. In this study. we examined the structural requirements for this interaction between K-Ras and microtubules. By using a series of chimeras in which regions of the C terminus of K-Ras were replaced with those of Ha-Ras and vice versa. we found that the polylysine region of K-Ras located immediately upstream of the prenylation site is required for binding of K-Ras to microtubules.

Gzα,1996,Jennifer Glick and Gabriela Santoyo and Patrick J Casey,271,Journal of Biological Chemistry,6,2949-2954,Elsevier,Gz is a member of the family of trimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). which plays a crucial role in signaling across cell membranes. The expression of Gz is predominately confined to neuronal cells and platelets. suggesting an involvement in a neuroendocrine process. Although the signaling pathway in which Gz participates is not yet known. it has been linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. We have found that arachidonate and related unsaturated fatty acids suppress guanine nucleotide binding to the α subunit of Gz. This inhibition of nucleotide binding by cis-unsaturated fatty acids is specific for Gzα; other G protein α subunits are relatively insensitive to these lipids. The IC50 for inhibition by the lipids closely corresponds to their critical micellar concentrations. suggesting that the interaction of the lipid micelle with Gzα is the primary event leading to inhibition.

The indole acetamide cysmethynil is by far the most potent and widely investigated Icmt inhibitor. but it has modest antiproliferative activity and may have pharmacokinetic limitations due to its lipophilic character. We report here that cysmethynil can be structurally modified to give analogues that are as potent in inhibiting Icmt but with significantly greater antiproliferative activity. Key modifications were the replacement of the acetamide side chain by tertiary amino groups. the n-octyl side chain by isoprenyl and the 5-m-tolyl ring by fluorine.

Herein. we demonstrate both in vitro and in cells that this domain interacts with the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G12 but not with the closely related Gα13 or with several other heterotrimeric G proteins. Axin preferentially binds the activated form of Gα12. a behavior consistent with other RGS proteins. However. unlike other RGS proteins. that of axin (axinRGS) does not affect intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by Gα12.

Obesity is often associated with insulin resistance. a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): a costly chronic disease and serious public health problem. The underlying cause of T2DM is a failure of the beta cells of the pancreas to continue to produce enough insulin to counteract insulin resistance. Most current T2DM therapeutics do not prevent continued loss of insulin secretion capacity. and those that do have the potential to preserve beta cell mass and function are not effective in all patients. Therefore. developing new methods for preventing and treating obesity and T2DM is very timely and of great significance.

Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. we have created Icmt loss-of-function isogenic cell lines for both RAS-transformed human mammary epithelial cells (HME1) and human cancer cell lines MiaPaca-2 and MDA-MB-231 containing naturally occurring mutant KRAS. In both in vitro and in vivo tumorigenesis studies. Icmt loss-of-function abolishes the tumor initiation ability of all major isoforms of mutant RAS in HME1 cells. and the tumor maintenance capacity of MiaPaca-2 and MDA-MB-231 cells. establishing the critical …,True,vl3U7kMAAAAJ:wmBOIy6d62IC,24,https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2016508,10691113827865339769,/scholar?cites=10691113827865339769,,https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2016508,0,0,0

Methyl esterification neutralizes the negative charge of the prenylcysteine and thereby increases membrane affinity. Icmt is an integral membrane protein restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog. Ste14p. traverses the ER membrane six times. We used a novel fluorescent reporter to map the topology of human Icmt in living cells. Our results indicate that Icmt traverses the ER membrane eight times. with both N and C termini disposed toward the cytosol and with a helix-turn-helix structure comprising transmembrane (TM) segments 7 and 8. Several conserved amino acids that map to cytoplasmic portions of the enzyme are critical for full enzymatic activity.

The cellular abundance of prenylated proteins. as well as the stability of the thioether bond. poses a metabolic challenge to cells. A lysosomal enzyme termed prenylcysteine lyase has been identified that degrades a variety of prenylcysteines. Prenylcysteine lyase is a FAD-dependent thioether oxidase that produces free cysteine. an isoprenoid aldehyde. and hydrogen peroxide as products of the reaction. Here we report initial studies of the kinetic mechanism and stereospecificity of this unusual enzyme.

G12. via Rho induces a striking increase in breast cancer cell invasion. In this study. evidence is provided that the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) is a key downstream effector of G12 on this pathway. Expression of constitutively-active Gα12 or activation of G12 signaling by thrombin leads to increased JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Pharmacologic inhibition of JNK or knockdown of JNK expression by siRNA significantly decreases G12-induced JNK activation as well as the ability of breast cancer cells to invade a reconstituted basement membrane. Furthermore. expression of dominant-negative Rho or treatment of cells with an inhibitor of the Rho kinase. ROCK. reduces G12-induced JNK and c-Jun activation. and ROCK inhibitor treatment also inhibits G12-induced cellular invasion. JNK knockdown or ROCK inhibitor treatment has no effect on activation of Rho by G12. Taken together. our data indicate that JNK activation is required for G12-induced invasion of breast cancer cells and that JNK is downstream of Rho and ROCK on this pathway.

Viral or yeast infection. and corneal neovascularization.Ras proteins share characteristic C-terminal Sequences termed CAAX motif. wherein C is CyS. A is an amino acid. usually an aliphatic amino acid. and X is an aliphatic amino acid or other type of amino acid. The biological activity of the proteins is dependent upon the post-translational modi fication of these Sequences by isoprenoid lipids. For proteins having a C-terminal CAAX Sequence. this modification. which is called prenylation. occurs in at least three Steps: the addition of either a …,True,vl3U7kMAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C,16,https://patents.google.com/patent/US6191147B1/en,16501039825991340182,/scholar?cites=16501039825991340182,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/02/fb/3b/be72069769a67e/US6191147.pdf,0,0,0
110954,Farnesylation of nonpeptidic thiol compounds by protein farnesyltransferase,2001,Kendra E Hightower and Patrick J Casey and Carol A Fierke,40,Biochemistry,4,1002-1010,American Chemical Society,Protein farnesyltransferase catalyzes the modification of protein substrates containing specific carboxyl-terminal Ca1a2X motifs with a 15-carbon farnesyl group. The thioether linkage is formed between the cysteine of the Ca1a2X motif and C1 of the farnesyl group. Protein substrate specificity is essential to the function of the enzyme and has been exploited to find enzyme-specific inhibitors for antitumor therapies. In this work. we investigate the thiol substrate specificity of protein farnesyltransferase by demonstrating that a variety of nonpeptidic thiol compounds. including glutathione and dithiothreitol. are substrates. However. the binding energy of these thiols is decreased 4−6 kcal/mol compared to a peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of H-Ras. Furthermore. for these thiol substrates. both the farnesylation rate constant and the apparent magnesium affinity decrease significantly. Surprisingly. no correlation is …,True,vl3U7kMAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC,16,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi002237d,159516464428602911,/scholar?cites=159516464428602911,,,0,0,0
110955,Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 as a target in cancer,2016,Nisar Ullah and Muhammad Mansha and Patrick J Casey,16,,7,563-571,Bentham Science Publishers,The process of protein prenylation involves the covalent linkage of either farnesyl (15-carbon) or geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) isoprenoid lipds to conserved cysteine residues in the carboxyl-terminus of proteins. Protein geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase-I) is the enzyme that catalyzes the addition of the geranylgeranyl moiety from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to the target protein. which contains a Cterminal consensus sequence termed a CaaX motif. Geranylgeranylation is important to the function of a number of proteins. including the majority of Rho GTPases. G protein gamma subunits. and several other regulatory proteins. Studies over the past two decades have revealed that many of these proteins contribute to tumor development and metastasis. Blocking Rho GTPase activity through inhibition of GGTase-I in particular has been advanced as a potential strategy for disease therapy.

These unique characteristics have become attractive targets that are being actively investigated for cancer therapy. p21cip1/waf1. also known as Cyclin-Dependent Kinase inhibitor 1A. is encoded by the CDKN1A gene. It is a major p53 target gene involved in cell cycle progression that has been extensively evaluated. To date. p21 has been reported to regulate various cell functions. both dependent and independent of p53. Besides regulating the cell cycle. p21 also modulates apoptosis. induces senescence. and maintains cellular quiescence in response to various stimuli. p21 transcription is induced in response to stresses. including those from oxidative and chemotherapeutic treatment. A recent study has shown that in response to metabolic stresses such as nutrient and energy depletion. p21 expression is induced to regulate various cell functions. Despite the biological significance. the mechanism of p21 regulation in cancer adaptation to metabolic stress is underexplored and thus represents an exciting field. This review focuses on the recent development of p21 regulation in response to metabolic stress and its impact in inducing cell cycle arrest and death in cancer cells.

Studies have implicated G protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) in cancer progression and the acquisition of TIC phenotypes. Many of the implicated GPCRs signal through the G protein GNA13. In this study. we demonstrate that GNA13 is upregulated in many solid tumors and impacts survival and metastases in patients. GNA13 levels modulate drug resistance and TIC-like phenotypes in patient-derived head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells in vitro and in vivo.

The final step in this pathway is methylation of the carboxyl terminus of the prenylated protein by isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase. Due to the impact of methylation on Rho function. we sought to determine if the process was reversible and hence could control Rho function in a dynamic fashion. Elevating isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase activity in cells has profound effects on MDA-MB-231 cell morphology. implying the presence of a pool of unmethylated prenyl proteins in these cells under normal conditions. Using a knockdown approach. we identified a specific esterase. carboxylesterase 1. whose function had a clear impact not only on the methylation status of RhoA but also RhoA activation and cell morphology.
