101734,Mussel-inspired adhesives and coatings,2011,Bruce P Lee and Phillip B Messersmith and Jacob N Israelachvili and J Herbert Waite,41,,,99-132,Annual Reviews,Mussels attach to solid surfaces in the sea. Their adhesion must be rapid. strong. and tough. or else they will be dislodged and dashed to pieces by the next incoming wave. Given the dearth of synthetic adhesives for wet polar surfaces. much effort has been directed to characterizing and mimicking essential features of the adhesive chemistry practiced by mussels. Studies of these organisms have uncovered important adaptive strategies that help to circumvent the high dielectric and solvation properties of water that typically frustrate adhesion. In a chemical vein. the adhesive proteins of mussels are heavily decorated with Dopa. a catecholic functionality. Various synthetic polymers have been functionalized with catechols to provide diverse adhesive. sealant. coating. and anchoring properties. particularly for critical biomedical applications.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC,1211,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-matsci-062910-100429,15007762249294970097,/scholar?cites=15007762249294970097,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3207216/,0,0,0

The marine mussel serves as an appropriate model to illustrate how Nature designs adhesives to resist the subversive effects of water.

Despite the obvious advantages of reinforcing soft protoplasm with a hard scaffold. such composites can lead to tremendous mechanical stresses where the two meet. Although little is known about how nature relieves these stresses. it is generally agreed that fundamental insights about molecular adaptation at hard/soft interfaces could profoundly influence how we think about biomaterials. Based on two noncellular tissues. mussel byssus and polychaete jaws. recent studies suggest that one natural strategy to minimize interfacial stresses between adjoining stiff and soft tissue appears to be the creation of a “fuzzy” boundary. which avoids abrupt changes in mechanical properties.

Mfp-1 (Mytilus foot protein-1) is a conspicuous component of the protective outer cuticle of byssal threads given its high 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) content at 10-15 mol %.

In marine mussels one such fluid. secreted during the formation of adhesive plaques. consists of a concentrated colloidal suspension of a mussel foot protein (mfp) known as Mfp-3S. The results of this study suggest that Mfp-3S becomes a complex fluid by a liquid–liquid phase separation from equilibrium solution at a pH and ionic strength reminiscent of the conditions created by the mussel foot during plaque formation. The pH dependence of phase separation and its sensitivity indicate that inter-/intra-molecular electrostatic interactions are partially responsible for driving the phase separation. Hydrophobic interactions between the non- polar Mfp-3S proteins provide another important driving force for coacervation.

Up to 70% of the total absorbed energy can be dissipated in the byssus. Because byssal threads attach the mussel to hard inert surfaces in its habitat. they must combine the need to be good shock absorbers with appropriate matching of Young's modulus between living tissue and a hard sub–stratum such as stone—stiffnesses that can differ by five orders of magnitude. Recent data suggest that improved modulus matching and decreased stress concentration between different portions of the byssus is achieved by the use of protein gradients.

To help cope with these stresses. mussels have evolved some extraordinary structural and biochemical adaptations. The production of the byssus is one such adaptation. The byssus is a complex array of threads and adhesive plaques that serves alternatively to attach the mussel to solid objects. to absorb shock. or to scale a vertical face (Waite. 1983 a; Price. 1983). Because of its location outside the animal's living tissues. the byssus cannot count on the same kind of repair and remodelling offered to structures within the animal.

It defines a scleroprotein functionally as a protein contributing mechanical strength to supporting structures in animals. The most persistent properties of the scleroproteins are their insolubility in vitro. and their resistance to proteinases and various hydrolytic solvents. This stability can be attributed to two factors: (1) special arrangement of amino acids and (2) covalent cross-linking of the primary valence chains.

The egg capsule wall of the channelled whelk Busycon canaliculum is an effective shock absorber with high reversible extensibility and a stiffness that changes significantly during extension. Here we show that post-stretch recovery in egg capsules is not driven by entropic forces as it is in rubber. Indeed. at fixed strain. force decreases linearly with increasing temperature. whereas in rubber elasticity the force increases. Instead. capsule wall recovery is associated with the internal energy arising from the facile and reversible structural α-helix-sheet transition of egg capsule proteins during extension.

Periostracin is unusually unstable in vitro. It was extracted with high yield from marginal periostracum with pure formic acid. It is a basic. water-insoluble protein with a molecular weight of 20.000 as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid composition of periostracin is unique with 55% of the residues being glycine. 10% tyrosine and 2.2% Dopa. The presence of Dopa was further substantiated by reaction with ethylenediamine. by difference spectra at various pH and by UV and visible spectra of the oxidation products.

This fibrous. proteinaceous and highly cross-linked structure allows the mussel to attach to a variety of substrata and contributes to its notoriety as a major freshwater biofouling species. We have successfully expressed a full-length version of Dreissena polymorpha foot protein 1 (Dpfp1). a putative byssal thread precursor. and have used the recombinant protein as an antigen for polyclonal antibody production. Antisera obtained from rabbits immunized with recombinant Dpfp1 recognize the protein in western blots of extracts from foot tissue and byssal threads. On the basis of this evidence. we conclude that Dpfp1 is a byssal precursor protein manufactured and stored in the foot of the mussel.

Many prior studies attribute their adhesive strength to the strong chemical interactions between the holdfast and substrate. While chemical interactions are certainly important. adhesive performance is also determined by contact geometry. and understanding the coupling between chemical interactions and the plaque shape and mechanical properties is essential in deploying bioinspired strategies when engineering improved adhesives. To investigate how the shape and mechanical properties of the mussel's plaque contribute to its adhesive performance. we use a custom built load frame capable of fully characterizing the dynamics of the detachment.

Dreissena polymorpha. owes its notoriety as a biofouler to its adhesive skills and opportunism. Adhesion by the adult mussel to hard substrata is mediated by a nonliving extracorporeal structure called the byssus. which is superficially similar to the byssus of marine mussels in that it consists of a tight bundle of sclerotized threads tipped by adhesive plaques. Juvenile zebra mussels secrete a homologous structure on settlement. but they also employ an elongated belaying byssus while climbing that consists of an elastic. mucous filament anchored at irregular intervals by a byssal thread and plaque. This multiply anchored belaying line can be 20 to 30 times the mussel length. Histochemical tests show that the thread and plaque of both kinds of byssus contains a complex distribution of proteins that are subject to chemical processing after secretion.

Emerging mechanistic insights about structure–property relationships in sclerotized extracellular composites include the following: (1) tissue stiffness can be significantly adjusted by the relative organization and density of rigid versus flexible domains in the protein components (mussel byssal thread); (2) structures can be rich in polyphenols without being sclerotized (mussel adhesive plaque); (3) stiffness and hardness can be adjusted by the relative abundance of interactions between protein-based imidazole and catecholate ligands and …,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,39,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065280610380039,10254207609301877495,/scholar?cites=10254207609301877495,,,0,0,0

Apparently. however. not all mussel adhesive proteins are beholden to Dopa chemistry. The cDNA-deduced sequence of Pvfp-1. a highly aromatic and redox active byssal coating protein in the green mussel Perna viridis. suggests that Dopa may be replaced by a post-translational modification of tryptophan. The N-terminal tryptophan-rich domain of Pvfp-1 contains 42 decapeptide repeats with the consensus sequences ATPKPW1TAW2K and APPPAW1TAW2K. A small collagen domain (18 Gly-X-Y repeats) is also present.

101904,Boronate complex formation with Dopa containing mussel adhesive protein retards pH-induced oxidation and enables adhesion to mica,2014,Yajing Kan and Eric W Danner and Jacob N Israelachvili and Yunfei Chen and J Herbert Waite,9,PLoS One,10,e108869,Public Library of Science,The biochemistry of mussel adhesion has inspired the design of surface primers. adhesives. coatings and gels for technological applications. These mussel-inspired systems often focus on incorporating the amino acid 3.4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (Dopa) or a catecholic analog into a polymer. Unfortunately. effective use of Dopa is compromised by its susceptibility to auto-oxidation at neutral pH. Oxidation can lead to loss of adhesive function and undesired covalent cross-linking. Mussel foot protein 5 (Mfp-5). which contains ∼30 mole % Dopa. is a superb adhesive under reducing conditions but becomes nonadhesive after pH-induced oxidation. Here we report that the bidentate complexation of borate by Dopa to form a catecholato-boronate can be exploited to retard oxidation. Although exposure of Mfp-5 to neutral pH typically oxidizes Dopa. resulting in a>95% decrease in adhesion. inclusion of borate retards oxidation at the same pH. Remarkably. this Dopa-boronate complex dissociates upon contact with mica to allow for a reversible Dopa-mediated adhesion. The borate protection strategy allows for Dopa redox stability and maintained adhesive function in an otherwise oxidizing environment.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,37,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108869,1455596563909819637,/scholar?cites=1455596563909819637,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108869,0,0,0

101911,Wresting the muscle from mussel beards: research and applications.,1995,Leszek M Rzepecki and J Herbert Waite,4,,4,313-322,,Marine and zebra mussels secrete byssal beards to attach themselves opportunistically to hard surfaces in their environment. By doing this. they naturally earn a reputation as fouling pests. The protein precursors of byssus in mussels are being investigated in the hope not only of discovering specific measures against these marine foulers. but also to gain some insights into the technically challenging task of engineering adhesive bonds underwater. Although byssal proteins are all part of the bearded glue that bonds them to a surface. they can be subdivided into three types depending on the function that they serve in byssal threads:(1) fibrous proteins form the load-bearing cables in the core of the threads.(2) cuticular proteins form a protective coat around the cables. and (3) adhesive proteins connect the cables to a foreign surface. A flaw in any one of these will undermine a mussel's ability to attach. The fibrous proteins can be collagenous. silk-like. elastic. or any combination of these. Covering these are the cuticular proteins. which are distinguished by their surface coupling properties. tandemly repeated primary sequence. and their high content of lysine and the exotic amino acid 3. 4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (DOPA).

Fibers are continuous. separated by matrix. and consist of chimeric collagens that encompass within the same primary protein structure domains corresponding to collagen. polyhistidine. and either elastin or dragline spider silk. The elastic modulus (stiffness) of the proximal portion of byssal threads was measured by cyclic stress-strain analysis at 50% extension. Before measurement. the threads were conditioned by various treatments. particularly agitation in aerated or nitrogen-sparged seawater. Stiffness can be permanently increased by more than two times. e.g.. from 25 MPa to a maximum of 65 MPa. by simple agitation in aerated seawater.

Oxidation of DOPA to Dopaquinone (Q) effectively abolishes the adsorption of Mfps to these surfaces. The thiol-rich mussel foot protein-6 (Mfp-6) rescues adhesion compromised by adventitious DOPA oxidation by reducing Q back to DOPA. The redox chemistry and kinetics of foot-extracted Mfp-6 were investigated by using a nonspecific chromogenic probe to equilibrate with the redox pool. Foot-extracted Mfp-6 has a reducing capacity of ∼17 e– per protein; half of this comes from the cysteine residues. whereas the other half comes from other constituents. probably a cohort of four or five nonadhesive. redox-active DOPA residues in Mfp-6 with an anodic peak potential ∼500 mV lower than that for oxidation of cysteine to cystine.

MA,The structural macromolecules of the extracellular matrix have been investigated with rapidly increasing activity and depth in the past decade. Collagen. and to a lesser extent. elastin. were among the earliest of this group to be studied in more detail than the proteoglycans and adhesive glycoproteins. Consequently. the extent of knowledge concerning collagen is greater than any of the other structural macromolecules; one index of this phenomenon is the large number of symposia and monographs which have been devoted to collagen in the past generation. One can virtually trace an exponential growth curve of the literature concerning the structure. function and biological properties of the protein.

The reversible complexation of Fe3+ by the 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) side chains in mfp-1 in Mytilus californianus cuticle is responsible for its high extensibility (120%) as well as its stiffness (2 GPa) due to the formation of sacrificial bonds that help to dissipate energy and avoid accumulation of stresses in the material. We have investigated the interactions between Fe3+ and mfp-1 from two mussel species. M. californianus (Mc) and M. edulis (Me). using both surface sensitive and solution phase techniques.

101960,"Response to comment on"" High abrasion resistance with sparse mineralization: copper biomineral in worm jaws""",2003,Helga Lichtenegger and Thomas Schöberl and Michael H Bartl and Herbert Waite and Galen D Stucky,,,,,na,Schofield and Nesson (1) express concern that the correlation between the element concentration in Glycera jaws and the mechanical properties of the jaw (2) may not reflect the correlation between atacamite mineral content and mechanical properties. They argue that there may be “unidentified nondiffracting copper and/or chlorine compounds that are predominantly responsible for mechanical properties” and criticize the use of chlorine as an indicator for the occurrence of the mineral. Although determining the exact amount of copper and chlorine bound to the mineral is indeed difficult and small amounts of further. unidentified copper-chlorine compounds (UCCCs) may well exist in the sample. our results do not yield any indicators for their occurrence. Despite careful reevaluation. we could not see the supposed significant differences between the copper. chlorine. and electron density maps in our original manuscript (3). We have. however. reexamined our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (Fig. 1). Clearly. the regions containing mineralized fibers are rich in copper and chlorine (Fig. 1A). with the copper peak greatly reduced in height in the matrix material (Fig. 1B). The remaining amount of copper is comparable to the amount in the fiber region that exceeds the Cu: Cl ratio of 2: 1 in atacamite. No chlorine at all was detected in matrix regions devoid of mineralized fibers. Hence. we conclude that chlorine constitutes a reliable indicator for the occurrence of the mineral. Notwithstanding that. we acknowledge that UCCCs could be part of the mineralized fibers.

101964,Marine metal chelating proteins,1991,Douglas C Hansen and J Herbert Waite,,,,256-262,,The attachment strategy of the common sea mussel Mytilus edulis relies on the formation of byssal threads which originate in the animal at one end and attach to a surface at the other. The point of attachment for these threads are small plaques which contain an adhesive protein. This protein contains the amino acid 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). DOPA-containing proteins have been isolated from other mytilid bivalves. namely Mytilus californianus and Geukensia demissa. Being an o-diphenol. this amino acid enables the adhesive plaque to displace water molecules through hydrogen bonding and to bind to metal ions that are present in the substrata. This chemisorption effectively anchors the mussel to the surface and allows it to resist the physical forces to which it is exposed. The byssal threads of these bivalves have demonstrated preferential accumulation and sequestration of trace metals.

Thefullimpact of this particular perspective is nowhere more evident than in the high-energy intertidal zone where mussels and other sessile organisms thrive amidst aeration. nutrient cycling. and waste removal ad libitum. The benefits of a turbulent habitat are considerable. but there are also costs. A major cost for mussels is the production of a robust holdfast or byssus. The byssus provides mussels with the necessary tenacity to survive incessant buffeting by waves. In exchange. a mussel is committed to invest 10% or more ofits energy and assimilated nitrogen for making and maintaining a byssus (Jordan and Valiela. 1982). Mussel byssus consists of a bundle of short threads that resemble tiny tendons (Figure 10.1). It is constructed entirely of extraorganismic. extracellular connective tissue. In the Mytilus species (M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis). each new thread has dimensions of a few centimetres in length and less than 0.1 mm in diameter and is made in about 5 minutes in the ventral groove of the foot by a process akin to injection moulding (Waite. 1992). Like tendons. the threads originate from the byssal retractor muscles by way ofa rooted stem; unlike tendons. byssal threads do not ‘insert’onto foreign objects as tendons do to bone (Currey. 1984). Instead. byssal adhesive plaques bond only to the surface of exogenous substrata. such as stone (Tamarin et al.. 1976). For morphological clarity. the byssus is divided into four parts (from proximal to distal): root. stem. thread. and plaque or pad.

The growing importance of long-chain polyethers with their remarkable biological properties could not be foreseen in 1981. when the first marine representative of this class of compounds. okadaic acid. was described. Since then. the Gulf to Mexico red tide agents. the brevetoxins. and a ciguatera-causing compound. ciguatoxin. among others. have been structurally defined.

Higa's chapter is a timely reminder that we should not lose sight of fundamental organic chemical principles. Polyethers. discussed in Chapter 1. illustrate yet another facet of bioorganic marine chemistry. Okadaic acid. first isolated from two genera of sponges with habitats in two oceans. was subsequently recognized as a metabolite of a marine microalga. the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima.

The mechanical performance of the shell is critically reliant on 3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine’s (Dopa) ability to form reversible iron-catecholate complexes at pH 8.

Wiley, Hoboken",,319-349,,Bioadhesion is about how living organisms attach to surfaces at different length and timescales. Model organisms for investigating bioadhesion are diverse and include sea stars [1]. barnacles [2]. polychaete worms [3]. ants [4]. geckos [5]. ivy [6]. tree frogs [7]. and mussels. among others. Not only is bioadhesion fascinating as a science. it can also have a significant impact on technology. The “double-edged blade” aspect of bioadhesion is particularly noteworthy in this regard. One “edge” of this blade is the unwanted attachment of living organisms to various surfaces. Knowing how living organisms stick to surfaces is a prerequisite to inventing effective strategies to keep them off (antifouling strategies)[8].

This is enabled by a bundle of fine protein based threads called the byssus. The byssus is emerging as an effective model system for studying the requirements for underwater adhesion. wear resistance and combined hardness and extensibility (1. 2). Careful secretion of different mussel foot proteins (mfp) combined with some metal ions (Fe3+. Zn2+ etc.) allows the mussel to tune properties and optimize function of diverse parts of byssus thread (3).Here we report in‐situ high‐resolution Raman spectroscopic imaging of the byssal coating and plaque showing micron level spatial distribution of various proteins and their interaction with Fe3+ using specific Resonance Raman (RR) spectral features. 3.4‐dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) is a strong chelator of Fe3+ within a specific pH window …,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC,2,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3482556,5331620381796697140,/scholar?cites=5331620381796697140,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew_Harrington/publication/47452451_In-situ_Raman_Spectroscopic_Imaging_of_a_Mussel_Coating_and_Adhesive/links/5439257e0cf24a6ddb9599f2/In-situ-Raman-Spectroscopic-Imaging-of-a-Mussel-Coating-and-Adhesive.pdf,0,0,0

In addition to the requirement of the multicompositional. hierarchical assembly of spatially distinct domains. there must be information exchange between the domains that can be selectively coupled with the external environment.

All four of the peptides are composed of a sequence of 36 amino acids. with the numbers and locations of the glycine (Gly). lysine (Lys) and cysteine (Cys) residues conserved (Fig. 1). The locations of the aromatic residues and leucine (Leu) hydrophobic control (X) were also conserved. The four peptides differ only by progressive hydroxylation of the aromatic residue in three of the peptides: phenylalanine (Phe). tyrosine (Tyr) and 3. 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa). The fourth peptide is a Leu analogue to test whether the strong adhesion forces we measure result from nonspecific hydrophobic and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions. The overall sequence is inspired by a Lys-and Dopa-rich sequence of 16 amino acids that is present in the mussel foot protein mefp-5. a strongly adhesive mussel foot protein prominently featured at the mussel adhesive plaque-solid interface 31. 33. Dopa is also the dominant aromatic residue in many mussel foot proteins. and thus we refer to the Dopa peptide as a mussel-mimetic peptide sequence. Although some mussel proteins also contain an appreciable Tyr content. Phe is conspicuously deficient in marine mussel adhesive proteins.Mica was selected as the substrate material because primary amines. like Lys. strongly bind to the surface of mica via ion exchange with the K+ ions present at the surface of single-crystalline mica 9. 34.

102012,Translating Mussel Adhesion: Four Uncertainties about the Interface,2016,J Herbert Waite,,,,305-321,Royal Society of Chemistry,The attachment of marine mussels to submerged solid surfaces has been the focus of numerous studies over the last twenty years. motivated both by fouling concerns and the technical limitations of adhesion in the presence of moisture. salt. corrosion. and biofilms. Several recent reviews with different perspectives have appeared on this subject. 1–3 Mussel attachment is mediated by a byssus. a peculiar brush-like holdfast that consists of hundreds of disc tipped threads made one thread at a time (Figure 9.1). Byssal attachment provides stability and. in the turbulent intertidal zone. an attribute of even greater survival value–tenacity.

Here we report a versatile and strong wet-contact adhesive inspired by sandcastle worm cement that enables both a triggered complexation of polyelectrolytes. and formation of a porous architecture. A catecholfunctionalized weak poly-anion was premixed with a poly-cation in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The polymer solution was applied underwater to substrates where electrostatic complexation. phase inversion. and rapid setting were actuated by water-DMSO solvent exchange. This process offers enhanced spatial and temporal control of complexation. thereby fostering rapid (≥ 25 s) and robust underwater adhesion (Wad ≥ 2 J/m2) of complexed catecholic polyelectrolytes to all tested surfaces including plastics. glasses. metals. and biological surfaces.

These mussel-inspired systems often focus on incorporating the amino acid 3. 4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (Dopa) or a catecholic analog into a polymer. Unfortunately. effective use of Dopa is compromised by its susceptibility to auto-oxidation at neutral pH. Oxidation can lead to loss of adhesive function and undesired covalent cross-linking. Mussel foot protein 5 (Mfp-5). which contains. 30 mole% Dopa. is a superb adhesive under reducing conditions but becomes nonadhesive after pH-induced oxidation. Here we report that the bidentate complexation of borate by Dopa to form a catecholato-boronate can be exploited to retard oxidation. Although exposure of Mfp-5 to neutral pH typically oxidizes Dopa. resulting in a. 95% decrease in adhesion. inclusion of borate retards oxidation at the same pH. Remarkably. this Dopa-boronate complex dissociates upon contact with mica to allow for a reversible Dopamediated adhesion.

The sea is full of practitioners of such adhesive strategies. Barnacles. reef worms. oysters. foraminifera. mussels. etc all have life histories that depend upon their secure attachment to solid substrata for survival (Harris. 1990). About thirty years ago. the United States Office of Naval Research initiated an antifouling program whose goal was to identify the adhesive molecules of marine foulers so as to specifically intervene in their attachment. A few years later. a materials program at the National Institutes of Health joined the initiative on marine bioadhesives with the aim of imitating them for numerous biomedical applications (Anon. 1968). This has not changed the nature of the research but has certainly doubled the perceived impact of any fully characterized adhesive strategy.

An understanding of the molecular mechanism of these functions would enhance the technological and medical exploitation of materials which have been specifically engineered by the course of evolution to possess strong adhesive and cohesive properties.

The glue is a mixture of post-translationally modified proteins. notably the cement proteins Pc-1 and Pc-2 with the amino acid. 3.4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (DOPA). Significant amounts of a halogenated derivative of DOPA were isolated from the worm cement following partial acid hydrolysis and capture of catecholic amino acids by phenylboronate affinity chromatography. Analysis by tandem mass spectrometry and 1H NMR indicates the DOPA derivative to be 2-chloro-4. 5-dihydroxyphenyl- L-alanine.

102042,Short‑Order Tendons,2008,Matthew J Harrington and J Herbert Waite,,Fibrous Proteins,,30,CRC Press,Musselbyssal threads are externally secreted collagneous protein fibers that tether marine mussels to hard surfaces in the rocky intertidal zone and prevent dislodgement from thedrag and lift forces generated by crashing waves. At low strain values. byssal threads mechanically resemble tendon with a stiffness~ 1 GPa and a high resilience above 90%. However. unlike tendon. threads do not rupture at 12% strain. but instead undergoyield and continue extending until twice their initiallength. In doing so. they dissipate up to 70% of the applied wave energy. Byssal threads are also able to self-healafter yield-induced stress softening. recoveringinitial material properties in a time dependent fashion. The added mechanical features ofbyssal threads appear to be an adaptation for functioning outside the organism in the tumultuous intertidal zone. Since both tendon and byssal threads are composed of over 50% collagen. it is intriguing that their mechanical properties would be so varied. This review focuses on the structure-property relationships that exist between the unique mechanical performance of the byssal threads and the biochemistry of the modified collagens (preCols) of which they are composed. In particular. we discuss the role of protein liquid crystal phases. histidine-metal complexation and graded distribution of preCol variants in the assembly process and mechanical function of mussel byssal threads.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11756368793176209651&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

102049,Current Topics Exploring Molecular and Mechanical Gradients in Structural Bioscaffolds,2004,J Herbert Waite and Helga C Lichtenegger and Galen D Stucky and Paul Hansma,,,,,,Most organisms consist of a functionally adaptive assemblage of hard and soft tissues. Despite the obvious advantages of reinforcing soft protoplasm with a hard scaffold. such composites can lead to tremendous mechanical stresses where the two meet. Although little is known about how nature relieves these stresses. it is generally agreed that fundamental insights about molecular adaptation at hard/soft interfaces could profoundly influence how we think about biomaterials. Based on two noncellular tissues. mussel byssus and polychaete jaws. recent studies suggest that one natural strategy to minimize interfacial stresses between adjoining stiff and soft tissue appears to be the creation of a “fuzzy” boundary. which avoids abrupt changes in mechanical properties. Instead there is a gradual mechanical change that accompanies the transcendence from stiff to soft and vice versa. In byssal threads. the biochemical medium for achieving such a gradual mechanical change involves the elegant use of collagen-based self-assembling block copolymers. There are three distinct diblock copolymer types in which one block is always collagenous. whereas the other can be either elastin-like (soft). amorphous polyglycine (intermediate). or silk-like (stiff). Gradients of these are made by an incrementally titrated expression of the three proteins in secretory cells the titration phenotype of which is linked to their location. Thus. reflecting exactly the composition of each thread. the distal cells secrete primarily the silk-and polyglycine-collagen diblocks. whereas the proximal cells secrete the elastin-and polyglycine-collagen diblocks.

By the very nature of life. the adhesive strategies employed must compete against the encroachment of water. that ubiquitous subverter of adhesion. Water and adhesion conflict in at least four ways (Comyn 1981). Water forms a weak boundary layer on surfaces. wicks into interfaces. hydrolyses or erodes adhesives. and swells or plasticizes the adhesive. Consequently. suc-cessful adhesives possess physical and chemical properties that repel such destructive incursions. The problems solved by nature's adhesive specialists are also those that challenge the use of adhesives in fields such as den-tistry. orthopedics. and underwater construction where surfaces are chronically exposed to water and usually may not be effectively cleaned and dried. In the face of this challenge to adhesive technology. we may profitably learn from nature. which supplies us with many and varied ex-emplars of adhesive strategies. Among the better understood of these exemplars is the marine mussel. which adheres to its underwater substrate by means of as ecreted nonliv. ing structure called the byssus.

The precursors for these coatings are proteins that appear to be present in separate phases in granules that resemble latex particles with interpenetrating polymer networks. We have developed an efficient method based on perchloric acid extraction of one of these precursors-a Dopa-containing protein. This has expedited expansion of our data bank on Dopa-protein sequences to 12 species and 3 phyla. All sequences contain abundant hydroxylated amino acids and all contain Dopa and lysine. which are present in approximately equal concentrations. Glycine and proline seen negatively correlated in the sequences. Specific aims of this proposal are 1 to identify and characterize coating precursor proteins in addition to the Dopa-proteins. 2 to examine interfacial interactions between these various proteins. and 3 to characterize the mechanism of curing. jsDescriptors:,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA228964,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA228964.pdf,0,0,0

Studies conducted over the past year on Dihydoxyphenylalanine DOPA-containing proteins from G. demissa and M. edulis suggest that these form soluble. stable complexes with type II collagen. essentially shielding the latter from digestion by clostridial collagenase. No such shielding was conferred by the Fasciola DOPA-proteins. Catecholoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of the DOPA residues to o-quinones results in a substantial tautomerizationof the quinones to alpha. beta-dehydro DOPA. The rate of tautomerization at physiological pH is comparable to the proposed Michael addition of lysyl epsilon amino groups to quinones. This may suggest that alpha. beta-dehydro DOPA is an important intermediate in quinone-tanning. A new histidine-rich DOPA-containing egg shell precursor has been characterized from Fasciola hepatica.

102077,Elastomeric gradients: a hedge against stress concentration in,,JH Waite and E Vaccaro and C Sun and JM Lucas,,,,,,The byssal threads of marine mussels are elastomeric fibres with a great capacity for absorbing and dissipating energy. Up to 70% of the total absorbed energy can be dissipated in the byssus. Because byssal threads attach the mussel to hard inert surfaces in its habitat. they must combine the need to be good shock absorbers with appropriate matching of Young’s modulus between living tissue and a hard substratum such as stone—stiffnesses that can differ by five orders of magnitude. Recent data suggest that improved modulus matching and decreased stress concentration between different portions of the byssus is achieved by the use of protein gradients. Protein gradients in byssal threads are constructed using natural macromolecular chimeras having a central collagenous domain. variable flanking modules and histidine-rich amino and carboxy termini. Stiff silk-like flanking modules prevail distally. while at the animal end. rubbery modules resembling elastin predominate. In between the two thread ends there is a mix of both module types. The histidine-rich termini provide metal binding/cross-linking sites. while collagen domains may confer self-assembly on all parts of the structure. A graded axial distribution of flanking modules is expected to moderate stress concentration in joined materials having disparate moduli.,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:BJbdYPG6LGMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jared_Lucas/publication/11452234_Elastomeric_gradients_A_hedge_against_stress_concentration_in_marine_holdfasts/links/0c960521cb8efef387000000.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jared_Lucas/publication/11452234_Elastomeric_gradients_A_hedge_against_stress_concentration_in_marine_holdfasts/links/0c960521cb8efef387000000.pdf,0,0,0

102081,The Importance of Interfacial Redox on the Mussel Protein Adhesion,,Jing Yu and Wei Wei and Eric Danner and Herbert Waite and Jacob Israelachvili,,,,,,The underwater adhesion of marine mussels relies on mussel foot proteins (mfps) rich in the catecholic amino acid 3. 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). As a side-chain. dopa is capable of strong bidentate interactions with a variety of surfaces. but its susceptibility to oxidation often renders it unreliable for adhesion. Mussels limit dopa oxidation by imposing an acidic. reducing regime in the confined space of mfp deposition. Using the Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) technique. we demonstrate that the adhesion of mfp-3 to mica is closely coupled with dopa redox and pH. Raising the pH from 3 to 7.5 decreases the adhesion energy of mfp-3 on mica 20-fold and appears to be driven by the pH-dependent oxidation of dopa. Addition of thiol-rich mfp-6 restores mfp-3 adhesion by coupling the oxidation of thiols to the reduction of dopaquinones. How mussels preserve adhesive dopa-containing proteins from oxidation has …,True,v3zMBlEAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,0,https://sites.chemengr.ucsb.edu/~ceweb/gss/pdfs/yu.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

In previous small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments conducted at the CMC-CAT beamlines. a pronounced. anisotropic SAXS signal was obtained from the fiber-containing regions. If the copper is mainly restricted to the fibers. the SAXS signal in the fiber region should be highly sensitive to variations of the incident beam energy around the copper absorption edge.

Issues in providing multimedia services on wireless include multiple access. bandwidth rationing and power control. We address the latter two issues. CDMA is assumed to be the access method. Different services have different quality (QoS) requirements. maximum power and/or minimum rate constraints. In order to achieve the required QoS they can alter their power and/or rate of transmission. Different rates are represented by varying the processing gain. Since users interfere with each other. achieving each user's QoS requirement is completely coupled with the powers. We formulate this as a constrained optimization problem.

Although much is known regarding the composition and catabolism of lipid droplets. the molecular components necessary for the biogenesis of lipid droplets have remained obscure. Here we report the characterization of a conserved gene family important for lipid droplet formation named fat-inducing transcript (FIT). FIT1 and FIT2 are endoplasmic reticulum resident membrane proteins that induce lipid droplet accumulation in cell culture and when expressed in mouse liver. shRNA silencing of FIT2 in 3T3-LI adipocytes prevents accumulation of lipid droplets. and depletion of FIT2 in zebrafish blocks diet-induced accumulation of lipid droplets in the intestine and liver. highlighting an important role for FIT2 in lipid droplet formation in vivo.

The present work relates to the development of a mathematical model for the prediction of heat transmission through multilayer clothing with air in between two successive layers of fabric in a multilayered clothing assembly. A mathematical model was developed using general equations of heat transfer through porous media and was validated using experimental results. A series of multilayered fabric assemblies were created with different combinations of fabric layers and air gaps of different thicknesses. The predicted total thermal resistance of these fabric assemblies was obtained from the model and the values were compared with experimental results. The total thermal resistance of these fabric assemblies were measured using a guarded hot plate for validating the model.

It also summarizes the contrary opinion on anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids by different research groups. Basically all nanofluid thermal conductivity models have been derived from classical models. Majority of the authors presented the thermal conductivity model based on the Brownian motion of particles and they proposed the random motion of particles is the cause for enhanced thermal conductivity. Though many models formulated on thermal conductivity and nanofluid. there is no universally accepted model and reliable mechanism for enhanced thermal conductivity over the particles volume fraction. The discrepancy between each model may be due to method of dispersion. assumption of particle and base fluid such as single and two phase flow.

We study a resistor-ferroelectric capacitor (R-FEC) network through a series of coupled equations based on Kirchhoff’s law. electrostatics. and Landau theory. We show that transient negative capacitance (NC) in a R-FEC circuit originates from the mismatch in switching rate between the free charge on the metal plate and the bound charge in a ferroelectric (FE) capacitor during the polarization switching. This transient free charge–polarization mismatch is driven by the negative curvature of the FE free-energy landscape. and it is also analytically shown that a free-energy profile with a negative curvature is the only physical system that can describe transient NC in a R-FEC circuit.

102142,Bank penetration and SHG-Bank linkage programme: A critique,2008,Pankaj Kumar and Ramesh Golait,,,,,Reserve Bank of India,This paper examines the outreach of Self Help Group (SHG)-Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP) in the backdrop of growing banking and socio-economic divide between regions in India. The ‘defining event’in the build-up of financial architecture in India was the nationalisation of major commercial banks. The aftermath of nationalisation witnessed a remarkable spread of the banking system to the unbanked and under-banked rural areas. However. the dependence on informal sources of credit has not decreased in rural areas. The problem accentuated as banks veered away from rural to urban India. The relative decline of commercial banking network in the rural areas runs contrary to the objective of financial inclusion and is a formidable challenge in the way of faster and more inclusive growth.SBLP was conceived to fill the existing gap in the formal financial network and extending the outreach of banking to the poor. However. the present distribution of the SBLP is skewed against the poorer regions of the country. While less than one-fifth of total loans to SHGs went into the Eastern and Central Regions taken together. they accounted for more than three-fifth of the total poor in India. Banks need to be encouraged as facilitators in extending the SHG movement in the poorer regions. perhaps by introducing a scheme of performance-linked incentive. Specific funds may be created to address the regional imbalances in the SBLP. SHGs need to be formed around activities of rural infrastructure such as construction and renovation of minor irrigation tanks. feeder channels. rural roads. etc. This will generate significant external economies for agricultural …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:SWgZeABleR0C,55,https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/PDFs/4BBDSWTS08.pdf,2912456902026959277,/scholar?cites=2912456902026959277,,https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/PDFs/4BBDSWTS08.pdf,0,0,0

Water quality index provides us a single number which expresses overall water quality at a certain location and time which is based on several quality parameters. The objective of an index is to turn complex water quality data into information that is understandable and usable by the public.In this paper a formula will be found to calculate water quality index when the numerical value of some of it’s quality parameters are missing. The standard formula to calculate water quality index has nine water quality parameters-biochemical oxygen demand. dissolved oxygen. pH. nitrate. phosphate. faecal coliform. turbidity. total dissolve solids and temperature. Sometimes it becomes very difficult to find out the values of all these parameters because of lack of time or because of failure in testing.

For a half rate speech codec assumed to have a frame size of 40 ms. the speech encoder puts out a fixed number of bits per 40 ms. These bits are divided into three distinct classes. referred to as Class 1. Class 2 and Class 3 bits. A subset of the Class 1 bits are further protected by a CRC for error detection purposes. The Class 1 bits and the CRC bits are encoded by a rate 1/2 Nordstrom Robinson code with codeword length of 16. The Class 2 bits are encoded by a punctured version of the Nordstrom Robinson …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:KIG7iI7jH74C,50,https://patents.google.com/patent/US5666370A/en,14026702014278740078,/scholar?cites=14026702014278740078,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9b/16/99/331ed7e11fd5df/US5666370.pdf,0,0,0

The manipulator is visually controlled with stereo vision in an eye-to-hand configuration. A novel Kohonen’s self-organizing map (KSOM) based visual servoing scheme has been proposed for a redundant manipulator with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF). The inverse kinematic relationship of the manipulator is learned using a Kohonen’s self-organizing map. This learned map is shown to be an approximate estimate of the inverse Jacobian. which can then be used in conjunction with the proportional controller to achieve closed loop servoing in real-time. It is shown through Lyapunov stability analysis that the proposed learning based servoing scheme ensures global stability. A generalized weight update law is proposed for KSOM based inverse kinematic control. to resolve the redundancy during the …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:GZelqfngyKEC,49,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889010000825,13452433566233039981,/scholar?cites=13452433566233039981,,,0,0,0

Kvβ1.3 subunits bind to the N termini of Kv1.5 α-subunits and induce fast N-type inactivation. slow the rate of deactivation. and alter the voltage dependence and kinetics of channel activation. The N terminus of a Kvβ subunit and quaternary ammonium compounds bind to the inner pore of Kv1 channels; however. it is unknown to what extent the pore binding sites for drugs and Kvβ subunits overlap. Here. we used site-directed Ala mutagenesis to scan residues of the Kv1.5 pore to define the binding site for Kvβ1.3 subunits. Individual mutations of five residues in the S6 domain (Val505. Ile508.

One hundred and fifty five patients divided in three groups and matched for age. sex. dose. duration and severity of poisoning constituted the subject matter. Significant hypomagnesemia was observed in patients who did not receive magnesium sulphate (group 1). Two dose schedules of MgSO4 therapy were tried. The dose schedule No. 1 given to patients of group 2 did not raise the magnesium levels significantly as compared to controls (group 4). The difference in the mortality between groups 1 & 2 was also not significant. On the other hand. the dose schedule No. 2 given to patients of group 3 raised the magnesium levels significantly and these remained above normal limits throughout the observed period. This dose schedule brought down the mortality significantly than dose schedule No. 1 (p< 0.001). It was also found that dose schedule No. 2 has been effective in reducing the mortality irrespective of dose of pesticide consumed and its efficacy was due to rapid rise in magnesium levels. It is suggested that hypomagnesemia might be responsible for high mortality of patients of aluminium phosphide poisoning and its correction has beneficial effect on the management and ultimate favourable outcome of the illness.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:RwQ8IgSj6xkC,42,https://europepmc.org/article/med/7829435,7790062864718929596,/scholar?cites=7790062864718929596,,,0,0,0

In most of the applications of wireless sensor networks. the event information without its location information has no significance. The well known traditional Distance-Vector Hop (DV Hop) algorithm and weighted centroid DV Hop based algorithms can be easily implemented in real wireless sensor networks with low cost and no additional hardware requirement. but it has poor localization accuracy and high power consumption. In order to avoid these limitations. a weighted centroid DV-Hop algorithm is proposed in this paper.

In the field of biophysics of cancer. a large body of research has been focused on the comparison between normal and cancer mechanics and slowly the hypothesis that cancer cells are softer than their normal counterparts has been accepted. even though in situ tumor tissue is usually stiffer than the surrounding normal tissue. This corroborates the idea that the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) has a critical role in regulating tumor cell properties and behavior. Rearrangements in ECM can lead to changes in cancer cell mechanics and in specific conditions the general assumption about cancer cell softening could be confuted.

PPD) poisoning has high morbidity and mortality and its incidence has increased dramatically in the past 4 years. A prospective study was planned to assess the clinical profile and outcome with different treatment approaches. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material comprised of 1020 cases admitted in Medicine Department of MLB Medical College. Jhansi. UP from July 2004 to March 2009. Out of 1020 cases 697 cases were of stone hair dye poisoning and 323 cases were of other branded hair dyes (powdered form containing less amount of Paraphenylene diamine). Diagnosis was made solely on the basis of the history given by cases/attendant and symptoms of neck swelling. black coloured urine and muscular pain. The cases were thoroughly studied for different complications (renal. hepatic and cardiac etc) and were treated accordingly. RESULTS: Out of 1020 cases studied. majority were females in the age group of 15-45 yrs (n= 734) while the rest were males. A total of 244 (23.92%) cases expired during treatment.

The process is highly inefficient. as only 10 to 15 pct of the charge gets converted into silicon carbide. No published attempt has been made to optimize this century-old process by applying mathematical modeling. Therefore. a simultaneous heat- and mass-transfer model has been developed for the resistance-heating furnace. considering silicon carbide formation as a typical carbothermal reaction.

102202,Human action recognition using RGB-D sensor and deep convolutional neural networks,2016,Javed Imran and Praveen Kumar,,,,144-148,IEEE,In this paper. we propose an approach to recognize human actions by the fusion of RGB and Depth data. Firstly. Motion History Images (MHI) are generated from RGB videos which represent the temporal information about the action. Then the original depth data is rotated in 3D point clouds and three Depth Motion Maps (DMM) are generated over the entire depth sequence corresponding to the front. side and top projection views. A 4 Channel Deep Convolutional Neural Network is trained. where the first channel is for classifying MHIs and the remaining three for the front. side and top view generated from depth data respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on publically available UTD-MHAD dataset which contains both RGB and depth videos.

Heidelberg,Software Transactional Memory Systems (STM) are a promising alternative for concurrency control in shared memory systems. Multiversion STM systems maintain multiple versions for each t-object. The advantage of storing multiple versions is that it facilitates successful execution of higher number of read operations than otherwise. Multi-Version permissiveness (mv-permissiveness) is a progress condition for multi-version STMs that states that a read-only transaction never aborts. Recently a STM system was proposed that maintains only a single version but is mv-permissive. This raises a natural question: how much concurrency can be achieved by multi-version STM. We show that fewer transactions are aborted in multi-version STMs than single-version systems. We also show that any STM system that is permissive w.r.t opacity must maintain at least as many versions as the number of live transactions.

Flow phenomena such as dynamic stall. flutter. and gust response all require appropriate experimental modeling in order to fully investigate the flow details. Many unsteady testing situations involve the dynamic movement of a model in the wind-tunnel test section. These methods provide suitable simulation of moving bodies in a fluid; however. the effects due to varying flow conditions are not adequately modeled by model movement alone due to viscous and compressibility effects.

Inspired by this a novel genetic algorithm (GA) is presented here. Various mutation operators such as small mutation. gene mutation and chromosome mutation have been applied in this genetic algorithm. In order to facilitate the implementation of the above-mentioned mutation operators a modified way of representing the variables has been presented. It resembles the way genetic information is coded in living beings. Different mutation operators pose a challenge as regards the determination of the optimal rate of mutation.

What has passed for secularism in Punjab. therefore. bore the impress of communalism both incremental and fundamental. and conditioned the new emerging socio-economic and political order. The religion-based politics professed by the Akali Dal and the Jan Sangh is an open fact of their religio-political history.

This is despite the inherent contradictions between professed religious doctrines and the contemporary functional politics. which is essentially lacking in commitment to human and moral values. not in our own country alone but also in many others. It may be relevant to mention that the use of religion in the contemporary history of India was made by Mahatma Gandhi.

The issue is addressed in a passive way by designing the fuel cell with low thermal conductivity materials. Use of low thermal conductivity materials for cell fabrication led to higher cell temperatures. The liquid water formation was delayed to high current densities due to increase in saturation pressure and higher buoyancy induced flow. Peak power density was increased by 36% and the limiting current density was increased by 37.5% when the cell was redesigned with low thermal conductivity materials.

We constructed a general human GRN from extensive transcription factor and microRNA target data obtained from public databases. In a subnetwork of this GRN that is active during estrogen stimulation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. we benchmarked automated algorithms for identifying core regulatory genes (transcription factors and microRNAs). Among these algorithms. we identified K-core decomposition. pagerank and betweenness centrality algorithms as the most effective for discovering core regulatory genes in the network evaluated based on previously known roles of these genes in MCF-7 biology as well as in their ability to explain the up or down expression status of up to 70% of the remaining genes. Finally. we validated the use of K-core algorithm for organizing the GRN in an easier to interpret layered hierarchy where more influential regulatory genes percolate towards the inner layers.

102280,Interference effect of two nearby strip footings on reinforced sand,2009,Priyanka Ghosh and Pawan Kumar,2,Contemporary Engineering Sciences,12,577-592,,In this study. a number of model tests were conducted to study the interference effect of two near-by strip footings on dry. reinforced Ennore sand bed. Single layer of uniaxial geogrid was used for reinforcing the foundation bed. To study the interference effect between the two footings. first. the bearing capacity of single isolated footing was obtained and later on. that of closely spaced footings was determined. The experimental study indicates that the bearing capacity of single footing on the reinforced soil decreases with increase in D/B. where D and B are the depth of reinforcement and width of footing. respectively. The bearing capacity factor due to the unit weight of soil is found to decrease with increase in the width of footing. The effect of centre to centre spacing (S) between two footings. on their bearing capacity and settlement is mainly focused in this paper.

Civil Engineering Division,,145-150,Institution of Engineers,Nowadays. the performance required for concrete structures is more complicated and diversified. The concrete is required to have properties like high fluidity. self-compactability. high strength. high durability. better serviceability and long service life of concrete structures. Self-compactability is desirable to attain rationalized and labour saving effects in manufacturing and placing of concrete. Self-compacting concrete (SCQ is a highly engineered concrete that addresses these requirements. It was developed around 1988 in Japan. to improve the durability of concrete structures. The early stage deteriorations of concrete structures are a result of the manual placing and the inadequate consolidation. Therefore. the need for the development of concrete with high fluidity and no segregation was felt. This paper deals with the history of SCC development and its basic principle. different testing methods to test high-flowability. resistance against segregation. and possibility.

We report a case of AIHA occurring in association with PBC. which has responded to treatment with UDCA alone. Possible mechanisms of autoimmune hemolysis in this patient include bile salt induced immune dysregulation and direct damage to red cell membranes by bile salts leading to exposure of neoantigens and development of red cell autoantibodies.

Large voltage driven RF-MEMS switches are a major concern in space bound communication applications. In this paper. we propose a low voltage driven RF MEMS capacitive switch with the introduction of perforations and reinforcement. The performance of the fabricated switch is compared with conventional capacitive RF MEMS switches. The pull-in voltage of the switch is reduced from 70 V to 16.2 V and the magnitude of deformation is reduced from 8 µm to 1 µm. The design of the reinforcement frame enhances the structural stiffness by 46% without affecting the high frequency response of the switch. The measured isolation and insertion loss of the reinforced switch is more than 20 dB and 0.4 dB over the X band range.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:o0tJHVzi6PsC,20,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6439/aa4ea1/meta,13632088048295597629,/scholar?cites=13632088048295597629,,,0,0,0

Velocity as well as mass slips are considered at the boundary. The governing PDEs are transformed into self-similar nonlinear ODEs by similarity transformations. The reduced nonlinear equations are solved numerically. The momentum boundary layer thickness is reduced for increase of permeability and suction parameters. whereas it increases with blowing parameter. The increase of velocity slip parameter reduces the momentum boundary layer thickness and also enhances the mass transfer from the plate.

Heterotrophic bacteria have gained recent appreciation for their major role in marine N budget by fixing a significant amount of N2.

Maximum areal rates (8 mmol N m-2 d-1) were the highest ever observed anywhere in world oceans. Our results suggest that the eastern Arabian Sea gains ~92% of its new nitrogen through N2 fixation.

As a generalization of the classical binary search for ordered array. suppose one wishes to find a specific element in an ordered array by making comparisons. where each comparison indicates the endpoint closer to the desired element. Given the likelihood of each element being the one searched. the objective is to compute a search strategy that minimizes the expected number of comparisons. Practical applications of this problem include file system synchronization and software testing. Here this paper presents a new algorithm which is 2 times faster than classical Binary Search. This represents a significant improvement over previous Binary Search Algorithm having worst case complexity O (log n). This New algorithm Quadratic Search having worst case complexity O (log n/2).

Spherical particles ranging in diameter between 20 and 80 nm were obtained. The stoichiometric composition of the powder was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the technique of neutron activation analysis after calcination at different temperatures. Enhanced surface activity in the form of an increase in oxygen content was observed to be maximum in the powder calcined around 800°C. This behaviour is attributed to differences in microchemical stoichiometry. i.e. presence of active centers which are most likely localised in crystallographically defective configurations thereby leading to chemisorptive hydroxyl incorporation at these local sites.

In this paper. a new thermal conductivity model is proposed based on the combination of statistical mechanism model and Brownian motion with the inclusion of particle critical size. This model is compared with Al2O3/water and CuO/water based nanofluids of spherical particles using the well known thermal conductivity models and the experimental results available in the open literature. This model is found fits well with the existing Brownian motion theoretical model and experimental results. It concludes that thermal conductivity is enhanced due to the effect of shape. nanolayer and Brownian motion of the particles.

This method uses the concept of Residual Number System (RNS) based on Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for share creation and share stacking of a given image. First. Secret image is hidden in cover image to get stego-image; a pixel (8 bit) of a Stego-image is taken and added with an eight bit key to get a cipher pixel. The algorithm used is additive mod 255. The key is generated using a pseudo random number generator and Mixed Key Generation technique. After encryption the cipher pixel is mapped into a Residue Number System of ‘n’Shares. These ‘n’Shares are stored or transmitted to the destination. The proposed approach like any other visual cryptographic approach is very secure. efficient. reliable. fast and easy to implement.

Character data is used for training the neural network and SVM. The trained network is used for classification and recognition. For the neural network. each character is resized into 70x50 pixels. which is directly subjected to training. That is. each resized character has 3500 pixels and these pixels are taken as features for training the neural network. For the SVM classifier recognition model is divided in two phases namely. training and testing phase.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,A 28‐year‐old woman with mirror‐image dextrocardia and severe rheumatic mitral stenosis underwent successful percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV). Standard technique was altered to include transseptal catheterization via the left femoral vein and inter‐atrial septal puncture with the transseptal needle rotated to a 7 o'clock position. The predilatation transmitral gradient (mean) of 16 mmHg decreased to 5 mmHg following PBMV. The valve area improved from 1.0 cm2 to 2.6 cm2. There were no complications.

Electrical power system developed so far was of three phases since the beginning of the last century but research in the field of multi-phase machines have attracted increased interest in recent years due to the several advantages that they offer as compared to the conventional three-phase ones. such as high power handling capability by dividing the required power between multiple phases. reduced torque pulsations and higher reliability. In particular. unlike in a three phase drive. the loss of stator phase does not prevent the machine from starting and running. Increased torque per ampere for the same volume machine due to reduced stator copper losses and reduced rotor harmonic currents have paved its wider acceptability of utilization.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:WAzi4Gm8nLoC,15,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10707273210549830534&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10707273210549830534,/scholar?cites=10707273210549830534,,,0,0,0

The dermatology clinical postings are generally poorly attended. and the clinical acumen of an average medical graduate in this specialty is quite low. Aims: To develop and implement Computer Assisted Objective Structured Clinical Examination (CA-OSCE) as a means of end of dermatology posting evaluation. Also. to assess its effectiveness in improving the motivation. attendance and learning of undergraduate students with respect to their visual recognition skills and problem solving ability. Methods: We designed and introduced CA-OSCE as a means of end of posting assessment. The average attendance and assessment scores of students undergoing CA-OSCE were compiled and compared using ‘independent t test’with the scores of previous year’s students who had undergone assessment with essay type questions. Results: The average attendance and average assessment scores for the candidates undergoing CA-OSCE were found to 83.36% and 77.47%. respectively as compared to 64.09% and 52.07%. respectively for previous years’ students. The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant. Student acceptability of the technique was also high. and their subjective feedback was encouraging.

The intercooler uses initially a binary mixture of ethylene glycol:water at 30:70 ratio as a shell-side base fluid and later uses nanofluids with Al2O3 nanoparticles of different volume concentrations. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the system was estimated at different shell-side fluid flow rates of 1. 1.5 and 2 LPM. COP was found to increase with the decrease in the refrigerant temperature at the compressor inlet. due to the reduction in the compressor work input. A highest increment in the COP of around 31 % was observed for the base fluid and 49.32 % was observed for the 0.75 % nanofluid with a flow rate of 2 LPM compared with the case without intercooler. An appreciable reduction in power consumption of 12.24 % was also observed.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:8cBNEdFwSQkC,14,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13369-015-1644-7,5488067017997254070,/scholar?cites=5488067017997254070,,,0,0,0

An emphasis is placed on understanding the transient deformation history. We study the effect of the Reynolds number. capillary number. and droplet to carrier fluid viscosity ratio on deformation. In the low Reynolds number limit. we expect the droplet deformation to be independent of Reynolds number. We examine moderate Reynolds numbers in the range of 10–100 and show that inertia plays a significant role in droplet deformation both in the magnitude of steady-state as well as transient deformations. For Reynolds numbers greater than 25. we observe non-monotonic deformation histories. At higher Reynolds numbers we also observe cavity regions forming at the trailing edge of the droplets. These cavity regions appear to be unstable due to their relatively high interfacial curvature …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:CC3C2HR4nz8C,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301932214001396,6697506423431964511,/scholar?cites=6697506423431964511,,,0,0,0

The reactions were of first order with respect to BIDC and hydrogen-ion. However. Michaelis-Menten type kinetics were observed with respect to aldehyde. The deuterium isotope effect for the oxidation of acetaldehyde (kH/kD= 6.36 at 298 K) indicated an α-C–H bond cleavage in the rate-determining step. Based on kinetic data. analyses of the solvent effect and results of structure-reactivity correlation along with some nonkinetic parameters suggested a mechanism involving rate-determining oxidative decomposition of a aldehyde-BIDC complex via a cyclic transition state to give a carbocationic species through hydride-ion transfer from the aldehyde to the oxidant.(doi: 10.5562/cca1694),True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:Hck25ST_3aIC,14,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/103909,10886851610088906378,/scholar?cites=10886851610088906378,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/103909,0,0,0

METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhaled nitric oxide was utilized for the management of residual pulmonary hypertension in 24 children following surgical correction of their underlying heart defects. Their ages ranged from 15 days to 14 months (median 5 months). Pulmonary artery hypertension was diagnosed either by direct pulmonary artery pressure monitoring or by echocardiography. Inhaled nitric oxide was used electively in 22 patients when the ratio of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and mean systemic arterial pressure exceeded 0.5. In the remaining 2 patients. nitric oxide was used only to manage a pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Inhaled nitric oxide was also used a second time in 2 patients who developed delayed pulmonary hypertensive crisis. Twenty-two patients showed an initial response to therapy and the pulmonary artery pressures dropped significantly. Of the patients on direct pulmonary artery pressure monitoring. a pulmonary artery to systemic artery pressure ratio below 0.3 on prolonged therapy was associated with a survival ratio of 4/6 (including 1 neurological death and one reoperation); that between 0.3 and 0.5 with a survival ratio of 3/4.

Ltd.,Background: Appropriate management of endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressure is essential during mechanical ventilation of an intubated patient. The ETT cuff should be inflated in order to seal the airway without volume loss or pharyngeal content aspiration. It is desirable that the cuff seal the airway without exerting high pressure on the trachea to compromise mucosal circulation. The aim of this study is to assess importance of monitoring of ETT cuff pressure in intubated patients and effect of intervention in preventing complications related to over and under inflation of ETT cuff. Method: An observational prospective study performed between January and April 2015. All patients having cardiac surgery with cuffed ETT insertion were included. In Group1 cuff pressure manometer was used to monitor the cuff pressure and adjusted in the range of 20-30 cm H2O within 15 min before going on cardiopulmonary bypass. In Group2 only minimal leak test (MLT) done to guide inflation and cuff pressure measured by cuff pressure manometer but no intervention was made. Patients were followed in postsurgical care till extubation and observed till discharge for complication like sore throat. voice changes and tracheomalacia.Results: In group 1 9 (25.7%) patient had cuff pressure within normal limit whereas 25 (71.4%) patient had cuff pressure higher than normal and 1 (2.9%) patient had cuff pressure measurement less than 20 cm H2O. Volume of air added or removed from cuff was-0.89±1.14 to optimize cuff pressure. Cuff pressure ranged from 15 to 120 (47±23) cm H2O.

India,The simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker analysis was carried out to determine the diversity among 18 rice varieties grown in Bihar. In total. 223 alleles were detected at the 30 SSR loci. of which all were polymorphic. The number of alleles generated by each marker ranged from 3 to 12 with an average 7.43 alleles per locus. The size of alleles ranged from  66 (RM 161) to 607 bp (RM 128). Polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged 0.059 (RM 161) to 0.929  (RM 429) with an average of 0.665 per marker. A dendrogram based on SSR polymorphism grouped all the 18 rice varieties into three major clusters. effectively differentiating the long. medium and short period of maturity varieties. except Richharia that has short maturity period but placed with medium maturity period varieties. It could be concluded that SSR markers are powerful tools to assess the genetic diversity of the varieties.

Their main function is to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2-a common end product of oxidative metabolism) to water. rendering it harmless. H2O2 is a strong oxidizing agent; it can be toxic if allowed to accumulate. Thus. peroxidases play a major role in removing excess H2O2 in cells under normal and stress conditions. Horseradish(Armoracia rusticana) is widely used plants and has thick pulpy yellow roots. spicy taste and antibiotic and anti-inflammatory ability. Peroxidases are versatile biocatalyst with an ever increasing number of applicationsAt present the roots of horseradish serves as the major source of commercially available peroxidase. however. investigations are being carried out for new peroxidases with higher stability and properties that can be exploited for different biotechnological. biomedical and other application.

PLS structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data.Findings and implications–The results show that the aspects of product fairness and price fairness are positively correlated to the attitudes of shoppers’ towards firms that resort to such practices. Additionally. shoppers’ attitudes and their perceived behavioral control further influence their intentions to consider a firm’s ethicality while anticipating a purchase. In terms of lifestyle aspects. the self-confidence and health consciousness of consumers do not moderate the relationship between attitude and intentions. As a whole. consumers offer hints that it is high time for marketers to start developing a sense of obligation to adhere to relevant ethical practices under vulnerable circumstances. Accordingly. it is suggested that managers offer products that are safe and pose the least risks. and that they set rational and justifiable prices.Limitation–This study has been limited to facial care products in Malaysia.Originality–This study addresses and operationalizes fairness aspects of products and their pricing from a consumer perspective through a rigorous review of the marketing and business ethics literature.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:An6A6Jpfc1oC,11,https://hrcak.srce.hr/160391,17326136630445011189,/scholar?cites=17326136630445011189,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/236651,0,0,0

This result decreases electrical signal to noise ratio (SNR) and because of this degradation it impaired performance. In this paper. we are discuss a comparative analysis of bit error rate (BER) performance for the on-off keying (OOK) modulated direct detection and coherent detection FSO communication systems in weak turbulence conditions. We present a statistical channel model called as log-normal distribution to describe the irradiance fluctuations in weak turbulence for FSO communication systems. First. we investigate performance of the direct detection FSO system over the log-normal turbulence channel and derived the closed form expression for BER in term of average received irradiance and SNR. and then we do same for coherent detection FSO system. finally …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:HtEfBTGE9r8C,11,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7279942/,5423161533078231186,/scholar?cites=5423161533078231186,,,0,0,0

The different pastes (FSP1 and 2) and the different crystallographic orientations of the Si surfaces studied strongly affected the contact resistance. The microstructure of the contacts was analyzed in plan-view and cross-section by combined scanning and analytical transmission electron microscopy. A controlled grinding process rather than a chemical etching process was applied for the plan-view sample preparation. For textured cells processed with different pastes. pronounced differences were seen in the contact resistances (FSP1: efficiency 16.9% and contact resistance 20 mΩ cm2. FSP2: 17.8% and < 5 mΩ cm2).

102484,Development of a single-shot lifetime PSP measurement technique for rotating surfaces,2010,Pradeep Kumar,,,,,,In this work. the viability of using pressure-sensitive paints as a pressure sensor on rotating surfaces with unsteady pressure fluctuations has been investigated. A lifetime-based single-shot technique is demonstrated on a small prototype rotor with blade-tip speeds on the order of 50 m/s. In the single-shot approach. all of the required intensity information is acquired from excitation by a single pulse of light to avoid any errors caused by non-uniformities of the illumination and paint application on the surface. This technique eliminates the need of image averaging. and provides instantaneous surface pressure even for low-speed applications. PSP with pressure sensitivity of 0.8% change in ratio of image-intensity per kPa. a 532nm PIV laser system. optics. and a fire-wire CCD camera are used for this application. The lifetime sensitivity to oxygen concentration of some widely used pressure-sensitive paints has been investigated using a photomultiplier tube as well as a CCD camera. with respect to possible abilities and limitations of the paints for the discussed application. The results of the phase-locked lifetime measurements in environments having overall surface pressure gradients as small as 3.0 kPa show that this technique is capable of accurately resolving small pressure changes.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:rUiCm8s56TIC,11,https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1285044595,5914407189406826779,/scholar?cites=5914407189406826779,,https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1285044595&disposition=inline,0,0,0

In the 1990’s. ERP systems were introduced to fulfill some of the technological requirements across functional areas within a corporate boundary. Moreover. with the exponential growth of Internet technology and the emergence of e-business. the focus of ERP systems has changed from an integrated functional focus within an organization to one reaching outside the organization throughout the value chain system. It is expected that an ERP system can facilitate an e-business effort of an organization. In order to serve as a platform for e-business. an ERP system must also be able to be extended to support a range of external constituents for a firm.

Appl. Sci. Res,5,34-45,,Water quality of the River Ghaghara has been examined in special reference to seven heavy metals namely cobalt (Co). copper (Cu). chromium (Cr). nickel (Ni). cadmium (Cd). zinc (Zn). lead (Pb). and on seasonal basis for two consecutive years 2013-14 and 2014-15. Samples were collected from five stations namely Katernia ghat. Colonelganj. Ayodhya. Dohrighat. and Chhapra. In the water of the river maximum value of Co. Cu. Cr. Ni. Cd. Zn. Pb and was recorded as 0.027. 0.032. 0.007. 0.018. 0.043. 0.031 and 0.019 mg/l respectively whereas the minimum value was recorded 0.005. 0.016. 0.001. 0.005. 0.003. 0.013. 0.005 mg/l respectively at different sites. Most of the above values were found either below or closed the permissible limit set by World Health Organization (WHO) except Cd. Cadmium concentration exceeded the WHO limit. Cd contamination in the river water of this area is a serious concern for human health. Correlation analysis among all considered heavy metals shows positive correlation with each other in both the years. The data generated may provide useful information to Governmental agencies to control the heavy metal pollution of the river at these urban centers which may even be worst in future scenario. The present experimental data indicates that the pollution level along the river Ghaghara is not very high but the increasing population load in the basin may cause irreparable ecological harm in the long-term well masked by short term economic prosperity,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:0SnApaDgcCoC,10,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harendra_Singh9/publication/257808800_Assessment_of_Geochemical_Environment_from_Study_of_River_Sediments_in_the_Middle_Stretch_of_River_Ganga_at_Ghazipur_Buxar_and_Ballia_area/links/5991d04caca27289539bae2e/Assessment-of-Geochemical-Environment-from-Study-of-River-Sediments-in-the-Middle-Stretch-of-River-Ganga-at-Ghazipur-Buxar-and-Ballia-area.pdf,14410104193777567575,/scholar?cites=14410104193777567575,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harendra_Singh9/publication/257808800_Assessment_of_Geochemical_Environment_from_Study_of_River_Sediments_in_the_Middle_Stretch_of_River_Ganga_at_Ghazipur_Buxar_and_Ballia_area/links/5991d04caca27289539bae2e/Assessment-of-Geochemical-Environment-from-Study-of-River-Sediments-in-the-Middle-Stretch-of-River-Ganga-at-Ghazipur-Buxar-and-Ballia-area.pdf,0,0,0

East Antarctica,2013,Rajesh Asthana and Prakash Kumar Shrivastava and Hari Bahadur Srivastava and Mirza Javed Beg and Pradeep Kumar,24,Adv Polar Sci,4,281-295,,Fisher Island and Broknes Peninsula in the Larsemann Hills constitute part of a polar lowland periglacial environment between marine and glacial ecosystems. The landscape is characterized by gently rolling hills and broad valleys interspersed with lakes formed in glacially scoured basins. We analyzed the physicochemical parameters and the ionic constituents of water samples from 10 lakes in each of these two locations. Our results showed considerable differences between the two regions and demonstrated the influence of lithology and processes including weathering. evaporation. and atmospheric precipitation. All major cations and anions in the lake waters showed positive correlations indicating balanced ionic concentrations. Unconsolidated sediments were sparsely distributed and scattered over glacial deposits. valley fills. and occasional moraine ridges. The type and rate of sedimentation was mainly controlled by surface run-off and aeolian influx. The sediment samples from lake beds and the catchment area on Fisher Island were immature and poorly to very poorly sorted. consisting of gravelly sand with negligible silt and finer fractions. Sediments had a polymodal grain size distribution with the two major populations lying between− 2 and− 1 phi and between 0 and 1.5 phi. The sediments were lithic arenite to arkosic in composition and the microtextures imprinted over quartz grains were dominated by mechanical textures resulting from several stages of glacial crushing and grinding.

Limited,Fifty years of electoral history of Punjab has been intermeshed with issues relating to competing identities. regional autonomy. and the political perception of threat and need paradox of democratic institutions. These issues together or separately have influenced the dynamics of electoral politics. The articulation of these issues in various elections has been influenced by the socio-economic and political context. These broad boundaries found expression in electoral discourse in four distinct phases:(i) pre-reorganisation from 1947 to 1966.(ii) post reorganisation from 1966 to 1980.(iii) terrorism phase from 1980 to 1992. and (iv) post-terrorism from 1992 onwards. Historically. social mobilizations and political articulation have also taken diverse forms. These assertions can be categorised under three main headings. ie. communal. caste. or religion; secular; or strata based. All these competing identities have been coexisting. For instance. Punjab had a culture and a language which transcended religious group boundaries. a unified politico administrative unit and specialized modern technology. which initiated the integration process of the diverse religious. caste. and other ascriptive group identities. Nonetheless. the tendency to evolve a unified sub-nationality with a common urge for territorial integrity remained weak in Punjab. On the contrary. politics mobilized people along communal lines resulting in the partition in 1947 and division in 1966 of the Punjabi-speaking people. All these forms of assertion have coexisted. Historically. the process of formulating communal identities was preceded by the assertion of separate religious group identities …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:A_-8YG8SPFQC,10,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4532210715549351538&hl=en&oi=scholarr,4532210715549351538,/scholar?cites=4532210715549351538,,,0,0,0

After neutron activation. Hg was released upon heating from 100 C to 500 C at 100 C steps and the activity ratio of 197Hg/203Hg was measured for each released fraction. After the correction for the interfering γ-rays of 75Se to 203Hg. the ratios obtained from the Dhajala meteorite (bulk and magnetically separated samples) were identical to those of the Hg monitor as well as standard rock samples (JB-1. basalt. and JG-1. granodiorite). An apparently low ratio of 196Hg/202Hg was observed at high temperature (500 C) for the Allende meteorite reference sample. As such a low value was not reproduced in another run. the presence of isotopically anomalous Hg in the Allende reference sample can not be concluded. Hg/Se ratio was observed to be very high in the nonmagnetic fraction of Dhajala compared with that in the magnetic fraction. suggesting that Hg is less chalcophile than Se.

102555,Design. Implementation. and Evaluation of new MAC Protocols for Long Distance 802.11 Networks,2006,Pavan Kumar,,with Bhaskaran Raman,,,,802.11 MAC is based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and was designed to be used in an indoor environment where a small number of wireless nodes share a common channel. It has been shown in Digital Gangetic Plains project that 802.11 hardware can be used beyond its intended use of WLANs by connecting long distance wireless links spread over tens of kilometers. These links have been used to operate voice (telephone through Voice over IP) and video (telemedicine through Video over IP) applications. But the existing MAC protocols like CSMA/CA that operate on 802.11 hardware do not work well in these outdoor wireless networks because of hidden node problem. huge Round Trip Time (RTT) and unnecessary contention. In this thesis. we therefore motivate the need for design and development of new MAC protocols to operate on point-to-point and point-to-mulitpoint long distance links to obtain better performance and flexibility compared to CSMA/CA. This report describes the implementation of two new MAC protocols 2P and SRAWAN that are suited for these long distance 802.11 networks. SRAWAN is designed from scratch. Even though the design of 2P exists. a significant challenge here is the implementation of these protocols on the off-the-shelf 802.11 Atheros hardware to preserve cost benefits. We have implemented 2P and SRAWAN by exploiting the flexibilities in the HAL code and Madwifi driver of Atheros AR5212 chipsets. The report then presents experimental evaluation of 2P and SRAWAN.

Steel braces in a braced frame undergo large axial deformations in tension and compression to dissipate the seismic energy. However. past studies have shown that SCBFs exhibit the soft‐story hinge mechanisms and unpredictable failure patterns under earthquake loading conditions. These inelastic responses along with the use of continuous structural sections as columns over consecutive floors induce flexural demand that is not considered in the current design practice. In this study. the evaluation of seismic performance of nine SCBFs designed as per the current practice has been carried out for three different story heights (i.e.. three‐story. six‐story. and nine‐story) and three types of brace configurations (namely …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:66S1BDY1aroC,8,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eqe.2867,16889609753335767564,/scholar?cites=16889609753335767564,,,0,0,0

In this paper. robust pitch control of a flight control system has been designed using fractional order controllers. In order to obtain the optimal values of the controller gains & orders such that the system offers robust response. the mixed sensitivity formulation has been expressed as multi-objective optimization problem based on generate first choose later (GFCL) approach. Multi-objective genetic algorithm has been used for designing the fractional order controllers. From the simulations it is clear that. all the controllers designed using MOGA offers robust response and the value of the infinity norm of sensitivity and complementary sensitivity function is also less than one.

102578,Molecular characterization and cultivar identification in Bougainvillea spp. using SSR markers,2014,P Pavan Kumar and T Janakiram and KV Bhat and RITU Jain and KV Prasad and KV Prabhu,84,Indian J. Agric. Sci,,1024-1030,,The present study was undertaken to determine the genetic relatedness and molecular characterization of fifty bougainvillea cultivars that belong to four major species of bougainvillea namely B. glabra. B. spectabilis. B. peruviana and Bougainvillea× buttiana. Five microsatellite (simple sequence repeat; SSR) markers with high PIC values were used to characterize these bougainvillea cultivars. A total of 28 alleles were detected at an average number of alleles of 5.6 alleles/locus. The PIC values varied widely among primers and ranged from 0.364 to 0.891 with an average of 0.716 per locus and the size of the amplified products ranged from 90bp to 250bp. Primer BOUG-1 showed the highest polymorphism index content (0.891) thus reflecting it’s ability to differentiate these cultivars much better at molecular level. A total of 18 rare alleles were identified among which the cultivar (Blondie) had maximum number of rare alleles (3). An unweighted pair group method cluster analysis (UPGMA) based on similarity values revealed five main clusters with Cluster I being the largest one encompassing 18 cultivars while cluster IV and V emerged as the smallest ones comprising 3 cultivars each. The pair wise estimates of genetic distance ranged from 0 (Cherry Blossom to Mary Palmer Special) to 1.0 (Blondie to Shubhra. Partha. Lady Hope. Gloriosus. Red September. Zakiriana.

The organic materials are mobile in the ground water and constitute a major off site pollution hazard. Large volumes of effluent are often discharged on small areas of land. which aggravates leaching. The effluents contain undesirable elements which create many serious changes in soil. water and physiological disorder in plants. human beings and animals. The result showed that effluent even if it is partially treated have high values of different physicochemical parameters. Partially treated distillery effluent when passed through lysimeter (fill up of different soil layers). various chemical constituents are initially absorbed by the soil layers but the values further increased with time due to limited soil capabilities. From these observations it may be concluded that the soil has capacity to absorb/adsorb the pollutants but their continsuous application may reduce the absorbing/adsorbing capacity of soil. The physical (sand. silt. clay etc.) and chemical characteristics (colloids elements. electrolytes etc.) of soil till saturation appear to be effective in ‘filtering out’and ‘reacting with’to improve the leachate composition and subsequently on saturation soil become ineffective and toxicant may easily reach to the ground water.

Ayurvedic medicines etc. India has a long history in the use of a large number of medicinal and aromatic plants for various purposes. These plants play an important role in the healthcare of people around the world. especially in the developing countries. Until the advent of modern medicines. man depended on plants for treating human and livestock diseases.Though. about 95 per cent of the requirement of medicinal plants in herbal drug industry is met from natural sources. due to the dwindling resources and the need for continuous supply in bulk quantities of medicinal plants of uniform quality. the cultivation of medicinal plants in our country has become a necessity. Further. intercropping medicinal plants with other medicinal plants or with tree components or horticulture crops is an attractive option as that would increase land use efficiency and simultaneously improve the economic status of the farmers (Kurian et al.. 2003).,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:edDO8Oi4QzsC,8,http://14.139.158.120:8000/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/174/Influence%20of%20arecanut%20on%20Economic%20Yield%20and%20Quality%20Parameters%20of%20Medicinal%20Plants.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,15663105222477426742,/scholar?cites=15663105222477426742,,http://14.139.158.120:8000/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/174/Influence%20of%20arecanut%20on%20Economic%20Yield%20and%20Quality%20Parameters%20of%20Medicinal%20Plants.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Objective  The objective of this study is to evaluate and analyze the frequency dependence hearing loss in tympanic membrane perforation based on the size and the site of perforation.  Methods  For the study. I selected 71 patients’ (89) ears for the cross-sectional study with tympanic membrane perforations; I examined the size and the site of perforations under the microscope and classified them into small. moderate. large. and subtotal perforations. and into anterior central. posterior central. malleolor central. and big central perforations. I measured mean level of speech frequencies hearing loss. and its relation with the site and the size of the perforation analyzed.  Results  The mean hearing loss at different sizes of the perforation at all speech frequencies was 37.4 dB. with ABG of 26.6 dB. and its maximum loss was detected in subtotal perforation of 42.3 dB. with ABG of 33.7 dB. at 500 Hz frequency. while in relation to the sites. it was 38.2 dB. with ABG of 26.8 dB. and its maximum loss was detected in big central site perforation of 42.1 dB. with ABG of 33.6 dB. at 500 Hz frequency.  Conclusions  The hearing loss was proportionally related with the sizes of the perforations. and the posterior site had greater impact on the hearing than anterior site perforations. This was also applied to the frequency dependence hearing level. as was detected to be worse at lower frequencies as 500 Hz. than those of 1000-2000 Hz.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:w_ORaKkuc5QC,7,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1809-48642017000400336&script=sci_arttext,18032477412663209693,/scholar?cites=18032477412663209693,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1809-48642017000400336&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Herein we report a reversible control over the functioning of a mechanosensitive ion channel by interfering with its interaction with the lipid bilayer. The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance from Escherichia coli is reconstituted into liposomes and activated to its different sub-open states by titrating lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into the lipid bilayer. Activated channels are closed back by the removal of LPC out of the membrane by bovine serum albumin (BSA). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra showed the LPC-dose-dependent gradual opening of the channel pore in the form of incrementally increasing spin label mobility and decreasing spin-spin interaction. A method to reversibly open and close mechanosensitive channels to distinct sub-open conformations during their journey from the closed to the fully open state enables detailed structural studies to follow the conformational changes during channel functioning. The ability of BSA to revert the action of LPC opens new perspectives for the functional studies of other membrane proteins that are known to be activated by LPC.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,7,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00409/full,556549581932765652,/scholar?cites=556549581932765652,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2016.00409/full,0,0,0

Flow phenomena such as dynamic stall. flutter. and gust response all require appropriate experimental modeling in order to fully investigate the flow details. Many unsteady testing situations involve the dynamic movement of a model in the wind tunnel test section. These methods provide suitable simulation of moving bodies in a fluid; however. the effects of varying flow conditions are not adequately modeled by model movement alone due to viscous and compressibility effects.

102641,Gravity compensation for PHANToMTM Omni® haptic interface,2010,Majid H Koul and Praneeth Kumar and Praveen K Singh and M Manivannan and Subir K Saha,,"The 1st Joint International Conference on Multibody System Dynamics, Lappeenranta, Finland",,25-27,,Although there have been many devices developed for Haptic applications. SensAble’s PHANToM Omni and Desktop models have gained wide popularity among the researchers in Haptics community. Recent haptics application such as medical simulations. stroke rehabilitation. dental restorations. and others require attachments of additional equipments to the stylus of the Phantom in order to make it appear as realistic virtual environment. In any virtual reality application. the inertial and gravitational properties characterizing the haptic manipulator may represent a disturbance which can strongly affect the simulation realisms. In the scope of this research. we focus on the problem of compensating the apparent gravity acting on the end-effector. due to the gravitational contributions acting on the whole kinematic chain of the haptic device. In this paper. we present a kinematic and dynamic study of the PHANToM Omni Haptic interface and its implementation in gravity compensation technique. The kinematic analysis is carried out for the system and the dynamic analysis is carried out using the DeNOC methodology. The equations of motion and the expressions for the necessary torque at respective joints are established using the symbolic toolbox included in Matlab. The expression along with the necessary logic is implemented in the SensAble’s Open Haptics Toolkit (HDAPI) software interface where the gravity compensation technique is carried out. The gravity compensation worked well. eliminating the effects of gravity even at the edges of the device workspace.

102649,A framework for multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision making for design of electrical drives,2008,Praveen Kumar,,,,,,All the products that we use and see in our daily lives are the results of one or the other engineering disciplines. The optimal design of these products is a multidisciplinary task and usually it is an iterative task performed by a team of skilled and experienced engineers. Therefore design is widely considered to be the central or distinguishing activity of engineering [1]. The engineering design is a constantly evolving discipline and design engineers are constantly trying to identify means of producing a better product in a shorter period of time. Design of a product classified as a complex system poses substantial challenges to both analysis and design [2]. Broadly speaking. in engineering design one attempts to improve or optimise several objectives. frequently competing and conflicting with each other. subject to satisfying a set of design and physical constraints. The problem solution involves two primary elements: formulation of the problem as a mathematical model that is suitable for optimisation and then defining a procedure for finding optimal solution of the problem once it has been formulated. To combine the mathematical model of the system to be designed with the optimisation algorithm for concrete engineering problems. it is necessary to clearly demarcate the boundaries of the engineering system to be designed and optimised. The development of the appropriate model of the system is a very challenging task because the models of the system to be designed have to represent the reality as closely as possible and also should not be computationally intensive. Invariably a detailed model of the system tends to give more accurate results but is …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:hx4mni8B3JkC,7,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:2cb6b4e3-46b3-4845-bb21-8c8c1a950695,4138865295781102753,/scholar?cites=4138865295781102753,,,0,0,0

102665,What are the observed high-frequency solar acoustic modes?,1990,P Kumar and TL Duvall and JW Harvey and SM Jefferies and MA Pomerantz and MJ Thompson,,,,87-92,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Jefferies et al. (1988) observe discrete peaks up to ≈7mHz in the power spectra of their intermediate degree solar intensity oscillation data obtained at South Pole. This is perhaps surprising since waves with frequency greater than the acoustic cut-off frequency at the temperature minimum (≈ 5.5mHz). unlike their lower frequency counterparts. are not trapped in the solar interior. We propose that the observed peaks are associated with what are principally progressive waves emanating from a broad-band acoustic source.

In order to exchange information. sensor nodes communicate in an ad hoc manner. The acquired information is useful only when the location of sensors is known. To use GPS-aided devices in each sensor makes sensors more costly and energy hungry. Hence. finding the location of nodes in WSNs becomes a major issue. In this paper. the authors propose a combination of range based and range-free localization scheme. In their scheme. for finding the distance. they use received signal strength indication (RSSI). which is a range based center of gravity technique. For finding the location of non-anchor nodes. the authors assign weights to anchor and non-anchor nodes based on received signal strength. The weight. which is assigned to anchor and non-anchor nodes. are designed by fuzzy logic system (FLS).,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC,6,https://www.igi-global.com/article/localization-in-wireless-sensor-networks-using-soft-computing-approach/181547,17094019416594650565,/scholar?cites=17094019416594650565,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2bf3/db6c1735809f3d09a8e52d2393a51b6dae2d.pdf,0,0,0

Seed Spices,2,40-45,,The present study aimed to forecast the coriander prices for Rajasthan by using the time series data of monthly wholesale prices for the period from May 2003 to June 2015 of Ramganj mandi Rajasthan. To forecast the coriander prices ARIMA models introduced by Box and Jenkins (1970) were used. To test the reliability of model R2. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used. The best fitted model was ARIMA (0. 1. 1). On comparing the alternative models. it was observed that AIC (2141.14). SBC (2147.09) and MAPE (6.38) were least for ARIMA (0. 1. 1) model therefore it was considered the most representative model for the price of coriander in Ramganj mandi of Rajasthan. Based on ARIMA (0. 1. 1) results the estimated coriander prices for Rajasthan would be increasing from July 2015 to December 2015 ie9677.9724.9770.98169863 and9909 per quintal. respectively.

In WSN. nodes have limited power and low processing capacity. Moreover. a homogeneous sensor network comprises of nodes having similar behavior. These constraints make it difficult to identify compromised nodes in such a network. Compromised nodes are those nodes whose behavior are dissimilar from normal nodes. Compromised node can be harmful for the network. To solve the problem of finding compromised node we are using anomaly detection technique. In this technique the behavior of nodes is observed and checked whether it is normal or not. We select some Intrusion Detection System(IDS) agents on the basis of internal congestion within the node.

It is important for the automotive design engineers to understand the mechanical behaviors of different joints and furthermore. to incorporate the static. impact. and fatigue strength of these joints in the early design stage using computer aided engineering and design tools.The aim of the work is to predict the life of nugget when subjected to fatigue loading. The parameters mainly considered for carrying out the analysis are sheet thickness. spot diameter and loading conditions. A simple model is used to illustrate the technique of spot-weld fatigue analysis. Finite element model and analysis are carried out utilizing the finite element analysis commercial codes. The commercial software Ansys workbench is used for performing the fatigue analysis. It can be seen from the results that spot diameter and sheet thickness greatly influence the fatigue life of the spot welded joint. Acquired results also show that the specimen fails at stress value far below the yield stress limit of the material which clearly shows the characteristic of fatigue failure. Further in this work. an economical design method is proposed to predict the fatigue life of spot welded specimen of different dimensions by defining a maximum stress equation using artificial neural networks.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:PQY3Tb_h0-cC,6,https://www.academia.edu/download/47045342/158-170V9N4CT.pdf,14381955227054114288,/scholar?cites=14381955227054114288,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47045342/158-170V9N4CT.pdf,0,0,0

All over the world. more than 30 million fishers and fish farmers and their families gain their livelihoods from fisheries. Globally. fish provide about 16 per cent of the animal protein consumed by humans. and are a valuable source of minerals and essential fatty acids. Although. wild fishery resources are in practice finite for production purposes. If they are overexploited. production declines and may even collapse. What made possible the continuing rise in overall fish production is the rapid growth of aquaculture. Global fish production has grown steadily in the last five decades with food fish supply increasing at an average annual rate of 3.2 per cent. outpacing world population growth at 1.6 per cent. Capture fisheries and aquaculture supplied the world with about 158.0 million tonnes of fish in 2012 of which 91.3 million tonnes was from capture fishery and 66.6 million tonnes from aquaculture. In the same year. total production of India was 8.66 million tonnes which included 3.372 million tonnes from capture fishery and 5.294 million tonnes from aquaculture and noticed increase at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in compare to population growth rate at 1.3%.

The Al2O3/water nanofluid at 0.1%. 0.4%. and 0.8% particle volume concentration was prepared by two-step method and characterized. It was found that the enhancement of experimental inner Nusselt numbers of 0.1%. 0.4% and 0.8% nanofluids are by 21%. 28% and 42%. respectively. higher than in water under laminar flow condition. This may be due to better mixing of the flow particles and higher effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid. The inner Nusselt number correlation was proposed based on the experimental data.

That is the reason; the problem of automatic speech recognition has been fascinating the computer scientists. Two robust speech recognition systems in noisy environment have been implemented in this work. One system is based on Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients and the other is based on Wavelet Packet Filter bank. Major drawback of all Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems is poor performance in the noisy environment. Hence. a speech segregation stage using Time-Frequency masking is employed as the front end of the systems implemented here. Other two stages are feature extraction stage and recognition stage as in conventional ASR systems. The accuracy of the entire system depends mainly on the performance of the segregation stage and feature extraction stage.

102708,On identification and stabilization of nonlinear plants using Fuzzy Neural Network,2005,Indrani Kar and P Prem Kumar and Laxmidhar Behera,1,,,474-479,IEEE,This paper is concerned with the stable tracking of a nonlinear plant using fuzzy clustering of ARMA models. The nonlinear input-output model is identified as fuzzy clusters of local ARMA models using a fuzzy neural net (FNN). It is thoroughly investigated whether the overall system can be made stable by stabilizing the individual linear subsystems. Two nonlinear systems have been taken and the controller is designed based on stabilizing each fuzzy region. The overall controller is determined by fuzzy blending of the individual controllers and it is shown that the systems are stable. Also. the overall system tracks a desired trajectory if all the individual subsystems track the same.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:6Dd5luMImnEC,6,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1571191/,3691138142245108694,/scholar?cites=3691138142245108694,,,0,0,0

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) has to struggle for acquisition of the limited micronutrients available in the host. One such crucial micronutrient that MTB requires for the growth and sustenance is iron. The present study aimed to sequester the iron supply of MTB to control drug resistance in MTB. We found that iron restriction renders hypersensitivity to multidrug-resistant MTB strains against first-line anti-TB drugs. To decipher the effect of iron restriction on possible mechanisms of chemosensitization and altered cellular circuitry governing drug resistance and virulence of MTB. we explored MTB cellular architecture.

To address the interval uncertainty. relation between an interval and a random variable is established according to the 3 sigma-rule. Using this relation an interval function is associated with a function of random variables and an interval inequality is associated with a chance constraint. The interval optimization problem is then transformed into a nonlinear stochastic programming problem.

The market of organic products is expected to grow globally in the coming years and high growth rates over the medium term (from 10-15 to 25-30%) are expected. The organic market expansion makes it possible for farmers to reap the benefits of a trade with relatively high price premiums. However. this market is not very well known to most farmers. especially those living in the developing countries. In developing countries it is therefore essential for major key players (eg NGOs. farmer organizations. traders. exporters etc.) that promote organic farming to have up-to-date information on the available opportunities (market requirements) and trends of the organic market. Although the movement is still regarded with some skepticism. the concept of organic farming has strong marketing appeal. growth forecasts are almost all positive and it has been suggested that the ‘movement’is now an ‘industry’. Major domestic markets for organic products lie in metropolitan cities–Mumbai. Delhi. Kolkata. Chennai. Bangalore and Hyderabad and the export markets are Europe. America. Middle East. Asia.

102755,Multisensory Marketing-Building Sustainability Perspective in Diverse Sectors.,2014,Prarthana Kumar,3,International Journal of Marketing & Business Communication,2,,,Synchronic studies in marketing propose that sensory stimulus. like colour. lighting effects. backdrop music. ambient scents. or upholstery’s texture affect consumers’ evaluation of the milieu. the wares presented. and affect consumer behaviour (eg. approximate amount spent. time spent at a store). A customer is frequently attracted towards a brand based on his sensory experience. In toto. the unexpurgated world is experienced through multiple senses (Lindstrom & Kotler. 2005). Ingenious brands are discovering means to captivate the entire consumer senses to fortify their brand experience. by amalgamating every sense into the marketing strategy; this approach is called Sensory Marketing. Sensory branding is based on the idea that we are most likely to form. retain. and revisit memory when all five senses are engaged. Many companies are discovering that when they engage consumers with multiple sensory touch points-not just the traditional sensory channels of sight or hearing—they can enhance customers’ emotional connection with their products and brands. The multisensory strategies seek to go beyond delivering functionality and value to evoking significant personal identification with products. It aims to fill in the lacuna of the conventional marketing. Technology is one of the main factors driving sensory marketing to success. Sensory Marketing has made its mark in multiple fields like Automobiles. Airlines. Hospitality. Casinos. Retail stores. Textile. Leather production. Skincare and Cosmetics at multiple levels.The following are a few examples for multisensory applications: 74% of Europeans and 46% of American recognise the Nokia …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:artPoR2Yc-kC,5,https://www.academia.edu/download/54046512/1.pdf,510524389579247011,/scholar?cites=510524389579247011,,https://www.academia.edu/download/54046512/1.pdf,0,0,0

Cham,Full chip resist simulation is a critical step in the lithography simulation of advanced CMOS technology nodes. The semi-empirical compact models (such as compact model 1. also known as CM1) are generally used in the semiconductor industries for resist simulation since the physical models are computationally expensive. The CM1 model considers physical effects of the resist process and uses a constant threshold on a two dimensional resist surface to extract the critical dimension (CD). However. the required threshold for different samples may vary over a range and therefore a constant threshold value may not hit an optimal solution for all the samples. In this paper. we propose a clustering based approach to enhance the accuracy of CM1 model and resist simulation. In this proposed approach. various attributes of the lithographic samples such as aerial image and pattern density are used to bin the …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:qyhmnyLat1gC,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-03002-9_9,4019178492880919860,/scholar?cites=4019178492880919860,,,0,0,0

102760,Clustering in wireless multimedia sensor networks,2013,Pushpender Kumar and Narottam Chand,2013,Journal of Sensor Technology,,,Scientific Research Publishing,Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) are comprised of small embedded audio/video motes capable of extracting the surrounding environmental information. locally processing it and then wirelessly transmitting it to sink/base station. Multimedia data such as image. audio and video is larger in volume than scalar data such as temperature. pressure and humidity. Thus to transmit multimedia information. more energy is required which reduces the lifetime of the network. Limitation of battery energy is a crucial problem in WMSN that needs to be addressed to prolong the lifetime of the network. In this paper we present a clustering approach based on Spectral Graph Partitioning (SGP) for WMSN that increases the lifetime of the network. The efficient strategies for cluster head selection and rotation are also proposed as part of clustering approach. Simulation results show that our strategy is better than existing strategies.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:5bFWG3eDk9wC,5,https://www.scirp.org/html/4-4200105_40958.htm,3873846187160802033,/scholar?cites=3873846187160802033,,https://www.scirp.org/html/4-4200105_40958.htm,0,0,0

Combined free and forced convection inside the channel is considered. The effects of viscous and ohmic dissipations are included in the energy equation. Both walls are kept either at the same or different temperatures such as isoflux-isothermal and isothermal-isoflux conditions. Governing equations in cartesian co-ordinates are solved analytically using regular perturbation technique to develop the expression for velocity and temperature. Velocity. temperature and Nusselt number are presented graphically. Effects of pertinent parameters. such as Hartmann number. electric field load parameter. viscosity ratio. width ratio and conductivity ratio are determined.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:3q5vy9RXY8EC,5,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?id=316112,2075239778473932335,/scholar?cites=2075239778473932335,,https://www.sid.ir/EN/VEWSSID/J_pdf/112520120302.pdf,0,0,0

102773,A min-process checkpointing protocol for deterministic mobile Ad hoc networks,2011,Praveen Praveen and Parveen Kumar,3,International Journal of Engineering Science and Technology,9,,Engg Journals Publications,The mobile ad hoc network architecture consists of a set of mobile hosts that can communicate with each other without the assistance of a base station. Nodes within each other radio range communicate directly via wireless links while these which are far apart rely on other nodes to relay messages. Node mobility causes frequent changes in topology. Fault-tolerance is an important design issue in building a reliable Ad hoc network. This paper considers checkpointing recovery schemes for the mobile ad-hoc network environment to introduce software based fault tolerance. In this paper we propose a new anti-message logging based non-intrusive minimum process checkpointing scheme for ad hoc networks. We assume that it uses Cluster Based Routing Protocol(CBRP) which belongs to a class of Hierarchical Reactive routing protocols. It produces a consistent set of checkpoints; the algorithm makes sure that only …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C,5,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13875890044753087&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13875890044753087,/scholar?cites=13875890044753087,,,0,0,0

We examined the functional organisation of NOX‐2 subunits in developing spermatozoa and its involvement in ROS generation. We found NOX‐2 components associated predominantly with caveolin‐rich microdomains of sperm head and mid piece membranes. Capacitation in vitro enriched NOX‐2 components within the caveolin‐positive sperm membrane rafts. Progesterone. but not 17β‐oestradiol. brought about loss of caveolin and extensive reorganisations in NOX‐2 distribution on sperm head microdomains and accompanying activation in the levels of superoxide. The sensitivity of superoxide production by spermatozoa to methyl‐β‐cyclodextrin confirms that NOX‐2 function in spermatozoa is tightly dependent on raft organisation.

Analysis of variance showed that these traits differ to each other. The seed yield per plant had highly significant and positive correlations both at genotypic and phenotypic levels with number of pods per plant. number of pods per cluster. number of cluster per plant and number of seeds per pod. Days to maturity showed negative and highly significant correlation with seed yield per plant at phenotypic and genotypic levels and days to 50% flowering at only genotypic level. The seed yield per plant did not show any significant association with protein content and other traits including number of branches per plant. number of pods per cluster and 100-seed weight that showed positive and significant correlation to protein content. So it can be concluded that selection for these traits enhance the seed yield and protein content in Mungbean.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC,4,http://ejplantbreeding.org/index.php/EJPB/article/view/308,1143249939109294602,/scholar?cites=1143249939109294602,,http://ejplantbreeding.org/index.php/EJPB/article/download/308/153,0,0,0
102849,Effect of supplementary irrigation and mulching on vegetative growth. yield and quality of ber,2014,PR Meghwal and Pradeep Kumar,71,Indian Journal of Horticulture,4,571-573,The Horticultural Society of India,Ber is one of the most important fruit crops in arid areas. Though it is drought resistant. its fruit yield is not satisfactory under extreme rainfed conditions. The studies were therefore. conducted to determine the frequency of supplemental irrigation and efficacy of mulching with black polythene and date palm leaves in conserving the moisture and its impact on fruit yield and quality of ber cv. Gola. The treatments comprised of four irrigation intervals (no irrigation. 60. 90 and 120 CPE) and three mulching materials (no mulch. black polythene and date palm leaf) with a total of 12 combinations. It emerged that supplementary irrigation at 60 or 90 CPE from September to November with mulching (black polythene or date palm leaves) significantly enhanced fruit yield by 21.8-43.88% over control.

The problem with this technique is that it is inherently more complex IFFT core. This paper delivers an examination of a technique to actions respective acts. called Orthogonal Wavelet Division Multiplex (OWDM). an substitute method to OFDM. which uses a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in its place of using the IFFT at the transmitter to produce the output and intensifications elasticity in system. In this research. we associated bit error rate using OFDM and OWDM. Actually OWDM (orthogonal wavelet division multiplexing) is realized by using various Daubechies family.

Industrial effluent samples were used to isolate copper tolerant bacteria. The isolate IFCu4 tolerated copper (CuSO4) at 28 mM in minimal media. The isolated strain was identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the sequence was submitted to NCBI database (Accession number: KF496212). The strain IFCu4 (Klebsiella pneumoniae) also possesses the integral inner membrane copper-transporting P-type ATPase. which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers for copA gene. The presence of copA gene encoding copper-transporting P-type ATPase contributes in removal of excess Cu (I) from the cytoplasm to protect microorganisms from copper–mediated toxicity at high concentrations; hence it is proposed that the isolated strain has potential role in bioremediation.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:teyi7TG2FwAC,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prasant_Kumar/publication/270280400_The_P-type_ATPase_Mediates_Copper_Tolerance_in_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_IFCu4_Strain_Isolated_from_South_Gujarat_Industrial_Effluents/links/5a2f907e4585155b617a4bea/The-P-type-ATPase-Mediates-Copper-Tolerance-in-Klebsiella-pneumoniae-IFCu4-Strain-Isolated-from-South-Gujarat-Industrial-Effluents.pdf,15018892391371898988,/scholar?cites=15018892391371898988,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prasant_Kumar/publication/270280400_The_P-type_ATPase_Mediates_Copper_Tolerance_in_Klebsiella_pneumoniae_IFCu4_Strain_Isolated_from_South_Gujarat_Industrial_Effluents/links/5a2f907e4585155b617a4bea/The-P-type-ATPase-Mediates-Copper-Tolerance-in-Klebsiella-pneumoniae-IFCu4-Strain-Isolated-from-South-Gujarat-Industrial-Effluents.pdf,0,0,0

This paper presents the simulation study of a fuzzy logic hysteresis band current controlled. three-phase SAPF to enhance power quality by harmonic elimination. power-factor correction. reactive power compensation and balancing of nonlinear loads. The advantage of fuzzy control is that it is based on a linguistic description and does not require a mathematical model of the system. Further. in this paper. the hysteresis based current control method is implemented for pulse width-modulation (PWM) switching signals. Results obtained by simulations with Matlab/Simulink show that dynamic behavior of the fuzzy controller is more effective than the conventional proportionalintegral (PI) controller method on compensating reactive power and harmonic currents of the load. It is found to be more robust to changes in load and other system parameters compared to the conventional PI controller under steady state and transient conditions.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:p6f6DfXMsGMC,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/32404996/DD31477485.pdf,7894972789907218141,/scholar?cites=7894972789907218141,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32404996/DD31477485.pdf,0,0,0

102869,Phytochemical investigation and antibacterial activity of the fruits of Alstonia scholaris,2012,Joel James and Arun Kumar Thaliyil Veettil and P Kumar,3,Int J Phytopharmacol,1,74e7,,The present paper is aimed at the phytochemical analysis and antibacterial activity of the fruits of Alstonia scholaris. The findings of the work revealed that the solvent extract of plant showed the presence of phytochemical constituents like alkaloids. carbohydrates. phenolic compounds. terpenoids. cardiac glycosides and flavanoids in major amounts while fixed oils and fats. saponins and steroids in lesser amounts. These phytochemicals have reported to have conferred the necessary bioactivity to the plant like the antibacterial activity. However the test of antibacterial activity showed dose dependent inhibition of bacteria with maximum antibacterial activity in case of benzene and butanol solvent inhibiting Lactobacillus lactis and Staphylococcus aureus respectively. However least antibacterial activity was seen in case of hexane extract and aqueous and methanolic extract showed overall higher activity compared to other extract. The results of antibacterial activity are quite similar to standard antibiotic chloramphenicol thus indicating the possible cure of bacterial pathogenic diseases using these plant extracts in future.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:C-Rn0OCouf8C,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/33611734/130_74-77.pdf,14752526780044200732,/scholar?cites=14752526780044200732,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33611734/130_74-77.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper a six-wheeled rover with rocker-bogie structure has been analyzed for planar case. The detailed kinematic model of the rover was built and the dynamic model was derived based on bond graph. The simulation studies were performed for obstacle climbing capability of the rover. It was observed from the study that rover can pass through plane surface. inclined surface. and inclined ditch without any control on the actuators of the rover. However. it fails to cross a vertical ditch so a velocity controller was designed. It consists of a proportional integral (PI) controller and reduced model of the rover.

The proposed method uses a secant (intersecting the head-loss function in two points) instead of a tangent to approximate the pipe head-loss function. A theoretical model is developed for the flow range in which the secant approximates the head-loss function without exceeding a given allowable error. This scheme allows a tradeoff to be made between the allowable error and the number of iterations required to achieve convergence. The proposed method is applied to an example network to illustrate its application and benefits. It is argued that the number of iterations required to find a solution can be reduced significantly in both snapshot and extended-period simulations.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:knQODA9bSJkC,4,https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2008)134:8(1176),18425297662391230759,/scholar?cites=18425297662391230759,,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/49183/11-2007+VanZyl+ASCE+JH+Twopointlinearizationfinal.pdf?sequence=6,0,0,0

In the clinical cases spermatogenic arrest is an interruption of germ cell differentiation that may result in either oligozoospermia or azoospermia and can be diagnosed in testicular biopsy. Although spermatogenesis requires many gene products. mutation or absence of the genes expressed at different levels of spermatogenesis may lead to spermatogenic arrest and infertility. Identification of new genes specifically involved in spermatogenesis and analysis of the phenotypes could provide an insight into this developmental process and a more rational basis for treatment of male infertility. Using differential display proteomics followed by genomic assays and molecular modeling. we have identified a few testis-specific genes that may regulate cell cycle in germ cells. We are currently concentrating on a class of testis-specific proteins named Cyclin-Like Proteins (CLPs). which are classical cyclin box-bearing proteins with typical folds. Using RT-PCR based approach. we have sequenced the full length CDS of mouse testicular CLP-1. With major thrust on this molecule. we are aiming at elucidating the intricate molecular control of meiosis and germ cell differentiation.

Mahendranagar and Nagrain Village Development Committees (VDCs). in one of the endemic districts. Dhanusha. in the Terai plain region of Nepal. during June-July 2002. A total of 1.085 finger prick thick blood smear samples were collected from volunteers at two sentinel sites. 468 from Mahendranagar and 617 from Nagrain VDCs. from 22.00-02.00 hr. and were examined for presence of helminthic parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. as per standard protocol. Twenty-five out of 468 samples (5.3%) collected from Mahendranagar were found to be microscopically positive for W. bancrofti. while only 14 out of 617 samples (2.3%) from Nagrain VDC were found to be positive for this filarial parasite. The prevalence of microfilaremia in Mahendranagar was higher than in Nagrain VDC.

Undulated surface (lower boundary) simulation was carried through sixth order polynomial by least square approximation. Segmentwise terrain simulation was linearly added to build ground feature extending either side of the blast location. Assuming the initial dust concentration in the vertical column to be uniform and treating the finite vertical line sources as a series of point sources to height. H varying from zero to top of the dust mushroom. integration was done of the concentration effects from H= 0 to L tanθ (L= horizontal distance of the blast location and θ is the angle of the top of dust cloud from the point of observation). Using frame of reference moving with the mean wind. the ground level concentration (GLC) has been computed over the undulated terrain.

In many practical situations. the illumination of a scene is changing with space and time. It is not unusual to have images having brightly lit and shadowed portions in the same scene demanding information extraction from the entire image. For example in the instance of space images over mountainous terrain you find brightly lit portions facing the sun while the other portion remain in the dark. Techniques based on homomorphic filtering are useful in these cases. However. these are based on spatial frequency filtering and tend to perform poorly in low SNR portion of the image.Up to now. image processing and image analysis have borrowed their basic tools from functional analysis …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C,4,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03772063.2000.11416170,10686125903995779693,/scholar?cites=10686125903995779693,,,0,0,0

Cochin,2,36-40,,The spiny lobsters are distinguished from the true lobsters by the absence of large crushing claws characteristic of the latter animals as well as the presence of flexible tail fan. These lobsters gained considerable importance in recent years due to the demands of frozen lobsters for export. The distribution patterns of the species contributing the Indian Lobster Fishery have been studied in detail based on earlier records at well as the material available in the collections of the Zoological Survey of India examined by the authors. An attempt is made to explain the distribution patterns of these species taking into consideration. the prevailing ocean currents influencing the dispersal of the free swimming and fragile-bodied larvae. prior to settling in a favourable substrata. particularly in areas especially near the coast where rocks or reefs offer retreats for them. though the adults also may migrate from place to place to a certain extent.

The stair structure. droplet configuration. and contact angle gradient are modeled using Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The stair climb efficiency of the droplet is found to be a function of wettability gradient strength. Using analytical balance of actuation and resistive forces across droplets. physical reasons behind stair climbing are established and influencing parameters are identified. Evolution of the droplet shape along with the advancing and the receding contact angles is presented from where instantaneous actuation and hysteresis forces are calculated. Using history of Lagrangian particles. circulation at the foot of stairs and progressing development of the advancing drop front are monitored. Higher efficiency in stair climbing in the case of a bigger sized drop than smaller …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:yBxuCEhX224C,3,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4985213,4290839303232971178,/scholar?cites=4290839303232971178,,,0,0,0

Many of the control flow techniques are applied only near leading or trailing edge. whereas the CFJ technique is applied on most of the suction surface. In this technique an injection slot is made near the leading edge through which a jet is introduced. In order to maintain the conservation of mass principle. same amount of mass is sucked through a suction slot. In this paper the performance of NACA6409 baseline airfoil is compared with three CFJ airfoils with varying positions of injection and suction slots. The performance characteristics considered are coefficient of lift. stall margin and lift to drag ratio. The analysis is done using commercial code ANSYS FLUENT. It was found that the CFJ airfoils improve the stall margin by 33% to 67% compared to the baseline airfoil. The airfoil CFJ1 has optimum position of injection and suction slots.

102937,Design and analysis of center jack for cars,2015,Pandra Uday Kumar and G Ramanjulu,2,"International Journal & Magazine of Engineering, Technology, Management and Research",,1476-9,,With the increasing levels of technology. the efforts being put to produce any kind of work has been continuously decreasing. The efforts required in achieving the desired output can be effectively and economically be decreased by the implementation of better designs. Power screws are used to convert rotary motion into translator motion. A screw jack is an example of a power screw in which a small force applied in a horizontal plane is used to raise or lower a large load. The principle on which it works is similar to that of an inclined plane. The mechanical advantage of a screw jack is the ratio of the load applied to the effort applied. The screw jack is operated by turning a lead screw. The height of the jack is adjusted by turning a lead screw and this adjustment can be done either manually or by integrating an electric motor. Pneumatics is a branch of technology that deals with the study and application of pressurized gas in affecting mechanical motion. In this project “Mechanical Project Report on Center Jack for Cars” is designed to make a pneumatic jack that can lift a complete car or an automobile when placed at the car’s bottom. These systems are mainly used in industries. factories and are generally plumbed with compressed air. The preference for pneumatic systems is because a centrally and electrically powered compressor is used to power cylinders through solenoid valves and provides motion in a cheaper and flexible mode. The best point of the project is that it can drive a complete system with the aid of Compressed air without any part of the automobile touching the ground. In this project. an electric motor will be integrated with the …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:OVe_t5h5bhEC,3,https://www.academia.edu/download/52647387/PandraUdayKumar-GRamanjulu-A-60.pdf,7509841869859056917,/scholar?cites=7509841869859056917,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52647387/PandraUdayKumar-GRamanjulu-A-60.pdf,0,0,0

Appl.,,4-8,,This paper presents a description of etching process for fabrication single mode optical fiber sensors. The process of fabrication demonstrates an optimized etching based method to fabricate single mode fiber (SMF) optic sensors in specified constant time and temperature. We propose a single mode optical fiber based temperature sensor. where the temperature sensing region is obtained by etching its cladding diameter over small length to a critical value. It is observed that the light transmission through etched fiber at 1550 nm wavelength optical source becomes highly temperature sensitive. compared to the temperature insensitive behavior observed in un-etched fiber for the range on 30ºC to 100ºC at 1550 nm. The sensor response under temperature cycling is repeatable and. proposed to be useful for low frequency analogue signal transmission over optical fiber by means of inline thermal modulation approach.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:h-fwNd0rmTkC,3,https://www.academia.edu/download/33278881/B42050408.pdf,8761978592023902641,/scholar?cites=8761978592023902641,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33278881/B42050408.pdf,0,0,0

102958,Interim identification of “at risk” students: A predictive model,2014,Mark IK Norrish and Pananghat A Kumar and Thomas A Heming,2,J Contemp Med Edu,4,199-203,,Objective: Identifying and supporting students who are academically at risk are an essential part of medical education. This study considers how well aspects of previous performance predict academic performance in the current year and whether it is possible to use a combination of previous and current performance to identify students who are academically “at risk” in the current year. Methods: Regression analysis was used to investigate how previous academic performance influences current performance in medical students at a mid-point in their studies (year 4 of 7). To identify students who are academically “at risk” in the current year a risk prediction model was developed on the basis of a combination of current and past performance variables. Results: Cumulative grade point average and previous failures were identified as significant macrolevel predictors of performance. and in addition several subject-by-subject level predictors were identified as independently significant. This risk prediction model accurately predicted “at risk” students. with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. as shown by the non-progression of 88% of the students who were identified as being ‘at risk’. Conclusions: By considering the academic content of courses. the development of transferable skills and how recently a course was taken. it is possible to accurately predict academic performance. It is possible to identify students who are academically “at risk” by developing a predictive model using a combination of current and previous variables.

Res.(JITR),,1120-1126,,Surface finish and material removal rate are two important factors in the manufacturing organization which affect acceptability of the product which in turn reflects on the profitability of the organization. Ability of the production setup to produce the components with high material removal rate without sacrificing the surface requirements can play vital role in sustainability and profitability of the organization. In this paper. the effect of process parameters on metal removal rate and surface roughness has been investigated in milling of SAE52100 tool steel. Cutting speed. feed and depth of cut have been taken as input factors in three level full factorial orthogonal arrays used for experimentation. Mathematical models have been developed using response surface methodology to predict surface finish. and metal removal rate in term of machining parameters. Depth of cut and feed rate are found to be a dominant parameter for surface roughness; whereas feed rate mainly effects the metal removal rate. The results of mathematical models have been compared with the experimental and found to be in good agreement.

Zircon and Zirconia based products are used due to its high thermal stability. excellent erosion resistance. self-opening. consistent casting speed and resistance to oxygen lancing during casting for removal of inclusion clogging and to streamline the flow. Higher casting sequences of molten steel CaO or MgO stabilized zirconia nozzles were being used and for industrial application point of view. dolomite stabilized zirconia (DSZ) could be a better substitute for the stabilization of zirconia. DSZ samples were prepared having 3. 4. 5. 6 and 7 mole% of dolomite by solid state route using high purity monoclinic zirconia and dolomite. The decomposition behaviour. phase stability and densification behavior of co-grounded zirconia-dolomite mixer were studied. It was observed that finer dolomite particle size (-63? m) resulted in higher amount of t/c ZrO 2 phase stabilization as a function of temperature. The effect of pre-calcination temperature on phase formation and densification was optimized. Higher t-phases were achieved with 3. 4 and 5 mol% dolomite whereas 6 and 7 mol% dolomite had more of cubic phases. The non-isothermal densification of the pre calcination compact showed two stage sintering behavior. Effect of sintering schedule on densification and phase formation of DSZ was co-related.

Shunt active power filter (SAPF) is one of the effective means for harmonic current compensation in electrical power system. The performance and dynamic characteristics of a three-phase SAPF with a simple control algorithm is presented and analyzed in this paper. This algorithm operates at fixed switching frequency and compensates the reactive power and the current harmonics of nonlinear loads. Reactive power compensation is achieved without sensing and computing the reactive component of the load current. thus simplifying the control implementation. Current harmonic compensation is done in time domain. The proposed controller is compared with the conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller method on compensating reactive power and harmonic currents of the load.

Ua,,,NISCAIR-CSIR. India,The Indian small satellite. YOUTHSAT. was launched mainly for the study of the ionosphere-thermosphere region over the Indian longitudes. The ionospheric processes play an important role in influencing the position accuracies while using the GPS applications. Ionospheric tomography is an effective way of investigating the spatio-temporal variabilities of these ionospheric processes. The RaBIT (Radio Beacon for Ionospheric Tomography) is one of the three payloads on-board the YOUTHSAT. In this paper. first a case. viz. the analysis of the slant total electron content (STEC) variation measured at the three southern RaBIT stations. namely Trivandrum (8.5°N. 77.0°E). Bangalore (13°N. 77.6°E) and Hyderabad (17.8°N. 78.0°E) on 9 May. 7 and 10 June and 6 July 2011 is presented. It is found that the overall STEC variations measured at each station are different for different days. These variations are attributed to the day-to-day changes in the distribution of ionosphere owing to prevailing electrodynamic processes. To highlight this aspect. the RaBIT tomograms are presented. as case 2. for three different days for five stations. one each for the May. June and July months of 2011 to highlight the day and night differences in the overall distribution of the electron density. The tomograms. unambiguously. reveal the marked differences in the ionization distribution on these days not just during daytime but night time also.

Information hiding is a technique that inserts secret messages into a cover file. Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one. apart from the sender and intended recipient. suspects the existence of the message. a form of security through obscurity. A lossless or reversible steganography is defined as an original image can be completely recovered from the stego-image after the embedded data has been extracted. This technique has been focused on spatial uncompressed domain recently. and is considered more challenging to carry out in the compressed domain. In this paper. we propose a lossless. compressed domain steganography technique for AMBTC-compressed images based on the interchange of two quantization levels. The location map. which is often used in lossless steganography. is not required in our scheme. Therefore. the hiding capacity is independent of the compressed codes. Moreover. the stego-image preserves the same image quality as the original compressed images.

Often. it is seen that large farmers are first and last to be benefitted from the new technology in terms of adoption and consequent increase in net returns. The small and large farmers are still within the grip of the traditional methods with very little technological intervention. The present study was conducted in purposively selected blocks Ranbir Singh Pura and Bishnah of District Jammu to find out the technology use pattern and the constraints of the selected respondents. The results of the study revealed that more than seventy five per cent of the respondents were in the marginal and serni medium category having holdings up to 2 hectares. More than 90% of the respondents plough their land using tractors. While 86% of the respondents purchased seeds for sowing in case of Wheat. the corresponding per centage in Paddy was only eight. There was cent per cent use of herbicides in case of Wheat and Paddy. None of the farmers used herbicides in other crops like Bajra. Barseem and pulses. Urea was used by all the respondents in case of Wheat and Paddy whereas Diammonium Phosphate was used by ninety per cent of the farmers.

UPASI Tea Research Institute recommends mechanized harvesting to cover large areas with high worker productivity. While adopting extensive mechanized harvesting. total leaf area of the maintenance foliage on the plucking surface is reduced. As a result growth of the crop shoots has been adversely affected leading to reduction in productivity. Excessive banji shoot formation and nutrient deficiency symptoms were also noticed. To overcome all these adverse impacts of extensive mechanization. foliar application of primary. secondary and micro-nutrients has been attempted. The practical utility of foliar feeding of all these nutrients when applied as a mixture after every harvest. except during continuous heavy rainy months. showed an increase in yield up to 21% compared to the current recommended practice. in spite of extensive harvesting using shears and machines. The problem of dwarfing of crop shoots due to extensive shear/machine harvesting could be minimized due to increase in internodal length by 0.87 cm and the dry weight of the crop shoots increased by 0.09 g/shoot. Excessive production of banji shoots also came down from 65 to 52%.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C,3,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1937350821879673478&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1937350821879673478,/scholar?cites=1937350821879673478,,,0,0,0

These oscillations are interpreted as slow magneto-acoustic waves excited impulsively in coronal loops. This study explores the effect of steady plasma flow on the dissipation of slow magneto-acoustic waves in the solar coronal loops permeated by uniform magnetic field. We have investigated the damping of slow waves in the coronal plasma taking into account viscosity and thermal conductivity as dissipative processes. On solving the dispersion relation it is found that the presence of plasma flow influences the characteristics of wave propagation and dissipation. We have shown that the time damping of slow waves exhibits varying behavior depending upon the physical parameters of the loop. The wave energy flux associated with slow magnetoacoustic waves turns out to be of the order of 106 …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:H-nlc5mcmJQC,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12648-011-0191-7,1652390800005326658,/scholar?cites=1652390800005326658,,,0,0,0

102986,Polarization reconfigurable active antenna,2010,Pramod Kumar and Mahesh P Abegaonkar and SK Koul and Ananjan Basu,,,,,,Active antennas (AAs) are a class of radiation system that integrates an antenna and backing active circuits which results in considerable reduction in complexity of the matching networks and filters [1]. This is done by carefully designing the radiating element to provide proper load for active elements. Hummer and Chang have investigated active antenna elements using a microstrip patch antenna and fieldeffect-transistors (FETs)[2]. Similarly. Ho. Fan and Chang have used FET devices using the simple transmission line method [3]. Reconfigurable patch antenna has also designed with frequency and radiation reconfigurability [4]. Polarization diversity is required for operations under different standards such as GSM. GPS. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) to reduce the multi-path fading and cochannel interference. The ability to operate both sense of circular polarization allows the system to reuse frequency and double the system capacity. Moreover. if the antenna can be switched between two senses of circular polarization as well as linear polarization. it will allow the user to roam virtually any existing network [5. 6]. This can be also very useful in RFID system. Polarization switchable active antenna can be used in spatial power combiner in the compact size. The reconfigurable antenna proposed in this paper operates at the three different polarizations (Linear. RHCP. and LHCP) with the frequency 2.2 GHz. It has been fabricated on low cost substrate. It can switch the polarization using the PIN diode.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:nnVijz9KPVYC,3,http://ap-s.ei.tuat.ac.jp/isapx/2010/pdf/228.pdf,15006327495991154202,/scholar?cites=15006327495991154202,,http://ap-s.ei.tuat.ac.jp/isapx/2010/pdf/228.pdf,0,0,0

This problem is converted into a deterministic linear programming problem using some positive weight functions and establishes the relation between the solutions of both problems. Further. a novel methodology is developed to study the existence of solutions in interval solid transportation problems.

Minimal access surgery is opted with hesitation in most surgical units. The present study was conducted to determine the feasibility of laparoscopic repair of duodenal perforation and to compare it with the conventional open repair in our set-up.Methods: The patients admitted in a single unit of surgery department during a two year period were included in the study. All the patients were admitted in emergency with the diagnosis of duodenal perforation. These were subjected to either laparotomy or laparoscopic repair of duodenal perforation. Results were analyzed and compared.Results: Result analysis indicated laparoscopic approach to be associated with less post-operative complications and morbidity with better patient recovery.Conclusions: We concluded that minimal access approach to duodenal ulcer perforation is safe and should be offered in properly selected cases.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:CqsiOOvXZmUC,2,https://mail.ijsurgery.com/index.php/isj/article/view/134,7307423085558383456,/scholar?cites=7307423085558383456,,https://mail.ijsurgery.com/index.php/isj/article/download/134/134,0,0,0

Reaming of Titanium Ti-6Al-4V alloy material is an important and current research topic on manufacturing processes. Optimal process parameter setting is an important element in the machinability study of Titanium Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Optimization has most significant importance. particularly for reaming operations. This research work focuses on the multi-response optimization of reaming process parameters using the Taguchi and Grey relational technique to obtain minimum cutting temperature (T). thrust force (Ft). torque (Mt). surface roughness (Ra) and hole quality. The experiments were performed on Titanium Ti-6Al-4V alloy using uncoated carbide straight shank reamer under wet and cryogenic LN2 conditions.

An 8-year-old boy presented with a huge mass in abdomen extending from epigastrium to the pelvis. Ultrasound and CT scan of abdomen revealed a huge mass with solid and cystic components and internal calcifications. The preoperative diagnosis was a teratoma but not specifically gastric one. At operation. it was found to be gastric teratoma. The mass was excised completely with part of the stomach wall. The histopathology confirmed it to be mature gastric teratoma.

Sci,,1100-1115,,The study was conducted to determine the sub acute toxicity of disodium EDTA upon slow intravenous injection in mice. Animals were divided into six groups and doses were administered for a period of 14 days in all the groups by slow intravenous injection. G1 was the vehicle control group. G2. G3 and G4 were the disodium EDTA treated (15. 30 & 60 mg/kg) group respectively. Groups G5 and G6 were the recovery groups observed for an additional period of 14 days after discontinuation of dosing. Clinical signs were recorded once daily in all the animals until their scheduled necropsy. Biochemical and hematological evaluations were performed on day 7 and 14 for animals of G1-G4 group and on day 28 for animals of G5 and G6 group. Gross pathology was performed and organs were collected for histopathology on terminal day. Results of the study suggested that there were no visible signs of toxicity in any group treated with disodium EDTA. Biochemical and hematological parameters were comparable to vehicle control groups in the main and recovery groups. Interim or terminal sacrifices did not reveal any significant pathological finding in the gross observations. Histological evaluations of disodium EDTA (60 mg/kg) group revealed an inflammatory lesions in the kidneys. However. in the recovery group did not show such lesions suggesting that the inflammatory lesions were transient and resolved upon discontinuation of treatment.

Genet,4,366-374,,Thirty-one maize genotypes were evaluated in 4 environments to estimate combining abilities and heterosis for grain yield. Spearman’s rank correlations and linear regressions were determined to identify the most important factor determining grain yield of F1s and heterosis. The inbred line 4 (IL4). IL7 and IL9 had high and significant positive GCA effects. The top three high yielding hybrids also had high mean general combining ability (MGCA) in the same order but did not match with order of specific combining ability (SCA) effects of cross combinations. The SCA. MGCA. low parent heterosis (LPH). mid-parent heterosis (MPH) and high parent heterosis (HPH) exhibited significant positive rank correlations and high coefficients of determination (R2) with grain yield of F1s (GYF1s). Similar patterns were also noted for SCA with the LPH. MPH and HPH. The MGCA was found to be relatively more important in determination of heterosis and GYF1s. Due to very low coefficient of determination. parental mean (PM) seems to have little value in prediction of performance or selection of lines for hybrid development.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:bu5pTcyXo34C,2,http://sabraojournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SABRAO-J-Breed-Genet-474-366-374-Kumar.pdf,17319633959976419615,/scholar?cites=17319633959976419615,,http://sabraojournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SABRAO-J-Breed-Genet-474-366-374-Kumar.pdf,0,0,0

The objectives of this clinical report are to review the limitations of using the current definition of birth trauma as an indicator of quality of care and to propose changes to make it a more accurate measure of quality of care.The reported incidence of birth trauma is highly variable from study to study. with several large population-based studies reporting an incidence ranging between 24 and 37 per 1000 births. 1–3 Although the majority of birth traumas occur in infants with risk factors. some occur in the absence of identifiable risk factors. making the latter challenging to predict and avoid. Because parents often assume birth traumas are preventable. their occurrence can lead to anger. frustration and sometimes litigation.

We consider the case when the nodes are not synchronized. but instead have local clocks that are relatively affine. In addition. the network is open in that nodes can enter at arbitrary times. To account for this new behavior. we make substantial revisions to the protocol in part one. We define a game between protocols for open. unsynchronized nodes and the strategies of adversarial nodes. We show that the same guarantees in part one also apply in this game: the protocol not only achieves the max-min utility. but the min-max utility as well. That is. there is a saddle point in the game. and furthermore. the adversarial nodes are effectively limited to either jamming or conforming with the protocol.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:jW3pDOCzWhQC,2,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7151071/,13466179933776154894,/scholar?cites=13466179933776154894,,http://cesg.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WiOpt2015part2.pdf,0,0,0

103085,Prediction of compressive strength using genetic programming involving NDT results,2015,Prasanta Kumar and Ankit Kumar,,,,,,Compressive strength of concrete is major parameter to assess the overall quality of concrete as other mechanical prosperities are directly related to the compressive strength. It can be determined using the destructive (DT) and non-destructive testing (NDT) methods. The destructive testing method is carried out by crushing the specimen to failure while the non-destructive is carried out without destroying the concrete specimen. The destructive method is time taking process and required equipment’s and power. Whereas the NDT methods like the rebound (Schmitz) hammer and Ultrasonic Pulse velocity (UPV) are most popular because they are handy. quicker and easy to use. Though the NDT methods are much quicker; their values are more of an approximation than exact compressive strength values. They are also machine specific. hence a calibration curve is provided by supplier which may not be reliable. The Indian code recommends about 25% variation in results. which is very high. The newly developed soft computing techniques like ANN. Fuzzy logic. Genetic programming etc. may be used to prepare a better numerical model correlating DT and NDT results. Hence the aim of the present study is to propose a model correlating the compressive strength obtained from destructive and non-destructive methods by using Genetic Programming. The whole work involves casting of 100 cubes of 150mm size belonging to of different grades of concrete. They were tested under compression following DT and NDT methods. These data were used for modelling ie.(70% for training and 30% for testing ) in GP.

Experiments are conducted separately on specially conceived parallel flow permeameter and converging flow permeameter keeping identical inlet and outlet conditions. using eight sizes of coarse granular media and water as the fluid medium. The media is sieved through sieves of different sizes to separate the crushed rock into sizes of 3.25 mm. 4.73 mm. 10.00 mm. 11.64 mm. 13.10 mm. 20.10 mm. 28.90 mm and 39.50 mm and glass spheres of 15.41 mm. 18.03 mm and 28.37 mm. As the effect of convergence is predominant in non-Darcian zones of flow. such as flow near the well. flow through rock fills. filters etc... the scope of the present work is restricted to flow regime with Re> 10.(After Kovacs) Forchheimer’s equation (i= aV+ bV2) is applied to analyze the experimental data. Equations are derived for Darcy parameter (a) and Non-Darcy parameter (b) of the Forchheimer’s equation for the crushed rock and glass spheres by relating to size of the media (d) in both parallel flow condition and converging flow condition. From the results it is inferred that for a given rate of flow through a known size of aquifer having predetermined grain size. the resistance to flow is higher in the parallel flow compared to similar media conditions in converging flow configurations. A comparison is then made between the coefficients of the equation. computed for parallel and converging configurations of flow. The difference in these values is expressed in terms of a factor called ‘Integrated Convergence factor (Cfi)’.

In this paper a mathematical model is designed with a jacobian logarithm which consists of a max function along with the exponential correction function. The complexity of the jacobian logarithm is also reduced by the Max Log Map algorithm by eliminating the correction term. The MAP decoder is recursive and complex. which makes high-speed implementations. The blockinterleaved pipelining (BIP) as a new high-throughput technique for MAP decoders. An area-efficient symbol-based BIP MAP decoder architecture is proposed by combining BIP with the well-known look-ahead computation. Due to the powerful error correcting performance. the turbo codes have been adopted in many wireless communication standards. The optimum decoding procedure for turbo codes is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. It is very difficult to design highspeed MAP Decoder. because of its recursive computations. The MAP decoding algorithm has equipped to output softdecision bits that turbo decoding requires.

Current unipath routing protocols result in performance degradation in mobile networks due to the unreliability of wireless infrastructure and mobility of nodes. Multipath routing protocol is an attractive alternative that distributes the traffic among several good paths instead of routing all the traffic along a single best path for highly error prone and resource depleted network environments. Frequent link failures are common in MANET due to node’s mobility and use of unreliable wireless channels for data transmission. Due to this. multipath routing protocol becomes an important research issue. Among the reactive protocols. AODV is a reactive routing protocol.

Because of the distinct prominence of buffalo as a dairy animal. the present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize GDF9 cDNA using orthologous primers based on the bovine GDF9 sequence. GDF9 transcripts were found to be expressed in oocytes irrespective of their follicular origin. and shared a single transcription start site (TSS) at–57 base pairs (bp) upstream of ATG. Assignment of the TSS is consistent with the presence of a TATA element at–23 of the TSS mapped in this study. Localization of a buffalo-specific minimal promoter within 320 bp upstream of ATG was consolidated by identification of an E-box element at–113bp. Presence of putative transcription factor binding sites and other cis regulatory elements were analyzed at∼ 5 kb upstream of TSS. Various germ cell-specific cis-acting regulatory elements (BNCF. BRNF. NR2F. SORY. Foxh1. OCT1. LHXF etc.) have been identified in the 5 flanking region of the buffalo GDF9 gene. including NOBOX DNA binding elements and consensuses E-boxes (CANNTG). Presence of two conserved E-boxes found on buffalo sequence at–520 and–718 positions deserves attention in view of its sequence deviation from other species.

Infection of human papillomavirus (HPV) mainly with high-risk HPV Type 16 is the most crucial event in malignant transformation and the leading cause of cervical cancer in women. Early cancer detection using newer diagnostic modalities should improve the clinical outcome by detecting the disease at an early stage and thus minimizing the morbidity and improving survival. Since persistence of oncogenic HPV infection is important for tumorigenic transformation. analysis of their physical status has prognostic significance. Although two successful prophylactic HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) are available for primary prevention. the extremely valuable effects of cytological Pap smear screening.

103135,Current Challenges in the Development and Formulation of Amorphous Solids,2012,Gannu Praveen Kumar and Bakka Sravan Kumar,23,,2,65-83,,Interest in amorphous pharmaceutical systems is steadily growing over the last 10 years. The amorphous state is critical in determining the solid state. physical and chemical properties of many pharmaceutical dosage forms. The main reason of the growing interest toward amorphous materials is the need to improve the bioavailability of drugs with poor aqueous solubility. Many drugs exist in crystalline solid form due to reasons of stability and ease of handling during the various stages of drug development. Conversion of the crystalline to amorphous form may occur during various pharmaceutical processes. This could change the dissolution rate and transport characteristics of the drug. The current focus of research in this area is to understand the origins of amorphous forms. The various thermodynamic phenomena such as glass transition. fragility. molecular mobility. devitrification kinetics. molecular level chemical interactions. solubility and stability are critically discussed. The aim of this review is to understand the recent development in the area of amorphous state and to address the current challenges faced by pharmaceutical formulation and process development scientists and thus is mandatory to anticipate future developments.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:IT1MJ6E3JesC,2,http://indonesianjpharm.farmasi.ugm.ac.id/index.php/3/article/view/665,15709483846016668677,/scholar?cites=15709483846016668677,,http://indonesianjpharm.farmasi.ugm.ac.id/index.php/3/article/view/665/531,0,0,0

103150,Laboratory studies of skid resistance and rutting of low cost bituminous wearing courses,2011,Praveen Kumar and Nikesh Chandra,39,Indian Highways,6,,,Two important aspects of low cost bituminous wearing courses are skid resistance and rutting. Normally. the polished stone value (PSV) of the aggregates used in the surface keep in check the effect of wearing out of the surfaces on the skid resistance. An effort is made in this laboratory study to assess the skid resistance of various wearing courses (Premix Carpet with Sand/Liquid Seal Coat. Mix Seal Surfacing Types' A'and'B'and Surface Dressing) using the British Portable Skid Resistance Tester. In addition. indigenous equipment is designed and fabricated in order to discover the effect of wearing out of the surfaces on skid resistance as a whole by directly providing the wheel passes over the prepared sample from the surface being tested. The rut depth after a given number of wheel passes is also studied in order to assess the resistance of the surface being tested to rutting. Variations on the testing include using both iron wheel and rubber tyre wheels. as well as using another sample for each surface with 10% extra bitumen tested with the rubber tyre wheel. Samples were prepared following specifications of rural roads by the Ministry of Rural Development. Results of the study show that Premix Carpet with Sand Seal Coat is the best surface for skid resistance and is further improved by adding 10% extra bitumen to the mix. Mix Seal Surfacing Type'A'shows the best resistance to rutting. however there is no improvement by adding extra bitumen.

Modernity and Hindi Satire in the Late 19th Century1,2011,Prabhat Kumar,28,Zeitschrift für Indologie und Südasienstudien (ZIS),,1-25,,This paper delineates an aspect of social perception of modernity. as reflected in Hindi satirical texts. in late 19th century colonial India by focusing on five selected satirical pieces written by two nineteenth century Khari Boli authors Bharatendu Harishchandra (1850-1884) and Radhacharan Goswami (1858-1925). 2 Hindi satire of this period mocks at targets as disparate as religious reform (er) s. colonial judiciary (or rule of law). caste associations. the railways. etc.. and alludes to social groups and movements. state and civil institutions. and cultural values. All these are associated with. and largely located in. urban space–a principal site for the unfolding of colonial modernity. The subject matter of satire in a variety of literary forms. it is argued. is inextricably entangled with the question of colonial modernity. 3 Although the trope of modernity as chaotic and deprived of ethical and moral values appears to have been a rather universal feature in modernising societies. yet its connotative meaning was delimited by the respective historical-particular literary context. As the existing scholarship shows us. modernity in its myriad forms has been linked to the global phenomenon of capitalism and has been experienced and articulated differentially throughout the world. 4 It is1 I am grateful to Prof. Dr. Hans Harder for his extensive comments and suggestions without which this article would not have been possible.

103161,A note on demand draft charges levied by banks in India,2010,Ashish Das and Rajeev Kumar and Prasanna Kumar,,,,,,In this paper we study the service charges levied by banks on demand drafts in India. Though RBI advocated reasonability of service charges for demand drafts as early as February 2007. it did not prescribe any explicit thresholds or measures of reasonability. We try to propose a rationalization of such charges by looking into the demand draft charges of 37 select banks comprising 89% of the network of bank branches in India. It is observed that among the select banks the highest service charge for issue of demand draft (having value upto Rs. 10.000) is Rs. 550 while the same is Rs. 1000 for cancellation. Similarly. for issue of demand drafts. having value more than Rs. 10.000. such charges range from 0% to 0.45% of the draft amount. After more than 36 months of RBI’s advice to banks on reasonability of service charges for demand draft issue. we find that more than 10% of the banks have not prescribed a ceiling for demand draft charges. Also. among those who have set a cap. the maximum demand draft charge has been set as high as Rs. 30.000. The analysis carried out here has an underlying premise that competitive market pricing is required to safeguard consumer interest. and if market fails to have a pricing structure which is competitive. it becomes imperative to take recourse to public policy to protect consumer interest. Focusing at the reasonability of service charges levied by banks for issuing demand drafts. the study provides benchmarks and concludes that there is a need to rationalize and bring in uniformity in the amount of service charges for demand drafts.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:oPLKW5k6eA4C,2,http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/jspui/handle/10054/1728,3016493506693134527,/scholar?cites=3016493506693134527,,http://dspace.library.iitb.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10054/1728/demand_draft_2010.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

An attempt has been made for the determination of the relative average die pressure developed for given geometries of the disc during the open die forging of sintered metal powder preform by using an upper bound and equilibrium method approach as different frictional stresses are assumed on top and bottom interfaces. The deformation characteristics of metal powder preform has been demonstrated by applying an appropriate interfacial friction law and yield criteria.

SD is treated as a key concept in social sciences and as a challenging process in governance everywhere. As a concept. SD signifies human endeavors for the realization of the development ideals and goals of intergenerational equity. intergenderal equity. and intranational and international equity. As a multidimensional concept. SD entails ecological. socioeconomic. and politicocultural sustainability.As a process. SD denotes all efforts made by the people individually and collectively and by the government at various levels aimed at the fulfillment of the basic needs of life with scope for improvement in the quality of life. This process must establish and maintain synergy between development and environment; concern for conservation of natural resources and ecological balance should be integrated into developmental plans and strategies. All these theoretical issues are examined in the first part of the chapter; the following parts address. respectively. people’s participation in SD and performance failures.

Retrieving the partial similar images generally requires a huge amount of storage space for indexes due to the large number of portions of images. The proposed method constructs the ternary tree. which greatly reduces the storage space for database images and fast retrieval. The computation of tree structure is not a computationally intensive task and tree comparison won’t take much time to find the best match image. The system is capable of accepting any size of query image decided by user and retrieves the whole images from the database.

However energy conservation is effectively possible in air conditioners by employing an intercooler with nanofluids. which can consequently reduce the compressor load. This paper presents an investigative report on the performance of proposed energy efficient air conditioning system. A binary mixture of ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2) and water is used as the base fluid in the shell and coil type heat exchanger (SCHE). The volume concentration of C 2 H 6 O 2 in base fluid. type of suspended nano particles (Al 2 O 3 and MgO). flow rate of nanofluid at shell side of intercooler and the volume fraction of nano particles are chosen for experimentation designed using Taguchi L 18 orthogonal array. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the nanofluid-based domestic air conditioner is estimated as the performance index (response). Quadratic model and response surface plots are generated to observe the effects of inputs on the COP. The nano particles of MgO (0.75% v/v). suspended in a binary mixture with 28.65% C 2 H 6 O 2 is found to improve the system performance (COP) at a nanofluid flow rate of 2.42 LPM.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:7MdmnBSEV98C,1,http://www.iieta.org/journals/jnmes/paper/10.14447/jnmes.v21i3.455,15596671169921270242,/scholar?cites=15596671169921270242,,http://www.iieta.org/journals/jnmes/paper/10.14447/jnmes.v21i3.455,0,0,0

A generalized vortex profile is obtained by suitable scaling for a range of rotational Froude numbers (2.38–11.18). The transient evolution rate of the vortex tip followed logarithmic law and is correlated with experimental data of air and glycerin. The axial pull that holds the vortex against gravity is found to be linearly increasing with the rise of disc rotation. Asymmetric vortex profiles with increased extent of asymmetry are obtained upon increase of disc inclination (0–17.45°). Axial and radial circulations are revealed by following the trajectory of a solid particle in the flow field.

The efficiency of PV cells decreases significantly as the temperature of the cells exceeds a certain limit. In order to increase the efficiency. it is necessary to reduce the operating temperature of array. Reflection of the sun’s irradiance normally fall the electrical performance of PV modules by 8–15%. Facade applications located in the tropics may even experience a 42 percent loss in performance. due to straight incidence angles. Additionally. when a module’s cell temperature is elevated there is 0.4 percent per K drop in voltage and power for singleand multi-crystalline silicon solar cells. One of the ways for increase the operation performance is cooling panel temperature with a thin film of water. The aim of this research is to study the effects of water cooling on the operation of system by using this method.

The Canadian registry quotes an incidence of 41 per 100.000 newborns per year. Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis is rarely reported in preterm infants. Although it is a potentially devastating condition with poor neuro developmental outcome. the risk factors are still poorly understood and the awareness to diagnose this condition is lacking. Males are at higher risk for both arterial ischemic stroke and for the sinovenous thrombosis.Case Report: We report a preterm. male neonate with right transverse venous sinus thrombosis. who had perinatal risk factors and elevated antiphospholipid antibodies on follow up. No other known risk factors for thrombosis were identified. High levels of anti phospholipid antibodies in this infant. could have possibly lead to venous sinus thrombosis in neonatal period.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:Ef4XXjhdXvQC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16477742875823003200&hl=en&oi=scholarr,16477742875823003200,/scholar?cites=16477742875823003200,,,0,0,0

APR to disease is accompanied by an increase in the circulating concentration of a number of plasma proteins which are collectively known as the Acute Phase Proteins. According to the concentration. APPs are classified in positive APP. if they increase or negative APP. if they decrease. During mastitis. APPs move from the systemic circulation to mammary gland or there could be de-novo synthesis of the APP within mammary gland tissues. Among the APPs. Serum Amyloid A (SAA). Haptoglobin (Hp). Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and Lipopolysaccharide binding protein play a major role during mastitis in cattle and their concentration will increase with the severity of the infection. inflammation or trauma. SAA is involved in defense against Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens. SAA acts by modulating innate immune system and by acting as an opsonin. Among the SAA isoforms. mammary associated SAA3 (m-SAA3) is important. The blood concentration of SAA and Hp increases dramatically after LPS infusion. with SAA (acute and middle phase of APR) appearing before Hp (Late phase of APR). The herd level APP might be useful for determining the prevalence of clinical and subclinical infections indicated by the high serum concentration of selected APP and by serving as the prognostic tool. APPs. used as markers of animal health may possibly be influenced by environmental factors. handling procedures and other types of stress in the absence of disease.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:lgwcVrK6X84C,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/50249073/Acute_Phase_Proteins_How_they_portray_Mastitis_A_review.pdf,15559052617091896411,/scholar?cites=15559052617091896411,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50249073/Acute_Phase_Proteins_How_they_portray_Mastitis_A_review.pdf,0,0,0

The compressive strength reaches beyond 150 MPa. which allows the construction of sustainable and economic buildings with an extraordinarily slim design. In general the aim is to achieve such high strength keeping the cement content under permissible limits. The aim herein is to develop a concrete mix incorporating silica fume. nano silica and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) with the addition of different percentages of steel fibers. which provides for high performance. durability and better serviceability in addition to overall economy in the long run. In this study. the compressive strength of UHPFRC is studied closely for different percentages of steel fibers with three w/b ratios (0.22. 0.20. and 0.18). The purpose is to have such proportions of materials. including cement replacement materials like silica fume. nana-silica. GGBS etc.. which on mixing would be able to provide compressive strengths in the range of 125 to 150 MPa at 28 days. The studies were carried at an early age of 7 days as well. The workability of the different mixtures was constantly maintained by optimum usage of superplasticizers. The results showed that with the increase in the amount of steel fibers the compressive strength of the matrix increased.

Evolutionary approach is a better choice than classical gradient based approaches as these are not efficient enough for accurate design. In this paper comparative analysis of FIR filter has been done using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization and it is found that results using PSO are better than genetic algorithm. FIR filter design involves multi parameter and multi-modular optimization. We can use different optimization techniques to determine the impulse response coefficient of a filter to meet the characteristics of ideal frequency response. Comparison of simulation results depicts the optimization effectiveness of the particle swarm optimization algorithm over the genetic algorithm optimization techniques for solving non-differentiable. multi modal. highly non-linear. and constrained FIR filter design problems.

Dryland Agric. Res. & Dev,1,01-09,,Long-term drought forecasts can provide valuable information to help in mitigation of the consequences of drought. The study has been carried out for Bearma basin of Bundelkhand region in Madhya Pradesh which is regularly suffered from frequent droughts due to large variation of rainfall. Rainfall data of 5 stations located in Bearma basin over the period of 1976-2005 were used. Efforts have been made to identify the drought characteristics through the modern technique using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The drought severities as well as the drought intensity have been evaluated for all the rain gauge stations in Bearma basin. The result showed that Damoh faced drought of 5 months in 1979 with the highest drought severity of-11.95 and intensity of-2.39 whereas a drought of severity-11.12 occurred during June to November 1979 at Jabera for a period of 6 months. It is also indicated that the maximum intensity of-5.50 was observed between onset and termination of drought of 1984 at Hatta. The drought of 4 months duration was recorded at Deori during June-September 1992 and at Rehli during August-November 1986. The spatial and temporal variations of drought and its progression into more areas in subsequent months and its withdrawal after the initiation of sufficient rainfall has been studied in detail for drought year 2002 as well as normal year 2004.

The range of their application varies from a simple task like hammering to a complicated. complex and precision-demanding tasks such as that of surgical scalpels. Hence. it becomes highly essential to design the tool for ‘comfort’ from the perspective of user. The aim of this study is to design a tool handle for a task involving a simple power grip such as hammer. The focus of this study is mainly confined to identify the right cross-section and profile of the tool handle. based on subjective experimentation of a group of subjects and find the approximate dimension and shape(of both cross-section and profile) which outstands in subject’s perception of comfort. In this study. a new criteria for decision making has been employed during a brief subjective analysis to find out the better cross- section shape among the various possible shapes for the handle. The shape of the profile has been reverse engineered from an existing tool handle using a CAD software which was been rated high in market. At various turns during this study. new simplified approaches were used to accomplish certain tasks which can be considered as reasonable approximation to standard methods.

103342,A heuristic algorithm for longest simple cycle problem,2014,Parveen Kumar and Nitin Gupta,,Proceedings of the International Conference on Wireless Networks (ICWN),,1,The Steering Committee of The World Congress in Computer Science. Computer Engineering and Applied Computing (WorldComp),The longest simple cycle problem is the problem of finding a cycle of maximum length in a graph. As a generalization of the Hamiltonian cycle problem. it is NP-complete on general graphs and. in fact. on every class of graphs that the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete. The longest simple cycle problem may be solved in polynomial time on the complements of comparability graphs. It may also be solved in polynomial time on any class of graphs with bounded tree width or bounded clique-width. such as the distance-hereditary graphs. However. it is NP-hard even when restricted to split graphs. circle graphs. or planar graphs. In this paper a heuristic algorithm is proposed which can solve the problem in polynomial time. To solve the longest simple cycle problem using adjacency matrix and adjacency list by making a tree of given problem to find the longest simple cycle as the deepest path in tree following reconnect the leaf node of deepest path with root node. The result resolves the open question for the complexity of the problem on simple unweighted graphs. The algorithm is implemented on a simple labeled graph without parallel edges and without selfloop. The worst case time complexity for the proposed algorithm is O (V+ E).,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:i9B0nK2ie9AC,1,http://world-comp.org/preproc2014/ICW2970.pdf,13347565338733219648,/scholar?cites=13347565338733219648,,http://world-comp.org/preproc2014/ICW2970.pdf,0,0,0

SOJ Pharm Pharm Sci. 1 (2). 10,2014,K Raza and P Kumar and S Ratan and R Malik and S Arora,,Polymorphism: The Phenomenon Affecting the Performance of Drugs,,,,Polymorphism is the ability of solid materials to exist in two or more crystalline forms with different arrangements or conformations of the constituents in the crystal lattice. These polymorphic forms of a drug differ in the physicochemical properties like dissolution and solubility. chemical and physical stability. flowability and hygroscopicity. These forms also differ in various important drug outcomes like drug efficacy. bioavailability. and even toxicity.

Conf. on Simulation of Semiconductor Processes and Devices (SISPAD),,216-219,,In this paper. we propose a Kernel PCA (KPCA) based light source optimization method for computation of the aerial image. The proposed approach is more general in nature and considers both continuous as well as discontinuous intensity distribution from different types of lithography light sources. We have compared both the PCA and KPCA approach. on four different light sources (conventional. annular. dipole. and quadruple light sources) used in optical lithography. Our simulation results clearly indicate that the KPCA performance in variance coverage among discrete data sets is better than the PCA for all the four types of light sources. Thus using KPCA. we can reduce the number of kernels (pixels) for different shapes of light sources using lesser number of principal components (PCs) compared to the PCA based linear approaches. This will help in reducing the computational complexity during the simulation of aerial image formation.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:gToihe7qpOEC,1,http://in4.iue.tuwien.ac.at/pdfs/sispad2013/P06.pdf,16918220863491626239,/scholar?cites=16918220863491626239,,http://in4.iue.tuwien.ac.at/pdfs/sispad2013/P06.pdf,0,0,0

103367,Multi-version conflict notion,2013,Priyanka Kumar and Sathya Peri,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1307.8256,,,,In recent years. Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs)[7. 13] have garnered significant interest as an elegant alternative for addressing concurrency issues in memory. STM systems take optimistic approach. Multiple transactions are allowed to execute concurrently. On completion. each transaction is validated and if any inconsistency is observed it is aborted. Otherwise it is allowed to commit.An important requirement of STM system is to ensure that transactions do not abort unnecessarily. This referred to as the progress condition. It would be ideal to abort a transaction only when it does not violate correctness requirement (such as opacity). However it was observed in [1] that many STM systems developed so far spuriously abort transactions even when not required. A permissive STM [4] does not abort a transaction unless committing of it violates the correctness-criterion. With the increase in concurrency. more transactions may conflict and abort. especially in presence many long-running transactions which can have a very bad impact on performance [2]. Perelman et al [12] observe that read-only transactions play a significant role in various types of applications. But long read-only transactions could be aborted multiple times in many of the current STM systems [3. 8]. In fact Perelman et al [12] show that many STM systems waste 80% their time in aborts due to read-only transactions. It was observed that by storing multiple versions of each object. multi-version STMs can ensure that more read operations succeed. ie. not return abort. History H1 illustrates this idea.

103380,Studies of wire-matrix interaction in some tungsten wire reinforced stainless steels,2013,Pawan Kumar,,,,,University of Canterbury. Mechanical Engineering,There is potential for improving creep properties of stainless steels by reinforcing them with tungsten (W) wires. Past studies have shown that a detrimental factor that impairs the mechanical properties of tungsten wire reinforced superalloy composites is the formation of brittle intermetallic phases due to the interaction between W wire and constituents of the alloy matrices. Formation and growth of the intermetallic phases strongly depends on the matrix chemistry and for the retention of creep strength. matrix compositions that do not form intermetallic phases with tungsten are desirable for fabricating W wire reinforced composites for high temperature applications.  This research investigated the formation and growth of reaction phases in W wire reinforced 316L (W/316L) stainless steel and HP alloy steel (W/HP) that were fabricated by casting method. Additionally. the effect of composition on the evolution and kinetics of reaction phases was studied in some W wire reinforced experimental alloys based on Fe-Ni-Cr only (W/Fe-Ni-Cr). The fabricated composites were diffusion annealed in the temperature range 1000-1200°C for 25-500 hours. Microstructure and chemistry of the reaction phases in the as-cast and diffusion annealed composites were studied using scanning electron microscopy. energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron backscattered diffraction techniques.

For measuring the performance of DS-CDMA receivers. the channel estimate plays for a crucial role and hence the channel estimation for DS-CDMA is considered. We describe the channel estimation based on the time domain channel statistics. using a general model for a slow fading channel. The investigation on the performance of Least Square estimator (LS) and Minimum Mean Square Error estimator (MMSE) in asynchronous DS-CDMA linear receiver is studied. The investigation studies the effect of MSE and SER with different modulation scheme employed in it and their analysis of modulated effect are taken into comparison.

103388,Multisensory Marketing: Creating New Sustainability Perspective in Hospitality Sector,2013,Prarthana Kumar,8,Atna Journal of Tourism Studies,1,43-55,,Synchronic studies in marketing propose that sensory stimulus. like colour. lighting effects. backdrop music. ambient scents or upholstery‘s texture. affect consumers ‘evaluation of the milieu. the wares presented. and affect consumer behavior (eg. approximate amount spent. time spent at a store). A Customer is frequently attracted towards a brand based on its sensory experience. In toto. the unexpurgated world is experienced through multiple senses.(Lindstrom & Kotler. 2005). Ingenious brands are discovering means to captivate the entire consumer senses to fortify their brand experience. by amalgamating every sense into the marketing strategy. this approach is called Sensory Marketing. Sensory branding is based on the idea that we are most likely to form. retain and revisit memory when all five senses are engaged. Many companies are discovering that when they engage consumers with multiple sensory touch points—not just the traditional sensory channels of sight or hearing—they can enhance customers ‘emotional connection with their products and brands. The multisensory strategies seek to go beyond delivering functionality and value to evoking significant personal identification with products. It aims to fill in the lacuna of the conventional marketing. Technology is one of the main factors driving Sensory marketing to success.

In this study. we simulate multiphase flow in complex micro-channels using two approaches: a multiphase Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) and a finite volume Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. In LBM. fluids are represented on a mesoscopic scale by particle distribution functions which evolve via a discretized Boltzmann equation. Macroscopic flow variables such as density and velocity are related to the moments of the distribution functions. In contrast. VOF calculates flow variables via three coupled equations: the continuity equation. the Navier-Stokes equation. and the volume-fraction transport equation which tracks the interface between disparate phases. An emphasis is placed on comparison of these schemes to determine their respective advantages in calculation of multiphase flow for these …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:MqTxh1vmwXEC,1,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012APS..DFD.M3005H/abstract,12828469733016729600,/scholar?cites=12828469733016729600,,,0,0,0

Mobile agent is a program segment which is self-controlling. The mobile agents have no security mechanism and authentication scheme is used to permit mobile agents to perform computations. Due to lacks of security aspects when applied to MANET where nodes cannot be classified as they are malicious or not. hence for the cases where the security of data or reliability of agent became must we need some method to insure the things. Thus. In this paper. we propose a Admission Control Mechanism on hierarchical model architecture of MANET maintained by Mobile agent using secure and priority based routing algorithm with effective security authentication technique. Our technique has three phases. In Initial phase. Admission Control method-where we provide admission of mobile nodes in hierarchical model. In the next phase. we discuss the priority based routing mechanism using BFS technique for routing.

Soil and Water Conservation and Crop,2011,P Kumar and M Pant and GCS Negi,1,Invasive Alien Plants An Ecological Appraisal for the Indian Subcontinent,,282,CABI,Rice is the predominant staple food crop of nearly half of the world's population. its cultivation covering 147 million ha in 2002 (IRRI. 2003). Worldwide. the area under rice cultivation is increasing rapidly due to everincreasing human demand. In intensively cultivated rice fields the capacity of soil to supply plant-available nitrogen (N) may decline unless soils are managed properly (Kundu and Ladha. 1995). In order to enhance and/or maintain crop productivity rice cultivators have become increasingly dependent on chemical N fertilizers. It has been reported that optimization of carbon (C) and N cycling through soil organic matter enhancement can improve soil fertility and crop yield while reducing negative environmental impacts (Blevins and Frye. 1993. Drinkwater et al.. 1998. Kushwaha and Singh. 2005). Sharma et al.(2005) reported that the application of organic matter residue provides better grain yield of rice in comparison with farmyard manure.

Therefore. for effective use of suitable upper-extremity prosthesis. we need to address two main critical aspects of prosthetic control (ie. force and position). The natural choice of a control input for prosthesis is the surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal. also simply referred to as EMG signal. The sEMG can be used to decipher the meaningful information. which correlates with the skeletal-muscle force and the finger joint-angles. By virtue of its nature. the sEMG signal is random and the influence of skeletal-muscle fatigue. which is a complex phenomenon. further enhances its randomness.

The driving goals of state-of-the-art 3D imagers are high sensitivity to light and fine depth resolution at long range. Furthermore. high level of integration is desirable to achieve low system cost. To meet these demands. the industry has started to transition from traditional analog techniques to standard CMOS based solutions.In this thesis. a novel time-of-flight 3D CMOS imager is proposed. The focus of the design is low power consumption while maintaining human-eye safety requirements. The imager targets security applications. primarily facial recognition. but is also suitable for automotive vision and robotics. In this work. a prototype of a 32x32 pixel array is designed. where each pixel consists of a single-photon avalanche diode as photodetector and a time-to-digital converter (TDC) for fast image acquisition. The imager is expected to achieve millimeterlevel depth resolution for range as long as 30 m and has a maximum frame-rate of 1000 fps.

103425,Dry beneficiation of coal fines using air table,2010,Pawan Kumar and Rakesh Sah and Vidyadhar Ari and Avimanyu Das,,Mineral Processing Technology,,446-451,,Wet processing of coal requires a large quantity of water. Waste generated from wet process ties up a significant amount of water and land. The slurry ponds also pose serious problems in case of dam failure. Dry beneficiation is coming up to be considered a feasible alternative. at least in coal preparation. Air table works on shallow bed fluidization principle in combination with the principles of a settling in wet shaking table separating the particles on the basis of specific gravity. It was observed that particles above 1 mm size cannot be effectively separated in air tables. For reasonably good separation the feed must have a narrow size range. Ultrafine particles are likely to be lost. The performance is affected by several process variables such as feed flow rate. air flow rate. deck eccentric speed. side tilt and end raise. The optimization of the process in terms of the operating variables has been performed in the present work using statistically designed experiments. The separation performance is influenced by a strong interdependence of the process variables. A mathematical model for the yield and ash content of the clean product was developed. In the present work. coal from Kuju area with a feed ash of 34.2% was used as the feed material. The product ash was reduced to 30.15% with a yield of 66% at a side tilt of 30 mm and 18.3 Hz eccentric speed expressed in terms of frequency. It was found that size also plays a dominant role. A narrower size range of feed gives better separation. It was observed that a small change in side tilt and eccentric speed affects the yield significantly. The separation efficiency is governed mostly by air flow rate and …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:qwy9JoKyICEC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vidyadhar_Ari/publication/262217312_Dry_beneficiation_of_coal_fines_using_Air_Table/links/004635371011136d9c000000/Dry-beneficiation-of-coal-fines-using-Air-Table.pdf,882676922204340856,/scholar?cites=882676922204340856,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vidyadhar_Ari/publication/262217312_Dry_beneficiation_of_coal_fines_using_Air_Table/links/004635371011136d9c000000/Dry-beneficiation-of-coal-fines-using-Air-Table.pdf,0,0,0

In our case. early hemodialysis was performed in the care of a 47 y/o female presenting 12 hours after ingesting 65.000 mg of aspirin with a salicylate level of 92 mg/dl. The arterial blood gas showed respiratory alkalosis with concomitant anion gap metabolic acidosis. She was started on a bicarbonate drip and underwent hemodialysis twice for a total of 8 hours until the salicylate was less than 40 mg/dl. Her clinical course was complicated by oliguric renal failure that improved after dialysis. Salicylate intoxication in adults usually causes a respiratory alkalosis. mixed metabolic-respiratory alkalosis or a pure anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The quality of transgene expression in plants is influenced by the position of integration in the genome and the complexity of the integrated DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The GT (gene targeting) allows the production of specific and predictable changes in any chosen gene as it allows the systematic introduction of mutations. It relies on HR (homologous recombination). Progress in the general understanding of HR. and the discovery of highly efficient GT in a moss require new approaches to improve GT in plants. However. over the past few years all attempts to establish an efficient GT technique in higher plants were indeed not successful. However. several novel approaches. some of them based on the availability of the genome sequence ofArabidopsis were initiated that may finally be applied universally. The concepts shown to improve GT can be transferred to commercially important systems as a first step towards application.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:hKIHPWh8nngC,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ln8OiuFPX0EC&oi=fnd&pg=PA267&dq=info:58PCwOhGRjcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=FrFEMP7w-m&sig=lL3OQvf6ijY7GGVtuaNWHY6-7QU,3982948885936128999,/scholar?cites=3982948885936128999,,,0,0,0

103454,RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN FIELDS CORNER,2004,Brian Cheigh and Pankaj Kumar and Heather Seyfang and Jeanne Zhijun Tan,,"Report prepared for Vietnamese American Initiative for Development, Dorchester, MA",,,,Sustainable development is a nebulous idea and goal that requires the establishment of a working definition for specific discussions on its implementation. The following report will use well established aspects of sustainable development to formulate a clear definition of sustainable development in the context of future sustainability in Fields Corner and recommend a plan of action for sustainable development to be implemented by Viet-AID.Striving to be an organization that promotes sustainable development requires a mission and set of skills that poses considerable challenges to neighborhood organizations. Viet-AID can take several steps to enhance its already rich capacity to transform it into a sustainable development organization. The report examines the institutional capacity of other organizations in Fields Corner and Viet-AID’s past and current programs to identify strengths and weaknesses in pursuing sustainable development. The report also identifies areas for collaboration with other groups in terms of strengthening capacities. Examples of successful CDC projects are offered as evidence of how a community organization can work in partnership to make the vision of sustainability a reality.

103486,A prospective clinico-bacteriological study of internal jugular cannulation in a critical care unit.,1993,A Gurnani and G Revathi and P Kumar and A Bhattacharya,98,The Indian journal of medical research,,223-226,,The results of 125 consecutive central venous catheterizations during a six-month period in the critical care unit were prospectively studied. All the catheters were inserted percutaneously by internal jugular approach and the placement of catheters was confirmed by chest roentgenography while injecting Conray 420. The safety of the technique was evaluated in terms of success and complication rates. Failure rate was only 0.8 per cent. while overall complication rate was 17.6 per cent. Arterial puncture and hematoma were the commonest complications encountered in 8 and 4 per cent of the patients respectively. Pneumothorax occurred in two patients (1.6%). while misplacement of catheter tip and thrombophlebitis was encountered in 0.8 per cent of all cannulations. No microorganisms were isolated from catheters inserted for less than 5 days. Positive catheter-tip cultures. by quantitative method. were obtained in 41 cases (P< 0.001) of which infected intravenous insert growing> 10 (3) colony forming units. was encountered in 36 (P< 0.001) and colonization of the catheter (< 10 (3) colony forming units) was seen in 5 cases. Catheter related bacteremia (recovery of the same organism from the catheter tip and peripheral blood cultures) occurred in 31 of these 41 patients (P< 0.01). The study reveals that internal jugular approach is a safe technique for central vein catheterization with very high success rate and fewer complications. However. catheter-related bacteremia is a potential threat which is directly related to the number of days the catheter is in central circulation and is totally preventable.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:w2Gke83ceDMC,1,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8119756,15652194666295359920,/scholar?cites=15652194666295359920,,,0,0,0

103488,End point for sclerosis of esophageal varices.,1993,BK Agrawal and A Suman and V Singh and P Kumar,12,Indian journal of gastroenterology: official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,3,83-85,,BACKGROUND: Small esophageal varices are difficult to inject intravariceally and complete eradication of varices may not be therapeutically necessary. METHODS: A prospective study designed to compare the use of different end points of sclerotherapy ie (i) total eradication (grade 0)(ii) grade I varices or (iii) grade II white (IIw) varices. by stopping variceal injection when one of these was reached. The patients were followed endoscopically and clinically at 3-4 mo intervals. OUTCOME MEASURES: Variceal recurrence and rebleeding rates. RESULTS: Of 266 patients with portal hypertension (147 cirrhosis. 51 non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis. 68 extra-hepatic portal venous obstruction). 232 (87.2%) reached one of the three end points--six to grade 0. 96 to grade I and 130 to grade IIw. Among 212 patients followed up for a mean post-sclerotherapy period of 12.2 mo (range 3-48 mo). variceal recurrence rates. time intervals to recurrence and rebleed rates were comparable in patients with endpoints of grade I and grade II (white) varices (28.5% vs 38.9%. 10.8 mo vs 9.2 mo. and 7.7% vs 7.8%. respectively; all p= ns). Overall. 51 patients had interval bleed before reaching the end point--50 (98%) of them bled from grade III and IV varices while only one patient (2%) bled with grade IIw varices. CONCLUSION: Grade I or grade IIw varices should be acceptable as the end points for endoscopic sclerotherapy of esophageal varices.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:ZHR7-34Bl2wC,1,https://europepmc.org/article/med/8354534,6430882293348646016,/scholar?cites=6430882293348646016,,,0,0,0

103515,E-ROSETTE PHENOMENON FOR THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF NEOPLASTIC CONDITIONS IN BUFFALOES,,Pradeep Kumar and Prahlad Ubhale and Y Hari Babu,,,,,,A study was undertaken to diagnose neoplastic conditions during early stages of development in buffaloes based on change in T-lymphocyte count. In this study. total leukocyte count (TLC) and differential leukocyte count (DLC) were used to find the elicitation of immune response to neoplastic conditions and E-rosette formation by T-lymphocytes with sheep RBCs was used to differentiate T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocytes and enumerate T-lymphocytes. The increase in total leukocyte count (TLC) indicated that there was activation of specific immunity against tumor. The increase in lymphocyte count in differential leukocyte count (DLC) indicated that lymphocytes were activated during neoplastic conditions. A simple but reliable methodology of E-rosette formation for differentiation and enumeration of T-lymphocytes showed increase in T-lymphocyte population. This emphasizes that during early stages of neoplastic conditions there is increase in T-lymphocyte population and the condition can be diagnosed by counting the E-rosettes.

In this regard. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is especially valuable given its all-weather capabilities. Within this study we investigate the usefulness of fully polarimetric SAR by utilizing an automatic sea ice classification algorithm. developed for Near Real T ime (NRT) services. on two sets of spatially and temporally near coincident fully polarimetric acquisitions from the ALOS-2. Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X satellites acquired during the N-ICE2015 sea ice drift study.  Overlapping coincident sea ice freeboard measurements from Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) data are used to validate the classification results. We analyzed the usefulness of 18 different polarimetric parameters for sea ice characterization. In order to deliver sea ice products in NRT savings in computational time are very important and by reducing redundant parameters we can speed up the delivery time. Validation with the coincident ALS data shows that 100 % of the open water is separated from the surrounding sea ice and that the sea ice classes have at least 96.9 % accuracy . A notable difference between the C/X-band and the L-band images was the high importance of entropy for the L-band sea ice classifications.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:sr8OKcTvXucC,0,https://elib.dlr.de/118776/,,,,,0,0,0

Inc.,Previous studies have suggested that neurotransmitters may play an important role in influencing neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) differentiation into oligodendrocytes (OL). Differentiated OL are known to aid in remyelination and axonal protection. In order to derive pure lineages of OL. especially for use in regenerative medicine. improved differentiation protocols are required. One potential differentiation cue is the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. however. its effects on NSPCs is currently unknown. Using real-time PCR. we examined the in vitro ability of glutamate. in combination of growth factors to influence the NSPCs differentiation. Glutamate (200μM) for 14-days did not induce significant changes in the gene expression profile of differentiated cultures. Moreover. the combination of growth factors (FGF2. PDGF. NT3) demonstrated no significant effect on the proportions of differentiated cell types. Although the differentiation media. containing fetal bovine serum. had an effect on appearance of neuronal lineage. the overall expression of mature cell markers continued to decrease by day-14. In contrast. Matrigel-attached cultures. demonstrated significant increase in glial markers. with possible inhibition of neuronal differentiation as observed with spontaneous attachment. Overall. these data suggest that glutamate (200μM) and combination of growth factors had no modulating effect on the gene expression profile of differentiated NSPCs culture.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:r0s_y6AIs4IC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Josef_Buttigieg/publication/325474429_GENE-TRACKING_OF_IN_VITRO_DIFFERENTIATION_CAPABILITIES_OF_ADULT_MOUSE_NEURAL_STEM_PROGENITOR_CELLS/links/5b10230c0f7e9b4981003a95/GENE-TRACKING-OF-IN-VITRO-DIFFERENTIATION-CAPABILITIES-OF-ADULT-MOUSE-NEURAL-STEM-PROGENITOR-CELLS,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Josef_Buttigieg/publication/325474429_GENE-TRACKING_OF_IN_VITRO_DIFFERENTIATION_CAPABILITIES_OF_ADULT_MOUSE_NEURAL_STEM_PROGENITOR_CELLS/links/5b10230c0f7e9b4981003a95/GENE-TRACKING-OF-IN-VITRO-DIFFERENTIATION-CAPABILITIES-OF-ADULT-MOUSE-NEURAL-STEM-PROGENITOR-CELLS,0,0,0

It is widely applied in a broad class of material systems and devices. It gives access to fundamental mechanisms of operation of solar cells. We have implemented a method of IS where we modulate the light instead of the bias. This scheme allows us to analyze not only carrier dynamics but also impedance of device locally. Here. using this scheme. we have measured the frequency-dependent photocurrent response of the thin-film planar and nano-textured Si solar cells using this method. Photocurrent response is measured in range of 50 Hz to 50 kHz. Bode and Nyquist plots are used to determine characteristic lifetime of both the cells. Interestingly. the carrier lifetime of both planar and nano-textured solar cells depend on back and front contact positions. This is due to either heterogeneity of device or contacts are not optimized. The estimated average lifetime is found to be shorter for the nano-textured cell. which could be due to the influence of the textured interface on the carrier relaxation dynamics.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:P0sSKRC7TM0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pushpendra_Kumar15/publication/324747627_Photoimpedance-Spectroscopy-Analysis-of-Planar-and-Nano-Textured-Thin-Film-Silicon-Solar-Cells/links/5ae0449e0f7e9b2859466c1f/Photoimpedance-Spectroscopy-Analysis-of-Planar-and-Nano-Textured-Thin-Film-Silicon-Solar-Cells.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pushpendra_Kumar15/publication/324747627_Photoimpedance-Spectroscopy-Analysis-of-Planar-and-Nano-Textured-Thin-Film-Silicon-Solar-Cells/links/5ae0449e0f7e9b2859466c1f/Photoimpedance-Spectroscopy-Analysis-of-Planar-and-Nano-Textured-Thin-Film-Silicon-Solar-Cells.pdf,0,0,0

Current mechanistic understanding of activation of these highly dynamic signalling receptors relies primarily on crystallographic information but many questions remain. Using 13C-methyl-methionine NMR we show that following cytoplasmic coupling of Gs-mimetic nanobodies to the β1-adrenergic receptor. the receptor is found in a dynamic ligand-efficacy dependent equilibrium between an active ternary complex when bound to full-agonist and a less-active conformation distinctive of basal activity. Structural differences between the conformations of these ternary complexes concentrate on the cytoplasmic side of the receptor indicating ligand-induced variations in G-protein mimetic interaction as the likely cause. providing a mechanistic framework for partial agonism for the Gs pathway. We compare differences in structure and dynamics for receptors bound to different orthosteric ligands. including observation of states representative of constitutive activity.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:xEWuX1mE_FUC,0,https://oak.novartis.com/id/eprint/33398,,,,,0,0,0

In contrast. a recent simulation study of plane shear flows by Mandal and Khakhar. suggests that the effective friction coefficient becomes maximum and then starts to decrease with increase in the inertial number for I> 0.5. In order to investigate whether such a dip at higher inertial numbers is indeed a feature of granular rheology. we perform DEM simulations of chute flow of highly inelastic disks. We show that steady. fully developed flows are possible at inclinations much higher than those normally reported in literature. At such high inclinations. the flow is characterised by a significant slip at the base; the height of the layer increases by more than 300% and kinetic energy of the layer increases by nearly 5 orders of magnitude.

Conventional I-Q mixers utilise hybrids. vias. cross over or wire-bonds for realisation. The reported design is based on a unique arrangement of six radio frequency (RF) power dividers with simpler routing for attaining similar performances for 10% RF bandwidth and fixed local oscillator (LO) frequency. The proposed topology is demonstrated by realising a mixer at 13.5 GHz in microwave integrated circuit (MIC) technology. With +10 dBm LO power. the measured maximum RF-I and RF-Q conversion loss is 13 dB and amplitude and phase imbalances are 0.1 dB root mean square (RMS) and 4.7° RMS over 1000 MHz bandwidth.

After the introduction of the state of the art of inverters for PV systems with and without transformers. the paper focuses on some known problems and challenges for transformer less inverters. Topologies without transformers have big advantages like low weight. volume and cost. In addition they often reach higher efficiencies than topologies with transformers. Eliminating the leakage current is one of the most important issues for transformer less inverters in grid-connected photovoltaic system applications. where the technical challenge is how to keep the system common-mode voltage constant to reduce the leakage current. To realize better utilization of PV modules and maximize the solar energy extraction. a distributed maximum power point tracking control scheme is applied to both single-and threephase multilevel inverters. which allows independent control of each dc-link voltage. For three-phase grid-connected applications. PV mismatches may introduce unbalanced supplied power. leading to unbalanced grid current. The intend of the fuzzy logic approach is to meet high quality output. minimum THD. fast response and high robustness. Finally Total Harmonics Distortion (THD) generated by the inverter is compared with conventional proportional Integral controls (PI) and fuzzy controller is evaluated.

Based on the literature. an attempt has been made to review the appropriate season. sensors and techniques used to map and monitor the three classes of salt-affected soils (saline. sodic and saline-sodic soils). The choice of season of satellite data for mapping of salt-affected soils depends on objective. crop rotation and rainfall pattern in an area. Both saline and saline-sodic soils show white reflectance but field survey and analysis of soils is required for differentiation of these soils. The visible and near-infra red bands are useful for separating saline and saline-sodic soils from non-salt-affected soils. In general. the surface of sodic soils become smooth due to hard crust and dark coloured due to dispersion of organic matter. and these indicators may be used to separate sodic soils from saline and saline-sodic soils when satellite data of appropriate season is taken. Generally thermal band is useful for separating sodic soils from saline and saline-sodic soils. The remote detection of salt-affected soils using various techniques (like principle component analysis. vegetation indices. Bayesian and neural networks. Support Vector Machine. Minimum Distance and Maximum Likelihood) has been reviewed and the conditions have been highlighted where the different approaches are likely to be most effective.

The inimical act of copious copying of other scholars’ intellectual property devoid of proper attribution or what is popularly regarded as ‘cut and paste’syndrome is a clear demonstration of the culture of mediocrity. The incidents of plagiarism nowadays seem to be on the increase especially with the advent of Internet which made information more easily available and accessible without any geographical barriers; therefore. researchers can have access to any document in any part of the world as easily as possible. The prevalence is traceable to the introduction of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in education as well as the plethora of online resources.(Gow. 2013)Nowadays the academic community especially research scholars and teachers are enthusiastic in publishing the results of their research in conference proceedings. books and journals. Unleashing one’s own work to the public not only gives him satisfaction and fame but also proves to be academically and professionally beneficial. This has resulted in urge to publish more. But what is more important is to keep the originality and ethics in the context of the published paper.

Current diagnostic criteria for AKI poorly recognize early renal dysfunction & may cause delayed diagnosis. We evaluated the use of serum cystatin C for the early and accurate diagnosis of AKI in patients hospitalized in Intensive care unit. Our estimation of kidney function of estimated glomerular filtration rate is clinically dependent on equations like Cockgroft formula which has a inverse relation to Serum Creatinine and its incorrect and late evaluation makes our approach incorrect thus delaying the patients recovery. Serum Creatinine is also dependent on parameters of age. sex. Body mass index & thus leads to an inaccurate measurement of kidney function. Serum Creatinine is limited as a marker of kidney dysfunction in the settings and may be inaccurate in several situations. such as in patients with low muscle mass or with fluid overload or high muscle mass or age. New biomarkers have the potential to identify earlier patients with AKI and in the future potentially intervene to modify outcomes. Equations combining serum cystatin C and Serum Creatinine perform better than the equations using either cystatin C or SCr alone. especially in situations where CKD needs to be confirmed. Combining creatinine. cystatin C and urine albumin to creatinine ratio improves risk stratification for kidney disease progression and mortality.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:tSVUDDkujAIC,0,http://jamdsr.com/uploadfiles/20_Cystatin_c_to_detect_early_acute_kidney_injury_81-85.20170312055910.PDF,,,,http://jamdsr.com/uploadfiles/20_Cystatin_c_to_detect_early_acute_kidney_injury_81-85.20170312055910.PDF,0,0,0
103562,The gender of caste: representing Dalits in print. by Charu Gupta,2017,Prabhat Kumar,8,,1,103-105,Routledge,The book under review is primarily an exploration into the representation of Dalit-subalterns in the twentieth-century Hindi public sphere. In doing so. it probes the intersectionality of caste and gender across multiple sites and registers of representation from a Dalit-feminist perspective. More importantly. the book privileges not the normative but everyday lives and practices in understanding the history of Dalit bodies and their representations. By juxtaposing a variety of literary and visual sources around a range of seemingly unconnected issues. the book foregrounds contested. variegated and shifting representations of Dalit men and women in Hindi print. This layered. and often contradictory. history of representation not only takes into account the politics of representing the other as well as the self. but also highlights their mutually conflicting but constitutive aspects.The first two chapters are primarily about …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:a67U_wXq1t0C,0,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19472498.2016.1260368,,,,,0,0,0

Highways and important roads are extensively flexible pavements. These flexible pavements deteriorate much faster than their design life. There are many factors which contribute to the deterioration of pavements. In this thesis. an attempt has been made to find out an equation which predicts the pavement deterioration over the years. By knowing the deterioration extent. we could predict the performance of the pavement. For this. all the factors contributing for the deterioration are taken into account. Few road networks are selected and Condition data. Traffic data. Pavement composition data. Road inventory of these are studied for the past two editions. Pavement Condition Index. Structural number are found out. Homogeneous sectioning is performed and then modelling is done. Modelling is done to find out the Roughness/Distresses (Cracking. Potholing) in the pavement. The results obtained from modelling are compared with the one obtained from survey data in that particular year. Graphs are drawn and a trend-line is extrapolated. This trendline gives us the equation which helps us to predict the future condition of the distress/roughness. which helps in predicting the condition of the pavement.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:bb2qmbnIBKIC,0,http://ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/8744/,,,,,0,0,0
103567,Behaviour of Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil (GRS) Wall as a Bridge Abutment Using Numerical Analysis,2017,Pavan Kumar Pelluru Venkata,,,,,,Reinforced soil walls (RSW) are the cost effective soil retaining walls and are gaining popularity now a days. The factors influencing the use of these walls includes economical. simple and fast construction techniques. better seismic performance. The use of GRS walls as bridge abutment is an alternative to the conventional use of deep foundation systems to support the bridge abutment. These effectively reduce the differential settlement arising between the bridge abutment and the approach roadway and this is called as the ‘bump at the bridge problem’. To check the stability of these structures the Limit equilibrium methods are commonly used because of its simplicity. Mostly these methods are empirical in nature and they don’t consider actual soil reinforcement interaction. Finite element method (FEM) and limit analysis (LA) methods are effective in finding the stability of a structure. The present study. discusses the numerical analysis of a full scale reinforced soil wall using commercially available software’s PLAXIS 2D and LimitState:GEO. The deformation and safety analysis has been carried out for the RSW by considering a surcharge on it which can be simulated as a bridge abutment. The effect of different parameters such as unit weight and the angle of internal friction of the; length of the reinforcement; the number of reinforcement; and interface coefficient between backfill and reinforcement on the performance of the GRS wall has been studied. The surcharge is applied on the wall with a certain setback distance (D) in terms of the height of the wall (H).

103574,Some design parametric considerations of cryogenic pre-cooler for spices grinding,2017,P Barnwal and KK Singh and P Kumar and SN Saxena,7,International J. Seed Spices,1,12-18,,Some design parametric considerations of cryogenic pre-cooler for grinding of spices (fenugreek and coriander seed) were studied. In conventional or ambient grinding of spices. temperature rise causes fat malting and sieve clogging. In grinding operation. spices lose a significant portion of their volatile oil or flavouring components due to rise in temperature. To overcome these drawbacks. cryogenic grinding is employed which is referred as the grinding of spices in the presence of a cryogenic fluid. A Cryogenic spice grinding system consists a pre-cooling unit (cryogenic pre-cooler) and grinding unit (grinder). The cryogenic pre-cooler plays very important role for cryogenic grinding of spices. Some design parameters of cryogenic pre-cooler (eg total freezing time. screw length and capacity etc.) were computed for grinding of fenugreek and coriander seed. Total freezing time is a one of the important deciding parameter for screw length. For constant values of screw diameter and pitch. the capacity and screw length of pre-cooler were computed at different speed (3. 6. 9. 12 and 15 rpm) of cooling screw of the cryogenic pre-cooler. It was found that the screw length and capacity of cryogenic pre-cooler for fenugreek and coriander seeds increased linearly with increase in cooling screw speed from 3 to 15 rpm.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:HV_RJt6Pqn0C,0,http://isss.ind.in/pdf/2017/3.pdf,,,,http://isss.ind.in/pdf/2017/3.pdf,0,0,0

As such. it has been of immense importance for the researchers to explicitly examine the role of virtuous marketing practices in shaping attitude of consumers. Accordingly. by means of a survey based investigation conducted with urban female consumers. this study probes the attitude of shoppers towards businesses’ ethicality in their marketing activities. Results indicate that righteousness in marketing communications and fairness in distribution channels exhibit a positive relationship with the attitude of consumers which further impacts their intentions to peruse marketers’ ethicalities while developing plans to buy cosmetics products. Furthermore. in an ethical marketing context. subjective norms and perceived behavioral control also influence consumer intentions significantly. It is also discovered that consumer lifestyle facets reflected by religiosity and women’s role and perception exert no moderating influence over the attitude-intention link.

103583,Control of absorptiion and dispersion of light by coherence in a atoms and molecules,2016,P Kumar,,,,,,The objective of this thesis is to explore the effects of the quantum coherence towards the precise control of the manipulation of the interaction between the atomic or molecular systems and the electromagnetic fields. This leads to the maneuvering of the optical response of the medium. More precisely. the present study is devoted to the coherence phenomena designated for the manipulation of dispersion together with absorption in an anisotropic as well as an isotropic medium. Such a control is attributed to the quantum interference created by the control field. Many novel optical phenomena such as electromagnetically induced transparency. coherent population trapping. lasing without inversion. saturated absorption techniques. enhancement of refractive index. manipulation of group velocity etc. are consequences of the quantum interference and coherence. Coherence can also be generated by vacuum that …,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:Kr09a2QcR50C,0,http://dspace.iitrpr.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/769,,,,,0,0,0

103701,An efficient approach for relay node placement in wireless sensor network,2015,Prateek Kumar and Priyanka Dayal,,,,23-26,IEEE,Sensors are small battery operated devices having small life span. These sensors are deployed in harsh conditions and hence are susceptible to failure. If any of sensor nodes dies or malfunction in the network. then the data collected by the base station may be incorrect and degrades quality of decisions made by the base station. Relay node placement is an efficient method which can be used to restore connectivity of the partitioned network. However. these relay nodes are costlier than the sensor node and therefore the count of relay nodes deployed should be minimized. This paper presents an efficient technique to place relay nodes in the partitioned wireless sensor network so as to restore connectivity. The technique discussed in this paper is based on game theory and calculates PDF of each partition.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:MwdXMY9cq6YC,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7489596/,,,,,0,0,0

103705,Multiversion Conflict Notion for Transactional Memory Systems,2015,Priyanka Kumar and Sathya Peri,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.04048,,,,In recent years. Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs) have garnered significant interest as an elegant alternative for addressing concurrency issues in memory. STM systems take optimistic approach. Multiple transactions are allowed to execute concurrently. On completion. each transaction is validated and if any inconsistency is observed it is aborted. Otherwise it is allowed to commit.In databases a class of histories called as conflict-serializability (CSR) based on the notion of conflicts have been identified. whose membership can be efficiently verified. As a result. CSR is the commonly used correctness criterion in databases. Similarly. using the notion of conflicts. a correctness criterion. conflict-opacity (co-opacity) which is a sub-class of can be designed whose membership can be verified in polynomial time. Using the verification mechanism. an efficient STM implementation can be designed that is permissive wrt co-opacity.,True,mO0yDzQAAAAJ:1xqo9R7SDZkC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04048,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.04048,0,0,0
