Estimation is performed at two levels: the basic level uses contributions from first‐order groups. while the next higher level uses a small set of second‐order groups having the first‐order groups as building blocks. Thus. the method provides both a first‐order approximation (first‐order group contributions) and a more accurate second‐order prediction (first‐ and second‐order group contributions). This article discusses methods for prediction of normal boiling point. normal melting point. critical pressure. critical temperature. critical volume. standard enthalpy of vaporization at 298 K. standard Gibbs energy. and standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K.

The proposed CAMD algorithm takes the following four steps: 1. preselect groups and target properties; 2. generate only a feasible set of compound structures in an optimal fashion; 3. predict properties for the screening of the set of feasible compound structures; and finally 4. select/design the compound. Since the success of any CAMD algorithm depends to a large extent on its ability to predict/compute the needed properties. the importance of the choice and applicability of these methods is considered along with the computational aspects related to the development of a computer program based on the proposed methodology.

This framework is based on the recently developed property clustering approach that allows one to perform design calculations on a component-free (or composition-free) basis. Removing the composition dependency from the design problem enables the simultaneous consideration of process and product selection and optimization. The clustering concept is based on the observation that properties. unlike mass. are not conserved and consequently they cannot be tracked among process units without performing component material balances. To overcome these limitations the use of property-based clusters has been proposed.

In this contribution. heuristic rules for entrainer selection and the design of entrainers through computer-aided molecular design are reviewed.

The MBLD transition lies at energy density significantly above the equilibrium spin glass transition. indicating that the closed system dynamics freezes well outside of the traditional glass phase.

This paper presents an analysis of the environmental conflict that arose between the state. society. and industry stakeholders in an industrial zone of the Eastern Seaboard Development Program of Thailand. This paper seeks to determine the effectiveness of policy measures implemented by the state to resolve the conflict. The purpose of this study is to draw lessons for industrializing nations that adopt the industrial zone model to foster environmentally sustainable industrial development. The study revealed that blatant violation of land-use planning regulations and expansion of the industrial zone into community areas was a root cause of the conflict. Through legal action. civil society has been successful in forcing the state and industries to halt unplanned expansion of industrial areas and practice better environmental governance. However. inadequate commitment by the state and industry stakeholders seems to perpetuate the conflict. threatening the sustainability of economic gains. A Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based analysis confirmed that the policy interventions of the government to resolve the conflict have not produced significant results.

It radiates from mixed commercial areas in the center to low density residential areas in the periphery. This pattern generates significant traffic volume towards city center. The gener-ated traffic releases emissions and degrades urban air quality since fossil fuel is predominantly used by vehicles in Bandung. In the absence of air polluting industries as well as construction and demolition activities. traffic load generated by land use changes is the only major contribu-tor to air quality degradation in the city. The land use change can therefore be seen as primary determinant of air pollution in Bandung. This study analyses land use changes and its impacts on traffic pattern and air quality. Multivariate correlation between traffic load and land use changes is employed as tool to substantiate the proposition. Relationships between the degree of chang-es in land use. as reflected in traffic loads. and the quantity of two principal air pollutants. namely SO2 and HC are also established to validate the argument.

1217330,Corroborating the land use change as primary determinant of air quality degradation in a concentric city,2015,Ariva Sugandi Permana and Ranjith Perera and Norsiah A Aziz and Chin Siong Ho,2,International Journal of Built Environment and Sustainability,2,,,Bandung City is characterized by concentric land use pattern as found in many naturally grown cities. It radiates from mixed commercial areas in the center to low density residential areas in the periphery. This pattern generates significant traffic volume towards city center. The gener-ated traffic releases emissions and degrades urban air quality since fossil fuel is predominantly used by vehicles in Bandung. In the absence of air polluting industries as well as construction and demolition activities. traffic load generated by land use changes is the only major contribu-tor to air quality degradation in the city. The land use change can therefore be seen as primary determinant of air pollution in Bandung. This study analyses land use changes and its impacts on traffic pattern and air quality. Multivariate correlation between traffic load and land use changes is employed as tool to substantiate the proposition. Relationships between the degree of chang-es in land use. as reflected in traffic loads. and the quantity of two principal air pollutants. namely SO2 and HC are also established to validate the argument. The result of analysis sub-stantiates the correlation between land use changes and air quality degradation.,True,I2Jt2HsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,8,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/60,9607150989953980487,/scholar?cites=9607150989953980487,,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/viewFile/60/26,0,0,0

The role that housing plays in the social and economic development of a country cannot be underestimated. Interventions in housing by government are widely acknowledged as one of the ways by which the social aspect of the life of the citizenry can be impacted especially through mass housing otherwise called social housing. This paper aims to examine the various potentials in the housing sector in order to enhance the delivery of more housing to Nigerians. A survey research approach was used in the study. Descriptive analysis was employed to explain the potentials in the housing sector. Housing deficit in Nigeria currently stands at about 17 million units. Efforts to meet and rectify the deficit will need a concerted effort of individuals and government. It requires unleashing the potentials in the housing sector to stimulate growth in the economy. thereby diversifying the economy from the mono to a multi sector economy. Interventions of governments at all levels as well as the involvement of informal sector in the housing sector will have a multiplier effect. It will generate multiple employment opportunities which will in turn stimulate the economy through the circulation of money in the system. The paper noted that interventions in housing sector will stimulate industries in the production of local building materials. Additionally. ailing companies will be revitalized. thereby improving the standard of living of the citizens.

Because of the nature of these enterprises with their inefficient use of energy and other resources. they contribute to local pollution and other environmental problems. Studies on the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from these industries are few. especially in developing countries. This article presents an estimation of CO2 emission due to energy (fuel and electricity) consumption in seven SMI sectors in Indonesia. The specific energy consumption and the energy intensity (energy use per value addition) of these sectors have been estimated.

Photovoltaic (PV) based electricity is an interesting option to provide quality light and better service in these situations. A PV based micro-utility system was initiated in a rural market in Bangladesh in October 1999. Twenty one shop owners were provided electricity for 5 h a day on fee-for-service basis. and paid a tariff daily. A local operator cum technician was trained to take care of the system and in charge of repair. maintenance and tariff collection. Feedback from the users of the system indicates that PV based electricity has been providing very satisfactory service to the consumers. The success of this type of PV dissemination model has been due to the users’ willingness to pay a daily tariff. clear agreements with the Bazaar Management Committee and users. and operator training.

They rely solely on self-water supply (free source) such as rivers. perennial streams. water ponds and unprotected wells which is susceptible to water borne diseases such as typhoid fever. cholera. dysentery. malaria parasites etc. These rural populations are engaged in farming activities with low income level living in small scattered settlements thus. making provision of piped water supply very difficult. Governments’ interventions towards rural water supply have been through the provision of hand-operated boreholes and wells. These sources yield little or no water during the dry season and are prone to frequent breakdown; leading water crisis and shortages. This situation forces households especially the women and children to spend more time walking longer distances during the dry season to trot water for domestic purposes.

Damaturu town became a state capital in August 1991. Since then the population has been on a steady increase mainly due to influx of people and its strategic location along axial route to major cities in the northeast region. Wastes are being generated mainly from residential. commercial and institutional land uses. Waste collection bins are placed at strategic locations identified by the agency and termed as high waste generating points with wheeled plastic waste bins. metal waste bins and constructed waste bunkers. The contents of these bins are finally disposed of at a location 6 kilometers away from the generating points. Spatial data on waste distribution was collected using a global positioning system (GPS). The data was manipulated and processed using Geographic information system (GIS) to produce the waste distribution map. Findings revealed that the existing solid waste management system is inefficient as the present practice rely on monthly collection and disposal of waste using an open dump site.,True,fv93Od4AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,37,https://file.scirp.org/pdf/JEP20100400004_43795261.pdf,15510139695817874421,/scholar?cites=15510139695817874421,,https://file.scirp.org/pdf/JEP20100400004_43795261.pdf,0,0,0

The focus of the study was on the changes in physical-chemical and biological environment as well as on the socioeconomy of fishermen in the form of fishery productivity and income level. Field observation and qualitative descriptive analysis were used as an approach. Data were gathered from government institutions and from a set of questionnaires handed out to a total of 89 respondents. Results showed that reclamation activities changed the environment such as coastal morphology. hydro-oceanography. mangrove and coral reefs deterioration. Other effects are the hill-cutting and tree-cutting of the surrounding area to get filling materials for the reclamation project. Among the consequences observed and recorded were flooding. erosions. sedimentations. and adverse influences on the seawater quality. sea biota. local depletion of several kinds of fishes such as snappers. groupers. and shrimps.

Researchers have categorized various types of urban sprawls. distinguished by their patterns and causes. These various categories of sprawls call for solutions of different approaches. This paper discusses a study carried out to identify the type of sprawl being experienced by a rapidly growing urban area in the southern part of Malaysia. The Landsat TM images of the study area. the City of Johor Bahru. for the years 1988. 1997 and 2005 were classified to detect for any occurrence of sprawl and its type. The classified images of the city for 1988. 1997 and 2005 showed a rapid increase of urbanized area of 231 km2. 304 km2 and 416 km2 respectively. Spatial investigation of the growth of the city. however. revealed an unsustainable growth in different directions along major roads. leaving pockets of undeveloped areas scattered within the city limit. This is typical of a ribbon sprawl where development occurs along major roads. In order to address this ribbon-type sprawl. certain urban planning policies such as the introduction of urban growth boundary and promotion of infill development are needed. These solutions and several others are discussed in the paper with the intention to come up with planning policies that would make the city more sustainable.,True,fv93Od4AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Majid/publication/283672018_Sprawling_Of_A_Malaysian_City_What_Type_And_What_Solutions/links/56430ffe08ae54697fb2bc5b/Sprawling-Of-A-Malaysian-City-What-Type-And-What-Solutions.pdf,6261706349307484981,/scholar?cites=6261706349307484981,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Majid/publication/283672018_Sprawling_Of_A_Malaysian_City_What_Type_And_What_Solutions/links/56430ffe08ae54697fb2bc5b/Sprawling-Of-A-Malaysian-City-What-Type-And-What-Solutions.pdf,0,0,0

1217389,The Consequences of Drought and Desertification in Nigeria.,2009,Nasiru Idris Medugu and Mohammed Rafee Majid and Foziah Johar,3,IUP Journal of Environmental Sciences,3,,,Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa with an estimated population of over 140 million and a total land area of 923.773 km². The country is currently losing about 351.000 ha annually to advancing desert and such conditions are estimated to be advancing southwards at the rate of about 0.6 km per year. The dunes are threatening life-supporting oasis. burying water points. and in some cases. engulfing major roads in the affected areas. Trees planted by the government as shelterbelts to check the advancing dunes are withering due to the lack of attention. This paper highlights the state of desertification in Nigeria. the historical trends. the past national efforts. as well as the ongoing and planned measures for combating this fast-spreading desert condition. It further reveals the failures of the past national efforts-projects that have not been designed to adequately tackle the problems of drought and desertification …,True,fv93Od4AAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,11,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09739912&asa=Y&AN=44705534&h=0p3NYeCqoB0BnFhdqJaZ7WlYEIIQMSJQN0HpuWPIgcJ4%2FQdqziw5w%2F%2Byb%2F7APQ4y6BwIEEd%2BHxZMQprIK%2Bwc0g%3D%3D&crl=c,10556743883906492349,/scholar?cites=10556743883906492349,,,0,0,0

1217391,Mapping poverty hot spots in peninsular Malaysia using spatial autocorrelation analysis,2016,M Rafee Majid and Abdul Razak Jaffar and Noordini Che Man and Mehrdad Vaziri and Mohamed Sulemana,14,Planning Malaysia,4,,,In September 2000 The Millennium Summit adopted the UN Millennium Declaration. committing nations to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty with a deadline of 2015. Eight Millennium Development Goals were formulated of which the eradication of poverty given top priority. However. Malaysia's participation with the UN in dealing with poverty. precede this when it committed itself with the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) programme. which was then reinforced when the Millennium Declaration was made in 2000. Nationally. poverty eradication as well as bridging the inequality gap among the major ethnic groups and states has been the main development goal in Malaysia's development agenda since independence. In this regards. the principle of â€ œgrowth with equity has been the central theme in all Malaysia's development policies and efforts since independence. Although Malaysia has made significant achievements in reducing the incidence of aggregate poverty across the country from 8.9% in 1995 down to 1.7% in 2012. there still exist pockets of poverty in the rural areas. in certain states/regions and among ethnic groups. as well as in some urban areas. This shows that formulating planning and policy implementation to eradicate poverty now needs to be more spatially focused for the implementation to be more effective. Recognising the incidence of poverty through standard statistical data tables alone is no longer adequate in formulating planning and policy implementation.

1217392,Protected area management in Nigeria: A review,2015,Hassan Abdulaziz and Foziah Johar and Mohammad Rafee Majid and Nasiru Idris Medugu,77,,15,,,Nigeria like other countries has experienced rapid increase in number and sizes of protected areas in the last century. As a result. a number of policies. agencies and departments were established to ensure proper protection and management of these areas. To ensure management effectiveness. frequent evaluation is necessary. This paper is a review of relevant literatures on protected area management effectiveness and collaboration in management. The findings of the review indicated that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) framework is the most widely used for assessing management effectiveness of protected areas. However. a limitation of the framework is its deficiency to integrate collaboration and motivation. These factors play vital roles in effective management of protected areas through promoting wildlife conservation particularly in developing world. Therefore. this paper proposes a hybrid framework for evaluating protected area management effectiveness. consisting of the IUCN framework. collaboration and motivation to be used in subsequent assessment of protected areas.

However. this information is severely limited. and most users rely on published topographic maps or DEMs produced by government agencies. This paper proposes an alternative method of generating DEM by using online source of elevation data which is easier and free. The result shows that. the difference in percent of the watershed boundary is 0.19% by using Google Earth’s elevation data as it compared with the same watershed area which is delineated using 20 meter interval contour data obtained from JUPEM (Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia). Firstly. the location of the study area identified in Google Earth. was divided into thirty-six areas and marked using provided mark functions in Google Earth. The coordinates were exported to an online application tool named Terrain Zonum Solutions for extracting 5000 elevation points for each thirty-six areas. These points were uploaded and processed in ArcGIS software (version 9.3. 1) to generate the DEM. As to compare the reliability of the elevation values that extracted from Google Earth. the DEM was utilized and integrated with river line data to delineate Sungai Muar’s watershed boundary using ArcHydro version 1.4 tool.

This process is believed to have some influences like gentrification and can stimulate social segregation and the widening socio-spatial polarization of different social groups. via the displacement of established residential groups. Studentification has been represented as a BritiSh phenomenon; although; recent evidence suggests that it occurs within other international contexts. The important key factor in this regard is the government-sponsored expansion of higher education to foster global economic competitiveness and innovation via knowledge-based economies and societies.

1217442,Spatiotemporal land use change analysis using open-source GIS and web based application,2015,Wan Yusryzal Wan Ibrahim and Ahmad Nazri Muhamad Ludin,2,International Journal of Built Environment and Sustainability,2,,,Spatiotemporal changes are very important information to reveal the characteristics of the urbanization process. Sharing the information is beneficial for public awareness which then improves their participation in adaptive management for spatial planning process. Open-source software and web application are freely available tools that can be the best medium used by any individual or agencies to share this important information. The objective of the paper is to discuss on the spatiotemporal land use change in Iskandar Malaysia by using open-source GIS (Quantum GIS) and publish them through web application (Mash-up). Land use in 1994 to 2011 were developed and analyzed to show the landscape change of the region. Subsequently. web application was setup to distribute the findings of the study. The result show there is significant changes of land use in the study area especially on the decline of agricultural and natural land which were converted to urban land uses. Residential and industrial areas largely replaced the agriculture and natural areas particularly along the coastal zone of the region. This information is published through interactive GIS web in order to share it with the public and stakeholders. There are some limitations of web application but still not hindering the advantages of using it. The integration of open-source GIS and web application is very helpful in sharing planning information particularly in the study area that experiences rapid land use and land cover change.

Urbanization contributes many advantages in terms of economics. but if uncontrolled. would create negative consequences to the physical. social and natural environment. Since planning is a future-oriented activity and necessitates forecast. the urban model is one of the techniques that assist planners to implement their work systematically. Geographic Information System (GIS) has provided an alternative tool in spatial modelling which contribute to much clearer understanding of the real planning problems as well as prescriptive planning scenarios to enhance the quality of urban planning and management. GIS notably provide a strong platform for decision makers in its role as the main component in Planning Support System (PSS) and Decision Support System (DSS). This paper will discuss the development and application of a PSS and DSS in the generation and selection of alternatives. A case study in Gombak District. located in the Klang Valley which is a rapidly growing region in Malaysia. are used to generate land use planning scenarios based on specified planning policies. The planning scenarios are then evaluated by using a Decision Support Software Definite. to improve the quality of decision making through the selection of better alternatives.,True,frMcz5IAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,8,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11777276.pdf,17064171517468054985,/scholar?cites=17064171517468054985,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11777276.pdf,0,0,0

This study aims at providing some guiding principles for development of affordable housing with respect to TOD concept. As such. the study employed an index called Affordability Index (AI) and adapted for the study area to assess the neighbourhoods' affordability. It is composed of housing cost. household transportation cost. and household income. The analyses were conducted on three neighbourhoods in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia. The results reveal that the AI is lower for both owners and renters in the neighbourhood farther away from the LRT station. where there is less public transit facility. despite the existence of more affordable housing. On the contrary. the index is high in the neighbourhood where the distance to LRT station is shorter. connectivity index is higher. and there are more public transport facilities. despite the presence of high-and medium-cost housings.

This paper looks at the missing link between land use planning and urban growth. and it implications for environmental sustainability in a selected sub Saharan Africa city of Kaduna. Nigeria. We assessed urban growth from historical GIS data of the city to evaluate the urban expansion. At the same time. regression analysis was used to established relationship between carbon emission and traffic volume in the city. A city characterized by weak land use planning has created a gap leading to uncoordinated land use planning and uncontrolled physical growth. A steady increase of built up area of 8.400.31 hectares in 1982 to an area of 17.120.5 hectares in 2015 can be a reflection of the presence of uncontrolled urban expansion. The lack of coordination between land use planning and urban growth has resulted to environmental ills within the city. One among the ills. is ubiquitous traffic congestion within the city leading to high carbon (CO2) emission. Findings shows a strong connection between emission and volume of traffic. In addition to findings. is the decline of green areas in the city. By this findings. it is suggested that the modern concept of land use planning which embraces flexibility. public participation and integration of environmental issues should be entrenched and allow to take the lead in the process of urban growth.,True,9_h8pSIAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,7,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/181,4205616098883849726,/scholar?cites=4205616098883849726,,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/viewFile/181/98,0,0,0

These. combined with field survey/checks. were brought into a GIS environment using ILWIS 3.2 Academic image classification software to map the land use/land cover and to estimate the rate of urban expansion and loss of rural land at the periurban fringes of Umuahia between 1991 and 2007. The study revealed significant changes in land use types over the period of study. It was observed that while built-up area and vacant landuse types increased over the study period. agricultural land and vegetation depreciated significantly. This development raises concerns. given the rate of deforestation and loss of cultivable land in the study area. Although other environmental and ecological problems such as increased runoff/flash floods. soil erosion and pollution of surface and underground water are identified as being caused by urban expansion. there is the need for further inquiry/investigation.

Baba and Daniel Ogbaje,7,Journal of Agriculture and Social Sciences,,1-6,,Remote sensing data are reliable basis for making predictions about growth. Present study was aimed to analyze the spatial growth through remote sensing (RS) data to assess urban expansion in Kogi state. central Nigeria. This study integrated LandSat TM of 1987. LandSat ETM 2001 and Nigeria Saturday. 1 2005 satellite imageries and came out with a comprehensive land cover change over the period. 1987-2005. It used ILWIS 3.1 for image processing. which were classified into these land uses; bare surface. built-up area. cultivated area. natural vegetation and water body. The analysis shows that between. 1987 and 2005 the size of the built-up area (settlement) increased by 9.97 km 2 from 0.34 km 2. with over 162% growth rate indicating a rapid rate of physical development. Arising from this is the substantial ecological resources increasingly being lost due to the physical expansion. Other problems include flooding. over-stressed facilities and environmental pollution. The study conclude by recommending the increased use of RS data in urban management because it is one of the best approach to making inventory and to map. monitor urban growth and model the natural environment.© 2011 Friends Science Publishers,True,9_h8pSIAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Davidson_Alaci2/publication/216653522_Spatial_Growth_Assessment_with_Remote_Sensing_Data_for_Central_Nigeria/links/003a6439b71f91be70da285e.pdf,11738748929785252449,/scholar?cites=11738748929785252449,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Davidson_Alaci2/publication/216653522_Spatial_Growth_Assessment_with_Remote_Sensing_Data_for_Central_Nigeria/links/003a6439b71f91be70da285e.pdf,0,0,0

Ojoko,2,"International Journal of Scientific Research in Science, Engineering and Technology (IJSRSET)",3,572-577,IJSRSET,The rate of deforestation in Nigeria is considered one of the highest in the world resulting in land degradation. desertification and loss of biodiversity. Consequently. Nigeria’s contribution to global GHGs emissions. global warming and climate change has soared geometrically. threatening socioeconomic growth and sustainable development. Deforestation and by extension desertification adversely affects the livelihoods of forest dwelling people who dependent directly or indirectly on land and forests. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) Goal 15 (G-15) aims to promote the sustainable management of forests. combat desertification. land degradation. loss of biodiversity and its effects on climate change in developing countries like Nigeria. Therefore. this paper proposes the concepts sustainable land use (SLU). forest resources management (FRM) and Protection of Biodiversity (PBD) as measures to climate change resulting rapid deforestation. desertification and land degradation in Nigeria. The results and conclusions of the paper submit that SLU. FRM and PBD can significantly reduce the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by investments in early warning systems. public awareness. and educational sensitization campaigns. The successful adoption and implementation of SLU.

Nigeria.,2018,Joy O Obadoba and Adams Ndalai Baba,,Proceedings of ICGET,,48-51,,The system of planning regulations and standards in urban areas of many countries located in the Global South has been criticised due to its unrealistic ambitious standards and bureaucratic procedures. Access to formal land and shelter is put out of reach of low-income earners who have little or no choice but to end up living in unintended settlements. illegal. poorly. and haphazardly constructed structures. within the urban centres and sometimes at the urban fringes including poor access to basic infrastructure. This research carried out an assessment of land development and planning regulation in Lokoja. Nigeria by comparing formal and non-formal residential land developments. The study employed qualitative methods of data collection with information drawn from 15 respondents. Results from field measurement and interviews were analysed using ATLAS ti and presented using the descriptive method. Findings from the study revealed that residential land development is non-formal due to exclusion of low-income earners in accessing formal land. The officials involved in the land administration have weak institutional capacity to check and control land development effectively. Furthermore. lack of political will to develop a concise framework that is workable and inclusive limits the ability of major land developers to comply fully with the planning standards and regulations. The study recommends an inclusive land administration system that reflects the characteristics of citizens. especially the low-income earners.,True,9_h8pSIAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joy_Obadoba2/publication/328381574_Land_Development_and_Planning_Regulations_in_Lokoja_Nigeria/links/5bc9735392851cae21b1d76c/Land-Development-and-Planning-Regulations-in-Lokoja-Nigeria.pdf,243074773476580991,/scholar?cites=243074773476580991,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joy_Obadoba2/publication/328381574_Land_Development_and_Planning_Regulations_in_Lokoja_Nigeria/links/5bc9735392851cae21b1d76c/Land-Development-and-Planning-Regulations-in-Lokoja-Nigeria.pdf,0,0,0

Increasingly. home-based enterprises (HBEs) has become a prevalent means of metropolitan urbanisation with varied components manifesting in new guises and in unexpected places. The limited assumptions that they are activities of poor households blur the understanding of their occurrences in planned neighbourhoods whose inhabitants in most cases have guaranteed livelihood and strive to enhance their well-being through such engagements. The paper measured the well-being perception of entrepreneurs on four variables that reflects economic. social. environment and safety in ten neighbourhoods of Lokoja. A total of 353 copies of questionnaires structured on 5-point Likert’s scale were administered to the entire population of HBE operators in the neighbourhoods. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) through structural equation modelling of measured well-being variables indicated satisfactory goodness of fit among accepted determinants of the model. The result revealed that well-being of households is not only predicated on economic gains as reflected in the p-value of the well-being construct in the structural model. rather social. environment and safety factors have also been found to be significant in the model. The findings of this study have shown that businesses carried out are compatible with domestic activities offering entrepreneurs psychological satisfaction. happiness. and life fulfilment.

The origin of these different traditional building body associates with the natural materials availability to the local builders as well as religious belief. cultural and taboos. The advent of colonialism in Nigeria changed the traditional life and culture of Nigerian which creates a weak connection between traditional architecture and contemporary architecture in Nigeria. Most recent buildings designs across Hausa regions in Nigeria have been built with imported materials and the construction techniques tailored to satisfy the modernity self-ego and aspirations. Thus. traditional architecture ought not to be abandoned and forgotten. hence; experts’ awareness should be tailored to the understanding of its original essence.

This paper looks at the missing link between land use planning and urban growth. and it implications for environmental sustainability in a selected sub Saharan Africa city of Kaduna. Nigeria. We assessed urban growth from historical GIS data of the city to evaluate the urban expansion. At the same time. regression analysis was used to established relationship between carbon emission and traffic volume in the city. A city characterized by weak land use planning has created a gap leading to uncoordinated land use planning and uncontrolled physical growth. A steady increase of built up area of 8.400.31 hectares in 1982 to an area of 17.120.5 hectares in 2015 can be a reflection of the presence of uncontrolled urban expansion. The lack of coordination between land use planning and urban growth has resulted to environmental ills within the city. One among the ills. is ubiquitous traffic congestion within the city leading to high carbon (CO2) emission. Findings shows a strong connection between emission and volume of traffic. In addition to findings. is the decline of green areas in the city. By this findings. it is suggested that the modern concept of land use planning which embraces flexibility. public participation and integration of environmental issues should be entrenched and allow to take the lead in the process of urban growth.,True,qcKIazsAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,7,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/181,4205616098883849726,/scholar?cites=4205616098883849726,,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/viewFile/181/98,0,0,0

There have been challenges encountered by the planners. landscape architects and allied professionals towards improving the physical quality of Oja in recent time. Plethora of relevant literatures revealed persistence advocacy necessary to improve the physical quality of Oja in diverse forms. However. fewer studies have attempted to explore the residents’ contributions to its improvement through community efforts initiatives in South-west region of Nigeria. Consequently. this research explored the factors responsible to improvement on the physical quality of Oja through residents’ collective opinion efforts. The qualitative method was adopted for the study through focus group interview comprising thirty-five (n= 35) Hausa. Ibo. and Yoruba participants. The decision extracts from the deliberations were analysed using content analysis and QSR (10) Nvivo software. Research findings revealed that Oja physical quality could be improved upon through residents’ opinions and views as supportive mechanisms to government initiative drives. This research suggests joint collaboration efforts between governments; stake holders and community residents towards improvement of Oja. It is therefore recommended that residents’ participation and opinions in decision making concerning Oja could further enhance the physical condition towards higher satisfaction in Nigeria.

Hal tersebut sebenarnya bisa diminimalisir dengan kemampuan berjalan kaki anak dalam mengakses sekolah dasar. Penelitian ini menjelaskan mengenai faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi pemilihan moda bermotor anak dalam mengakses sekolah dasar di Kota Surakarta. Penelitian ini menggunakan data primer berupa penyebaran kuisioner kepada 138 responden. Teknik yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah teknik analisis faktor. Berdasarkan pembahasan dan analisis dalam penelitian ini dapat disimpulkan bahwa melalui analisis faktor dapat diperoleh 6 kelompok faktor yang mempengaruhi pemilihan moda bermotor anak dalam mengakses sekolah dasar di Kota Surakarta. Kelompok faktor pertama memiliki pengaruh paling besar dalam mempengaruhi pemilihan moda bermotor anak dalam mengakses sekolah dasar di Kota Surakarta dengan nilai sebesar 33.927%.,True,TZHsLOkAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,1,https://jurnal.uns.ac.id/region/article/view/21164,18320267672891216993,/scholar?cites=18320267672891216993,,https://jurnal.uns.ac.id/region/article/download/21164/18636,0,0,0

1217524,Faktor-faktor yang Mempengaruhi Pemilihan Sekolah Dasar dalam Mendukung Kota Surakarta Layak Anak,2018,Resty Darma Saputri,,,,,UNS (Sebelas Maret University),Pemenuhan kebutuhan anak akan fasilitas sosial menjadi salah satu urgensi dalam perkembangan kota mengingat penduduk pada usia anak memiliki hak yang sama dengan penduduk berusia dewasa. Tidak seperti penduduk berusia dewasa. pergerakan anak dapat dikatakan masih terbatas. Anak belum mampu untuk menjangkau kebutuhan mereka akan fasilitas sosial dengan menggunakan kendaraan. Oleh karena itu. idealnya pemenuhan kebutuhan akan fasilitas sosial anak harus dimulai dari unit lingkungan terkecil atau dapat disebut Neighbourhood Unit (NU). Salah satu prinsip Neighbourhood Unit yang ideal ialah pentingnya ketersediaan fasilitas sosial SD pada suatu Neighbourhood Unit. Rini et al.(2017) menyatakan bahwa 37. 67% atau lebih dari sepertiga penduduk anak usia SD di Kota Surakarta cenderung memilih sekolah yang berada di luar Neighbourhood Unit tempat tinggal mereka sendiri. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bahwa terdapat faktor-faktor yang mempengaruhi pemilihan Sekolah Dasar dalam mendukung Kota Surakarta layak anak. Berdasarkan analisis faktor yang telah dilakukan dengan menggunakan software SPSS. terbentuklah 3 kelompok faktor yang berisi beberapa sub-faktor. Kelompok faktor pertama yang merupakan faktor dominan merepresentasikan terpenuhinya indikator terkait sekolah ramah anak. Kelompok faktor kedua merepresentasikan lokasi dan jam belajar sekolah. sedangkan Kelompok faktor ketiga merepresentasikan fasilitas tambahan yang tidak disediakan oleh semua sekolah. seperti ketersediaan sarana dan prasarana transportasi umum dan adanya program makan siang di sekolah.,True,TZHsLOkAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,1,https://digilib.uns.ac.id/dokumen/detail/61669/Faktor-Faktor-yang-Mempengaruhi-Pemilihan-Sekolah-Dasar-dalam-Mendukung-Kota-Surakarta-Layak-Anak,6593093764576621590,/scholar?cites=6593093764576621590,,https://digilib.uns.ac.id/dokumen/download/61669/Mjg5NTc3/Faktor-Faktor-yang-Mempengaruhi-Pemilihan-Sekolah-Dasar-dalam-Mendukung-Kota-Surakarta-Layak-Anak-abstrak.pdf,0,0,0

This paper attempts to review the variance between urban greenery. urban development and the quest for environmental sustainability. A critical review of relevant materials related to the study was carried out. The quantitative nature of the study was backed empirically. Findings from the study reveal that physical development plans for some urban areas have been very ad-hoc and loosely defined. Allocation of open green spaces is not in harmony with the urban population and it mostly characterized by a low percentage. Abuja master plan. for instance. has the highest allocation of 32.87%. while allocation in other master plans fall below 30% with Suleja master plan counts 2.5% only. Outdated master plan and the lack of will power from urban authority in plan implementation has often resulted in the distortion. encroachment. and conversion of green areas to other land uses. Increase carbon emission and pollution especially from the transport sector has been marked by a decline in greenery. Therefore. reducing the sequestration capacity of the urban area. weak urban planning and harsh climatic condition could be regarded as critical challenges. This study suggests the strict adherent to sustainable urban planning that integrates physical development and environmental consideration to enhance greenery. The study also recommends the placement of urban greenery on the same platform with the urban grey infrastructure by urban stakeholders.,True,vvQNar8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,5,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/view/211,10419225160532045829,/scholar?cites=10419225160532045829,,https://ijbes.utm.my/index.php/ijbes/article/viewFile/211/106,0,0,0
1217527,Indigenous knowledge in flood disaster risk reduction in Kaduna town Nigeria,2019,AMOS Danladi,,,,,,In the year 2003. the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 58/124 which specifies that there is a need for enhancing education regarding the use of indigenous knowledge for disaster risk reduction. In relation to flood control. over the years. most attention has been given on the use of structural and non-structural approaches. Thus. this study adopts a qualitative phenomenological approach. using Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and semi-structured interviews to explore indigenous knowledge for flood disaster risk reduction in Kaduna floodplain. The data generated was analysed using Nvivo 11 software. The analysis of the FGDs revealed that the major flood adaptation strategy in Kaduna is community work. The analysis also revealed that waste dumping in drainages was found to be the major environmental problem. This is related to community work involving local drainage construction. which causes blockages. Additionally. solutions were proposed for the effective use of indigenous flood adaptation strategies. in which public enlightenment was proposed as the means of resolving major waste dumping in local drainages. In addition. it was found in the analysis of the interviews that the major indigenous flood early warning signs identified in Kaduna floodplain are by the weather such as continuous downpour. black thick cloud and position of clouds. These are not based on meteorological stations but on past experiences of living with flood disaster in the floodplain of Kaduna.

1217550,Model Rumah-C3 (Cedhak-Cilik-Ciut) Sebagai Solusi Green Building Pada Rumah Tinggal di Perkotaan,2013,Qomarun Qomarun,,,,,UMS,Paper ini dilatarbelakangi oleh upaya optimalisasi potensi lokal atas tantangan global saat ini. Tantangan global dunia arsitektur pada milenium ketiga ini adalah isu sustainable development (pembangunan yang berkelanjutan). Tantangan global itu akhirnya justru memunculkan tema-tema baru di dunia arsitektur. seperti: sustainable architecture; sustainable city; urban sustainable; green architecture; dan green building. Tema-tema itu pada prinsipnya menekankan adanya perancangan yang selalu tanggap terhadap tiga ranah sekaligus. yaitu: teknologi-ekonomi-ekologi. Permasalahan yang diangkat pada paper ini adalah bagaimana menemukan alternatif solusi green building pada proyek rumah tinggal (rumah ramah lingkungan) di perkotaan. Metode pemecahan permasalahan ini dilakukan dengan model eksperimen. yaitu mencakup proses perancangan-pembangunan-pengujian. Rumah yang menjadi objek eksperimen ini didesain dengan konsep bahasa Jawa: Cedhak-Cilik-Ciut. Konsep ‘cedhak’ berarti jarak rumah dan kantor berdekatan; konsep ‘cilik’ berarti fisik bangunannya kecil; sedangkan konsep ‘ciut’ berarti volume ruangannya mungil. Proses rancang-bangun telah dilakukan sekitar lima tahun. sedangkan proses pengujiannya dilakukan pada setahun terakhir. Pengujian hasil rancang-bangun ini dilakukan melalui parameter yang berlaku di dunia arsitektur berkelanjutan (green building). yang saat ini telah dikenal sebagai kriteria greenship. Materi kriteria greenship ini disusun oleh GBCI (Green Building Council Indonesia) dan IAI (Ikatan Arsitek Indonesia) pada tahun 2011.

1217552,Urban Social Disaster: A Case Study of Solo City during 1740-2000,2009,Q. Qomarun and Arya Ronald and Ronim Azizah,,,,,International Society of Habitat Engineering,The background of the study is a highly frequency of mass amok phenomenon in Solo City in the last several decades. Exploring  the urban social disaster. this study observed the development of Solo City during 1740 to 2000. The purpose of this research is not  only to explore the urban space damaged. but also to clarify the main formula of urban social disaster. The research is approached  by rationalistic paradigm; while the method of study is conducted by the historical-archeology. This study finds that there are 26  accidents within 1-12 scale range of Urban Space Damaged (USD) during 1740-2000. The other finding is the main formula of  urban social disaster as: (fm) = (f 1 ) + (f t ). The study shows that the bigger latent conflict (f ) occurs. the easier manifest conflict (fm)  happens; while the urban social disaster is always in need of a trigger (f 1 1 ). However. this study finds that the urban social disaster  appears approximately every 10 years; while the victims of every accident are always seem in the collapse buildings. the dying  people and the chaotic environment. Therefore. the urban spaces of Solo City usually have a setback period. According to the  serial data. the main factors of latent conflicts (f ) are conducted by economic-disparity. social-leaderless and hypocrite-culture;  while the several triggers (f t 1 ) are conducted by the activity of socio-politic. socio-economic and socio-culture. The study has yet  to find the indicator and parameter of each factor's formula so that this study suggests taking the advance research related to the  detail formula of urban social disaster.,True,imxBM7kAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6791051730892340453&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Qomarun,,,,,,Isu kota yang berkelanjutan (sustainable city) telah menjadi agenda pada seluruh kota di Indonesia saat ini (Agenda 21). namun dalam kenyataannya kondisi yang terjadi justru didominasi oleh berbagai bencana (disaster) di perkotaan. Studi ini akan memberikan gambaran bahwa agenda sustainable dan fakta disaster adalah kondisi paradoks yang harus dialami oleh sebagian besar masyarakat kota di Indonesia pada saat ini dan bahkan diduga akan tetap terjadi pada saat beberapa dasawarsa ke depan. Paper ini akan mengupas tema sustainable dan fakta disaster melalui studi kasus perkembangan Kota Solo. Metode penggalian perkembangan kota dan bencana kota dilakukan dengan studi kearsipan. yaitu: (1) sumber-sumber dari dokumen tekstual; (2) sumber-sumber dari dokumen gambar; dan (3) sumbersumber  dari dokumen artefaknya. Konsep sustainable development selalu mengikutkan empat sifat hirarkik dalam proses pelaksanaannya. yaitu: (1) aman; (2) nyaman; (3) produktif; dan (4) berkelanjutan. Berdasarkan kajian yang telah dilakukan. konsep sustainable di perkotaan Indonesia masih terganjal pada prasyarat yang mendasar. yaitu konsep aman-nyaman. Studi ini menghasilkan temuan bahwa tipologi perkembangan Kota Solo (morfologi kota) selalu tersusun atas tiga  proses hirarkik. yaitu: (1) invasi; (2) ekspansi; dan (3) okupansi. Model tersebut telah ditemukan di berbagai tempat dan di berbagai jaman. namun tentu dengan jenis atau corak yang berbeda.

The objective of this study is to identify the factors that determine residential location preferences towards future neighborhood selection. Current literature focuses on preferences in relation to physical and demographic aspects. such as ownership. income. land use. facilities as well as transportation services. However. this study suggests safety and cultural aspects which are likely to be significant in many contexts. In order to further investigate these suggestions. a case study has been carried out based on Iskandar Malaysiaâ€™ s development region. A Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is applied to 384 household heads on their housing selection preferences.

Travel behaviour trend has increased drastically all over the world. With the present reality of climate change. the transportation studies are becoming increasingly important. in regards of travel behaviour changes. It is important to understand the need to change travel behaviour as one of the initiative to achieve sustainable transportation. In achieving transportation sustainability. understanding on travel behaviour and need can be more functional and useful for transportation planners to encourage people to use public transportations. In recent years. Low Carbon Society (LCS) concept has taken place to change the people’s lifestyles. especially to increase the use of public transportations. Undeniably. the only solution to a more sustainable transportation leading to a low carbon society is through a higher adoption rate of public transportation. However. it is still far to achieve as far as transportation planners are concerned because of the lack of understanding of the social needs to complement with public transportations. The planning of the fast developing region of Iskandar Malaysia. which is one of the major economic growth conurbation located in southern part of Peninsular Malaysia. provides a good opportunity for transportation planners or engineers to incorporate the ideas of low carbon society into designing a sustainable transportation systems.

When the party to contract intends to determine a contract. he must let the other party knows his intention to do so. He is required to follow several procedures before he is said to determine the contract validly. Standard forms and bespoke construction contracts usually provide procedures for parties to contract to do so. Failure to adhere to the procedures may cause the termination invalid and the repercussions of such failure is severe and of serious consequences to the determining party. When one party exercises his intention to determine a contract. the other party often seeks to destroy his intention by claiming non compliance to procedural requirement for valid exercise of determination under the contract. One party argues that he has followed the required procedures for service of notice and the other party claims otherwise. This has led to numerous arguments and disputes between the parties often end with arbitrations or litigations. The arbitrators and courts are not helping either as decisions have not been consistent depending on how one construes the ambiguous words. The underlying matter is the interpretation adopted by arbitrators and courts in construing the ambiguous words.

1217582,Paving of Malaysian Greenfields: The Amount of Residential Impervious Surface and Factors Influencing It,,M Rafee Majid and Wan Yusryzal Wan Ibrahim and Misariah Halili,,,,,,Arnold & Gibbons [1] defined impervious surfaces as any material covering the ground that prevents infiltration of water into the soil. Impervious surface is not a single homogeneous quantity but when used as a landscape indicator it is typically presented as a percentage of the land that is covered with impervious materials. The word imperviousness is also regularly used to refer to the extent of this percentage. Different types of surfaces such as paved surfaces (roads. parking lots. sidewalks. etc.) and building rooftops fall unambiguously under the definition of impervious surface while there are also other surfaces. man-made and natural. that are so heavily compacted as to be functionally impervious. Examples of these are compacted soil in construction areas. dirt roads. bedrock outcrops and. even to a certain extent. grass turf in residential areas.It is a fact that urbanization carries with it a series of environmental concerns such as water and air pollution as well as increase in temperature and occurrence of flash floods. On many occasions have these been linked to the extent of impervious surface. an indicator that defines urbanization. As development alters the natural landscape. the percentage of land covered by impervious surface too increases. Increase in urban impervious surface has been identified by many studies as an important contributor to water pollution. urban heat island. flash floods and other environmental degradations [2. 3. 4. 1].,True,AS5z_RsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/2731679/PavingofMalaysianGreenfields_MRafeeMajid.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/2731679/PavingofMalaysianGreenfields_MRafeeMajid.pdf,0,0,0

Eight Millennium Development Goals were formulated of which the eradication of poverty given top priority. However. Malaysia's participation with the UN in dealing with poverty. precede this when it committed itself with the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) programme. which was then reinforced when the Millennium Declaration was made in 2000. Nationally. poverty eradication as well as bridging the inequality gap among the major ethnic groups and states has been the main development goal in Malaysia's development agenda since independence. In this regards. the principle of â€ œgrowth with equity has been the central theme in all Malaysia's development policies and efforts since independence. Although Malaysia has made significant achievements in reducing the incidence of aggregate poverty across the country from 8.9% in 1995 down to 1.7% in 2012. there still exist pockets of poverty in the rural areas. in certain states/regions and among ethnic groups. as well as in some urban areas. This shows that formulating planning and policy implementation to eradicate poverty now needs to be more spatially focused for the implementation to be more effective.

Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,Several countries. including Malaysia. have set a long term target of establishing a more educated workforce. This thrust on the massification of higher education has resulted in a new problem-graduate unemployment. The growing problem of graduate unemployment in Malaysia is widely debated in the media and blogs. The Higher Education Ministry. in its Graduate Tracer Study Report 2011. reported that 24 per cent of them have not found a job after six months of graduating. The employment scenario of the urban planning graduates has changed over the years from catering the needs of the public sector. to catering the needs of the private sector and to fulfilling the need of the One Stop Centre or the OSC. The advent of the liberalization of urban planning services challenges urban planning schools in Malaysia to produce planners not only to cater for local needs but also with the capability of exporting their skills and services internationally. Given the diverse scope of urban planning it is a paradox that graduates of urban planning should converge on the conventional urban planning organizations for employment.

As developing nations in the world aspire to meet the vision 20: 2020. it is imperative that whatever economic approach. model or strategy adopted must not be at the expense of the welfare of the citizens. In western industrialised world. privatisation is used to improve the lives of citizens where market competition in the provisions of goods and services thrive for the benefit of an egalitarian and equitable society. However. the outcomes of privatisation in most developing countries are not as intended. as the social costs far supersede its benefits. owing to some reasons the paper is out to discuss. As a conceptual paper with discussions based predominantly on secondary data sources cum literature. this paper seeks to explain the socio-inequality and poverty laden outcomes of privatisation policy of service delivery of electricity in Nigeria. Privatisation policy has been claimed to adversely impinged the welfare of the populace. making the poor. poorer. Based on identified theoretical gap of non-harmonising policies with actual situation on ground. this paper argues that the issues of social inequality are occasioned by privatisation policy. and identifies the shortcomings of this approach to service delivery of electricity.

Reducing energy consumption in cities through various controlling strategies has significant impact on the conservation of natural resources and environment. Residential density and floor area to land ratio has been used as key parameters in development control tools towards creating harmonious urban development. However no attempt has been made to employ them to lower residential energy consumption. This study attempts to demonstrate the possibility of using residential density and floor area to land ratio as passive parameters to reduce non-transportation energy consumption at household level. The analysis was based on questionnaire survey of nontransportation energy consumption viz. energy for lighting. thermal comfort and cooking purposes at household level in Bandung City. Indonesia. The result shows that non-transportation energy consumption perceptibly associates with the two parameters of development control with a u-shape pattern ie the correlation has one lowest point with higher trends at both ends.

The residential density analysis was conducted using ArcGIS10. The results of the study were able to show the mismatch between the vision and reality. The results showed that the higher the residential density the greater the distance to the commercial centres; meaning longer travelling distance and higher carbon emitted to the atmosphere. Planning experts pointed to the economic objectives of the developments as the main reason for this unacceptable scenario. and that the design of the neighbourhoods did nothing to mitigate climate change due to the higher dependency on private vehicles. Finally. the paper suggests a review into the design approach of the neighbourhood to ensure that the Region’s vision of becoming a low carbon city could become a reality.

The problem of physical development occurs in Surakarta City especially in in the southern of the city where massive physical development is underway. It causes deferent levels of urban compactness inside the city. The deference enables movement from an area with low level urban compactness to higher level urban compactness because the area provide sophisticated facilities. Then compact city concept concerning with centralizing the development of area rises. The concept can decrease the conversion of vacant land by intensifying the land use through mixed land use that has the goal in reducing movement.

The char sample after pyrolysis was cooled down directly for in situ reactivity measurement with air. The results indicated that the volatilisation of Na during pyrolysis is an important reason for the existence of catalyst loading saturation level with Na as a catalyst in char because the char prepared at high temperature had a limited holding capacity for Na. Under the experimental conditions in this study. the char reactivity showed good linear correlation with the Na concentration in the reacting char. Peak pyrolysis temperature. affecting the release of Cl and distribution of Na in char. is an important factor governing the correlation between the char reactivity and Na concentration in char.

Further analysis of the liquid products obtained at various temperatures suggests that the amorphous portion within microcrystalline cellulose contains some short glucose chain segments hinged with crystalline cellulose via weak bonds (e.g.. hydrogen bonds). These short chain segments are reactive components responsible for the formation of C4−C13 oligomers in the primary liquid products during hydrolysis in HCW at temperatures as low as 100 °C. The minimal temperature for breaking the glycosidic bonds in those short chain segments to form glucose monomer from amorphous portion within microcrystalline cellulose is ∼150 °C.

Cl retention in char increases with temperature. reaching a maximum at 600 °C (∼42%). and then decreases with further temperature increases (e.g.. only ∼6% at 900 °C).

The results show that the form and amount of Cl released during the slow pyrolysis of the NaCl-loaded cellulose strongly depend on pyrolysis temperature. Cl is mainly released as HCl (g) at temperatures ⩽300 °C whereas it can be released in forms that are organically bound in heavy tar (termed as “tar-Cl”) at temperatures ⩾350 °C. The release of both HCl (g) and total Cl (including gaseous HCl and tar-Cl) begins at 200 °C. reaches the corresponding maximum values (∼53% for gaseous HCl and ∼71% for total Cl) at 350 °C. and then levels off with further increasing temperature to 400 °C.

1217700,Investigation of sulfuric-acid treated activated carbon properties,2019,Neda ASASIAN KOLUR and Seyedmehdi SHARIFIAN and Tahereh KAGHAZCHI,43,TURKISH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY,,663 – 675,TÜBİTAK,A granulated type of commercial activated carbon (GAC) with surface area of 828 m /g was treated with a strong solution of sulfuric acid (98% wt.) at a temperature of 30 C. The physicochemical and porous properties and the surface chemistry of the sorbents were investigated and compared in detail. It was established that the lower temperatures of impregnation and the higher concentration of H  SO  solution resulted in the introduction of higher percentages of sulfur-containing groups and smaller porosity loss. The results of EDS. FTIR. and XPS tests confirmed the introduction of sulfone groups and acidic oxygenated ones. which increased the adsorbent affinity towards mercury species available in the aqueous phase (pH 7) by 20%. It was found that acid-washing treatment helped to reduce the ash content of GAC and cleaned its internal space; however. with the introduction of bulky H  SO  molecules into micropores and narrow mesopores of GAC. the surface area and pore volume were reduced. The increase of mercury adsorption capacity in spite of decreasing porosity after acid treatment shows that trapping in pores is not the only mechanism involved in mercury adsorption.,True,zMYUu5YAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,7,https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/chem/abstract.htm?id=24633,15217645524109354639,/scholar?cites=15217645524109354639,,https://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/chem/issues/kim-19-43-2/kim-43-2-24-1810-63.pdf,0,0,0

1217706,Process Simulation of Syngas Purification by Gas Permeation Application,2019,Seyedmehdi Sharifiana and Neda Asasian-Kolura and Michael Harasekb,76,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,,,,Nowadays. syngas production from renewable energy sources particularly by methanation process has taken great interest. The aim of the process is energy saving by converting surplus produced energy into a truthful chemical product. Methanation reactor outlet stream contains a gas mixture which is not feasible to be used directly in distributing grids. where a higher purity of methane is necessary to obtain the highest power density. To reach the different grades of methane (for heat. electricity and vehicle fuels applications). various purification levels should be provided for syngas. For use as a fuel. elimination of carbon dioxide and water is needed. because water affects negatively on the mechanical components within the vehicles’ engine equipment. Moreover. CO2 removal should be carried out to enhance heat quality of methane and cause less pollution in the atmosphere. In the current study. the performance of a combination of flash separator and hollow fiber membranes for syngas purification was studied. For this purpose. a flash separator model was implemented to condense water from the wet feed. Then for the elimination of CO2 from methane. a hollow fiber membrane system was considered. Therefore. a unit operation user model in FORTRAN was developed to incorporate into Aspen Plus® V8. 6. Different designs and arrangements of membrane modules were compared. and the best result was to purify methane up to 98% vol. obtained using a two-stage gas permeation system with recycle streams.

The upgrading is based on the membrane separation process Gas Permeation and allows low energy consumption as well as very low methane losses. The quality of the upgraded biomethane is controlled continuously regarding various unwanted or malicious substances to assure the agreement with the quality prescribed by Austrian laws. The produced biomethane is introduced to the natural gas grid and delivered to the households of the neighboring city Bruck/Leitha in Lower Austria.

Power to gas offers a promising pathway for energy storage in existing natural gas infrastructure. if valid regulations are met. To improve interaction between energy supply and storage. a flexible power to gas process is necessary. An innovative multibed methanation concept. based on ceramic honeycomb catalysts combined with polyimide membrane gas upgrading. is presented in this study. Cordierite monoliths are coated with γ-Al 2 O 3 and catalytically active nickel. and used in a two-stage methanation process at different operation conditions (p= 6–14 bar. GHSV= 3000–6000 h− 1). To fulfill the requirements of the Austrian natural gas network. the product gas must achieve a CH 4 content of≥ 96 vol%. Hence. CH 4 rich gas from methanation is fed to the subsequent gas upgrading unit. to separate remaining H 2 and CO 2. In the present study. two different membrane modules were investigated. The results of methanation and gas separation clearly indicate the high potential of the presented process. At preferred operation conditions. target concentration of 96 vol% CH 4 can be achieved.

It is often considered to be superior to the production of electricity and district heat with internal combustion engines mainly because of better energy utilisation. higher flexibility and beneficial economic prospects. Biogas upgrading is commonly accepted as state-of-the-art and a considerable number of small and industrial scale plants have been commissioned to date representing the portfolio of currently available upgrading technologies. Nevertheless. academic research clearly demonstrates that still a huge potential for optimisation and development is existing in this field. The current work contributes to the field of biogas upgrading by suggesting innovative and powerful approaches along the whole process chain. The importance of trace component separation is exemplary depicted by introducing a novel desulphurization technology based on chemical-oxidative scrubbing applying an innovative short-contact-time apparatus. Thus. separation efficiency for hydrogen sulphide is maximized while the simultaneous separation of carbon dioxide is minimized to assure minimum chemicals consumption. As an example for the major biogas upgrading step of carbon dioxide removal. the process of membranebased gas permeation is suggested.

Biorefineries have been studied as the technological scheme to process integrally renewable resources. The so-called “bioactive” compounds (BACs) have been of high interest. given their high added value and potential application in pharmaceutics and health. among others. However. there are still elements to be addressed to consider them as economic drivers of sustainable processes. First. BACs can be produced from many sources and it is important to identify feedstocks for this purpose. Second. a sustainable production process should also consider valorizing the remaining components. Finally. feedstock availability plays an important role in affecting the process scale. logistics. and feasibility. This work consists of a review on the feedstocks for the sustainable production of BACs in biorefineries. covering the type of BAC. composition. and availability. Some example biorefineries are proposed using wheat straw. hemp and grapevine shoots. As a main conclusion. multiple raw materials have the potential to obtain BACs that can become economic drivers of biorefineries. This is an interesting outlook. as the integral use of the feedstocks may not only allow obtaining different types of BACs. but also other fiber products and energy for the process self-supply.

1217738,A shrinking particle—shrinking core model for leaching of a zinc ore containing silica,2009,Vida Safari and Gilnaz Arzpeyma and Fereshteh Rashchi and Navid Mostoufi,93,International Journal of Mineral Processing,1,79-83,Elsevier,A new mathematical model was developed for leaching of zinc ores containing silicates such as hemimorphite which produce a gel during leaching with sulfuric acid. This model is based on the shrinking core model in which the particle size and the reacting core shrink simultaneously. It was shown that the actual dissolution time of the ore particles is longer than the time corresponding to the dissolution of chemical zinc oxide itself. It was suggested that because of the existence of silicates in the ore. a gelatinous layer was formed around the reacting core. Since the gel product is soft. it breaks apart when the particles collide and as a result. the particles shrink. However. a thin gelatinous layer always covers the reacting core which increases the mass transfer resistance and increases the leaching time.

Studies related to activated sludge tend to classify sludge as non-Newtonian fluid. Until now. several theories have been built to describe the complex behavior of activated sludge with varying degrees of success. In this article. seven different models for viscosity of non-Newtonian fluids (ie. Power law. Bingham plastic. Herschel-Bulkley. Casson. Sisko.

Results showed that although evaluating the constants in the four-parameter models is difficult. they provide the best prediction of viscosity in the whole range of shear rates for activated sludge. For easier prediction of viscosity at different mixed liquor suspended solids (2.74-31g/L). temperature (15-25 C) and shear rate (1-1000/s). simple correlations were proposed.

The FCC (Geldart A) and irregular sand particles (Geldart B) were used as bed materials. respectively. Such two types of particle led to extremely different dynamic flow structures in the bed. However. for both particles. the dynamic flow structure exhibited the continuous double-peak probability density functions of the local voidages from εmf to 1. one peak for the emulsion and another for the bubbles. A probability model was thus proposed to describe and simulate such dynamic gas–solid distribution and its complex evolution from bubbling to turbulent regimes.

1217759,Prediction of effective drag coefficient in fluidized beds,1999,N Mostoufi and J Chaouki,54,Chemical Engineering Science,7,851-858,Pergamon,A radioactive particle tracking technique is used to measure classification velocity of a radioactive tracer falling in a liquid–solid fluidized bed. The liquid passing through the fluidized bed is water and nine different types of particles are used as fluidized particles. A radioactive particle is dropped into the fluidized bed in order to measure its falling velocity. Emitted γ-rays from the radioactive tracer are detected by eight NaI scintillation detectors placed around the bed. The number of counts of γ-rays are then used to calculate the coordinates of the tracer from which the velocity of the tracer is calculated. The classification velocity is used to calculate the effective drag coefficient. The correction factor. f. which is defined as the ratio of effective drag coefficient over standard drag coefficient at the same slip velocity. is then evaluated.

Patterns within RP of the fluidized bed were classified into two groups of local white areas (LWA). showing macro structures. and local bold areas (LBA). showing meso and micro structures. These patterns showed that the fluidized bed system has three different hydrodynamic behaviors as superficial gas velocity increases; at low gas velocities. macro structures become more dominant. further increase in gas velocity empowers influence of finer structures on the hydrodynamic and finally the fluidization regime changes.

The process of heat transfer through clusters which exist adjacent to the wall was viewed in context of partial and total heat penetration. In the case of partial heat penetration. the heat flux applied to the wall side of the clusters has not reached its bed-side. while in the case of total heat penetration the heat flux has completely crossed the cluster. and the temperature of its bed-side would differ from the bed temperature. Based on the heat balance equation inside the cluster. two different expressions were derived for heat transfer coefficient for each penetration period.

It has the potential to impact the power-generation sector as well as industrial sectors where significant quantities of process steam are required. Compared to conventional concentrated solar power systems. which use synthetic oils or molten salts as the heat transfer fluid. direct steam generation offers an opportunity to achieve higher steam temperatures in the Rankine power cycle and to reduce parasitic losses. thereby enabling improved thermal efficiencies. However. this is associated with non-trivial challenges. which need to be addressed before such systems can become more economically competitive. Specifically. important thermal-energy processes take place during flow boiling. flow condensation and thermal-energy storage. which are highly complex. multi-scale and are multi-physics in nature that involve phase-change. unsteady and turbulent multiphase flows in the presence of conjugate heat transfer. This paper reviews our current understanding and ability to predict these processes. and knowledge that has been gained from experimental and computational efforts in the literature. In addition to Rankine cycles. organic Rankine cycle applications. which are relevant to lower operating temperature conditions. are also considered.

This work analyses the different flow patterns taking place in an inclined tube at 30  numerically. Both upward and downward flows are considered. The simulations of air-water flow in a pipe of diameter 0:051m and length 2m have been carried out using one-fluid model. The simulated flow patterns are slug. plug. stratified and bubbly flow. The calculated flow regimes are compared with data taken from the well-known Barnea flow pattern map. ANSYS-FLUENT 16.0 is used to solve the mass and momentum equations using second-order upwind scheme. The model takes into account the influence of gravitational force and the surface tension on the flow. A piecewise linear interface reconstruction based on Youngs's VOF is used. The simulation is carried out for the following combinations of superficial air velocities and superficial water velocities of (0.05. 0.1). (1.0.0.5) and (0.5.9.0) at an inclination angle of 30  and of (1.0. 0.1). (12.5) and (1.0.8.0) at an inclination angle of     30 . The volume fraction is predicted. To the authors’ knowledge. it is the first time that air-water flow as predicted by Barnea flow pattern map is being reproduced numerically and used to validate the VOF method.

1217796,Numerical optimisation of square pin-fins for minimum thermal resistance with non-uniform design dimensions,2014,Olabode Thomas Olakoyejo and Josua P Meyer,,,,,International Conference on Heat Transfer. Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics,In this paper we apply constructal theory and design to present a three-dimensional geometric optimisation of cooling square pin-fins in forced convection of solid base material subject to constant temperature at the bottom. The main objective was to optimise the configuration in such a way that the peak temperature was minimised from the solid to the fluid of the pin fin. The cross–sectional area of solid base was fixed and the thickness of the solid is allowed to change. Three design cases are considered; the Case 1 has the pin-fins in a single row. Case 2 configuration has the pin-fins in two rows and Case 3 has configuration of the pin-fins in three rows arrangement. In all the three cases. the pin-fins geometric dimension are not uniform. The structure had four degrees of freedom as design variables: thickness of the solid base. hydraulic diameter of the pin. the height of the pin and pin spacing. The shape of the pin was not fixed but allowed to morph to determine the best configuration which gave the lowest thermal resistance. The cooling fluid (air) was driven by forced convection to the pin-fin by the stream velocity.

In this research. we employed constructal theory and design to present three-dimensional theoretical and numerical solutions of conjugate forced convection heat transfer in heat generating devices with cooling channels of different cross-sectional shapes. In recent times. geometric configurations of cooling channel have been found to play an important role in thermal performance. Therefore. an efficient ways of optimally designing these cooling channels shapes is required. Experimentation has been extensively used in the past to understand the behaviour of heat removals from devices. In this research. the shapes of the cooling channels and the configurations of heat-generating devices were analytically and numerically studied to minimise thermal resistance and thus illustrate cooling performance under various design conditions. The cooling channels of five different cross-sectional shapes were studied: Circular. square. rectangular. isosceles right triangular and equilateral triangular. They were uniformly packed and arranged to form larger constructs. The theoretical analysis is presented and developed using the intersection of asymptotes method. This proves the existence of an optimal geometry of parallel channels of different cross-sectional shapes that penetrate and cool a volume with uniformly distributed internal heat generation and heat flux. thus minimising the global thermal resistance.

The system is simulated with a range of organic working fluids and its performance is optimised for operation in the UK climate. The findings are applicable to similar geographical locations with significant cloud coverage. a low solar resource and limited installation areas. A key feature of the system’s design is the implementation of fixed fluid flow-rates during operation in order to avoid penalties in the performance of components suffered at part-load. Steady operation under varying solar irradiance conditions is provided by way of a working-fluid buffer vessel at the evaporator outlet. which is maintained at the evaporation temperature and pressure of the ORC.

Markides,9,Energies,6,448,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In the present paper. we consider the employment of working-fluid mixtures in organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems with respect to thermodynamic and heat-transfer performance. component sizing and capital costs. The selected working-fluid mixtures promise reduced exergy losses due to their non-isothermal phase-change behaviour. and thus improved cycle efficiencies and power outputs over their respective pure-fluid components. A multi-objective cost-power optimization of a specific low-temperature ORC system (operating with geothermal water at 98 C) reveals that the use of working-fluid-mixtures does indeed show a thermodynamic improvement over the pure-fluids. At the same time. heat transfer and cost analyses. however. suggest that it also requires larger evaporators. condensers and expanders; thus. the resulting ORC systems are also associated with higher costs. In particular. 50% n-pentane+ 50% n-hexane and 60% R-245fa+ 40% R-227ea mixtures lead to the thermodynamically optimal cycles. whereas pure n-pentane and pure R-245fa have lower plant costs. both estimated as having∼ 14% lower costs per unit power output compared to the thermodynamically optimal mixtures.

It has been demonstrated that. consistent with previous experimental results for hydrogen and acetylene. the increased scalar dissipation rate created by faster co-flowing air delays autoignition. as revealed by a disproportionate increase of ignition length with air velocity. The predicted mean and variance of the mixture fraction. the mixture fraction PDF and the conditional scalar dissipation rate are in good agreement with experimental results obtained with acetone-tracer PLIF. The first-order. spatially averaged CMC model reproduces the experimental trends quite well. despite the neglect of conditional fluctuations and spatial dependence of the conditional averages.

In such systems. generic spatiotemporal variations in the flow give rise to variations in the heat flux for a given fluid–solid temperature difference. which can be interpreted as spatiotemporal fluctuations of the instantaneous heat transfer coefficient. These variations can lead to unsteady conjugate heat transfer. in which the exchanged heat flux arises from an interaction between the bulk fluid temperature and the temperature in the solid. Further. the nonlinear coupling between the fluctuating temperature differences and the heat transfer coefficient can lead to an effect we refer to as augmentation. which quantitatively describes the ability of a particular arrangement to have a different time-mean heat flux from the product between the mean heat transfer coefficient and the mean temperature difference across the fluid.

In this. the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals.

This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries. not observed in proton-proton collisions. which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot. dense medium.,True,Pnc2lRMAAAAJ:K_bBBR5tcgMC,1212,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303,10374830077736851981,/scholar?cites=10374830077736851981,,https://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303,0,0,0

The optimum volume of heat-extracting material may slightly reduce the amount of electromagnetic energy that is processed. but more efficient heat removal yields higher allowable levels of both electromagnetic stress and losses per unit volume in the remaining material. Without influencing the electromagnetic performance. heat extractors provide the potential to improve the power density of passive modules.

It has the potential to impact the power-generation sector as well as industrial sectors where significant quantities of process steam are required. Compared to conventional concentrated solar power systems. which use synthetic oils or molten salts as the heat transfer fluid. direct steam generation offers an opportunity to achieve higher steam temperatures in the Rankine power cycle and to reduce parasitic losses. thereby enabling improved thermal efficiencies. However. this is associated with non-trivial challenges. which need to be addressed before such systems can become more economically competitive. Specifically. important thermal-energy processes take place during flow boiling. flow condensation and thermal-energy storage. which are highly complex. multi-scale and are multi-physics in nature that involve phase-change. unsteady and turbulent multiphase flows in the presence of conjugate heat transfer. This paper reviews our current understanding and ability to predict these processes. and knowledge that has been gained from experimental and computational efforts in the literature. In addition to Rankine cycles. organic Rankine cycle applications. which are relevant to lower operating temperature conditions. are also considered.

Collars are considered as one of the substantial methods for reducing the depth and volume of scour around bridge piers. In this study. the experimental and numerical methods are used to investigate two different shapes of collars. i.e. rectangular and circular. in terms of reducing scour around a single bridge pier. The experiments were conducted in hydraulic laboratory at university of Malaya. The scour around the bridge pier and collars was simulated numerically using a three-dimensional. CFD model namely SSIIM 2.0. to verify the application of the model. The results indicated that although. both types of collars provides a considerable decrease in the depth of the scour. the rectangular collar. decreases scour depth around the pier by 79 percent. and has better performance compared to the circular collar. Furthermore. it was observed that using collars under the stream’s bed. resulted in the most reduction in the scour depth around the pier.

1217925,Multi-objective optimisation of a prefabricated house in Australian climate zones,2020,Sareh Naji,,,,,,Quantitative evaluations of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) along with energy efficiency are amongst the key features of environmentally sustainable buildings. Buildings are responsible for a significant portion (nearly 40%) of the world’s total energy consumption and GHG emissions. On the other hand. operational phase contributes to the greater part of the building’s energy consumption. Along with energy efficiency. IEQ is another aspect that has been attracting significant attention in the field of sustainable building design. People spend about 90% of their time indoors. Therefore. the comfort levels and satisfaction of indoor environment can easily affect the quality of their daily life. The IEQ parameters considered in this thesis include thermal comfort. visual comfort. auditory comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ).  While prefabrication offers substantial benefits to the construction industry through quality assurance. time savings and waste reduction. it tends to transform the construction process and components which can affect the buildings’ performance in both positive and negative ways. Understanding the effects of the prefabricated building components on energy performance and IEQ will inform the design decisions which can lead to the creation of more sustainable buildings with high quality. Although previous research has focused on the benefits and limitations of prefabrication in housing. there has been little quantitative analysis on how various envelope components may affect several performance parameters including energy consumption and IEQ of residential buildings. Along with that. there is still a lack of systematic design methods …,True,9f-xp-UAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/252715,,,,,0,0,0
1217926,Sensitivity analysis of building envelope parameters affecting thermal comfort,2018,S Naji and L Aye and M Noguchi,,,,,ZEMCH Network,The ever-increasing attention towards implementation of environmentally sustainable building design approaches necessitates the prediction of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) during design stage. Building performance simulation tools are able to predict key performance indices of buildings including IEQ. Among different aspects of IEQ. thermal comfort has been reported as one of the important aspects for occupants. It is necessary to understand the effects of design parameters on the performance of building in order to provide acceptable thermal comfort levels. However. due to the possibility of various design strategies. the selection of the most appropriate combination is a challenging task. Thus. the determination of effective parameters is of great importance in order to streamline the design process. The design parameters related to building envelope are among the most important items that have major influence on building thermal performance. Although prefabrication offers several benefits in terms of saving on-site time. saving money and better waste management. it affects envelope thermal performance due to introduction of lightweight components. While there is a body of research reporting the effects of passive strategies on building thermal performance. the influence of lightweight prefabricated envelope components is not well-documented in the current literature.

In general. thermal performance of the building envelope is an important parameter which dictates the operational energy consumption. There are some prefabricated modular buildings available in Australia. However. their thermal performance benchmarks have not been well documented in the literature. Innovative panel systems have been proposed to improve the cost competitiveness and to achieve better performance. It is essential to know the current performance so that newer panels can be proven to be better. This paper investigates the thermal performance of four prefabricated modular buildings currently available in the Australian market.

The demand of energy. as well as the construction materials used in buildings. are becoming increasingly problematic for the earth's sustainable future. and thus have led to alarming concern. The energy efficiency of buildings can be improved. and in order to do so. their operational energy usage should be estimated early in the design phase. so that buildings are as sustainable as possible. An early energy estimate can greatly help architects and engineers create sustainable structures. This study proposes a novel method to estimate building energy consumption based on the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) method.

RCA was used to produce high-workability concrete substituting 0-100% natural coarse aggregate (NCA) by weight. The slump and slump flow of fresh concretes were determined to ensure high workability. In addition. the compressive. flexural and splitting tensile strengths. modulus of elasticity. and permeable voids of hardened concretes were determined. The test results revealed that RCA significantly decreased the workability of concrete. RCA also affected the compressive strength. modulus of elasticity. and permeable voids of concrete. At the age of 28 days. the concrete with 100% RCA provided 12.2% lower compressive strength and 17.7% lesser modulus of elasticity than the control concrete.

A new approach. named WhiteSteg is proposed in information hiding using inter-word spacing and inter-paragraph spacing as a hybrid method to reduce the visible detection of the embedded messages. WhiteSteg offers dynamic generated cover-text with six options of maximum capacity according to the length of the secret message. Besides. the advantage of exploiting whitespaces in information hiding is discussed. This paper also analyzes the significant drawbacks of each existing method and how WhiteSteg could be recommended as a solution.,True,unHSurIAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,72,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yee_Por/publication/228672143_WhiteSteg_A_new_scheme_in_information_hiding_using_text_steganography/links/0deec531ae4e4dd4a9000000.pdf,10445375670309973383,/scholar?cites=10445375670309973383,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yee_Por/publication/228672143_WhiteSteg_A_new_scheme_in_information_hiding_using_text_steganography/links/0deec531ae4e4dd4a9000000.pdf,0,0,0

Technol.,1,51-60,,Several problems arise among the existing LSB-based image steganographic schemes due to distortion in a stegoimage and limited payload capacity. Thus. a proposed scheme has been developed with the aims to help in improving the payload of the secret data at the same time retaining the quality of the stego-image produced within an acceptance threshold. This study has led to the modification of the current LSB substitution algorithm by delivering a new algorithm namely sequential colour cycle. For achieving a higher security. multi-layered steganography can be performed by embedding a secret data into multiple layers of cover-images.

Thus. steganography was introduced to conceal a secret message into an unsuspicious cover medium so that it can be sent safely through a public communication channel. Suspicion becomes the significant key determinant in the field of steganography. In other words. an efficient stegnographic algorithm will not cause any suspicion after the hidden data is embedded. This paper presents an overview of steganography on GIF image format in order to explore the potential of GIF in information hiding research. A platform. namely StegCure is proposed by using an amalgamation of three different Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion algorithms that is able to perform steganographic methods. This paper explains about the enhancement of the Least Significant Bits (LSB) insertion techniques from the most basic and conventional 1 bit to the LSB colour cycle method. Various kinds of existing steganographic methods are discussed and some inherent problems are highlighted along with some issues on existing solutions. In comparison with the other data hiding applications. StegCure is a more comprehensive security utility where it offers user-friendly functionality with interactive graphic user interface and integrated navigation capabilities.

The textual passwords or alpha-numeric passwords have been the basis of authentication systems for centuries. Similarly. it had also been the major attraction for crackers and attackers. However. users tend to face difficulty in remembering a password that is considered as secured password because this type of secured password usually has long string of characters and they appear randomly [14]. Hence. most users tend to create simple. short and insecure passwords. As a consequence. most of the time. the usability level of passwords has not achieved an optimum for a secured password [14]. In order to solve this problem. a new password scheme had been invented. known as Graphical Password System (GPS). Graphical password is an alternative mean of authentication for login intended to be used in place of conventional password; it utilizes images instead of text. In this paper. we discuss the design and intention of our proposed scheme. called Background Pass-Go (BPG). BPG is an improved version of Pass-Go. as it keeps most of the advantages of Pass-Go and achieves better usability. We had analyzed the BPG scheme in terms of 1) how BPG is able to improve other schemes of GPS especially in Pass-Go. 2) how BPG acts as a solution to different types of threats to networked computer systems. We had verified that BPG manages to overcome the shortage of other GPS schemes.

In the proposed method. a user is only required to click on one of the pass-image instead of both pass-images shown in each challenge set for three consecutive sets.While this activity is simple enough to reduce login time. the images clicked appear to be random and can only be obtained with complete knowledge of the registered password along with the activity rules. Thus. it becomes impossible for shoulder-surfing attackers to obtain the information about which password images and pass-images are used by the user.

Chitosan membranes prepared from acetic acid were flexible. transparent. smooth and quick-drying. The FTIR spectra showed the existence of intermolecular interactions between chitosan and glucose oxidase (GOD). Higher catalytic activities were observed on for GOD-MMCHI than GOD-LMCHI and for those crosslinked with glutaraldehyde than using the adsorption technique. Enzyme loading greater than 0.6 mg decreased the activity. Under optimum conditions (pH 6.0. 35°C and applied potential of 0.6 V) response times of 85 s and 65 s were observed for medium molecular weight chitosan glucose biosensor (GOD-MMCHI/PT) and low molecular weight chitosan glucose biosensor (GOD-LMCHI/PT). respectively. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant () was found to be 12.737 mM for GOD-MMCHI/PT and 17.692 mM for GOD-LMCHI/PT. This indicated that GOD-MMCHI/PT had greater affinity for the enzyme. Moreover.

1217984,Multi-grid background Pass-Go,2008,LY Por and XT Lim,7,WSEAS Transactions on Information Science and Applications,7,1137-1148,World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society (WSEAS),Computer security depends largely on passwords to authenticate the human user for access to secure systems. Remembering the password they have chosen is a frequent problem for all users. As a result. they tend to choose short and insecure passwords as compared to secure passwords which usually consist of a long mixture of random alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric characters. Thus. the tendency of choosing insecure passwords has brought up many security problems. Graphical password is an alternative to replace alphanumeric password in which users only have to click on the images in order to authenticate themselves rather than typing alphanumeric strings. The main objectives of this paper are to present a classification of graphical passwords system (GPS) and identify its future research area. In this paper. we attempt to identify a number of threats to the networked computer systems. focus on the research of graphical password system (GPS) and analysis on some aspects of GPS; 1) how each GPS algorithm works. 2) the advantages and disadvantages of each GPS algorithm. 3) how each GPS algorithm is able to address solutions to the threats. Besides. the paper also concentrates on the design and the implication of a proposed prototype. namely Multi-Grid Background Pass-Go (MGBPG) which is targeted to be its strength and the winning edge over other graphical password systems. The preliminary result and analysis of the proposed prototype is then presented by comparing it on its role in addressing the drawbacks of current existing GPS and several security attacks.

Compute-intensive mobile applications can be augmented using cloud either in client/server model or through cyber foraging. However. long or permanent network disconnections due to user mobility increase the execution time and in certain cases refrain the mobile devices from getting response back for the remotely performed execution. In this paper. we propose use of process state synchronization (PSS) as a mechanism to mitigate the impact of network disconnections on the service continuity of cloud-based interactive mobile applications. To validate the PSS-based execution. we develop a mathematical model that incorporates the disconnection and synchronization intervals. and mobile device capabilities along with that of cloud.

Based on laboratory experiments. this study focuses on the relationship between scour depth in complex pier groups and combined piles bridge and various parameters including the variation of inflow velocity. distance. and time. 1 200 data were collected for flow velocity and scour. The flow pattern and scour were analyzed for different flow discharges and flow depths. The results showed that the scour development with respect to time was greater for higher flow depth and bigger flow discharge at semi-integral bridges. In addition. the equilibrium scour depth increased with the approach flow depth around piers at semi-integral bridges. Velocity distribution also affected the scour development.

This was done for planning of irrigation strategy and to develop an appropriate irrigation scheduling for different cropping systems. Probability analysis. evapotranspiration and net irrigation requirement were estimated. For recurrence interval of 2. 5. 25. 50 and 100 years. the values of maximum rainfall found in June were 470. 660.790. 910. 982 and 104 mm. respectively. The highest ETp (6.49 mm day-1) was obtained in April and the lowest (3.68 mm day-1) in July. The maximum net irrigation requirements for crops were found in the months of April. November. February. and January. respectively. May to September was the highest rainfall months when the rainfall was more than 300 mm in over 63.80% of the years and was always more than 50 mm. It appears that rainfall can be delayed upon during June and water resources can be brought into consideration to share the excess water for agricultural use in drought months. Effort was to be made to conserve for winter period as most of the month indicate drought by soil conservation. The results further indicate that net radiation generally decreased during monsoon reaching its minimum in December and then gradually increased again with the onset monsoon summer. finally reaching its peak in May.

Building integrated wind turbines (BIWTs) are an interesting option in this respect. BIWTs are low cost renewable sources of energy. Since the power in wind is proportional to the cubic power of the wind velocity approaching the wind turbine. a small amount of wind speed acceleration leads to a large increase in energy output. To augment free wind speed streams. the open area between two buildings can be used as diffuser by taking advantage of the Venturi effect.

These provided evidence of the strength of agile methodologies as a strategy that can speed up the development of rhythms and growth of innovation. Managing a project involves a complexity of requirements and developmental processes. This provides challenges to the project manager as he is accountable for the failure of a completed project.

1218047,Simple heuristics that make us smart,1999,Gerd Gigerenzer and Peter M Todd,,,,,Oxford University Press. USA,Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart invites readers to embark on a new journey into a land of rationality that differs from the familiar territory of cognitive science and economics. Traditional views of rationality tend to see decision makers as possessing superhuman powers of reason. limitless knowledge. and all of eternity in which to ponder choices. To understand decisions in the real world. we need a different. more psychologically plausible notion of rationality. and this book provides it. It is about fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules for making decisions when time is pressing and deep thought an unaffordable luxury. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices. classifications. and predictions by employing bounded rationality. But when and how can such fast and frugal heuristics work? Can judgments based simply on one good reason be as accurate as those based on many reasons? Could less knowledge even lead to systematically better predictions than more knowledge? Simple Heuristics explores these questions. developing computational models of heuristics and testing them through experiments and analyses. It shows how fast and frugal heuristics can produce adaptive decisions in situations as varied as choosing a mate. dividing resources among offspring. predicting high school drop out rates. and playing the stock market. As an interdisciplinary work that is both useful and engaging. this book will appeal to a wide audience. It is ideal for researchers in cognitive psychology. evolutionary psychology. and cognitive science. as well as in economics and artificial intelligence.

1218048,Experimental practices in economics: A methodological challenge for psychologists?,2001,Ralph Hertwig and Andreas Ortmann,24,,3,383-403,,This target article is concerned with the implications of the surprisingly different experimental practices in economics and in areas of psychology relevant to both economists and psychologists. such as behavioral decision making. We consider four features of experimentation in economics. namely. script enactment. repeated trials. performance-based monetary payments. and the proscription against deception. and compare them to experimental practices in psychology. primarily in the area of behavioral decision making. Whereas economists bring a precisely defined “script” to experiments for participants to enact. psychologists often do not provide such a script. leaving participants to infer what choices the situation affords. By often using repeated experimental trials. economists allow participants to learn about the task and the environment; psychologists typically do not. Economists generally pay participants on the basis of clearly defined performance criteria; psychologists usually pay a flat fee or grant a fixed amount of course credit. Economists virtually never deceive participants; psychologists. especially in some areas of inquiry. often do. We argue that experimental standards in economics are regulatory in that they allow for little variation between the experimental practices of individual researchers. The experimental standards in psychology. by contrast. are comparatively laissez-faire. We believe that the wider range of experimental practices in psychology reflects a lack of procedural regularity that may contribute to the variability of empirical findings in the research fields under consideration.

This result is roughly consistent with theoretical predictions according to which cheap talk promotes efficient Nash play.

Based on this assessment. experimental economists were counseled to lift their de facto prohibition against deception to capture its potential benefits. To the extent that this recommendation is derived from empirical studies. we argue that it draws on a selective sample of the available evidence. Building on a systematic review of relevant research in psychology. we present two major results: First. the evidence suggests that the experience of having been deceived generates suspicion that in turn is likely to affect the judgment and decision making of a non-negligible number of participants.

Drawing on modern agency theory. we conclude that the trust hypothesis stands on shaky ground.

The available evidence. patchy and inadequate as it is. seems to suggests that there are some ownership-related differences in aspects of organisational performance connected with asymmetric information.

MA,In this chapter. we examine the trust hypothesis: the proposition that information asymmetries between providers and consumers of services can explain the existence of nonprofit enterprise in certain markets. We argue that this hypothesis. in order to be viable. has to meet three challenges: (a) the de jure inability of nonprofits to distribute profits to shareholders and/or management must affect incentives within the nonprofit firm in ways that are compatible with trustworthiness (“incentive compatibility challenge”). (b) nonprofit behavior must not be adulterated by individuals taking advantage of the perceived trustworthiness (“adulteration challenge”). and (c) nonprofit status must be treated as a reliable predictor of organizational behavior by consumers. when the reputation of individual firms is not seen as reliable (“reputational ubiquity challenge”).

Two University of Michigan psychologists lured a variety of students to a laboratory. ostensibly to take part in a different study. At one point. the subjects were asked to drop off a questionnaire at the far end of a narrow hallway and had to squeeze by a student working at a file drawer.

An analysis of listening strategies in distributional learning,2013,Karin Wanrooij and Paola Escudero and Maartje EJ Raijmakers,41,Journal of Phonetics,5,307-319,Academic Press,This study first confirms the previous finding that Spanish learners improve their perception of a difficult Dutch vowel contrast through listening to a frequency distribution of the vowels involved in the contrast. a technique also known as distributional training. Secondly. it is demonstrated that learners' initial use of acoustic cues influences their performance after distributional training. To that end. types of unique listening strategies. i.e.. specific ways of using acoustic cues in vowel perception. are identified using latent class regression models.

1218084,The association between autism and errors in early embryogenesis: what is the causal mechanism?,2010,Annemie Ploeger and Maartje EJ Raijmakers and Han LJ van der Maas and Frietson Galis,67,,7,602-607,Elsevier,The association between embryonic errors and the development of autism has been recognized in the literature. but the mechanism underlying this association remains unknown. We propose that pleiotropic effects during a very early and specific stage of embryonic development—early organogenesis—can explain this association. In humans early organogenesis is an embryonic stage. spanning Day 20 to Day 40 after fertilization. which is characterized by intense interactivity among body parts of the embryo. This implies that a single mutation or environmental disturbance affecting development at this stage can have several phenotypic effects (i.e.. pleiotropic effects). Disturbances during early organogenesis can lead to many different anomalies. including limb deformities. craniofacial malformations. brain pathology. and anomalies in other organs.

How can they express that knowledge? In two sequence-learning experiments. we studied the acquisition of knowledge of complex probabilistic sequences. Using a novel experimental paradigm. we were able to compare reaction time and generation measures of sequence knowledge online. Hidden Markov models were introduced as a novel way of analyzing generation data that allowed for a characterization of sequence knowledge in terms of the grammar that was used to generate the stimulus material. The results indicated a strong correlation between the decrease in reaction times and an increase in generation performance. This pattern of results is consistent with a common knowledge base for improvement on both measures.

The data were obtained in a repeated measures study in which subjects aged 6 to 10 years carried out a simple discrimination learning task. In contrast to distribution models of exclusively rational learners or exclusively incremental learners. a mixture distribution model of rational learners and slow learners was found to fit the data of all measurement occasions and all age groups. Hence. the finite mixture distribution analysis provides strong support for the existence of distinct modes of learning behavior.

Two studies of performance on triad classification tasks with large samples (N=226 and N=328) are presented to (a) contrast theoretical predictions from the holistic-to-analytic-shift theory (Smith & Kemler. 1977) and the differential-sensitivity account (Cook & Odom. 1992). and (b) to contrast findings with Thompson's (1994) rule analysis technique with latent class analysis (LCA). The findings. which demonstrate the value of LCA in this context. support the differential-sensitivity account. but not the holistic-to-analytic-shift theory.

These approaches are evaluated and integrated on the basis of catastrophe theory. In particular. catastrophe theory specifies a set of common criteria for testing the discontinuity hypothesis proposed by Piaget. Separate criteria correspond to distinct methods used in cognitive developmental research.

When a genuine stage transition is present. these criteria are expected to be satisfied.

In this chapter. the criticism of DST will be reformulated in a way that is consistent with Wohlwill’s thesis that the study of developmental processes requires analysis of intraindividual differences. not interindividual differences.

A recent investigation conducted by Smith and colleagues (2011) on methods for estimating connectivity maps suggested that those which attempt to ascertain the direction of influence among ROIs rarely provide reliable results. Another problem gaining increasing attention is heterogeneity in connectivity maps. Most group-level methods require that the data come from homogeneous samples. and misleading findings may arise from current methods if the connectivity maps for individuals vary across the sample (which is likely the case). The utility of maps resulting from effective connectivity on the individual or group levels is thus diminished because they do not accurately inform researchers.

The nonstationarity in the series is represented by a linear time dependent mean function. This mild form of nonstationarity is often relevant in analyzing socio-economic time series met in practice. Through the use of an extended version of Molenaar's stationary dynamic factor analysis method. the effect of nonstationarity on the latent factor series is incorporated in the dynamic nonstationary factor model (DNFM).

Wood color is associated with wood extractives contents. This study presents the relationship between wood color parameters measured by the CIELab color system and total amount of extractives and phenolic-type extractives in ethanol-toluene and hot water extracts of wood from two fast-growth plantation species. The results demonstrated that the difference in sapwood and hardwood color in Vochysia guatemalensis and Acacia mangium is caused by lower concentrations of extractives in sapwood of both species. Additionally. variations in total extractive and phenolic content have different effects on the color parameters (L*. a* and b*) of both species studied. In Vochysia guatemalensis wood. parameter L* decreases as total extractive and phenolic content increases; however. parameter a* increases as the content of extractives and phenols increases. In Acacia mangium. the amount of phenols showed no relationship with the color parameters. The ethanol-toluene total extractive content. however. shows a relationship with several color parameters.

The objective of the present research was to determine the variation in the anatomy of xylem caused by the ecological conduction variation. Dimensions of fiber. axial parenchyma percentage of cross sections. parameters of vessels and the ray were measured. The results showed that some anatomical characteristics remained stable despite variations of ecological conditions. especially radial parenchyma and anatomical features which were less affected by the altitude. On the other hand. the vessels. axial parenchyma and fiber were less stable because they were affected significantly by the longitude. latitude. altitude and precipitation. Latitude significantly affected vessel percentage. length and diameter of the fiber and lumen. Longitude affected vessel percentage and fiber diameter. Altitude had a significant correlation with the amount of cells at ray height. Annual average precipitation affected vessel percentage and diameter. not only of the fiber. but also of the lumen.

Vochysia guatemalensis. and Hyeronima alchorneoides trees from fast-growth condition in a tropical humid region of Costa Rica. A total of 10 trees of T. amazonia. V. guatemalensis and H. alchorneoides each. were randomly selected for harvesting from forest plantations. Young trees of all three species showed very poor esthetic characteristics in comparison to market expectations. particularly due to their reduced heartwood content and their light dark color. Wood from plantation forest trees of V. guatemalensis. T. amazonia. and H. alchorneoides in Costa Rica showed inferior wood properties than wood from natural forests. However. age differences of trees between both provenances limit the validity of present results. Terminalia amazonia from forest plantations show very promising characteristics for industry processes due to its ease of drying. manipulation. and mechanical properties.

American Association of Petroleum Geologists. Society of Petroleum Engineers,In the Permian basin. unconventional reservoirs have been the main target of horizontal well drilling since the early 2000s. Over the years. completion and stimulation design in horizontal wells has evolved from conservative to radical designs. It has also progressed from exploration mode to full development. and from single-well pads to multi-well pads and stacked laterals. In field development mode. infill drilling between pre-existing wells that have been on production for some time is typically done. Production interference has been observed to occur and known to have negative impact on pre-existing (parent) wells.

1218187,Simulation study of zipper fracturing using an unconventional fracture model,2015,Fangda Qiu and Matteo Marongiu Porcu and Jian Xu and Raj Malpani and Piyush Pankaj and Timothy L Pope,,,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,In the past decade the industry has embraced unconventional resources; namely. shale oil and shale gas. After the initial drill-to-hold stage. multiwell pad drilling and stimulations are employed to exploit the acreage. Zipper fracturing is a technique that reduces the standby time (up to 50% reduction. when combined with the plug-and-perf isolation method). Because of this operational efficiency improvement. zipper fracturing has become one of the most common fracturing practices for unconventional reservoir stimulation. It has also been purported to increase production. which several authors have previously reported. There are also other studies showing no benefit of zipper fracturing on production performance.,True,WDAU9i0AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,21,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-175980-MS,13180316013801213688,/scholar?cites=13180316013801213688,,,0,0,0

This point heat‐source model differs from previous conduction models in that it accepts power rather than temperature as the boundary condition at the plasma/cathode interface. Optimum pulse times are predicted to within an average of 16% over a two‐decade range after the model is tuned to a single experimental point. A constant fraction of the total power supplied to the gap is transferred to the cathode over a wide range of currents. A universal. dimensionless model is then presented which identifies the key parameters of optimum pulse time factor (g) and erodibility (j) in terms of the thermophysical properties of the cathode material. Compton’s original energy balance for gas discharges is amended for EDM conditions. Here it is believed that the high density of the liquid dielectric causes plasmas of higher …,True,VWtdqgcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,707,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.343994,4904080908117716930,/scholar?cites=4904080908117716930,,,0,0,0

The anode erosion model,1989,Mukund R Patel and Maria A Barrufet and Philip T Eubank and Daryl D DiBitonto,66,Journal of applied physics,9,4104-4111,American Institute of Physics,As a second in a series of theoretical models for the electrical discharge machining (EDM) process. an erosion model for the anode material is presented. As with our point heat‐source model in the previous article. the present model also accepts power rather than temperature as the boundary condition at the plasma/anode interface. A constant fraction of the total power supplied to the gap is transferred to the anode. The power supplied is assumed to produce a Gaussian‐distributed heat flux on the surface of the anode material. Furthermore. the area upon which the flux is incident is assumed to grow with time. The model is capable of showing. via the determined migrating melt fronts. the rapid melting of the anodic material as well as the subsequent resolidification of the material foation from plasma dynamics modeling could improve substantially our results.,True,VWtdqgcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,473,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.343995,7407722186175789095,/scholar?cites=7407722186175789095,,,0,0,0

The variable mass. cylindrical plasma model,1993,Philip T Eubank and Mukund R Patel and Maria A Barrufet and Bedri Bozkurt,73,Journal of applied physics,11,7900-7909,American Institute of Physics,A variable mass. cylindrical plasma model (VMCPM) is developed for sparks created by electrical discharge in a liquid media. The model consist of three differential equations—one each from fluid dynamics. an energy balance. and the radiation equation—combined with a plasma equation of state. A thermophysical property subroutine allows realistic estimation of plasma enthalpy. mass density. and particle fractions by inclusion of the heats of dissociation and ionization for a plasma created from deionized water. Problems with the zero‐time boundary conditions are overcome by an electron balance procedure. Numerical solution of the model provides plasma radius. temperature. pressure. and mass as a function of pulse time for fixed current. electrode gap. and power fraction remaining in the plasma. Moderately high temperatures (≳5000 K) and pressures (≳4 bar) persist in the sparks even after long pulse times …,True,VWtdqgcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,345,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.353942,11254347185713005805,/scholar?cites=11254347185713005805,,,0,0,0

We measured viscosities at temperatures ranging from ambient to 450 K using a versatile mercury capillary tube.We evaluated several mixing rules to predict the mixture viscosity as a function of temperature and the viscosities of the constituents. The most promising mixing rule follows a methodology proposed originally by Lederer. We used our own experimental data to calibrate this mixing rule. which only has two adjustable parameters. and used the same coefficients to predict the blending viscosity of mixtures of bitumen and a synthetic oil solvent reported in the literature.

Ltd,The aminoglycosides. a group of structurally related antibiotics. bind to rRNA in the small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome. Most aminoglycosides are inactive or weakly active against eukaryotic ribosomes. A major difference in the binding site for these antibiotics between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes is the identity of the nucleotide at position 1408 (Escherichia coli numbering). which is an adenosine in prokaryotic ribosomes and a guanosine in eukaryotic ribosomes. Expression in E. coli of plasmid‐encoded 16S rRNA containing an A1408 to G substitution confers resistance to a subclass of the aminoglycoside antibiotics that contain a 6′ amino group on ring I. Chemical footprinting experiments indicate that resistance arises from the lower affinity of the drug for the eukaryotic rRNA sequence.

We show here that tlyA encodes a 2′-O-methyltransferase that modifies nucleotide C1409 in helix 44 of 16S rRNA and nucleotide C1920 in helix 69 of 23S rRNA. Loss of these previously unidentified rRNA methylations confers resistance to capreomycin and viomycin. Many bacterial genera including enterobacteria lack a tlyA gene and the ensuing methylations and are less susceptible than mycobacteria to capreomycin and viomycin. We show that expression of recombinant tlyA in Escherichia coli markedly increases susceptibility to these drugs.

1218456,Converting GTP hydrolysis into motion: versatile translational elongation factor G,2019,MV Rodnina and Frank Peske and BZ Peng and Riccardo Belardinelli and Wolfgang Wintermeyer,,Biological Chemistry,,,De Gruyter,Elongation factor G (EF-G) is a translational GTPase that acts at several stages of protein synthesis. Its canonical function is to catalyze tRNA movement during translation elongation. but it also acts at the last step of translation to promote ribosome recycling. Moreover. EF-G has additional functions. such as helping the ribosome to maintain the mRNA reading frame or to slide over non-coding stretches of the mRNA. EF-G has an unconventional GTPase cycle that couples the energy of GTP hydrolysis to movement. EF-G facilitates movement in the GDP-Pi form. To convert the energy of hydrolysis to movement. it requires various ligands in the A site. such as a tRNA in translocation. an mRNA secondary structure element in ribosome sliding. or ribosome recycling factor in post-termination complex disassembly. The ligand defines the direction and timing of EF-G-facilitated motion.

Vienna,The past decade has seen tremendous advances in our understanding of the mechanism of protein synthesis. due in part to the solution of ribosome structures by X-ray crystallography. These structures have clarified our view of the decoding process so that it can now be understood in stereochemical terms. and have demonstrated that the ribosome is a ribozyme. catalyzing peptide bond formation using RNA’s capacity to adopt complex three-dimensional arrangements. While the ribosome structure solutions represent fundamental technical achievements. perhaps their most important contribution is that they explain some four decades of genetic and biochemical studies of the ribosome.

Formation of the first peptide bond between the P-site-bound fMet-tRNA and the A-site-bound amino-acyl-tRNA specified by the second mRNA codon marks the transition from initiation to elongation. Three protein factors (initiation factors IF1. IF2. and IF3) and at least one GTP molecule are required to ensure the efficiency and fidelity of this process.Initiation is usually the rate-controlling step of translation; under normal conditions (eg. with the lacZ mRNA). elon-gation proceeds at a rate of~ 12 amino acids/s (Sorensen et al.. 1989). while the ribosomes load onto the same mRNA at~ 3.2-s intervals (Kennell & Riezman. 1977).

In accordance with previously published findings. we show that these motifs occur in AT-rich regions of DNA.

In cells growing under optimal conditions. the GTP concentration is very high. and that of ppGpp very low. However. under stress conditions. the GTP concentration may decline by as much as 50%. and that of ppGpp can attain levels comparable to those of GTP.

Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models were recently used to provide the desired data. The current uncertainty sources in NWP models introduce uncertainties in wind resource assessment. More accurate NWP wind data will lead to more accurate resource assessment. wind turbine micrositing and energy short-term forecasting. Using one single NWP model may lead to undesired results compared to the huge investment in wind energy projects. New capabilities and strategies to quantify and reduce the uncertainty of wind data from NWP models are required.

This paper presents a feasibility study of wind penetration into an existing diesel power plant of an isolated area known as Al Duqm in Oman. Both wind data and the actual load data have been used in the simulation model. It was found that with the existing diesel price of 0.368 $/l. the hybrid system will provide the lowest cost of energy with wind speed of more than 5.3 m/s. which is very close to the average wind speed in the Al Duqm area. As the wind speed increases. the cost of energy decreases even with the increase in the fuel cost.

These initiatives have been introduced to the utilities in shape of incentives and penalties. Recently. the electricity distribution companies in Oman have been incentivized to reduce the distribution technical and non-technical losses with an equal annual reduction rate for 6 years. In this paper. different techniques for losses reduction in Mazoon Electricity Company (MZEC) are addressed. In this company. high numbers of substation and feeders were found to be non-compliant with the Distribution System Security Standard (DSSS). Therefore. 33 projects have been suggested to bring non-complying 29 substations and 28 feeders to meet the planed criteria and to comply with the DSSS. The largest part of MZEC’s network (South Batinah region) was modeled by ETAP software package. The model has been extended to implement the proposed projects and to examine their effects on losses reduction. Simulation results have shown that the implementation of these projects leads to a significant improvement in voltage profile. and reduction in the active and the reactive power losses.

Reducing losses can result in substantial savings for utility. Other benefits from loss reduction include released system capacity. and possible deferral of capital expenditures for system improvements and expansion.While losses in distribution lines are due to copper losses. transformer losses occur due to both copper and core losses. An increase in loading will result in an increase of current flow and correspondingly greater amount of loss in the transformer. Moreover. an unbalance in the system load will increase transformer losses. The harmonic currents will cause a small increase in copper losses; however. the high frequency harmonic voltage can cause large core losses. Frequently. utilities are forced to use an oversized transformer to compensate when a large harmonic presence is indicated.

Currently. the observations of the atmosphere and surface indicate the following changes:. Atmospheric Composition. It is certain that atmospheric burdens of the well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) targeted by the Kyoto Protocol increased from 2005 to 2011. The atmospheric abundance of carbon dioxide (CO2) was 390.5 ppm (390.3 to 390.7) in 2011; this is 40% greater than in 1750. Atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) was 324.2 ppb (324.0 to 324.4) in 2011 and has increased by 20% since 1750. Average annual increases in CO 2 and N 2 O from 2005 to 2011 are comparable to those observed from 1996 to 2005. Atmospheric methane (CH 4) was 1803.2 ppb (1801.2 to 1805.2) in 2011; this is 150% greater than before 1750. CH 4 began increasing in 2007 after remaining nearly constant from 1999 to 2006.

1218540,Projection of Future Changes in Rainfall and Temperature Patterns in Oman,2013,Y Charabi and Al-Yahyai S,4,Journal of Earth Science and Climatic Change,5,1-8 doi: 10.4172/2157-761,OMICS Publishing Group,Oman is one of most water-stressed countries in the world. Therefore. keeping water and energy supply and demand in equilibrium in a pressing development is a challenge facing Oman in the years ahead. The threat from the potential impacts of climate change has growing with the recent tropical cyclones that had affected the country and caused loss of life and substantial damage throughout the coastal areas of Oman. The design of an effective climate change strategy requires a deep knowledge about the past. the present climate and also requires an accurate estimation of the plausible change in future climate. This paper presents a rather complete picture about the current (1961-1990) and future (2011-2070) projection of the pattern of rainfall and temperature. For the assessment of the future climate projection over Oman. the 21st century the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) A1B. forcing scenario is used with the climate model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Community Climate System Model (CCSM-3). The A1B scenario clearly shows future minimum temperature increases that are in line with the results shown that minimum temperatures will experience the greatest impact from climate change. The simulation shows that the northern of Oman is expected to face decreasing rainfall in the coming decades. In a region where historic average annual rainfall levels are between 50 and 100 mm for the northern coast area. climate change is expected to lead to between 20 and 40 mm less rainfall by 2040.

This study is associated with the development of rainfall data infilling model. The model was developed and validated based on the past fifty years of observed hydrological data in Malaysia. It utilizes the basic principles of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). combined with Nearest Neighbour Imputation (NNeigh) technique. The result of this study shows that the proposed methods are sufficiently robust to cope with vagaries due to sample size and extreme data insufficiency even at 80% missing data level. Further. this study concludes that ANN is superior in patching missing data. specifically rainfall data or any other data with similar characteristics. The fact that the proposed model is able to produce pattern of imputed data which closely resembles that of the observed values where peaks of the observed hydrographs are mostly attainable proves that the proposed model is able to capture daily maximum rainfall series. Annual daily maximum rainfall series is essential in the planning and design of large scale and high risk water resources projects.

Developing an accurate forecasting model for a streamflow is highly essential for several applications in the field of water resources engineering. One of the main contributors for the modeling reliability is the optimization of the input variables to achieve an accurate forecasting model. The main step of modeling is the selection of the proper input combinations. Hence. developing an algorithm that can determine the optimal input combinations is crucial. This study introduces the Genetic algorithm (GA) for better input combination selection. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used for monthly streamflow time series forecasting due to its simplicity and effectiveness of integration with the selection algorithm.

In order to deliver high-quality product to both purchaser and buyer. there is a need to assess the efficiency of the company behind the product. Despite numerous journal papers explaining critical success factors (CSFs) for construction projects. very few focus on determining the CSFs for construction management. The primary objective of this paper is to identify the principal CSFs for construction management through literature review and survey. From the review. seven main factors can be determined from all of the sub-factors discovered. Those factors were assembled into a questionnaire and distributed among construction industry practitioners. including property developers. consultants and contractors. An analysis of factors was then used to ascertain the dependent and independent variables necessary for developing an assessment system for evaluating construction management in construction industry firms.

In this research. brown. green. and red lentil (Lens culinaris) extracts have been evaluated as a natural coagulant for the turbidity reduction. The physicochemical characteristics properties of lentil extract were evaluated through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). zeta potential analysis. and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Red lentil extract was found to be an anionic polymer with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups. The effects of three major operating parameters. pH. the concentration of coagulant. and settling time. were studied and optimized through response surface methodology (RSM) using the Box–Behnken Design (BBD). The red lentil extract as coagulant was outperformed alum in acidic wastewater treatment. which achieved up to 98.87% turbidity removal with an optimum concentration of 26.3 mg/L in 3min. Besides. the red lentil extract as coagulant reduced 29.42% of material cost. generated 15.6% lower amount of sludge and produced flocs with better settling characteristic (SVI: 7.39) as compared to alum. Based on the experimental observation and characterization study. absorption and bridging mechanisms were proposed for red lentil extract as the coagulant in turbidity reduction.

Dam and reservoir operation rules are considered one of the most complicated optimization engineering problems. In fact. the operation rules of dams and reservoirs are multisystematic and highly stochastic and have highly nonlinear system constraints due to the direct influence of environmental conditions: Therefore. these rules are considered highly complex optimization problems. Recently. metaheuristic methods inferred from nature have been broadly utilized to elucidate the way optimal solutions are provided for several complex optimization engineering applications. and these methods have achieved interesting results. The major advantage of these metaheuristic methods over conventional methods is the unnecessity to identify a particular initial condition. convexity. continuity. or differentiability. The present study investigated the potential of using a new metaheuristic method (ie. the crow algorithm (CA)) to provide optimal operations for multireservoir systems. with the aim of optimally improving hydropower generation. A multireservoir system in China was considered to examine the performance of the proposed optimization algorithm for several operation scenarios. The results obtained the average hydropower generation by considering all examined operation scenarios based on the operation rule achieved using the CA. which outperformed the other metaheuristic methods.

The removal efficiency of different pollutants under this system is generally satisfactory. except for nitrogen which is deficient in certain bioretention systems. Nitrogen has a complex biogeochemical cycle. and thus the removal processes of nitrogen are typically slower than other pollutants. This study summarizes recent studies that have focused on nitrogen removal for urban stormwater runoff and discusses the latest advances in bioretention systems. The performance. influencing factors. and design enhancements are comprehensively reviewed in this paper. The review of current literature reveals that a bioretention system shows great promise due to its ability to remove nitrogen from stormwater runoff. Combining nitrification and denitrification zones with the addition of a carbon source and selecting different plant species promote nitrogen removal. Nevertheless. more studies on nitrogen transformations in a bioretention system and the relationships between different design factors need to be undertaken.

1218589,Master-leader-slave cuckoo search with parameter control for ANN optimization and its real-world application to water quality prediction,2017,Najmeh Sadat Jaddi and Salwani Abdullah and Marlinda Abdul Malek,12,PloS one,1,e0170372,Public Library of Science,Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been employed to solve a broad variety of tasks. The selection of an ANN model with appropriate weights is important in achieving accurate results. This paper presents an optimization strategy for ANN model selection based on the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. which is rooted in the obligate brood parasitic actions of some cuckoo species. In order to enhance the convergence ability of basic CS. some modifications are proposed. The fraction Pa of the n nests replaced by new nests is a fixed parameter in basic CS. As the selection of Pa is a challenging issue and has a direct effect on exploration and therefore on convergence ability. in this work the Pa is set to a maximum value at initialization to achieve more exploration in early iterations and it is decreased during the search to achieve more exploitation in later iterations until it reaches the minimum value in the final iteration. In addition. a novel master-leader-slave multi-population strategy is used where the slaves employ the best fitness function among all slaves. which is selected by the leader under a certain condition. This fitness function is used for subsequent Lévy flights. In each iteration a copy of the best solution of each slave is migrated to the master and then the best solution is found by the master. The method is tested on benchmark classification and time series prediction problems and the statistical analysis proves the ability of the method.

Exploitation of shelters may be impeded by mutual interference. yet interference competition can be difficult to distinguish from exploitation competition. We used bullheads (Cottus gobio) as a model system of mobile fish to investigate the effect of intraspecific competition on shelter use. A series of field experiments was conducted under controlled conditions of shelter availability and population density. For each experiment. the location of each individual fish was observed over a period of 10 days. We then constructed a continuous-time Markov-chain model for the movement of fish between shelters and the open stream. which explicitly parameterised exploitation competition and interference competition for shelter and which accounted for …,True,wyZ6MacAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,18,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10666-008-9171-5,782934439304359942,/scholar?cites=782934439304359942,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Owen_Jones4/publication/225504919_Distinguishing_Between_Interference_and_Exploitation_Competition_for_Shelter_in_a_Mobile_Fish_Population/links/00b4952718e81bffce000000/Distinguishing-Between-Interference-and-Exploitation-Competition-for-Shelter-in-a-Mobile-Fish-Population.pdf,0,0,0

The approach starts with the assumption that a unit of rainfall‐excess runoff generated at a point is a fraction β of precipitation P (m) which travels some variable distance down a slope before reinfiltrating. depending on the local rainfall. climate. soils. etc. If this random distance travelled Y is represented by a distribution. then a survival function will describe the probability of this unit of runoff travelling further than some distance x (m). The total amount of per unit width runoff Q (m2) flowing across the lower boundary of a slope of length λ (m) may be considered the sum of all the proportions of the units of rainfall excess runoff integrated from the lower boundary x = 0 to the upper boundary x = λ of the slope.

The runoff‐runon process is invoked to explain field observations of runoff ratios that decline with plot length and steady‐state infiltration rates that increase gradually with rainfall intensity. To illustrate the influence of spatial variability and runoff‐runon on net infiltration and runoff generation. we use both (i) field rainfall simulation on soil with a high infiltration capacity and (ii) numerical rainfall‐runoff‐runon simulations over a spatially variable area.

ECG and EEG traces. and various hydrological and meteorological time series. Simulation of self-similar processes has proven problematic. because they exhibit a slowly decaying correlation structure (long-range dependence). which means that the individual elements of any sequence of observations X (1)..... X (n) are strongly correlated. In practice to date this generally means that it is not possible to simulate X (n) without simultaneously simulating X (1)..... X (n− 1). and this necessarily results in an algorithm that requires O (n) storage to generate n steps of X. More importantly. this means that if you have already generated n steps. then it is not possible to generate step n+ 1 directly. instead it is necessary to generate all n+ 1 steps from scratch. 1. 2. 3 One model which avoids these problems is the M/G/queue. 4 Unfortunately this model is not flexible enough to be useful in practice. Here we present a new class of self-similar models called EBP processes (for Embedded Branching Process). which are flexible. readily fitted to data. and easily simulated. Features of the simulation algorithm are (i) Scaleable: O (n log n) time to generate n steps.(ii) Efficient: O (log n) storage required to generate n steps.(iii) On line: can generate a new step on demand.The class of processes is described in Section 2. and the simulation algorithm given in Section 3.

Two of the key properties determining this runoff volume are the rainfall rate and the infiltration rate. Both these rates are variable in both space and in time. but it is common to neglect the spatial variability. In this paper we propose a stochastic runoff model that deals explicitly with spatial variability. while neglecting the temporal variability.We use an idealised model for the catchment terrain. which allows us to obtain analytical results. We consider a single hillslope. broken up into a series of parallel and independent strips. perpendicular to the stream edge. Each strip has width and is divided into blocks of length. Consider a single strip. and number the blocks. starting at the top of the slope. and let be the flow of runoff from block to. in.

Our prime motivation is to show how the coalescence of runoff streams promotes the total generation of runoff. We show that. for our model. as the rate of rainfall increases in relation to the soil infiltration rate. there is a distinct phase-change. For low rainfall (the subcritical case) only the bottom of the hill-slope contributes to the total overland runoff. while for high rainfall (the supercritical case) the whole slope contributes and the total runoff increases dramatically. We identify the critical point at which the phase-change occurs. and show how it depends on the degree of coalescence. When there is no stream coalescence the critical point occurs when the rainfall rate equals the average infiltration rate. but when we allow coalescence the critical point occurs when the rainfall rate is less than the average infiltration rate. and increasing the amount of coalescence increases the total expected runoff.,True,wyZ6MacAAAAJ:8VtEwCQfWZkC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08803,16098064236552139287,/scholar?cites=16098064236552139287,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08803,0,0,0

In this paper. we discuss the approach’s properties and illustrate its performance using two case studies of wildfire-prone areas in the state of Victoria. Australia. The results show that our approach can lead to significant improvements when compared to ad-hoc evacuation. but these improvements also strongly depend on population density and road network topology.

It requires spatiotemporal decision making by many individual agents under circumstances that include an unknown impact of the disaster on the environment. which impedes the evacuation planning. and potentially destroyed. blocked or lacking communication infrastructure. which impedes central management. This paper suggests and investigates a novel paradigm for evacuation planning: decentralized planning based on sharing local knowledge.

The fact that many processes have uncertain parameters is a barrier to obtain the best design of the control charts. In this paper. economic statistical design (ESD) of the X-bar control chart utilising robust optimisation approach that considers interval estimates of uncertain parameters is investigated. A heuristic algorithm is developed to obtain the robust scheme of the control chart. Robust design for an industrial problem is compared with traditional ESD. and heuristic design.

Hence. there is a need for more realistic assumptions to be incorporated. In order to reduce cost penalties for not knowing the true values of some parameters. this paper aims to develop a bi-objective model of the economic-statistical design of the S control chart to minimize the mean hourly loss cost while minimizing out-of-control average run length and maintaining reasonable in-control average run length considering Taguchi loss function. The purpose of Taguchi loss function is to reflect the economic loss associated with variation in. and deviations from. the process target or the target value of a product characteristic. In contrast to the existing modeling approaches. the proposed model and given Pareto-optimal solution sets enables the chart designer to obtain solutions that is effective even for control chart design problems in uncertain environments.

The system relies on matching vehicle signatures from wireless sensors. The sensors provide a noisy magnetic signature of a vehicle and the precise time when it crosses the sensors. A match (re-identification) of signatures at two locations gives the corresponding travel time of the vehicle. The travel times for all matched vehicles yield the travel time distribution.

Developing statistical models from historical data for wind power ramps is important for designing intelligent distribution and market mechanisms for a future electric grid. This requires robust detection schemes for identifying wind ramps in data. In this paper. we propose an optimal detection technique for identifying wind ramps for large time series.

On the one hand. context-free privacy solutions. such as differential privacy. provide strong privacy guarantees. but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand. context-aware privacy solutions. such as information theoretic privacy. achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff. but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP. learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals’ private variables. and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP’s performance. we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models:(a) the binary data model; and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models. we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms. and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice. even in the absence of dataset statistics.

We further prove that for any utility function and any privacy level. solving the privacy-utility maximization problem is equivalent to solving a finite-dimensional linear program. the outcome of which is the optimal staircase mechanism. However. solving this linear program can be computationally expensive since it has a number of variables that is exponential in the size of the alphabet the data lives in.

1218673,Context-aware generative adversarial privacy,2017,Chong Huang and Peter Kairouz and Xiao Chen and Lalitha Sankar and Ram Rajagopal,19,Entropy,12,656,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Preserving the utility of published datasets while simultaneously providing provable privacy guarantees is a well-known challenge. On the one hand. context-free privacy solutions. such as differential privacy. provide strong privacy guarantees. but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand. context-aware privacy solutions. such as information theoretic privacy. achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff. but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP. learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals’ private variables. and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP’s performance. we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models:(a) the binary data model; and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models. we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms. and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice. even in the absence of dataset statistics.

A key challenge is that training algorithms often require estimating many different quantities (vectors) from the same set of examples---for example. gradients of different layers in a deep learning architecture. as well as metrics and batch normalization parameters. Each of these may have different properties like dimensionality. magnitude. and tolerance to noise.

Manual inspection of raw data-of representative samples. of outliers. of misclassifications-is an essential tool in a) identifying and fixing problems in the data. b) generating new modeling hypotheses. and c) assigning or refining human-provided labels. However. manual data inspection is problematic for privacy sensitive datasets. such as those representing the behavior of real-world individuals. Furthermore. manual data inspection is impossible in the increasingly important setting of federated learning. where raw examples are stored at the edge and the modeler may only access aggregated outputs such as metrics or model parameters. This paper demonstrates that generative models-trained using federated methods and with formal differential privacy guarantees-can be used effectively to debug many commonly occurring data issues even when the data cannot be directly inspected.

We focus on the device discovery problem. with extensions to joint discovery and data transmission as well as data transmission without communicating the device identities. We formulate this problem as a combinatorial group testing problem. where the goal is to exactly identify the set of at most d defective items from a pool of n items. We translate the energy constraint at the wireless physical layer to a constraint on the number of tests each item can participate in. and study the resulting “sparse” combinatorial group testing problem.

In this work we turn the tables and ask the following question: can we harness the power of adversarial examples to prevent malicious adversaries from learning identifying information from data while allowing non-malicious entities to benefit from the utility of the same data? For instance. can we use adversarial examples to anonymize biometric dataset of faces while retaining usefulness of this data for other purposes. such as emotion recognition?

The spread of messages on these platforms can be modeled by a diffusion process over a graph. Recent advances in network analysis have revealed that such diffusion processes are vulnerable to author deanonymization by adversaries with access to metadata. such as timing information. In this work. we ask the fundamental question of how to propagate anonymous messages over a graph to make it difficult for adversaries to infer the source. In particular. we study the performance of a message propagation protocol called adaptive diffusion introduced in (Fanti et al.. 2015). We prove that when the adversary has access to metadata at a fraction of corrupted graph nodes. adaptive diffusion achieves asymptotically optimal source-hiding and significantly outperforms standard diffusion. We further demonstrate empirically that adaptive diffusion hides the source effectively on real social networks.,True,m8NUgw0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,8,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/fanti16.html,17548160246962158692,/scholar?cites=17548160246962158692,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/fanti16.pdf,0,0,0

On the one hand. context-free privacy solutions. such as differential privacy. provide strong privacy guarantees. but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand. context-aware privacy solutions. such as information theoretic privacy. achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff. but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP. learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals’ private variables. and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP’s performance. we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models:(a) the binary data model; and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models. we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms. and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice. even in the absence of dataset statistics.

This measure quantifies the maximal gain of an adversary in refining a tilted version of its prior belief of any (potentially random) function of a dataset conditioning on a disclosed dataset. The choice of α determines the specific adversarial action ranging from refining a belief for α = 1 to guessing the best posterior for α = ∞. and for these extremal values this measure simplifies to mutual information (MI) and maximal leakage (MaxL). respectively. For all other α this measure is shown to be the Arimoto channel capacity.

Rate distortion theory is shown to be a natural choice to develop such a framework which includes modeling of data sources. developing application independent utility and privacy metrics. quantifying utility-privacy tradeoffs irrespective of the type of data sources or the methods of providing privacy. and developing a side-information model for dealing with questions of external knowledge.,True,VQq0aIwAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,38,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5513684/,3054343098289450812,/scholar?cites=3054343098289450812,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/H_Vincent_Poor/publication/221137142_A_Theory_of_Utility_and_Privacy_of_Data_Sources/links/54a29db00cf267bdb9041c33.pdf,0,0,0
1218713,A rate-disortion perspective on local differential privacy,2014,Anand D Sarwate and Lalitha Sankar,,,,903-908,IEEE,Local differential privacy is a model for privacy in which an untrusted statistician collects data from individuals who mask their data before revealing it. While randomized response has shown to be a good strategy when the statistician's goal is to estimate a parameter of the population. we consider instead the problem of locally private data publishing. in which the data collector must publish a version of the data it has collected. We model utility by a distortion measure and consider privacy mechanisms that act via a memoryless channnel operating on the data. If we consider a the source distribution to be unknown but in a class of distributions. we arrive at a robust-rate distortion model for the privacy-distortion tradeoff. We show that under Hamming distortions. the differential privacy risk is lower bounded for all nontrivial distortions. and that the lower bound grows logarithmically in the alphabet size.,True,VQq0aIwAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,37,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7028550/,5385055811237939602,/scholar?cites=5385055811237939602,,https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~asarwate/pdfs/SarwateS14allerton.pdf,0,0,0

1218720,Context-aware generative adversarial privacy,2017,Chong Huang and Peter Kairouz and Xiao Chen and Lalitha Sankar and Ram Rajagopal,19,Entropy,12,656,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Preserving the utility of published datasets while simultaneously providing provable privacy guarantees is a well-known challenge. On the one hand. context-free privacy solutions. such as differential privacy. provide strong privacy guarantees. but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand. context-aware privacy solutions. such as information theoretic privacy. achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff. but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP. learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals’ private variables. and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP’s performance. we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models:(a) the binary data model; and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models. we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms. and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice. even in the absence of dataset statistics.

In this paper. we show empirically that adversarial examples mainly lie in the low probability regions of the training distribution. regardless of attack types and targeted models. Using statistical hypothesis testing. we find that modern neural density models are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. Based on this discovery. we devised PixelDefend. a new approach that purifies a maliciously perturbed image by moving it back towards the distribution seen in the training data. The purified image is then run through an unmodified classifier. making our method agnostic to both the classifier and the attacking method. As a result. PixelDefend can be used to protect already deployed models and be combined with other model-specific defenses.

Poverty data. for example. is typically scarce. sparse in coverage. and labor-intensive to obtain. Remote sensing data such as high-resolution satellite imagery. on the other hand. is becoming increasingly available and inexpensive. Unfortunately. such data is highly unstructured and currently no techniques exist to automatically extract useful insights to inform policy decisions and help direct humanitarian efforts. We propose a novel machine learning approach to extract large-scale socioeconomic indicators from high-resolution satellite imagery. The main challenge is that training data is very scarce. making it difficult to apply modern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We therefore propose a transfer learning approach where nighttime light intensities are used as a data-rich proxy. We train a fully convolutional CNN model to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery. simultaneously learning features that are useful for poverty prediction.

1218735,A dirt-t approach to unsupervised domain adaptation,2018,Rui Shu and Hung H Bui and Hirokazu Narui and Stefano Ermon,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.08735,,,,Domain adaptation refers to the problem of leveraging labeled data in a source domain to learn an accurate model in a target domain where labels are scarce or unavailable. A recent approach for finding a common representation of the two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin & Lempitsky. 2015). which attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target feature distributions in some feature space. However. domain adversarial training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function has high-capacity. then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint. 2) in non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform well in both the source and target domains). training the model to do well on the source domain hurts performance on the target domain. In this paper. we address these issues through the lens of the cluster assumption. ie. decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and related models: 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model. which combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes the violation the cluster assumption; 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T) model. which takes the VADA model as initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the cluster assumption violation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the combination of these two models significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on the digit. traffic sign. and Wi-Fi recognition domain adaptation benchmarks.,True,ogXTOZ4AAAAJ:p2g8aNsByqUC,241,https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08735,8960716763873957731,/scholar?cites=8960716763873957731,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08735,0,0,0

To fill this gap. we propose TVNet. a novel end-to-end trainable neural network. to learn optical-flow-like features from data. TVNet subsumes a specific optical flow solver. the TV-L1 method. and is initialized by unfolding its optimization iterations as neural layers. TVNet can therefore be used directly without any extra learning. Moreover. it can be naturally concatenated with other task-specific networks to formulate an end-to-end architecture. thus making our method more efficient than current multi-stage approaches by avoiding the need to pre-compute and store features on disk. Finally. the parameters of the TVNet can be further fine-tuned by end-to-end training. This enables TVNet to learn richer and task-specific patterns beyond exact optical flow.

In this paper. we propose unrestricted adversarial examples. a new threat model where the attackers are not restricted to small norm-bounded perturbations. Different from perturbation-based attacks. we propose to synthesize unrestricted adversarial examples entirely from scratch using conditional generative models. Specifically. we first train an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) to model the class-conditional distribution over data samples. Then. conditioned on a desired class. we search over the AC-GAN latent space to find images that are likely under the generative model and are misclassified by a target classifier. We demonstrate through human evaluation that unrestricted adversarial examples generated this way are legitimate and belong to the desired class. Our empirical results on the MNIST.

Implicit models such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) often generate better samples compared to explicit models trained by maximum likelihood. Yet.

As predictions from different models often disagree. understanding the sources of this divergence is central to building a more robust picture of climate change's likely impacts. A common approach is to use statistical models trained on historical yields and some simplified measurements of weather. such as growing season average temperature and precipitation. Although the general strengths and weaknesses of statistical models are widely understood. there has been little systematic evaluation of their performance relative to other methods.

Unfortunately. efforts to improve their livelihoods must now unfold in the context of a rapidly changing climate. in which warming temperatures and changing rainfall regimes could threaten the basic productivity of the agricultural systems on which most of the world’s poor directly depend. But whether climate change represents a minor impediment or an existential threat to development is an area of substantial controversy. with different conclusions wrought from different methodologies and based on different data. This book aims to resolve some of the controversy by exploring and comparing the different methodologies and data that scientists use to understand climate’s effects on food security. In explains the nature of the climate threat. the ways in which crops and farmers might respond. and the potential role for public and private investment to help agriculture adapt to a warmer world. This broader understanding should prove useful to both scientists charged with quantifying climate threats. and policy-makers responsible for crucial decisions about how to respond.

Because the maximum possible yields achieved in farmers' fields might level off or even decline in many regions over the next few decades. reducing the gap between average and potential yields is critical. In most major irrigated wheat. rice. and maize systems. yields appear to be at or near 80% of yield potential. with no evidence for yields having exceeded this threshold to date. A fundamental constraint in these systems appears to be uncertainty in growing season weather; thus tools to address this uncertainty would likely reduce gaps.

Agriculture is rightly recognized as a source of considerable emissions. with concomitant opportunities for mitigation. Although future agricultural productivity is critical. as it will shape emissions from conversion of native landscapes to food and biofuel crops. investment in agricultural research is rarely mentioned as a mitigation strategy. Here we estimate the net effect on GHG emissions of historical agricultural intensification between 1961 and 2005.

As predictions from different models often disagree. understanding the sources of this divergence is central to building a more robust picture of climate change's likely impacts. A common approach is to use statistical models trained on historical yields and some simplified measurements of weather. such as growing season average temperature and precipitation.

Although yields have increased in absolute value under all levels of stress for both crops. the sensitivity of maize yields to drought stress associated with high vapor pressure deficits has increased.

Kendall. Mylenko. and Ponce (2010) obtain similar results using more recent data. While developing countries have only 28 percent as many bank accounts per adult as do developed countries. the figure in sub-Saharan Africa is far lower (only 16 percent).

But efforts to decrease one run the risk of increasing the other. Using rich experimental data on household treatment-seeking behavior in Kenya. we study the implications of this trade-off for subsidizing life-saving antimalarials sold over-the-counter at retail drug outlets. We show that a very high subsidy (such as the one under consideration by the international community) dramatically increases access. but nearly one-half of subsidized pills go to patients without malaria.

What’s more. social psychology suggests that asking individuals whether they plan to take an action that appears desirable (eg. invest in a health product) can make it more likely that they go through with it. Most people answer “yes.” and in so doing acquire an image of themselves (“self-perception”) that can then trigger them to go through with the action (Daryl Bem 1967). Based on this theory of self-perception. marketing specialists have designed what’s called the “foot-in-the-door” marketing technique. This consists in getting people to first agree to do something “easy” in relation to a product (for example. answer a few questions about what they think about it). before asking them if they want to buy it (Mark Snyder and Michael Cunningham 1975).

1218825,Peer effects. pupil-teacher ratios. and teacher incentives: Evidence from a randomized evaluation in Kenya,2007,Esther Duflo and Pascaline Dupas and Michael Kremer,,Unpublished manuscript,,,,This paper takes advantage of a randomized evaluation of a Kenyan program which provided school committees with funds to hire teachers locally on short term contracts in order to shed light on the impact of peers. pupil-teacher ratios. teacher incentive systems. and parental monitoring of teachers. A key finding is that peer quality and pupil-teacher ratios affect educational outcomes like test scores not only in a direct way but also through their impact on teacher behavior. In the context we examine. tracking students by initial academic achievement leads to large increases in learning for all students. contrary to standard models of peer effects in which students’ test scores increase with those of their classmates. Decentralized hiring of extra teachers on a contract basis does not lead to increases in test scores for students randomly assigned to remain with civil service teachers. despite the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios in their classes. but it does lead to large test score increases for students randomly assigned to contract teachers. These effects are intermediated by changes in teacher behavior. Locally-hired contract teachers are much less likely to be absent from the classroom than centrally-hired teachers with civil service protection. but locally hiring contract teachers in a school decreases classroom presence among civil service teachers. Increased parental supervision moderates this effect. however.The program we evaluate sought to address challenges created by the introduction of free primary education in Kenya and the associated influx of new pupils with varying levels of academic preparation.

We develop a smart charging framework to identify the benefits of non-residential EV charging to the load aggregators and the distribution grid. Using this extensive dataset. we aim to improve upon past studies focusing on the benefits of smart EV charging by relaxing the assumptions made in these studies regarding: (i) driving patterns. driver behavior and driver types; (ii) the scalability of a limited number of simulated vehicles to represent different load aggregation points in the power system with different customer characteristics; and (iii) the charging profile of EVs.

This baseline load profile (BLP) is key to accuratelyassessing the load impacts from event-based DR programs and may alsoimpact payment settlements for certain types of DR programs. We testedseven baseline models on a sample of 33 buildings located in California. These models can be loosely categorized into two groups:(1) averagingmethods. which use some linear combination of hourly load values fromprevious days to predict the load on the event. and (2) explicit weathermodels. which use a formula based on local hourly temperature to predictthe load.

Research results show that there is significant potential to reduce peak demand in commercial buildings through advanced control technologies and strategies. However. a better understanding of commercial building’s contribution to peak demand and the use of energy management and control systems is required to develop this demand response resource to its full potential. This paper discusses recent research results and new opportunities for advanced building control systems to provide demand response (DR) to improve electricity markets and reduce electric grid problems. The main focus of this paper is the role of new and existing control systems for HVAC and lighting in commercial buildings. A demand-side management framework from building operations perspective with three main features: daily energy efficiency. daily peak load management and event driven. dynamic demand response is presented. A general description of DR. its benefits. and nationwide potential in commercial buildings is outlined.

It compares resource requirements. limits to aggregation. measurement and verification. bidding requirements. market timelines. and the types of organizations that can play in the markets. Additionally. it uses market clearing prices and market size to compare what value may be extracted from these markets. and identifies how these prices are currently determined. Using these criteria.

1218846,Automated Critical Peak Pricing field tests: Program description and results,2006,Mary Ann Piette and David Watson and Naoya Motegi and Sila Kiliccote and Peng Xu,,,,,,1.1. BackgroundCalifornia utilities have been exploring the use of critical peak prices (CPP) to help reduce needle peaks in customer end-use loads. CPP is a form of price-responsive demand response. Recent experience has shown that customers have limited knowledge of how to operate their facilities in order to reduce their electricity costs under CPP (Quantum 2004). While the lack of knowledge about how to develop and implement DR control strategies is a barrier to participation in DR programs like CPP. another barrier is the lack of automation of DR systems. Most DR activities are manual and require building operations staff to first receive emails. phone calls. and pager signals; and second. to act on these signals to execute DR strategies. The various levels of DR automation can be defined as follows. Manual Demand Response involves a laborintensive approach such as manually turning off or changing comfort set points at each equipment switch or controller. Semi-Automated Demand Response involves a preprogrammed demand response strategy initiated by a person via centralized control system. Fully-Automated Demand Response does not involve human intervention. but is initiated at a home. building. or facility through receipt of an external communications signal. The receipt of the external signal initiates pre-programmed demand response strategies. We refer to this as Auto-DR. One important concept in Auto-DR is that a homeowner or facility manager should be able to—opt out “or—override “a DR event if the event comes at time when the reduction in end-use services is not desirable. Auto-CPP is a specific type of Auto …,True,xQ9Oj7QAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C,67,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7k70n055/qt7k70n055.pdf,18025887727963514226,/scholar?cites=18025887727963514226,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt7k70n055/qt7k70n055.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore. successful implementations of bilevel models rely largely on the development of an efficient algorithm in handling realistic complications. In spite of various intriguing attempts that were made in solving the bilevel models. these algorithms are unfortunately either incapable of finding the global optimum or very computationally intensive and impractical for problems of a realistic size. In this paper. a genetic-algorithms-based (GAB) approach is proposed to efficiently solve these models.

In addition to marginal social cost pricing (MSC) congestion pricing schemes are considered that yield a traffic flow distribution with minimum total travel time as first-best. We give a counterexample showing that MSC and other first-best congestion pricing schemes do not necessarily lead to less traffic emissions.

The models rely on exogenous inputs of reference points and thus the resulting reference-dependence could be regarded as an ad hoc assumption. This paper proposes a conjecture on travelers’ determination of reference points and encapsulates it into the prospect-based user equilibrium conditions. The conditions are formulated as an equivalent variational inequality and a heuristic solution algorithm is proposed to solve it. Both the model and the solution algorithm are demonstrated in two numerical examples. As one application. this paper further develops an optimal pricing model in which the proposed user equilibrium model is adopted to capture travelers’ response to pricing signals under risk. The pricing model is formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. solved by a derivative-free algorithm. Another numerical example is presented to illustrate the pricing model and the solution algorithm.© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

An approach to assess the performance reliability of road networks under nonrecurrent congestion is suggested. Nonrecurrent congestion can arise anywhere along the roadway; when it does arise. it suddenly reduces the capacity of the roadway and makes the traffic condition unstable.

Commuters are assumed to choose the path with minimal expected disutility.

1218883,Robust signal timing optimization with environmental concerns,2013,Lihui Zhang and Yafeng Yin and Shigang Chen,29,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,55-71,Pergamon,This paper formulates a bi-objective optimization model to determine timing plans for coordinated traffic signals along arterials to minimize traffic delay and the risk associated with human exposure to traffic emissions. Based on a cell-transmission representation of traffic dynamics. a modal sensitive emission approach is used to estimate the tailpipe emission rate for each cell of a signalized arterial. A cell-based Gaussian plume air dispersion model is then employed to capture the dispersion of air pollutants and compute the roadside pollutant concentrations. A measure of mean excess exposure is further defined to represent the risk associated with human exposure to traffic pollutants under the wind uncertainty. A signal timing optimization model is formulated to optimize the cycle length. offsets. green splits and phase sequences to minimize the total system delay and the mean excess exposure simultaneously …,True,GWXVM1cAAAAJ:_Ybze24A_UAC,97,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X13000053,16905581435180743921,/scholar?cites=16905581435180743921,,https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sgchen/Publications/ZYC13.pdf,0,0,0
1218884,Optimal design of autonomous vehicle zones in transportation networks,2017,Zhibin Chen and Fang He and Yafeng Yin and Yuchuan Du,99,Transportation Research Part B: Methodological,,44-61,Pergamon,This paper advocates the need for infrastructure planning to adapt to and further promote the deployment of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. It is envisioned that in the future government agencies will dedicate certain areas of road networks to AVs only to facilitate the formulation of vehicle platoons to improve throughput and hopefully improve the performance of the whole network. This paper aims to present a mathematical framework for the optimal design of AV zones in a general network. With the presence of AV zones. AVs may apply different routing principles outside of and within the AV zones. A novel network equilibrium model (we refer to it as the “mixed routing equilibrium model”) is thus firstly proposed to capture such mixed-routing behaviors. We then proceed to formulate a mixed-integer bi-level programming model to optimize the deployment plan of AV zones. Numerical examples are presented to …,True,GWXVM1cAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,94,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261516306178,1190199231444974527,/scholar?cites=1190199231444974527,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0191261516306178,0,0,0
