Here we show that the metabolic enzyme glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) is critical for TICs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TICs from primary NSCLC tumors express high levels of the oncogenic stem cell factor LIN28B and GLDC. which are both required for TIC growth and tumorigenesis. Overexpression of GLDC and other glycine/serine enzymes. but not catalytically inactive GLDC. promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. We found that GLDC induces dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine/serine metabolism. leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism to regulate cancer cell proliferation. In the clinic. aberrant activation of GLDC correlates with poorer survival in lung cancer patients. and aberrant GLDC expression is observed in multiple cancer types.

Here we have employed microarray analysis to study the temporal activity of developmentally regulated genes during zebrafish embryogenesis. Transcriptome analysis at 12 different embryonic time points covering five different developmental stages (maternal. blastula. gastrula. segmentation. and pharyngula) revealed a highly dynamic transcriptional profile. Hierarchical clustering. stage-specific clustering. and algorithms to detect onset and peak of gene expression revealed clearly demarcated transcript clusters with maximum gene activity at distinct developmental stages as well as co-regulated expression of gene groups involved in dedicated functions such as organogenesis. Our study also revealed a previously unidentified cohort of genes that are transcribed prior to the mid-blastula transition. a time point earlier than when the zygotic genome was traditionally thought to become active. Here we provide. for the first time to our knowledge. a comprehensive list of developmentally regulated zebrafish genes and their expression profiles during embryogenesis. including novel information on the temporal expression of several thousand previously uncharacterized genes.

The hypoxic-sensitive regulation of gene expression allows information about the oxygen status to be converted into appropriate cellular responses. Although there is a core transcriptional pathway. the signalling cascade can be modified to allow diversity and specificity in the transcriptional output.

Ltd.,The Wnt signaling pathway is necessary both for maintaining undifferentiated stem cells and for directing their differentiation. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Wnt signaling preferentially maintains “stemness” under certain permissive conditions. T‐cell factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs. Despite the wealth of knowledge regarding the importance of Wnt signaling underlying stem cells functions. the precise mechanistic explanation by which the effects are mediated is unknown. In this study. we identified new regulatory targets of Tcf3 using a whole‐genome approach and found that Tcf3 transcriptionally represses many genes important for maintaining pluripotency and self‐renewal. as well as those involved in lineage commitment and stem cell differentiation.

Here. we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression. including endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs). and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly. this leads to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stress and activation of type 1 interferon. which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. Furthermore. LSD1 depletion enhances tumor immunogenicity and T cell infiltration in poorly immunogenic tumors and elicits significant responses of checkpoint blockade-refractory mouse melanoma to anti-PD-1 therapy.

MiR-125b. the vertebrate homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans microRNA lin-4. has been implicated in the regulation of neural and hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis. analogous to how lin-4 regulates stem cells in C. elegans. Depending on the cell context. miR-125b has been proposed to regulate both apoptosis and proliferation. Because the p53 network is a central regulator of both apoptosis and proliferation. the dual roles of miR-125b raise the question of what genes in the p53 network might be regulated by miR-125b. By using a gain- and loss-of-function screen for miR-125b targets in humans. mice. and zebrafish and by validating these targets with the luciferase assay and a novel miRNA pull-down assay. we demonstrate that miR-125b directly represses 20 novel targets in the p53 network. These targets include both apoptosis regulators like Bak1. Igfbp3. Itch. Puma. Prkra. Tp53inp1. Tp53. Zac1. and also cell-cycle regulators like cyclin C. Cdc25c. Cdkn2c. Edn1. Ppp1ca. Sel1l. in the p53 network. We found that. although each miRNA–target pair was seldom conserved. miR-125b regulation of the p53 pathway is conserved at the network level. Our results lead us to propose that miR-125b buffers and fine-tunes p53 network activity by regulating the dose of both proliferative and apoptotic regulators. with implications for tissue stem cell homeostasis and oncogenesis.,True,-NB-480AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,157,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002242,6235575242323104004,/scholar?cites=6235575242323104004,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002242,0,0,0

In the first activation of p53 in tumor cells can promote apoptosis and senescence and enhance the anti-tumor activity of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. In the second application activation of p53 in normal tissues can cause a reversible cell cycle arrest that can be used to protect normal cells from the action of anti-mitotics. In this cyclotherapy role p53 mutant tumor cells are not arrested and remain sensitive to anti-mitotics. The advent of specific p53 activating molecules such as nutlin-3 has encouraged both approaches. We have sought for a clinically approved drug that can mimic nutlin-3.

Lung ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury is the inciting event in acute lung failure following transplantation. surgery. and shock. To study the function of HO-1 in I-R-induced lung injury. we designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences that effectively suppress HO-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo in an organ-specific manner. In this study we show that there is enhanced apoptosis. via increased Fas expression and caspase 3 activity. in the presence of HO-1 siRNA in endothelial cells and mouse …,True,7eV19QgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,321,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817477283,1398430180684030466,/scholar?cites=1398430180684030466,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817477283,0,0,0

Since bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and heme a pro-oxidant. HO may protect cells against oxidative damage. HO-1 is highly inducible by diverse chemical agents. resembling those evoking induction of phase 2 enzymes (i.e.. Michael reaction acceptors. heavy metals. trivalent arsenicals. and sulfhydryl reagents). Phase 2 enzymes (glutathione transferases; NAD(P)H:quinone reductase; glucuronosyltransferases) are regulated by antioxidant-responsive elements (ARE). and their induction protects against chemical carcinogenesis. Is HO-1 regulated by chemical agents and enhancer elements similar to those controlling phase 2 enzymes? Induction of HO-1 by phorbol ester and heavy metals is transcriptionally controlled through a 268-bp SX2 fragment. containing two phorbol ester-responsive (TRE) sites (TGAC/GT C/AA) which overlap ARE consensus sequences (TGACNNNGC). Therefore. mutations of the SX2 element designed to distinguish ARE from TRE were inserted into chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmids. and the response of the CAT activity of murine hepatoma cells stably transfected with these constructs was examined with a wide range of inducers of phase 2 enzymes. All compounds raised HO-1 mRNA and CAT expression constructs containing wild-type SX2. When the SX2 region was mutated to alter TRE consensus sequences without destroying the ARE consensus. full inducibility was preserved. Conversely. when the ARE consensus was disturbed. inducibility was abolished …,True,7eV19QgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,309,https://molmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/BF03401897,12505141566906697170,/scholar?cites=12505141566906697170,,https://molmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/BF03401897,0,0,0

There is. however. growing evidence that posttranslational modification of histones is a dynamic process that shows many correlations with gene expression. Here we have followed the genome-wide distribution of two important histone H3 modifications. H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 during late mouse retina development. The retina provides an ideal model for these studies because of its well-characterized structure and development and also the extensive studies of the retinal transcriptome and its development. We found that a group of genes expressed only in mature rod photoreceptors have a unique signature consisting of de-novo accumulation of H3K4me2. both at the transcription start site (TSS) and over the whole gene. that correlates with the increase in transcription. but no accumulation of H3K27me3 at any stage. By in silico analysis of this unique signature we have identified a larger group of genes that may be selectively expressed in mature rod photoreceptors. We also found that the distribution of H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 on the genes widely expressed is not always associated with their transcriptional levels. Different histone signatures for retinal genes with the same gene expression pattern suggest the diversities of epigenetic regulation. Genes without H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 accumulation at any stage represent a large group of transcripts never expressed in retina.

Antimonene. i.e. 2D Sb monolayer. is demonstrated to be stable and semiconducting. and is the recently proposed cousin of phosphorene. In this study. β-antimonene nanosheets were exfoliated using liquid-phase exfoliation assisted by sonication. The step heights of antimonene nanosheets were around 5–16.5 nm.

Defining the molecular phylogeny of PEDF by bioinformatic analysis is one approach to understanding the link between its gene structure and its function in these biological processes. From a comprehensive search of available DNA databases we identified a single PEDF gene in all vertebrate species examined. These included four mammalian and six non-mammalian vertebrate species in which PEDF had not previously been described. A five gene cluster around PEDF was found in an approximate 100 kb region in mammals. birds. and amphibians. In ray-finned fish these genes are scattered over three chromosomes although only one PEDF gene was consistently found. The PEDF gene is absent in invertebrates including Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). and sea squirt (C. intestinalis). The PEDF gene is transcribed in all vertebrate phyla. suggesting it is biologically active throughout vertebrate evolution. The multiple actions of PEDF are likely conserved in evolution since it has the same gene structure across phyla. although the size of the gene ranges from 48.3 kb in X. tropicalis to 2.9 kb in fugu. with human PEDF at a size of 15.6 kb. A strong similarity in the proximal 200 bp of the PEDF promoter in mammals suggests the existence of a possible regulatory region across phyla.

In this study. we have integrated computational bioinformatics and microarray experimental approaches to classify the tissue specificity and developmental distribution of mouse retina transcripts. We have classified a set of retina-specific genes using sequence-based screening integrated with computational and retina tissue-specific microarray approaches. 33.737 non-redundant sequences were identified as retina transcript clusters (RTCs) from more than 81.000 mouse retina ESTs. We estimate that about 19.000 to 20.000 genes might express in mouse retina from embryonic to adult stages. 39.1% of the RTCs are not covered by 60.770 RIKEN full-length cDNAs. Through comparison with 2 million mouse ESTs. spectra of neural. retinal. late-generated retinal. and photoreceptor -enriched RTCs have been generated. More than 70% of these RTCs have data from biological experiments confirming their tissue-specific expression pattern.

Elevated FFA concentrations are linked with the onset of peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance and. while the precise action in the liver remains unclear. a model to explain the role of raised FFA in the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance has recently been put forward. Over 30 years ago. Randle proposed that FFA compete with glucose as the major energy substrate in cardiac muscle. leading to decreased glucose oxidation when FFA are elevated. Recent data indicate that high plasma FFA also have a significant role in contributing to insulin resistance. Elevated FFA and intracellular lipid appear to inhibit insulin signalling. leading to a reduction in insulin‐stimulated muscle glucose transport that …,True,k6z6wAwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1651,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2362.32.s3.3.x,15109276999036642608,/scholar?cites=15109276999036642608,,,0,0,0

Short term fat feeding (FF) caused a ∼3-fold increase in liver triglyceride and total fatty acyl-CoA content without any significant increase in visceral or skeletal muscle fat content. Suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) by insulin was diminished in the FF group. despite normal basal EGP and insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose disposal. Hepatic insulin resistance could be attributed to impaired insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. These changes were associated with activation of PKC-ϵ and JNK1.

Expression of appetite or the motivational drive toward an energy source is a highly regulated phenomenon in vertebrates. It is considered a cornerstone for maintenance of energy homeostasis and for rigidly guarding the body weight around a set point. Abnormalities in the onset. periodicity. duration. and magnitude of eating episodes generally underlie augmented appetite (1–3). Increased appetite. whether temporary. as seen clinically in transient bingeing. or permanent. invariably culminates in an increased rate of body weight gain and obesity (1. 4–6). On the other hand. anorexia due to psychobiological causes (7. 8) or in response to acute and chronic infections. inflammation. and trauma is followed by severe loss of body weight (9–11). There is now a growing recognition that expression of appetite is chemically coded in the hypothalamus (1. 12). A perceived corollary is that subtle and progressive derangement in this neurochemical signaling. produced by environmental. genetic. and hormonal factors. impels either hyperphagia or anorexia (1).

The strategy employs ‘βTail’tags. which allow for good protein expression in bacteriological cultures. yet can be induced to co-assemble into nanomaterials when mixed with additional β-sheet fibrillizing peptides. Multiple different βTail fusion proteins could be inserted into peptide nanofibres alone or in combination at predictable. smoothly gradated concentrations. providing a simple yet versatile route to install precise combinations of proteins into nanomaterials.

Microvascular endothelial cells at a site of inflammation are both active participants in and regulators of inflammatory processes. The properties of endothelial cells change during the transition from acute to chronic inflammation and during the transition from innate to adaptive immunity.

The morphologic definition of activation from the 1960s has been replaced by a cell biologic definition in the 1980s. but recent studies have suggested that these phenomena are two aspects of the same processes. Moreover. the initial distinction of endothelial cell activation. a beneficial reaction. from injury and dysfunction. a harmful sequence. has become more complex as clinical studies have revealed that activation can produce dysfunction. with or without injury.

In contrast. the lipid raft-caveolar internalization pathway contains the Smad7-Smurf2 bound receptor and is required for rapid receptor turnover.

We now identify SARA (for S mad a nchor for r eceptor a ctivation). a FYVE domain protein that interacts directly with Smad2 and Smad3. SARA functions to recruit Smad2 to the TGFβ receptor by controlling the subcellular localization of Smad2 and by interacting with the TGFβ receptor complex. Phosphorylation of Smad2 induces dissociation from SARA with concomitant formation of Smad2/Smad4 complexes and nuclear translocation. Furthermore. mutations in SARA that cause mislocalization of Smad2 inhibit TGFβ-dependent transcriptional responses. indicating that the regulation of Smad localization is important for TGFβ signaling.

However. because of their highly reactive nature. anthocyanins are unstable. We developed a novel strategy for improving the thermal stability and photostability of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) molecules by encapsulating them within the inner cavity of apo recombinant soybean seed H-2 subunit ferritin (rH-2). C3G molecules were successfully encapsulated within protein cages with a C3G/protein ratio of 37.5 to 1. As expected. such encapsulation increased the thermal stability and photostability of C3G molecules by a factor of ~ 2. More importantly.

Lactate racemase (Lar) requires nickel. but the nickel-binding site and the role of three accessory proteins required for its activation remain enigmatic. We combined mass spectrometry and x-ray crystallography to show that Lar from Lactobacillus plantarum possesses an organometallic nickel-containing prosthetic group. A nicotinic acid mononucleotide derivative is tethered to Lys184 and forms a tridentate pincer complex that coordinates nickel through one metal-carbon and two metal-sulfur bonds. with His200 as another ligand.

Phytoferritin represents a novel alternative for iron supplementation.

However. proteins. carriers of biological functions in living systems. have not yet been fully explored as building blocks for the construction of MOFs. This work presents a strategy for the fabrication of binary MOFs.

Materials and Methods A comprehensive review of the literature from Pubmed. Web of Science and Scopus was performed in October 2013. All relevant studies comparing RPN with OPN were included for further screening. A cumulative meta-analysis of all comparative studies was performed and publication bias was assessed by a funnel plot.  Results Eight studies were included for the analysis. including a total of 3418 patients (757 patients in the robotic group and 2661 patients in the open group). Although RPN procedures had a longer operative time (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 40.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 14.39–67.40; p = 0.002). patients in this group benefited from a lower perioperative complication rate (19.3% for RPN and 29.5% for OPN; odds ratio [OR]: 0.53; 95%CI. 0.42–0.67; p<0.00001). shorter hospital stay (WMD: −2.78; 95%CI. −3.36 to −1.92; p<0.00001). less estimated blood loss(WMD: −106.83; 95%CI. −176.4 to −37.27; p = 0.003). Transfusions. conversion to radical nephrectomy. ischemia time and estimated GFR change. margin status. and overall cost were comparable between the two techniques. The main limitation of the present meta-analysis is the non-randomization of all included studies.

The signal sequence coding region (SSCR) can support an alternative mRNA export (ALREX) pathway that does not require splicing. However. most SSCR–containing genes also have introns. so the interplay between these export mechanisms remains unclear. Here we support a model in which the furthest upstream element in a given transcript. be it an intron or an ALREX–promoting SSCR. dictates the mRNA export pathway used. We also experimentally demonstrate that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes can use the ALREX pathway. Thus. ALREX can also be supported by nucleotide signals within mitochondrial-targeting sequence coding regions (MSCRs). Finally. we identified and experimentally verified novel motifs associated with the ALREX pathway that are shared by both SSCRs and MSCRs. Our results show strong correlation between 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) intron presence/absence and sequence features at the beginning of the coding region.

We use isotachophoresis (ITP) with an ionic spacer and a sieving matrix to enable size-selection with a high yield of RNA in the target size range. The spacer zone separates two concentrated ITP peaks. the first containing unwanted single nucleotides and the second focusing RNA of the target size range (2–35 nt). Our ITP method excludes >90% of single nucleotides and >65% of longer RNAs (>35 nt). Compared to size selection using gel electrophoresis. ITP-based size-selection yields a 2.2-fold increase in the amount of extracted RNAs within the target size range.

However. the positional distributions of coding mutations. and the 79% of somatic variants in exome data that do not alter protein sequence or RNA splicing. remain largely unstudied. We employed density-based clustering methods on ∼4.700 exomes from 21 tumor types to detect variably-sized significantly mutated regions (SMRs). SMRs reveal recurrent alterations across a diverse spectrum of coding and non-coding elements. including microRNAs. transcription factor binding sites. and untranslated regions that are individually mutated in up to ∼15% of samples in specific cancer types. SMRs often associated with changes in gene expression and signalling. Mapping SMRs to protein structures revealed spatial clustering of somatic mutations at known and novel cancer-driver domains and molecular interfaces. Mutation frequencies in SMRs demonstrate that distinct protein regions are differentially mutated among tumor types.

Here. we report the first RNA expression and splicing analysis from a family whose members carry a non-canonical splice variant in an intron of RPL11 (c.396+3A>G). This mutation is causative for Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) in this family despite incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Our analyses revealed a complex pattern of disruptions with many novel junctions of RPL11. These include an RPL11 transcript that is translated with a late stop codon in the 39 untranslated region (39UTR) of the main isoform. We observed that RPL11 transcript abundance is comparable among carriers regardless of symptom severity. Interestingly. both the small and large ribosomal subunit transcripts were significantly overexpressed in individuals with a history of anemia in addition to congenital abnormalities. Finally. we discovered that coordinated expression between mitochondrial components and RPL11 was lost in all carriers. which may lead to variable expressivity.

By using a bicistronic vector. it was shown that the 5′ UTR of the poliovirus (PV) or the Encephalomyelitis virus (EMCV) had the ability to bind the 43S preinitiation complex in a 5′ and cap-independent manner.

The poly(A) tail has also been shown to stimulate translation of picornavirus internal ribosome entry sites (IRES)-directed translation. These effects have been attributed principally to interactions between eIF4G and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) but also to the participation of PABP in other steps during translation initiation. As the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) does not recapitulate this cap/poly(A) synergy. several systems based on cellular cell-free extracts have been developed to study the effects of poly(A) tail              in vitro              but they generally exhibit low translational efficiency.

In this process. the RNA-induced silencing complex interacts both with PABP and the 43S pre-initiation complex to disrupt scanning of the 40S ribosome. However. in some specific cases. miRNAs can stimulate translation. Although the mechanism of miRNA-mediated upregulation is unknown. it appears that the poly(A) tail and the lack of availability of the TNRC6 proteins are amongst major determinants.

This can be particularly burdensome when modeling large sets of interactions. macromolecular assemblies. or interactions between flexible proteins. We previously developed a protein docking program. ZDOCK. which uses a fast Fourier transform to perform a 3D search of the spatial degrees of freedom between two molecules. By utilizing a pairwise statistical potential in the ZDOCK scoring function. there were notable gains in docking accuracy over previous versions. but this improvement in accuracy came at a substantial computational cost. In this study. we incorporated a recently developed 3D convolution library into ZDOCK. and additionally modified ZDOCK to dynamically orient the input proteins for more efficient convolution. These modifications resulted in an average of over 8.5-fold improvement in running time when tested on 176 cases in a newly released protein docking benchmark. as well as substantially less memory usage. with no loss in docking accuracy. We also applied these improvements to a previous version of ZDOCK that uses a simpler non-pairwise atomic potential. yielding an average speed improvement of over 5-fold on the docking benchmark. while maintaining predictive success.

Here we present evidence that the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle of the SF1 helicase Upf1 is required for mRNA discrimination during nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Mutations affecting the Upf1 ATPase cycle disrupt the mRNA selectivity of Upf1. leading to indiscriminate accumulation of NMD complexes on both NMD target and non-target mRNAs. In addition. two modulators of NMD—translation and termination codon-proximal poly(A) binding protein—depend on the ATPase activity of Upf1 to limit Upf1-non-target association.

We tested the hypothesis that transcriptional pausing is an obligate transition state between definitive activation and silencing as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) change state from pluripotency to mesoderm. Chromatin immunoprecipitation for trimethyl lysine 4 on histone H3 (ChIP-Chip) was used to analyze transcriptional initiation. and 3′ transcript arrays were used to determine transcript elongation. Pluripotent and mesodermal cells had equivalent fractions of the genome in active and paused transcriptional states (∼48% each). with ∼4% definitively silenced (neither initiation nor elongation). Differentiation to mesoderm changed the transcriptional state of 12% of the genome. with roughly equal numbers of genes moving toward activation or silencing. Interestingly. almost all loci (98–99%) changing transcriptional state do so either by entering or exiting the paused state. A majority of these transitions involve either loss of initiation. as genes specifying alternate lineages are archived. or gain of initiation. in anticipation of future full-length expression. The addition of chromatin dynamics permitted much earlier predictions of final cell fate compared to sole use of conventional transcript arrays. These findings indicate that the paused state may be the major transition state for genes changing expression during differentiation. and implicate control of transcriptional elongation as a key checkpoint in lineage specification.,True,zvv-JG8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,15,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022416,10546132761537114726,/scholar?cites=10546132761537114726,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022416,0,0,0

To compare AS events across human tissues. we analyzed the splicing patterns of genomically aligned expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from libraries of cDNAs from different tissues. Controlling for differences in EST coverage among tissues. we found that the brain and testis had the highest levels of exon skipping. The most pronounced differences between tissues were seen for the frequencies of alternative 3' splice site and alternative 5' splice site usage. which were about 50 to 100% higher in the liver than in any other human tissue studied. Quantifying differences in splice junction usage. the brain. pancreas. liver and the peripheral nervous system had the most distinctive patterns of AS.

We generated multiple iPSC lines from an FTD/ALS patient with the TARDBP A90V mutation and from an unaffected family member who lacked the mutation. After extensive characterization. two to three iPSC lines from each subject were selected. differentiated into postmitotic neurons. and screened for relevant cell-autonomous phenotypes. Patient-derived neurons were more sensitive than control neurons to 100 nM straurosporine but not to other inducers of cellular stress. Three disease-relevant cellular phenotypes were revealed under staurosporine-induced stress. First.

Third. the levels of microRNA-9 (miR-9) and its precursor pri-miR-9-2 decreased in patient neurons but not in control neurons.

While the former has been studied extensively. to what extent translation occurs on monosomes and its importance for overall translational output remain controversial.

They describe systems throughout all levels of biological organization. from molecules regulating metabolism to species interactions that shape ecosystem dynamics. The network thinking revealed recurrent organizational patterns in complex biological systems. such as the formation of semi-independent groups of connected elements (modularity) and non-random distributions of interactions among elements. Other structural patterns. such as nestedness. have been primarily assessed in ecological networks formed by two non-overlapping sets of elements; information on its occurrence on other levels of organization is lacking. Nestedness occurs when interactions of less connected elements form proper subsets of the interactions of more connected elements. Only recently these properties began to be appreciated in one-mode networks (where all elements can interact) which describe a much wider variety of biological phenomena. Here. we compute nestedness in a diverse collection of one-mode networked systems from six different levels of biological organization depicting gene and protein interactions. complex phenotypes. animal societies. metapopulations. food webs and vertebrate metacommunities.

By using conditional knockdown. we have shown previously that yeast Nip7p is required primarily for 60S subunit synthesis while human NIP7 is involved in the biogenesis of 40S subunit. This raised the possibility that human NIP7 interacts with a different set of proteins as compared to the yeast protein. By using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified FTSJ3. a putative ortholog of yeast Spb1p. as a human NIP7-interacting protein. A functional association between NIP7 and FTSJ3 is further supported by colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Conditional knockdown revealed that depletion of FTSJ3 affects cell proliferation and causes pre-rRNA processing defects. The major pre-rRNA processing defect involves accumulation of the 34S pre-rRNA encompassing from site A′ to site 2b. Accumulation of this pre-rRNA indicates that processing of sites A0. 1 and 2 are slower in cells depleted of FTSJ3 and implicates FTSJ3 in the pathway leading to 18S rRNA maturation as observed previously for NIP7. The results presented in this work indicate a close functional interaction between NIP7 and FTSJ3 during pre-rRNA processing and show that FTSJ3 participates in ribosome synthesis in human cells.,True,dGiROqsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,27,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029174,5010706473916255185,/scholar?cites=5010706473916255185,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029174,0,0,0

Despite extensive studies on the eukaryotic exosome and on the proteins interacting with this complex. little information is yet available on the identification and function of archaeal exosome regulatory factors. Here. we show that the proteins PaSBDS and PaNip7. which bind preferentially to poly-A and AU-rich RNAs. respectively. affect the Pyrococcus abyssi exosome activity in vitro. PaSBDS inhibits slightly degradation of a poly-rA substrate. while PaNip7 strongly inhibits the degradation of poly-A and poly-AU by the exosome. The exosome inhibition by PaNip7 appears to depend at least partially on its interaction with RNA. since mutants of PaNip7 that no longer bind RNA. inhibit the exosome less strongly. We also show that FITC-labeled PaNip7 associates with the exosome in the absence of substrate RNA.

Specific conserved sequences in premature transcripts are important to recruit the spliceosome machinery. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalytic spliceosome is composed of about 60 proteins and 5 snRNAs (U1. U2. U4/U6 and U5). Among these proteins. there are core components and regulatory factors. which might stabilize or facilitate splicing of specific substrates. Assembly of a catalytic complex depends on the dynamics of interactions between these proteins and RNAs. Cwc24p is an essential S. cerevisiae protein. originally identified as a component of the NTC complex. and later shown to affect splicing in vivo. In this work. we show that Cwc24p also affects splicing in vitro. We show that Cwc24p is important for the U2 snRNP binding to primary transcripts. co-migrates with spliceosomes. and that it interacts with Brr2p. Additionally. we show that Cwc24p is important for the stable binding of Prp19p to the spliceosome.

At the same time. the network has a modular structure with groups of proteins sharing similar interaction patterns.

Many of these rearrangements involve successive strengthening and weakening of different RNA∶RNA and RNA∶proteins interactions within the complex. To gain insight into the organization of the catalytic core of the spliceosome arrested between the two steps of splicing chemistry (C complex). we investigated the effects of exposing C complex to low concentrations of urea. We find that in the presence of 3M urea C complex separates into at least three sub-complexes. One sub-complex contains the 5′exon. another contains the intron-lariat intermediate. and U2/U5/U6 snRNAs likely comprise a third sub-complex. We purified the intron-lariat intermediate sub-complex and identified several proteins. including U2 snRNP and PRP19 complex (NTC) components. The data from our study indicate that U2 snRNP proteins in C complex are more stably associated with the lariat-intron intermediate than the U2 snRNA.

Mais de 170 fatores atuam de forma transitória no processamento dos precursores para gerar os rRNAs maduros que formarão as subunidades ribossomais no citoplasma. Entre as proteínas envolvidas na síntese de ribossomos está a Nip7p. uma proteína nucleolar de 21 kDa associada ao complexo pré-60S em Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nip7p é conservada e possui ortólogas em eucariotos e em Archaea. A análise da seqüência primária revela a presença de um domínio conservado na região C-terminal. denominado PUA. encontrado em diversas proteínas associadas a modificações no RNA. Neste trabalho. foram realizadas análises estruturais e funcionais com o objetivo de investigar a função molecular da proteína Nip7 no processamento e modificação do rRNA. A estrutura tri-dimensional de PaNip7. ortóloga de Nip7p em Pyrococcus abyssi foi resolvida por difração de raios-X até 1.8Å de resolução. utilizando o método SIRAS. Comparação estrutural seguida por ensaios in vitro confirmaram o envolvimento do domínio PUA na interação com RNA.

The efficient processing of rRNAs is therefore an essential step for achieving successful translation. This process involves a large number of factors. estimated to be approximately 150 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

1222442,Interaction pathways promote spliceosome module integration and network-level robustness to cascading effects,,Paulo R Guimarães Jr and Mathias M Pires and Maurício Cantor and Patricia P Coltri,,,,,,Biological systems are organized as networks. A central problem in the study of biological networks is to understand if and how the network structure affects the fragility of biological systems to multiple types of perturbations. For example. the functionality and fragility of protein networks may depend on their network structure. and mutations and other errors may generate cascading effects that. in turn. lead to system malfunctioning. Spectral graph theory studies the structural and dynamical properties of a system based on the mathematical properties of matrices associated with the networks. providing tools. which can reveal the fragility of biological networks to cascading effects. We combined two of such tools to explore the fragility to cascading effects of the network describing protein interactions within a key macromolecular complex. the S. cerevisiae spliceosome. The spliceosome network shows a higher number of indirect pathways connecting proteins than expected for random networks. The multiplicity of pathways may promote routes to cascading effects to propagate across the network. However. analytical results derived from the spectral graph theory and numerical simulations of a minimal mathematical model suggest that the modular structure of the spliceosome network constrains the propagation of cascading effects due to the concentration of pathways within modules. We hypothesize that the concentration of pathways within modules favors robustness of the spliceosome against failure but may lead to a higher vulnerability of functional subunits. which may affect the temporal assembly of the spliceosome.

Important reasons include the lack of antibodies or reporter constructs to visualise these proteins. Here. we present a genome-wide fosmid library of 10000 GFP-tagged clones. comprising tagged genes and most of their regulatory information. For 880 tagged proteins. we created transgenic lines. and for a total of 207 lines. we assessed protein expression and localisation in ovaries. embryos. pupae or adults by stainings and live imaging approaches. Importantly. we visualised many proteins at endogenous expression levels and found a large fraction of them localising to subcellular compartments. By applying genetic complementation tests. we estimate that about two-thirds of the tagged proteins are functional. Moreover. these tagged proteins enable interaction proteomics from developing pupae and adult flies.

We find that the pattern of adult myotubes is prefigured by a pattern of duf-lacZ-expressing myoblasts at appropriate locations. Selective expression of duf-lacZ in single myoblasts emerges from generalized. low-level expression in all adult myoblasts during the third larval instar. The number of founders. thus chosen. corresponds to the number of fibres in a muscle. In contrast to the embryo. the selection of individual adult founder cells during myogenesis does not depend on Notch-mediated lateral inhibition.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,During metazoan development the ongoing process of cell-fate specification channels cells to distinct fates. Once committed. cellular ensembles exhibit tightly coordinated sequences of morphogenetic activities that collectively contribute towards forming the final structure of the organism. These activities involve a wide variety of cell behaviors: individual cells may change shape. divide. or migrate to different areas. entire tissue layers can spread across a surface or fold up to form a three-dimensional structure. A better understanding of such cellular behaviors can be obtained by simply watching them as they occur in a living. unperturbed organism. This forms the basis of the real-time imaging study that is fast becoming a powerful technique for comprehending cellular dynamics.The advent of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its engineered and mutagenized variants as viable cellular markers has greatly facilitated non–invasive imaging in different biological systems (Chalfie and Kain. 1998; Tsien and Prasher. 1998). In Drosophila. GFP expressed by fusing it downstream of promoter elements has been used to study tissue morphology (eg. Hazelrigg. 1998; van Roessel and Brand. 2002). However. GFP driven by a ubiquitously expressed promoter/enhancer is not useful for imaging tissues buried deep within the organism and use of a tissue-specific promoter/enhancer restricts study to a particular tissue type. The Gal4-UAS system circumvents these problems and enables fluorescence labeling of desired tissue types by crossing UAS-GFP to appropriate Gal4 drivers (Brand and Perrimon. 1993; Brand et al.. 1994).

We demonstrate that these myoblasts already show distinctive properties and examine how this diversity is generated. In the late larva. Vestigial and low levels of Cut are expressed in myoblasts that will contribute to the indirect flight muscles. Other myoblasts. which express high levels of Cut but no Vestigial. are required for the formation of the direct flight muscles. Vestigial and Cut expression are stabilized by a mutually repressive feedback loop. Vestigial expression begins in the embryo in a subset of adult myoblasts. and Wingless signaling is required later to maintain this expression.

1222459,Patterning Muscles Using Organizers: Larval Muscle Templates and Adult Myoblasts Actively Interact to Pattern the Dorsal Longitudinal Flight Muscles of Drosophila ,1998,Sudipto Roy and K VijayRaghavan,141,The Journal of cell biology,5,1135-1145,The Rockefeller University Press,Pattern formation in muscle development is often mediated by special cells called muscle organizers. During metamorphosis in Drosophila. a set of larval muscles function as organizers and provide scaffolding for the development of the dorsal longitudinal flight muscles. These organizers undergo defined morphological changes and dramatically split into templates as adult fibers differentiate during pupation. We have investigated the cellular mechanisms involved in the use of larval fibers as templates. Using molecular markers that label myoblasts and the larval muscles themselves. we show that splitting of the larval muscles is concomitant with invasion by imaginal myoblasts and the onset of differentiation. We show that the Erect wing protein. an early marker of muscle differentiation. is not only expressed in myoblasts just before and after fusion. but also in remnant larval nuclei during muscle differentiation.

This method was used to screen for cDNA clones corresponding to RNAs expressed in the Drosophila head that cannot be detected in the early embryo. RNA blots were used to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of these RNAs. The ensemble of 436 head-not-embryo clones identified roughly 700 distinct RNAs that are differentially expressed in the Drosophila head. The RNA expression patterns can be classified into five major categories. It is argued that this ensemble of clones represents a large fraction of all genes differentially expressed in the adult head. but not detected in the early embryo.

Altering intrinsic homeotic identities of myoblasts does not affect their segment-specific migration patterns. By transplanting meso - and metathoracic myoblasts into the abdomen. we demonstrate that the fusion abilities of myoblasts are independent of their segmental identities. However. transplanted thoracic myoblast nuclei are ‘entrained’ by those of the host abdominal muscles to which they fuse and are unable to ‘switch on’ a thoracic muscle-specific reporter gene. This process is likely to be mediated by homeotic repression because mis-expression of an abdominal muscle-specific homeotic gene.

In vertebrates. spinal networks regulate locomotion. while the brainstem controls movements of respiration and feeding. Similarly. amongst invertebrates diversification of appendages along the body axis is tied to the performance of characteristically different movements such as those required for feeding. locomotion. and respiration. Such movements require locally specialized networks of nerves and muscles. Here we use the regionally differentiated movements of larval crawling in Drosophila to investigate how the formation of a locally specialized locomotor network is genetically determined.

By using conditional knockdown. we have shown previously that yeast Nip7p is required primarily for 60S subunit synthesis while human NIP7 is involved in the biogenesis of 40S subunit. This raised the possibility that human NIP7 interacts with a different set of proteins as compared to the yeast protein. By using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified FTSJ3. a putative ortholog of yeast Spb1p. as a human NIP7-interacting protein. A functional association between NIP7 and FTSJ3 is further supported by colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation analyses. Conditional knockdown revealed that depletion of FTSJ3 affects cell proliferation and causes pre-rRNA processing defects. The major pre-rRNA processing defect involves accumulation of the 34S pre-rRNA encompassing from site A′ to site 2b. Accumulation of this pre-rRNA indicates that processing of sites A0. 1 and 2 are slower in cells depleted of FTSJ3 and implicates FTSJ3 in the pathway leading to 18S rRNA maturation as observed previously for NIP7.

Prior to induction. IκBα retains NF-κB in the cytoplasm until the NF-κB activation signal is received. After activation. NF-κB is removed from gene promoters through association with nuclear IκBα. restoring the preinduction state. The 2.3 Å crystal structure of IκBα in complex with the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer reveals mechanisms of these inhibitory activities. The presence of IκBα allows large en bloc movement of the NF-κB p65 subunit amino-terminal domain. This conformational change induces allosteric inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding.

1222517,Understanding the logic of IκB: NF-κB regulation in structural terms,2010,Tom Huxford and Alexander Hoffmann and Gourisankar Ghosh,,,,1-24,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor that controls expression of diverse stress response genes. The entire mammalian NF-κB family is generated from a small cadre of five gene products that assemble with one another in various combinations to form active homo- and heterodimers. The ability of NF-κB to alter target gene expression is regulated at many levels. Chief among these regulatory mechanisms is the noncovalent association in the cell cytoplasm of NF-κB dimers with IκB inhibitor proteins. Removal of IκB leads to accumulation of active NF-κB within the cell nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences contained within the promoter regions of target genes and initiates recruitment of general transcription factors and assembly of the basal transcription machinery. Here we provide a detailed description of these fundamental NF-κB regulatory events using as a basis macromolecular structures …,True,4_rk2AIAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,22,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/82_2010_99,9922365240833479006,/scholar?cites=9922365240833479006,,https://biocircuits.ucsd.edu/pubs/articles/Huxford11.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. we build upon the observation that highly purified human IKKβ subunit preparations retain this specificity in vitro. We show that IKKβ constructs that lack their carboxy-terminus beginning at the leucine zipper motif fail to phosphorylate IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36. Rather. these constructs. which contain the entire IKKβ subunit kinase domain. phosphorylate serine and threonine residues contained within the IκBα carboxy-terminal PEST region. Furthermore. removal of the leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix regions converts IKKβ to monomer.

One major class of primary response genes is characterized by CpG-island promoters. which facilitate promiscuous induction from constitutively active chromatin without a requirement for SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complexes. The low nucleosome occupancy at promoters in this class can be attributed to the assembly of CpG islands into unstable nucleosomes. which may lead to SWI/SNF independence. Another major class consists of non-CpG-island promoters that assemble into stable nucleosomes. resulting in SWI/SNF dependence and a requirement for transcription factors that promote selective nucleosome remodeling.

Ltd,The splicing of mRNA requires a group of essential factors known as SR proteins. which participate in the maturation of the spliceosome. These proteins contain one or two RNA recognition motifs and a C‐terminal domain rich in Arg‐Ser repeats (RS domain). SR proteins are phosphorylated at numerous serines in the RS domain by the SR‐specific protein kinase (SRPK) family of protein kinases. RS domain phosphorylation is necessary for entry of SR proteins into the nucleus. and may also play important roles in alternative splicing. mRNA export. and other processing events. Although SR proteins are polyphosphorylated in vivo. the mechanism underlying this complex reaction has only been recently elucidated.

1222575,The superfamily of arginine/serine-rich splicing factors.,1995,XIANG-DONG Fu,1,,7,663,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,INTRODUCTION Pre-messenger RNA splicing requires small ribonucleo-protein particles (snRNPs) and non-snRNP proteins. These factors are assembled onto pre-mRNA in an or-derly fashion to form spliceosomes in which the splicing reaction takes place. This review focuses on a family of protein factors containing an arginine-and serine-rich (RS) domain. These proteins have been identified both as speciﬁc splicing regulators and as essential splicing factors that function in early steps of spliceosome assembly. Many of these factors can modulate splice site selection. and may therefore play a key role in the regulation of gene expression at the level of RNA processing.,True,FfEWiUkAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,862,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1369309/,6398032864273746843,/scholar?cites=6398032864273746843,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1369309/pdf/7585252.pdf,0,0,0

However. nicotinamide's impact often cannot be attributed to its nutritional functions. In a vitamin screen. we find that nicotinamide promotes cell survival and differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells. Nicotinamide inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin light chain. suppresses actomyosin contraction. and leads to improved cell survival after individualization. Further analysis demonstrates that nicotinamide is an inhibitor of multiple kinases. including ROCK and casein kinase 1. We demonstrate that nicotinamide affects human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation as a selective kinase inhibitor.

The CD28 response element (CD28RE) in the IL-2 enhancer is nonameric and similar to the κB DNA target sites recognized by p65 homodimers.Results: We have determined and refined the X-ray crystal structure of the c-Rel homodimer complexed to the CD28RE DNA site. 5′-AGAAATTCC-3′. to 2.85 Å resolution. The c-Rel homodimer binds CD28RE in a mode similar to that observed in the p65/IL-8 κB crystallographic complex. Binding studies reveal that the c-Rel homodimer recognizes the CD28RE with higher affinity as compared to other canonical κB sequences despite the nonconsensus A:T base pair at the 5′ end of the CD28RE.

TRPV1. a channel responsible for the burning pain sensation in response to heat. acid or capsaicin. is desensitized at high intracellular calcium concentrations.

Matriptase has been implicated in the degradation of certain extracellular matrix components as well as the activation of various cellular proteins and proteases. including hepatocyte growth factor and urokinase. Sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1 (SFTI-1). a cyclic peptide inhibitor originally isolated from sunflower seeds. exhibits potent inhibitory activity toward matriptase. We have engineered and produced recombinant proteins of the matriptase protease domain. and have determined the crystal structures of the protease:SFTI-1 complex at 2.0 Å as well as the protease:benzamidine complex at 1.2 Å. These structures elaborate the structural basis of substrate selectivity of matriptase. and show that the matriptase S1 substrate specificity pocket is larger enough to allow movement of benzamidine inside the S1 pocket. Our study also reveals that SFTI-1 binds to matriptase in a way similar to its binding to trypsin despite the significantly different isoelectric points of the two proteins (5.6 vs. 8.2). This work helps to define the structural basis of substrate specificity of matriptase and the interactions between the inhibitor and protease.

Cre recombinase is an integrase family member that recombines 34 bp loxP sites in the absence of accessory proteins or auxiliary DNA sequences. The 2.7 Å structure of Cre recombinase bound to an immobile HJ and the 2.5 Å structure of Cre recombinase bound to a symmetric. nicked HJ reveal a nearly planar. twofold‐symmetric DNA intermediate that shares features with both the stacked‐X and the square conformations of the HJ that exist in the unbound state. The structures support a protein‐mediated crossover isomerization of the junction that acts as the switch responsible for activation and deactivation of recombinase active …,True,ShJkuiYAAAAJ:u_35RYKgDlwC,327,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/17.14.4175,13901759632017498152,/scholar?cites=13901759632017498152,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1093/emboj/17.14.4175,0,0,0

Members of this family. which include the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase. bacteriophage lambda integrase. the yeast Flp recombinase. and the bacterial XerCD recombinases. exchange strands between DNA substrates in a stepwise process. One pair of strands is exchanged to form a Holliday junction intermediate. and the second pair of strands is exchanged during resolution of the junction to products. Crystal structures of reaction intermediates in the Cre-loxP site-specific recombination system. together with recent biochemical studies in the field. support a “strand swapping” model for recombination that does not require branch migration of the Holliday junction intermediate in …,True,ShJkuiYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,323,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.biophys.30.1.87,5400400218338311857,/scholar?cites=5400400218338311857,,,0,0,0

At the start of the recombination pathway. the loxP sites are each bound by two recombinase molecules. and synapsis of the sites is mediated by Cre–Cre interactions. We describe the structures of synaptic complexes formed between a symmetrized loxP site and two Cre mutants that are defective in strand cleavage. The DNA in these complexes is bent sharply at a single base pair step at one end of the crossover region in a manner that is atypical of protein-induced DNA bends. A large negative roll (−49°) and a positive tilt (16°) open the major groove toward the center of the synapse and compress the minor groove toward the protein–DNA interface.

To understand specificity. we solved the crystal structure of the helical motif from D-AKAP2. a dual-specific AKAP. bound to the RIIα D/D domain.

The flexible N terminus of one protomer is then recruited to the site. anchored to the peptide through two essential isoleucines. The other N terminus is disordered.

A Wiley Company,Control of structural flexibility is essential for the proper functioning of a large number of proteins and multiprotein complexes. At the residue level. such flexibility occurs due to local relaxation of peptide bond angles whose cumulative effect may result in large changes in the secondary. tertiary or quaternary structures of protein molecules. Such flexibility. and its absence. most often depends on the nature of interdomain linkages formed by oligopeptides. Both flexible and relatively rigid peptide linkers are found in many multidomain proteins. Linkers are thought to control favorable and unfavorable interactions between adjacent domains by means of variable softness furnished by their primary sequence. Large‐scale structural heterogeneity of multidomain proteins and their complexes. facilitated by soft peptide linkers. is now seen as the norm rather than the exception.

Polypharmacology. which focuses on multi-target drugs. has emerged as a new paradigm in drug discovery. The rational design of drugs that act via polypharmacological mechanisms can produce compounds that exhibit increased therapeutic potency and against which resistance is less likely to develop. Additionally. identifying multiple protein targets is also critical for side-effect prediction. One third of potential therapeutic compounds fail in clinical trials or are later removed from the market due to unacceptable side effects often caused by off-target binding. In the current work. we introduce a multidimensional strategy for the identification of secondary targets of known small-molecule inhibitors in the absence of global structural and sequence homology with the primary target protein. To demonstrate the utility of the strategy. we identify several targets of 4.5-dihydroxy-3-(1-naphthyldiazenyl)-2.7-naphthalenedisulfonic acid. a known micromolar inhibitor of Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing ligase 1.

Many proteins in the cell are unfolded. so folding and function are coupled. This paper investigates how binding kinetics is influenced by the folding of a protein.

In this scenario of binding. the unfolded state binds weakly at a relatively large distance followed by folding as the protein approaches the binding site: the “fly-casting mechanism.” We illustrate this scenario with the hypothetical kinetics of binding a single repressor molecule to a DNA site and find that the binding rate can be significantly enhanced over the rate of binding of a fully folded protein.,True,hd1j2w0AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,996,https://www.pnas.org/content/97/16/8868.short,10589023360842891416,/scholar?cites=10589023360842891416,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/97/16/8868.full.pdf,0,0,0

The increase in macrophage miR-126–3p levels was not prevented by actinomycin D. suggesting that it was not due to de novo gene transcription. Platelet MPs dose-dependently downregulated expression of four predicted mRNA targets of miR-126–3p. two of which were confirmed also at the protein level. The mRNA downregulatory effects of platelet MPs were abrogated by expression of a neutralising miR-126–3p sponge. implying the involvement of miR-126–3p.

Here. we investigated whether levels of anti-PLA2R correlate with the immunological activity of membranous nephropathy. potentially exhibiting a more rapid response to treatment than clinical parameters such as proteinuria. We measured the amount of anti-PLA2R using Western blot immunoassay in serial serum samples from a total of 35 patients treated with rituximab for membranous nephropathy in two distinct cohorts. Pretreatment samples from 25 of 35 (71%) patients contained anti-PLA2R. and these autoantibodies declined or disappeared in 17 (68%) of these patients within 12 months after rituximab.

We studied a family with hereditary persistent AF and identified the causative mutation (S140G) in the KCNQ1 (KvLQT1) gene on chromosome 11p15.5.

The transient activation of Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel provokes an hyperpolarization of the membrane. It is followed by a sustained depolarization which is due to the opening of a non-specific cation channel which is permeable to Ca2+ and Mg2+. The depolarization then activates L-type Ca2+ channels.

We now recognize that MN is an organ-specific autoimmune disease in which circulating autoantibodies bind to an intrinsic antigen on glomerular podocytes and form deposits of immune complexes in situ in the glomerular capillary walls. Here we define the clinical and pathological features of MN and describe the experimental models that enabled the discovery of the major target antigen. the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R).

Studies in Heymann nephritis. an experimental model of MN. have established a paradigm in which these deposits locally activate complement to cause podocyte injury. culminating in cytoskeletal reorganization. loss of slit diaphragms. and proteinuria. There is much circumstantial evidence for a prominent role of complement in human MN because C3 and C5b-9 are found consistently within immune deposits.

The recent identification of circulating autoantibodies directed towards the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) has been a major advancement in the serological diagnosis of idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN). a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. The goal of this study was to compare the performance characteristics of two commercial assays as well as the first addressable laser bead immunoassay (ALBIA) developed for the detection of anti-PLA2R antibodies. Methods. Serum samples of 157 IMN patients and 142 controls were studied. Samples were tested by a cell based immunofluorescence assay (CBA-IFA. Euroimmun. Germany). by ELISA (Euroimmun). and by a novel ALBIA employing an in vivo expressed recombinant human PLA2R. Results. Overall. the three assays showed significant qualitative and quantitative correlation. As revealed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. the ALBIA correlated better with the CBA-IFA than the ELISA (                                           ).

To identify candidate tumor suppressors we applied CRISPR/Cas9 gene inactivation screens to a cellular model of early-stage SCLC. Among the top hits was MAX. the obligate heterodimerization partner for MYC family proteins that is mutated in human SCLC. Max deletion increases growth and transformation in cells and dramatically accelerates SCLC progression in an Rb1/Trp53-deleted mouse model. In contrast. deletion of Max abrogates tumorigenesis in MYCL-overexpressing SCLC. Max deletion in SCLC resulted in derepression of metabolic genes involved in serine and one-carbon metabolism. By increasing serine biosynthesis. Max-deleted cells exhibit resistance to serine depletion. Thus. Max loss results in metabolic rewiring and context-specific tumor suppression.,True,DjmiIB4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,3,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610820302154,9320548377740406543,/scholar?cites=9320548377740406543,,,0,0,0

However. the effect of mitogenic growth factor on cellular senescence is so far largely unknown. Here we show that normal human dermal fibroblasts display a complex response to Platelet derived growth factor B (PDGFB) expression. Indeed. PDGFB expression induces. in the same cell population. both senescence and cellular transformation. Remarkably both populations are sustained with passages suggesting that transformed cells eventually enter a senescent state.

CDT is an AB 2 toxin. where the CdtA and CdtC subunits are required to mediate the binding on the surface of the target cells. allowing internalization of the active CdtB subunit. which is functionally homologous to the mammalian deoxyribonuclease I. The nature of the surface receptor is still poorly characterized. however binding of CDT requires intact lipid rafts. and its internalization occurs via dynamin-dependent endocytosis. The toxin is retrograde transported through the Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum. and subsequently translocated into the nuclear compartment. where it exerts the toxic activity. Cellular intoxication induces DNA damage and activation of the DNA damage responses. which results in arrest of the target cells in the G1 and/or G2 phases of the cell cycle and activation of DNA repair mechanisms. Cells that fail to repair the damage will senesce or undergo apoptosis.

Sequencing of TCR Vα and Vβ chains and alanine scanning mutagenesis analysis of 83 CTL clones isolated in five reactivation experiments demonstrated that this repertoire is composed of at least four distinct CTL clonotypes that are constantly reactivated from donor’s blood and express structurally heterogeneous TCRs. Target cell recognition and CD8 blocking experiments indicate that the four clonotypes possess different avidity and TCR affinity for the specific Ag. This demonstrates that at least in some individuals a heterogeneous peptide-specific memory CTL repertoire selected by a persistent Ag can be remarkably stable in time and accommodate a range of TCR affinities and T cell avidities.

The consequence of intoxication or infection is induction of DNA breaks that. if not properly repaired. results in irreversible cell cycle arrest (senescence) or death of the target cells. At present. only three bacterial genotoxins have been identified. Two are protein toxins: the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) family produced by a number of Gram-negative bacteria and the typhoid toxin produced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The third member. colibactin. is a peptide-polyketide genotoxin. produced by strains belonging to the phylogenetic group B2 of Escherichia coli. This review will present the cellular effects of acute and chronic intoxication or infection with the genotoxins-producing bacteria. The carcinogenic properties and the role of these effectors in the context of the host-microbe interaction will be discussed. We will further highlight the open questions that remain to be solved regarding the biology of this unusual family of bacterial toxins.

Ltd,Cytolethal distending toxin. produced by several Gram‐negative bacteria. and colibactin. secreted by several commensal and extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli strains. are the first bacterial genotoxins to be described to date. Exposure to cytolethal distending toxin and colibactin induces DNA damage. and consequently activates the DNA damage response. resulting in cell cycle arrest of the intoxicated cells and DNA repair. Irreversible DNA damage will lead to cell death by apoptosis or to senescence. It is well established that chronic exposure to DNA damaging agents. either endogenous (reactive oxygen species) or exogenous (ionizing radiation). may cause genomic instability as a result of the alteration of genes coordinating the DNA damage response. thus favoring tumor initiation and progression.

In response to genotoxic agents. cells overexpressing MYC undergo apoptosis. However. the MYC-regulated effectors acting upstream of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway are still unknown.  Principal Findings In this study. we demonstrate that expression of Myc is required to activate the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage checkpoint responses in rat cell lines exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) or the bacterial cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). Phosphorylation of the ATM kinase and its downstream effectors. such as histone H2AX. were impaired in the myc null cell line HO15.19. compared to the myc positive TGR-1 and HOmyc3 cells. Nuclear foci formation of the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (Nbs) 1 protein. essential for efficient ATM activation. was also reduced in absence of myc. Knock down of the endogenous levels of MYC by siRNA in the human cell line HCT116 resulted in decreased ATM and CHK2 phosphorylation in response to irradiation. Conversely. cell death induced by UV irradiation. known to activate the ATR-dependent checkpoint. was similar in all the cell lines. independently of the myc status.  Conclusion These data demonstrate that MYC contributes to the activation of the ATM-dependent checkpoint responses. leading to cell death in response to specific genotoxic stimuli.,True,wfh7298AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,59,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008924,18306918404859340111,/scholar?cites=18306918404859340111,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008924,0,0,0

(ii) poor peptide translocation into the ER lumen or (iii) inefficient maturation and transport of the MHC‐peptide complexes at the cell surface.

While the responses induced in the host cells have been extensively studied in vitro. the role of these effectors during the course of infection remains poorly characterized. To address this issue. we assessed the effects of the Salmonella enterica genotoxin. known as typhoid toxin. in in vivo models of murine infection. Immunocompetent mice were infected with isogenic S. enterica. serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) strains. encoding either a functional or an inactive typhoid toxin. The presence of the genotoxic subunit was detected 10 days post-infection in the liver of infected mice. Unexpectedly. its expression promoted the survival of the host. and was associated with a significant reduction of severe enteritis in the early phases of infection. Immunohistochemical and transcriptomic analysis confirmed the toxin-mediated suppression of the intestinal inflammatory response. The presence of a functional typhoid toxin further induced an increased frequency of asymptomatic carriers. Our data indicate that the typhoid toxin DNA damaging activity increases host survival and favours long-term colonization. highlighting a complex cross-talk between infection.

However. as a result of Env variability disappointing results have been obtained in preclinical and phase III clinical trials. Although the objective of a preventive immunity still remains a priority. secondary endpoints (e.g. block of virus replication and disease onset) are being considered at the present as more achievable end-points in HIV vaccine development. This is based on accumulating evidence indicating that low viral load correlates with maintenance of immune functions and slow progression to disease. and that cell-mediated immunity plays a major protective role in the absence of sterilizing immunity.

However. the pleiotropic functions of TFAP2A and its redundantly-acting paralogs have made the precise contribution of TFAP2-type activity to melanocyte differentiation unclear. Defining this contribution may help to explain why TFAP2A expression is reduced in advanced-stage melanoma compared to benign nevi. To identify genes with TFAP2A-dependent expression in melanocytes. we profile zebrafish tissue and mouse melanocytes deficient in Tfap2a. and find that expression of a small subset of genes underlying pigmentation phenotypes is TFAP2A-dependent. including Dct. Mc1r. Mlph. and Pmel. We then conduct TFAP2A ChIP-seq in mouse and human melanocytes and find that a much larger subset of pigmentation genes is associated with active regulatory elements bound by TFAP2A. These elements are also frequently bound by MITF. which is considered the “master regulator” of melanocyte development. For example. the promoter of TRPM1 is bound by both TFAP2A and MITF. and we show that the activity of a minimal TRPM1 promoter is lost upon deletion of the TFAP2A binding sites. However. the expression of Trpm1 is not TFAP2A-dependent. implying that additional TFAP2 paralogs function redundantly to drive melanocyte differentiation. which is consistent with previous results from zebrafish. Paralogs Tfap2a and Tfap2b are both expressed in mouse melanocytes. and we show that mouse embryos with Wnt1-Cre-mediated deletion of Tfap2a and Tfap2b in the neural crest …,True,5KdL1LcAAAAJ:yZoBfgUKqwcC,35,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006636&rev=1,5335298870878254450,/scholar?cites=5335298870878254450,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006636&rev=1,0,0,0

About 60% of the cases displayed nuclear p53 overexpression as revealed by immunostaining with PAb1801. PAb122 and PAb240 monoclonal antibodies. This phenomenon was associated with the presence of structural and/or transcriptional alterations of the p53 gene. Our results provide evidence that p53 abnormalities constitute the most frequent genetic alteration identified so far in LSCC and indicate that the abnormal accumulation of the protein correlates with the presence of p53-mutated versions.

HHV-6 variant characterization was carried out in 10 HT FNA samples. determining that all specimens harbored HHV-6 Variant A. The tropism of HHV-6 for thyroid cells was verified by infection of Nthy-ori3-1. a thyroid follicular epithelial cell line. showing that thyrocytes are permissive to HHV-6 replication. which induces de novo expression of HLA class II antigens. Furthermore. HHV-6-infected Nthy-ori3-1 cells become targets for NK-mediated killing. NK cells from HT patients show a significantly more efficient killing of HHV-6 infected thyroid cells than healthy controls. and HT patients have increased T-cell responses to HHV-6 U94 protein. associated to viral latency.

The Ku70 DNA end-joining protein has recently been shown to suppress apoptosis by sequestering Bax from mitochondria. The mechanism by which Bax is regulated remains unknown. Here. we identify eight lysines in Ku70 that are targets for acetylation in vivo. Five of these. K539. K542. K544. K533. and K556. lie in the C-terminal linker domain of Ku70 adjacent to the Bax interaction domain. We show that CBP and PCAF efficiently acetylate K542 in vitro and associate with Ku70 in vivo. Mimicking acetylation of K539 or K542 or treating cells with deacetylase inhibitors abolishes the ability of Ku70 to suppress Bax-mediated apoptosis.

Trx80 induces differentiation of human monocytes into a novel cell type. named Trx80-activated-monocytes (TAMs).   Principal Findings In this investigation we present evidence for a role of TAMs in the control of intracellular bacterial infections. As model pathogens we have chosen Listeria monocytogenes and Brucella abortus which replicate in the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum respectively. Our data indicate that TAMs efficiently inhibit intracellular growth of both L. monocytogenes and B. abortus. Further analysis shows that Trx80 activation prevents the escape of GFP-tagged L. monocytogenes into the cytosol. and induces accumulation of the bacteria within the lysosomes. Inhibition of the lysosomal activity by chloroquine treatment resulted in higher replication of bacteria in TAMs compared to that observed in control cells 24 h post-infection. indicating that TAMs kill bacteria by preventing their escape from the endosomal compartments. which progress into a highly degradative phagolysosome.

Here we have characterized the chromatin interaction of GMPs encoded by viruses belonging to the genera Lymphocryptovirus (LCV) and Rhadinovirus (RHV). We found that. in addition to a similar diffuse nuclear localization and comparable detergent resistant interaction with chromatin in transfected cells. all GMPs shared the capacity to promote the decondensation of heterochromatin in the A03-1 reporter cell line. They differed. however. in their mobility measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). and in the capacity to recruit accessory molecules required for the chromatin remodeling function. While the AT-hook containing GMPs of LCVs were highly mobile. a great variability was observed among GMPs encoded by RHV. ranging from virtually immobile to significantly reduced mobility compared to LCV GMPs. Only the RHV GMPs recruited the bromo- and extra terminal domain (BET) proteins BRD2 and BRD4 to the site of chromatin remodeling.

Proteins that enter the cell from the extracellular milieu (such as receptor-mediated endocytosed proteins) are degraded in lysosomes. Lysosomal degradation of intracellular proteins occurs mostly under stressed conditions. Nonlysosomal mechanisms are responsible for the highly selective turnover of intracellular proteins that occurs under basal metabolic conditions. but also for some aspects of degradation of intracellular proteins under stress. An important nonlysosomal proteolytic pathway is the ubiquitin system in which proteins are degraded by a 26s protease complex following conjugation by multiple molecules of ubiquitin.

In addition. modifications by ubiquitin-like proteins as well as proteins containing ubiquitin-interacting and -associated motifs modulate many others. This tightly controlled process involves multiple specific and general enzymes of the system as well as many modifying and ancillary proteins. Thus. it is not surprising that ubiquitin-mediated degradation/processing/modification regulates a broad array of basic cellular processes. Moreover. aberrations in the system have been implicated. either as a primary cause or secondary consequence. in the pathogenesis of both inherited and acquired neurodegenerative diseases.

Analysis of the ratio of APF-1 to lysozyme radioactivities and of the molecular weights of the bands indicated that they consist of increasing numbers of the APF-1 polypeptide bound to one molecule of lysozyme.

Inc.,The ubiquitin proteolytic system plays an important role in a broad array of basic cellular processes. Among these are regulation of cell cycle. modulation of the immune and inflammatory responses. control of signal transduction pathways. development and differentiation. These complex processes are controlled via specific degradation of a single or a subset of proteins. Degradation of a protein by the ubiquitin system involves two successive steps. conjugation of multiple moieties of ubiquitin and degradation of the tagged protein by the 26S proteasome. An important question concerns the identity of the mechanisms that underlie the high degree of specificity of the system. Substrate recognition is governed by a large family ubiquitin ligases that recognize the substrates. bind them and catalyze/facilitate their interaction with ubiquitin.

Relative to PBL. the percentage of natural killer (NK) cells among fresh TIL was reduced. while a higher proportion of T cells expressing HLA‐DR was found. As previously reported. we found significantly reduced levels of the CD3‐ and CD 16‐associated ζ chain in TIL and. to a lesser extent. also in patients' PBL. Levels of ζ chain in T and NK cells from non‐cancerous colorectal tissue from patients were lower than in PBL but higher than in TIL. with a direct relationship between levels of this signal‐transducing molecule and the distance from …,True,bpj7NDkAAAAJ:yFnVuubrUp4C,237,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijc.2910610605,12550447143383103593,/scholar?cites=12550447143383103593,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46762221/ijc.291061060520160624-29222-s25qo4.pdf,0,0,0
1223287,Natural killer cells in the mouse: an alternative immune surveillance mechanism?,1978,Rolf Kiessling and Otto Haller,,,,171-201,Springer. Boston. MA,During thelast 10 years thenumber of effector cell types active in growth inhibition or cytolysis of tumor cells has steadily increased. Although theimportance of immune T cells in tumor rejection. measured by cytolytic or cyto-static activity in vitro. is firmly established. there is an increasing amount of evidence showing that tumor resistance also could be mediated by non-T-cell-dependent mechanisms. Some of these alternatives to T-cell cytotoxicity involve tumor killing by activated macrophages (Keller. 1976) or by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Perlmann et al. 1972) carried out by a variety of nonimmune effector cells. The phenomenon of natural cell-mediated immunity to be discussed in this article will add further to thecomplexity of this field.

We used peptide-pulsed autologous DC from the ascites of patients with ovarian carcinomas to induce CTL. Of the 22 tested new HER2/neu-derived epitopes that could bind HLA-A2 with high (IC50 < 50 nM) or intermediate (50 nM < IC50 < 500 nM) affinity. we report the recognition by CTL of at least four novel epitopes. including HER2(9435).

This facilitates the T cell receptor–mediated recognition by CD8+ T cells but decreases target cell sensitivity to lysis by NK cells due to engagement of inhibitory NK receptors. In this study. short-term tumor cell lines from patients with advanced ovarian carcinomas were established. We demonstrate the paradoxical finding that IFN-γ treatment of these short-term ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OVACs) resulted in resistance of tumor cells to lysis by peptide- and allospecific CD8+ T cells. Blocking experiments revealed that this phenomenon was dependent on enhanced inhibitory signalling via CD94/NKG2A receptors expressed on the effector cells.

It has been shown that bacteria populating the gut microbiota can release significant amounts of amyloids and lipopolysaccharides. which might play a role in the modulation of signaling pathways and the production of proinflammatory cytokines related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Additionally. nutrients have been shown to affect the composition of the gut microbiota as well as the formation and aggregation of cerebral amyloid-β.

In this study. the antioxidant and anti-aging activities of a polyphenol-rich strawberry extract were evaluated using human dermal fibroblasts exposed to H 2 O 2. Firstly. the phenol and flavonoid contents of strawberry extract were studied. as well as the antioxidant capacity. HPLC-DAD analysis was performed to determine the vitamin C and β-carotene concentration. while HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS analysis was used for anthocyanin identification. Strawberry extract presented a high antioxidant capacity. and a relevant concentration of vitamins and phenolics. Pelargonidin-and cyanidin-glycosides were the most representative anthocyanin components of the fruits. Fibroblasts incubated with strawberry extract and stressed with H 2 O 2 showed an increase in cell viability. a smaller intracellular amount of ROS. and a reduction of membrane lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Strawberry extract was also able to improve mitochondrial functionality. increasing the basal respiration of mitochondria and to promote a regenerative capacity of cells after exposure to pro-oxidant stimuli. These findings confirm that strawberries possess antioxidant properties and provide new insights into the beneficial role of strawberry bioactive compounds on protecting skin from oxidative stress and aging.

The aim of the present study was to examine the phytochemical content and the antioxidant activity of Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) honey (STH) and its cytotoxic properties against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-116) and metastatic (LoVo) cell lines in comparison with Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey (MH). Several unifloral STH and MH were analyzed for their phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein contents. as well as their radical scavenging activities. STH from the Berchidda area showed the highest amount of phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein content. and antioxidant capacity compared to MH. Both STH and MH induced cytotoxicity and cell death in a dose-and time-dependent manner in HCT-116 and LoVo cells. with less toxicity on non-cancer cells. Compared to MH. STH showed more effect at lower concentrations on HCT-116 and LoVo cells. In addition. both honeys increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In HCT-116 cells. STH and MH induced similar ROS production but in LoVo cells STH induced a higher percentage of ROS compared to MH. Our results indicate that STH and MH can induce cell growth inhibition and ROS generation in colon adenocarcinoma and metastatic cells. which could be due to the presence of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties.

Among them. cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality. In general. preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset. In this sense. a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs. such as cancer and CVDs. Traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of cancers and CVDs. where olive oil plays an important role. In fact. different epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil consumption prevents some cancers. as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality. Historically. the beneficial health effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids. Nowadays. many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in olive oil have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health. Among them. phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits. The present work aims to explore. in studies published during the last five years. the effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from olive oil on different cancer or CVD aspects. in order to clarify which compounds have more potential to be used as nutraceuticals with preventive or even therapeutic properties.

Data confirmed that liver. skeletal muscle. and heart have different capabilities to adapt their membrane composition to dietary fatty acids. the heart being the most resistant to changes. Such specificity affects membrane hydroperoxide levels that depend on the type of dietary fats and the rate of fatty acid incorporation into the membrane. Sedentary rats fed a monounsaturated fatty acid-rich diet (virgin olive oil) showed a higher protection of their mitochondrial membranes against peroxidation than sedentary rats fed a polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich diet (sunflower oil).

Numerous epidemiological studies indicate that diets rich in fruit. such as berries. provide significant health benefits against several types of cancer. including colon cancer. The anticancer activities of berries are attributed to their high content of phytochemicals and to their relevant antioxidant properties. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that berries and their bioactive components exert therapeutic and preventive effects against colon cancer by the suppression of inflammation. oxidative stress. proliferation and angiogenesis. through the modulation of multiple signaling pathways such as NF-κB. Wnt/β-catenin. PI3K/AKT/PKB/mTOR. and ERK/MAPK. Based on the exciting outcomes of preclinical studies. a few berries have advanced to the clinical phase.

1223378,Polyphenol-rich strawberry extract protects human dermal fibroblasts against hydrogen peroxide oxidative damage and improves mitochondrial functionality,2014,Francesca Giampieri and José M Alvarez-Suarez and Luca Mazzoni and Tamara Y Forbes-Hernandez and Massimiliano Gasparrini and Ana M Gonzàlez-Paramàs and Celestino Santos-Buelga and José L Quiles and Stefano Bompadre and Bruno Mezzetti and Maurizio Battino,19,Molecules,6,7798-7816,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Strawberry bioactive compounds are widely known to be powerful antioxidants. In this study. the antioxidant and anti-aging activities of a polyphenol-rich strawberry extract were evaluated using human dermal fibroblasts exposed to H 2 O 2. Firstly. the phenol and flavonoid contents of strawberry extract were studied. as well as the antioxidant capacity. HPLC-DAD analysis was performed to determine the vitamin C and β-carotene concentration. while HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS analysis was used for anthocyanin identification. Strawberry extract presented a high antioxidant capacity. and a relevant concentration of vitamins and phenolics. Pelargonidin-and cyanidin-glycosides were the most representative anthocyanin components of the fruits. Fibroblasts incubated with strawberry extract and stressed with H 2 O 2 showed an increase in cell viability. a smaller intracellular amount of ROS. and a reduction of membrane lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Strawberry extract was also able to improve mitochondrial functionality. increasing the basal respiration of mitochondria and to promote a regenerative capacity of cells after exposure to pro-oxidant stimuli. These findings confirm that strawberries possess antioxidant properties and provide new insights into the beneficial role of strawberry bioactive compounds on protecting skin from oxidative stress and aging.

It has been demonstrated that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a direct impact on lipid metabolism by modulating several downstream-signaling components. The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the in vitro effect of a methanolic strawberry extract on AMPK and its possible repercussion on lipid metabolism in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). For such purpose. the lipid profile and the expression of proteins metabolically related to AMPK were determined on cells lysates. The results demonstrated that strawberry methanolic extract decreased total cholesterol. low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. and triglycerides levels (up to 0.50-. 0.30-. and 0.40-fold. respectively) while it stimulated the p-AMPK/AMPK expression (up to 3.06-fold). compared to the control. AMPK stimulation led to the phosphorylation and consequent inactivation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). the major regulators of fatty acids and cholesterol synthesis. respectively.

The aim of the present study was to examine the phytochemical content and the antioxidant activity of Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) honey (STH) and its cytotoxic properties against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-116) and metastatic (LoVo) cell lines in comparison with Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey (MH). Several unifloral STH and MH were analyzed for their phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein contents. as well as their radical scavenging activities. STH from the Berchidda area showed the highest amount of phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein content. and antioxidant capacity compared to MH. Both STH and MH induced cytotoxicity and cell death in a dose-and time-dependent manner in HCT-116 and LoVo cells. with less toxicity on non-cancer cells. Compared to MH. STH showed more effect at lower concentrations on HCT-116 and LoVo cells. In addition. both honeys increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In HCT-116 cells. STH and MH induced similar ROS production but in LoVo cells STH induced a higher percentage of ROS compared to MH. Our results indicate that STH and MH can induce cell growth inhibition and ROS generation in colon adenocarcinoma and metastatic cells. which could be due to the presence of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. These preliminary results are interesting and suggest a potential chemopreventive action which could be useful for further studies in order to develop chemopreventive agents for colon cancer.

Among them. cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality. In general. preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset. In this sense. a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs. such as cancer and CVDs. Traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of cancers and CVDs. where olive oil plays an important role. In fact. different epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil consumption prevents some cancers. as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality. Historically. the beneficial health effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids. Nowadays. many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in olive oil have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health. Among them. phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits.

In this study. the antioxidant and anti-aging activities of a polyphenol-rich strawberry extract were evaluated using human dermal fibroblasts exposed to H 2 O 2. Firstly. the phenol and flavonoid contents of strawberry extract were studied. as well as the antioxidant capacity. HPLC-DAD analysis was performed to determine the vitamin C and β-carotene concentration. while HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS analysis was used for anthocyanin identification. Strawberry extract presented a high antioxidant capacity. and a relevant concentration of vitamins and phenolics. Pelargonidin-and cyanidin-glycosides were the most representative anthocyanin components of the fruits. Fibroblasts incubated with strawberry extract and stressed with H 2 O 2 showed an increase in cell viability. a smaller intracellular amount of ROS. and a reduction of membrane lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Strawberry extract was also able to improve mitochondrial functionality. increasing the basal respiration of mitochondria and to promote a regenerative capacity of cells after exposure to pro-oxidant stimuli.

It has been demonstrated that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a direct impact on lipid metabolism by modulating several downstream-signaling components. The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the in vitro effect of a methanolic strawberry extract on AMPK and its possible repercussion on lipid metabolism in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). For such purpose. the lipid profile and the expression of proteins metabolically related to AMPK were determined on cells lysates. The results demonstrated that strawberry methanolic extract decreased total cholesterol. low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. and triglycerides levels (up to 0.50-. 0.30-. and 0.40-fold. respectively) while it stimulated the p-AMPK/AMPK expression (up to 3.06-fold). compared to the control. AMPK stimulation led to the phosphorylation and consequent inactivation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR). the major regulators of fatty acids and cholesterol synthesis. respectively. Strawberry treatment also entailed a 4.34-. 2.37-. and 2.47-fold overexpression of LDL receptor. sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). respectively. compared to control.

The aim of the present study was to examine the phytochemical content and the antioxidant activity of Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) honey (STH) and its cytotoxic properties against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-116) and metastatic (LoVo) cell lines in comparison with Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey (MH). Several unifloral STH and MH were analyzed for their phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein contents. as well as their radical scavenging activities. STH from the Berchidda area showed the highest amount of phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein content. and antioxidant capacity compared to MH. Both STH and MH induced cytotoxicity and cell death in a dose-and time-dependent manner in HCT-116 and LoVo cells. with less toxicity on non-cancer cells. Compared to MH. STH showed more effect at lower concentrations on HCT-116 and LoVo cells. In addition. both honeys increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In HCT-116 cells. STH and MH induced similar ROS production but in LoVo cells STH induced a higher percentage of ROS compared to MH. Our results indicate that STH and MH can induce cell growth inhibition and ROS generation in colon adenocarcinoma and metastatic cells. which could be due to the presence of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. These preliminary results are interesting and suggest a potential chemopreventive action which could be useful for further studies in order to develop chemopreventive agents for colon cancer.

Among them. cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality. In general. preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset. In this sense. a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs. such as cancer and CVDs. Traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of cancers and CVDs. where olive oil plays an important role. In fact. different epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil consumption prevents some cancers. as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality. Historically. the beneficial health effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids. Nowadays. many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in olive oil have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health. Among them. phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits. The present work aims to explore. in studies published during the last five years. the effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from olive oil on different cancer or CVD aspects. in order to clarify which compounds have more potential to be used as nutraceuticals with preventive or even therapeutic properties.

In this study. the antioxidant and anti-aging activities of a polyphenol-rich strawberry extract were evaluated using human dermal fibroblasts exposed to H 2 O 2. Firstly. the phenol and flavonoid contents of strawberry extract were studied. as well as the antioxidant capacity. HPLC-DAD analysis was performed to determine the vitamin C and β-carotene concentration. while HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS analysis was used for anthocyanin identification. Strawberry extract presented a high antioxidant capacity. and a relevant concentration of vitamins and phenolics. Pelargonidin-and cyanidin-glycosides were the most representative anthocyanin components of the fruits. Fibroblasts incubated with strawberry extract and stressed with H 2 O 2 showed an increase in cell viability. a smaller intracellular amount of ROS. and a reduction of membrane lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Strawberry extract was also able to improve mitochondrial functionality. increasing the basal respiration of mitochondria and to promote a regenerative capacity of cells after exposure to pro-oxidant stimuli. These findings confirm that strawberries possess antioxidant properties and provide new insights into the beneficial role of strawberry bioactive compounds on protecting skin from oxidative stress and aging.

It has been demonstrated that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has a direct impact on lipid metabolism by modulating several downstream-signaling components. The main objective of the present work was to evaluate the in vitro effect of a methanolic strawberry extract on AMPK and its possible repercussion on lipid metabolism in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). For such purpose. the lipid profile and the expression of proteins metabolically related to AMPK were determined on cells lysates. The results demonstrated that strawberry methanolic extract decreased total cholesterol. low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. and triglycerides levels (up to 0.50-. 0.30-. and 0.40-fold. respectively) while it stimulated the p-AMPK/AMPK expression (up to 3.06-fold). compared to the control.
