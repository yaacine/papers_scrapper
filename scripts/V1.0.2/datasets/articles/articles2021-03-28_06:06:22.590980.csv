Here we report that a copper electrocatalyst at an abrupt reaction interface in an alkaline electrolyte reduces CO2 to ethylene with 70% faradaic efficiency at a potential of −0.55 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Hydroxide ions on or near the copper surface lower the CO2 reduction and carbon monoxide (CO)–CO coupling activation energy barriers; as a result. onset of ethylene evolution at −0.165 volts versus an RHE in 10 molar potassium hydroxide occurs almost simultaneously with CO production.

This separation is currently done through energy intensive cryogenic distillation. To reduce the overall energy requirements for air separation it is examined whether a hybrid membrane and cryogenic process be utilized instead. The examined process uses an O2/N2 permeable membrane to create oxygen enriched air. This enriched air is then turned into high purity oxygen using cryogenic distillation. Several arrangements of such a system are investigated and compared on a practical and thermodynamic level to the current cryogenic process in use. It is found that using a vacuum pump arrangement to draw air through the membrane has potential to reduce energy requirements from the current standard.

Despite considerable progress on catalyst performance using nanostructured electrodes. the sensitivity of the reaction to process conditions has led to debate on the origin of the activity and high selectivity.

The gains in production. however. have come with stability challenges due to rapid flooding of GDEs. which frustrate both laboratory experiments and scale-up prospects. Here. we investigate the role of carbon gas diffusion layers (GDLs) in the advent of flooding during CO2RR. finding that applied potential plays a central role in the observed instabilities. Electrochemical characterization of carbon GDLs with and without catalysts suggests that the high overpotential required during electrochemical CO2RR initiates hydrogen evolution on the carbon GDL support. These potentials impact the wetting characteristics of the hydrophobic GDL. resulting in flooding that is independent of CO2RR.

We report on investigations of redox couples based on the reversible protonation of small organic molecules called quinones. These molecules can be very inexpensive and may therefore offer a low cost per kWh of electrical energy storage. Furthermore they are known to rapidly undergo oxidation and reduction with high reversibility under some conditions. suggesting the possibility of high current density operation. which could lead to low cost per kW.

This is the reason why in the past few years different mitigation strategies for the microclimate have been studied and examined. These strategies depend on those passive factors characterizing the urban setting that are able to affect the values of local meteorological variables. as the limit surfaces of the urban space (parterre and façades of the buildings). This paper examines the Cloister by Giuliano da Sangallo. which is part of the Faculty of Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. The case study compares the present configuration of the Cloister with four other configurations characterized by some vegetation and materials with a high albedo by taking into consideration the PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model. Microclimatic variables are calculated through numerical simulations performed by the ENVI-met software. Such a comparison is performed during a typical summer day. While examining the results it can be noticed how the strategy presenting the best results is the one with some vegetation. whereas the materials with a high albedo improve the microclimate if applied on surfaces characterized by a high sky view factor.

A useful solution is to identify the energy performance of buildings through the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). as it provides information for the comparison of buildings with different architectural typology. shape. design technology and geographic location. However. this tool does not assess the real energy consumption of the building and does not always take into account its impact on the environment. In this work. two different types of analysis were carried out: one based only on the energy efficiency and the other one based on the environmental impact. Those analyses were applied on a standard building. set in three different Italian locations. with the purpose of obtaining cross-related information. After the evaluation of the results. interventions on some parameters (walls insulation. windows frame. filler gas in the insulated glazing) have been identified in order to improve the energy behavior of the building with an acceptable environmental impact. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology that integrates the EPC with green building rating systems. leading to a more conscious choice of retrofit interventions as a compromise between energy performances and environmental impact.

This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli. a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300-Part1. which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope. based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the non-alteration of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25%. This work shows how it is possible to improve the energy performance of an existing building achieving a significant energy saving with the respect of the building architecture. shape. function and the surrounding landscape.

LEED is one of the most qualified rating systems at an international level; it assesses building sustainability thanks to a point-based system where credits are divided into six different categories. One of these is fully related to building materials. The ITACA procedure derives from the international evaluation system Sustainable Building Tool (SBTool). modified according to the Italian context. In the region of Umbria. ITACA certification is composed of 20 technical sheets. which are classified into five macro-areas. The analysis was developed on a residential building located in the central Italy. It was built taking into account the principles of sustainability as far as both structural and technical solutions are concerned. In order to evaluate the influence of thermal insulating material. different configurations of the envelope were considered. replacing the original material (glass wool) with a synthetic one (expanded polystyrene. EPS) and two natural materials (wood fiber and kenaf). The study aims to highlight how the materials characteristics can affect building energy and environmental performance and to point out the different approaches of the analyzed protocols.

The Sun represents the main exposure source for all the frequency bands of optical radiation. that is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging between 100 nm and 1 mm. including infrared (IR). ultraviolet (UV) and visible radiation. According to recent studies. outdoor workers have a relevant exposure to SR but few studies available in scientific literature have attempted to retrace a detailed history of individual exposure. Material and Methods: We propose a new method for the evaluation of SR cumulative exposure both during work and leisure time. integrating subjective and objective data. The former is collected by means of an interviewer administrated questionnaire. The latter is available through the Internet databases for many geographical regions and through individual exposure measurements. The data is integrated into a mathematical algorithm. in order to obtain an esteem of the individual total amount of SR the subjects have been exposed to during their lives.

In this paper a daylight “filter” structure. called pre-tunnel. is placed before the tunnel's portal. to investigate how a gradual reduction of luminance maintaining uniformity could be achieved; the structure presents very small circular holes on the ceiling giving access to natural light. A scale model has been constructed to test the effect of different diameters of holes on luminance and to evaluate the reduction of the lighting percentage. Results show the ability of this solution to have a potential control daylight management at the entrance of the tunnel.,True,bd1f8s4AAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,20,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7165241/,4795719105130054329,/scholar?cites=4795719105130054329,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chiara_Burattini/publication/282976667_Study_of_a_daylight_filter_zone_in_tunnels/links/5624ed4608aea35f26871445/Study-of-a-daylight-filter-zone-in-tunnels.pdf,0,0,0

Our aim was to provide a detailed evaluation of individual UV exposure in three different fishing activities in Italy. with personal UV dosimeters and a simple formula to calculate the fraction of ambient erythemal UV dose received by the workers. The potential individual UV exposure of the fishermen was between 65 and 542 Joules/m 2. The percentages of the ambient exposure were estimated between 2.5% and 65.3%. Workers’ UV exposure was mainly influenced by the characteristics of the work activity. the postures adopted. and the type of boats. Overall. our data showed that 43% of the daily measurements could result largely above the occupational limits of 1–1.3 standard erythemal dose (ie. 100 Joules/m 2) per day. in case of exposure of uncovered skin areas. Measurements of individual UV exposure are important not only to assess the risk but also to increase workers’ perception and stimulate the adoption of preventive measures to reduce solar UV risk. Furthermore. the simple method proposed. linking ambient erythemal UV dose to the workers’ exposure. can be a promising tool for a reliable assessment of the UV risk. as time series of environmental UV dose are widely available.

The value of the city center in a Smart City can increase through urban lighting systems: its elements on the territory can collect and convey data to increase services to city users; the electrical system becomes the so-called Smart Grid. This paper presents a study of smart lighting for a small town. a touristic location inside a nature reserve on the Italian coast. Three different approaches have been proposed. from minimal to more invasive interventions. and their effect on the territory has been investigated. Based on street typology and its surroundings. the work analyzes the opportunity to introduce smart and useful services for the citizens starting from a retrofitting intervention. Smart city capabilities are examined. showing how it is possible to provide new services to the cities through ICT (Information and Communication Technology) without deep changes and simplifying the control of basic city functions. The results evidence an important impact on annual energy costs. suggesting smart grid planning not only for metropolis applications. but also in smaller towns. such as the examined one.

1260326,Atomic Force Microscopy Grain Structure Characterization of Perpendicular Magnetic Recording Media,2007,Alexander Luce,,"Engineering Physics, University of Arizon",,,,Magnetic recording technology plays a key role in the development of computer. audio. and video storage devices. The nanoscale grain size of current hard-disk media determines important recording properties and thus requires accurate characterization methods. In this work. we developed a new method to characterize the nanostructure of thin film magnetic recording media using a phase-imaging tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM). In this study. clear images obtained with the AFM were compared to those obtained with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). A statistical distribution of grain size was analyzed. This novel method is an important development because phase imaging tapping mode AFM could provide a cheaper and faster characterization alternative to TEM.,True,CQlH42kAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,6,https://www.nnin.org/sites/default/files/files/2007nninREUluce.pdf,13010418622590541918,/scholar?cites=13010418622590541918,,,https://www.nnin.org/sites/default/files/files/2007nninREUluce.pdf,0,0,0
1260327,Engineering Dilute Nitride Semiconductor Alloys for Intermediate Band Solar Cells,2015,Alexander Vallejo Luce,,,,,,The growth and characterization of GaAs nanowires and GaNPAs thin-films is discussed within the context of finding a material system that is suitable as an intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) absorber. The IBSC is an attractive concept proposed to exceed the Shockley-Queisser detailed balance limit for photovoltaic efficiency. These solar cells have an additional intermediate band. allowing for the absorption of below bandgap photons. thus resulting in an increase in photocurrent and higher efficiency. Suitable materials systems for the implementation of the IBSC concept. however. are presently lacking. Recent work on the highly-mismatched alloy (HMA) GaAsN has shown that the unique features of the electronic band structure demonstrate optical activity of three energy bands and have led to the realization of a proof-of-concept IBSC. GaAsN. however. is not without shortcomings. Another HMA material. GaNPAs. which offers a wide range of bandgap tunability and is better matched to the solar spectrum is proposed. This work covers the optical characterization of both GaAs nanowires and GaAsPN using traditional visible-light semiconductor characterization techniques including optical absorption spectroscopy. photo-modulated reflectance. steady-state  photoluminescence. and spectral photoconductivity.

This investigation has shown that the decay time constant does not change significantly up to 100 K. and then starts to decrease rapidly above this temperature. Additionally. the decay times at the high-energy side of the spectrum decrease faster than those at the low-energy side. The effects have been explained by the interplay between carrier capture by radiative and nonradiative recombination centers. Detailed simulations show that the effect of carrier localization in the investigated materials is better described by double-scale potential fluctuations that are related to (i) distribution of localized states energy and (ii) bandgap fluctuations. In addition. it was observed that the increase in nitrogen concentration leads to a shorter decay time at room temperature. which is attributed to a larger concentration of non-radiative recombination centers. Furthermore. a post-growth annealing step leads to a longer decay time at room temperature. which is attributed to a reduction in non-radiative recombination centers. At low temperatures. the role of non-radiative centers is suppressed. and therefore the decay time does not differ significantly for samples with either different nitrogen concentrations or in both the as-grown more»,True,CQlH42kAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/22403015,,,,,,0,0,0

In an IBSC. a partially occupied energy band located within the bandgap region of a semiconductor serves as a ‘stepping stone’ for the absorption of lower energy photons that are nominally not absorbed by the cell. In theory. the addition of this ‘intermediate band’ would provide a high photocurrent while maintaining a high output voltage.1 Recently. an IBSC device using the highly-mismatched semiconductor GaNAs alloy (HMA’s) has demonstrated optical activity from the three energy bands and is a proof of principle for the IBSC concept.[2] It has been proposed that the GaAsPN dilute nitride alloy system is another promising candidate material for IBSC’s.3 Calculations based on the band anticrossing model4 show that the …,True,CQlH42kAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/MA2014-02/43/2071/meta,,,,,,0,0,0
1260330,11 Cleantech capital in California,2014,Alex Luce and Brian Steel,,"Carbon Governance, Climate Change and Business Transformation",,188,Routledge,The cleantech investment landscape is shifting. Investing in hardware-centric cleantech (eg. solar panels. electric vehicles. or battery technologies) is valuable to society. but risky for investors. Historically. many cleantech sectors have been capital intensive. substantially driven by government policies or subsidies. and are governed by commodity markets that operate on a global scale. As a result. it is difficult for new entrants to break in. at least within the amount of time and capital made available by investors. Venture capital (VC). the primary driver of most early-stage company development works much better for software-centric cleantech. or the “cleanweb.” which includes less capital-intensive technologies occupying the intersection between information technologies (gathering. communicating. tracking. measuring) and cleantech. reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.For both cleantech and its cleanweb component. the most important market in the world has been California. Silicon Valley. from which more innovations and more early-stage investments emanate than anywhere else. the nation’s most aggressive renewable energy policies. and a large population focused on clean energy (as well as reducing. reusing. and recycling). California has facilitated the launch of more cleantech companies and technologies than any other market. This chapter will explore the role of capital in cleantech. with a focus on the state of California.

Electrodes are constructed using a Nafion film to encapsulate PSI as well as the hole-scavenging redox mediator Os(bpy)2Cl2. The photoactive electrodes generate photocurrents of 4 μA/cm2 when illuminated with 1.4 mW/cm2 of 676 nm band-pass filtered light. Methyl viologen (MV2+) is present in the electrolyte to scavenge photoelectrons from PSI in the Nafion film and transport charges to the counter electrode. Because MV2+ is positively charged in both reduced and oxidized states. it is able to diffuse through the cation permeable channels of Nafion.

Cathode contamination is inevitable in a single-chamber MFC yet it is impossible to study the magnitude of this effect in the single-chambered format. Therefore to study the effect of contamination at the cathode two-chamber MFCs must be used.

This study was performed with the cathode in two positions: completely submerged in the catholyte and raised to a point where wicking action was used to coat the cathode with catholyte.

To understand the interactions between microorganisms in consortia. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is used to follow the concentrations of various metabolites such as sugars (eg. glucose. maltose). longer chain carbohydrates. and ethanol to optimize consortia conditions for the production of ethanol. It is shown that with proper design A. oryzae can digest food waste simulants into soluble sugars that S. cerevisiae can ferment into ethanol. Depending on the substrate and conditions used. concentrations of 13% ethanol were achieved in 10 days. It is further shown that a direct alcohol fuel cell (FC) can be coupled with these A. oryzae-enabled S. cerevisiae fermentations using a reverse osmosis membrane. This “bio-hybrid FC” continually extracted ethanol from an ongoing consortium. enhancing ethanol production and allowing the bio-hybrid FC to run for at least one week. Obtained bio-hybrid FC currents were comparable to those from pure ethanol—water mixtures. using the same FC.

To achieve a high power density of methanol oxidation reaction in fuel cell. it is essential to develop anode catalyst with high capacity and excellent stability. Metal oxides (Cobalt oxide) is a prospective anode material on account of its high energy density. In this paper different types of high-quality cobalt vanadate nanostructures such as Co3V2O8 and Co2V2O7 crystals have been synthesized as per the experimental procedure of hydrothermal treatment followed by heating at 450oC. Cobalt metavanadate nanostructures were synthesized via ammonium metavanadate and cobalt nitrate as a vanadium and cobalt source respectively. Structure and morphology of the synthesized samples were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The SEM image illustrated the formation of nanoparticles is very uniform in size and well separated The XRD patterns revealed that the synthesized sample are of high crystallinity purity. The molar ratio of Co: V effects on the type of products. morphology and size of cobalt vanadate nanoparticles was studied.

Commercial Pt catalysts promoted by various metal oxides show enhanced methanol electrooxidation activity and CO tolerance behavior. In our laboratory we explored Pt–MoO3/C and Pt–Nb2O5/C electrocatalysts in acidic media. and Pt–V2O5/C electrocatalyst in alkaline media for direct electro-oxidation of methanol. A fast and efficient intermittent microwave heating (IMH) method was employed to load metal oxides on carbon black (Vulcan XC-72). The oxide promoted electrocatalysts were found to be more active and stable as compared to the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst for electrooxidation of methanol.

In the model. while all countries suffer from the same environmental damage as a result of total global emissions. non-signatory countries decide on their emission levels by maximizing their own welfare. whereas signatory countries decide on their emission levels by maximizing the aggregate welfare of all signatory countries. It is assumed that signatory countries will be able to punish non-signatories. at some cost to themselves. When countries decide on their pollution emissions. they account for the evolution of the stock of pollution over time. Moreover. we propose a mechanism to describe how countries reach a stable IEA.

More specifically. we consider a two-player game and solve it under three different cases. In the first case. countries play a non-cooperative game and optimize their welfare under an environmental constraint without having access to joint implementation. In the second case. we assume countries do have access to JI. which allows us to assess its merits by comparing the players’ welfare levels achieved with and without JI. In the last case. the players jointly optimize their welfare under a collective environmental constraint.

The farsightedness assumption for players in a coalitional game acknowledges the fact that a deviation from a single player will lead to the formation of a new coalition structure as the result of possibly successive moves of her rivals in order to improve their payoffs. It departs from mainstream game theory in that it relies on the so-called rational conjectures. as opposed to the traditional Nash conjectures formed by players on the behavior of their rivals.

The main findings of this study are as follows. First. Bertrand competition is more efficient if either R&D productivity is low or products are very different. Second. Cournot competition is more efficient provided that R&D productivity is high. products are close substitutes. and spillovers are not close to zero. This last result is different from what has been obtained in the literature.

The problem is studied from the perspective of cooperative games and three possible definitions of the characteristic function of the game are analyzed. We further address the issue of free riding and the stability of coalitions. The challenge is to find a possible reconciliation of the two approaches. In other words. we are looking for a payment function which ensures the formation and stability of a large coalition. even if we consider that different countries are playing non‐cooperatively and are acting only in their own interest. Our results suggest that it is difficult to deter free riding and that no large coalition can emerge if countries decide to play non‐cooperatively.,True,8z0Gc-AAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,24,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9957.2006.00485.x,4879584689228548444,/scholar?cites=4879584689228548444,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Georges_Zaccour/publication/266416441_Characteristic_Functions_Coalitions_Stability_and_Free-riding_in_a_Game_of_Pollution_Control/links/543d19420cf24ef33b766e8b.pdf,0,0,0

In addition. the removal of such subsidies may release a sizeable portion of a country's national budget for use on more productive targets. One of the most recognized challenges of such reform is “selling” the new energy prices to citizens. particularly those with a more fragile purchasing power. Several empirical and technical studies have prescribed that the reform might be supported by a direct compensation mechanism in order to ensure feasibility.This is what was done during the recent energy subsidy reform in Iran. However. the compensation mechanism implemented in Iran's reform was successful at the beginning. but did not proceed as expected.

In some swirl combustors. it has been observed that a PVC is present under non-reacting conditions but disappears in the corresponding reacting cases. Since numerous studies have shown that a PVC has strong effects on the flame stabilization. it is desirable to understand the formation and suppression of PVCs in GT combustors. The present work experimentally studies the flow field in a GT model combustor at atmospheric pressure. Whereas all non-reacting conditions and detached M-shaped flames exhibit a PVC. the PVC is suppressed for attached V-shaped flames.

GTs also must be able to operate at extremely low emission levels. which is currently achieved with lean-premixed burner designs. To investigate the performance of highly reactive fuels in the reheat combustion concept. mainly with respect to autoignition and flashback limits. a generic reheat combustor with excellent optical access has been developed. The first objective of this work was to carefully characterize the mixing section in order to derive well-defined boundary conditions for the subsequent autoignition studies. Initial autoignition results at T > 1000 K and p = 15 bar are presented for natural gas (NG) and H2-rich fuels.

Fine. medium. and coarse microstructures are exposed to redox cycling at 950 C. FIB (focused ion beam)-tomography and image analysis are used to quantify the effective (connected) volume fraction (Φ eff). constriction factor (β). and tortuosity (τ). The effective conductivity (σ eff) is described as the product of intrinsic conductivity (σ 0) and the so-called microstructure-factor (M): σ eff= σ 0* M. Two different methods are used to evaluate the M-factor:(1) by prediction using a recently established relationship. M pred= εβ 0. 36/τ 5.17. and (2) by numerical simulation that provides conductivity. from which the simulated M-factor can be deduced (M sim). Both methods give complementary and consistent information about the effective transport properties and the redox degradation mechanism. The initial microstructure has a strong influence on effective conductivities and their degradation. Finer anodes have higher initial conductivities but undergo more intensive Ni coarsening. Coarser anodes have a more stable Ni phase but exhibit lower YSZ stability due to lower sintering activity. Consequently. in order to improve redox stability. it is proposed to use mixtures of fine and coarse powders in different proportions for functional anode and current collector layers.

XRD. XPS and Raman analyses enabled the identification of simonkolleite and zinc oxide as the patina constituents. FIB-SEM imaging shows that the upper part of the patinas is a network of simonkolleite nanosheets with an open microstructure that is unlikely to act as a significant barrier for corrosion processes.

Degradation is expected to form aromatic amines. which may be toxic and recalcitrant to anaerobic treatment but degradable aerobically. Methods for the quantitative detection of substituted aromatic amines arising from azo-dye cleavage are complex. A simple qualitative method is suggested as a way in which to investigate whether decolorisation is actually due to degradation. and whether the amines generated are successfully removed by aerobic treatment.

1260492,ACOUSTIC EMISSION SOURCE LOCATION IN PLATE-LIKE STRUCTURES USING A CLOSELY ARRANGED TRIANGULAR SENSOR ARRAY.,2010,Dirk Aljets and Alex Chong and Steve Wilcox and Karen Holford,28,Journal of Acoustic Emission,,,,In order to identify the location of acoustic emission (AE) sources in large plate-like structures it typically requires the use of at least three widely spaced sensors. The distance between these sensors is defined by. for example. expected AE intensity and attenuation of the signals. This work presents a novel configuration of the three sensors. which are installed in a closely arranged triangular array with the sensors just a few centimetres apart. The algorithm locates AE sources by determining the direction from which the wave is approaching the array using the time of arrival and the distance the wave has travelled using the wave mode separation. Tests were conducted on a composite (CFRP) plate with anisotropic lay-up. In this work it is shown that the technique is able to accurately identify the source location. The technique is particularly suitable for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications where the close positioning of the sensors allows the array to be installed in one housing to simplify mounting and wiring. It is expected that this sensor arrangement could reduce the number of sensors needed to monitor large plate-like structures compared to more conventional AE source location methods.,True,LPUcldQAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,66,https://www.ndt.net/article/jae/papers/28-085.pdf,3692496936664837906,/scholar?cites=3692496936664837906,,,https://www.ndt.net/article/jae/papers/28-085.pdf,0,0,0

Because it can reduce the greenhouse gas emission and enhance oil recovery. In some oil or gas reservoirs. the reservoir water and the strong heterogeneity make the CO2 storage capacity difficult to be determined. In this research. the CO2 storage evaluation method is introduced. This method considers the CO2 displacement efficiency. the CO2 sweep efficiency. the CO2 dissolution in oil and gas and the CO2 displacement mechanism. The key factors in this evaluation method are determined by the reservoir simulation method. the thermodynamic theories and the statistical analysis methods separately. At last. the CO2 storage capacity evaluation system is built.

The resultant `black-box' models of the pollutant emissions. namely the nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions. were able to represent the dynamics of the process and delivered reasonably accurate estimates over a wide range of unseen data.

However. although viscous damping governs the physics of metal deformation. it is concluded that the detected high frequency acoustic emission (AE) signals arising from metal cutting can only be generated owing to the interaction between moving dislocations and obstacles. This would appear to be the reason why the amplitude of the AE signal cannot be directly related to the cutting power. since it arises from a different generation mechanism. As a result. a qualitative model relating the AE to basic deformation parameters was derived. in which the power of the AE is expected to increase with strain and strain rate. but to decrease with temperature.

Akram A.. Nishizu T.. Kondo N.. Setarehdan SK. Rajabipour A.. 2010. An ultrasound based technique for the determination of poultry egg quality. Res. Agr. Eng.. 56: 26–32.The present study investigates the possibility of the non-destructive prediction of the main quality indices of commercial eggs by calculating the ultrasound phase velocity within the egg material. The phase velocity of the ultrasound signal in the egg material was determined by analysing the recorded ultrasound signals using the Fast Fourier Transform. Three hundred commercial eggs (Boris Brown. 33 weeks age) from the first day of egg laying were purchased from a farm and divided in two groups. The first group was kept at the room temperature (22–25 C) and the second group was kept in a refrigerator (5 C). Every week. 25 eggs from both the room and the refrigerator were first submitted to the non--destructive ultrasound test at weekly basis at the room temperature. Immediately after testing. the air cell. the thick albumen heights. the Haugh unit and the yolk index of the eggs were also determined destructively for the comparison purposes. The results were analysed to find any possible correlation between the computed ultrasonic phase velocity and the destructive parameters. during a storage period of five weeks. The tests were carried out using an ultrasound beam with a frequency of 150 kHz with a sampling rate of 2.5 Gs/S on the eggs under a controlled temperature situation. Significant differences between the means of the destructive analysis on different days of the eggs storage were found using ANOVA.

This paper compares results of the application of two different approaches. parametric model (PM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). for assessing economical productivity (EP). total costs of production (TCP) and benefit to cost ratio (BC) of potato crop. In this comparison. Cobb-Douglas function for PM and multilayer feedforward for implementing ANN models have been used. The ANN. having 8-6-12-1 topology with R2= 0.89. resulted in the best-suited model for estimating EP. Similarly. optimal topologies for TCP and BC were 8-13-15-1 (R2= 0.97) and 8-15-13-1 (R2= 0.94). respectively. In validating the PM and ANN models. mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used as performance indicator. The ANN approach allowed to reduce the MAPE from  184% for PM to less than 7% with a+ 30% to  95% variability range.

Three different network topologies are considered:(i) a random scale-free topology.(ii) a deterministic pseudofractal scale-free network. and (iii) an Apollonian network. For the random scale-free topology we find a coupling strength threshold beyond which full synchronization is attained. This threshold scales as k− μ. where k is the outgoing connectivity and μ depends on the local nonlinearity. For deterministic scale-free networks coherence is observed only when the coupling strength is proportional to the neighbor connectivity.

By measuring the size and position of dunes in Moroccan barchan dune fields. we find that these dunes tend to distribute uniformly in space and follow an unique size distribution function. We introduce an analytical mean-field approach to show that this empirical size distribution emerges from the interplay of dune collisions and sand flux balance. the two simplest mechanisms for size selection.

Signal deviations from model prediction are labelled as anomalies and are further investigated. In this paper we assess a stochastic approach to reconstruct the 1 Hz tower top acceleration signal. which was measured in a wind turbine located at the wind farm Alpha Ventus in the German North Sea. We compare the resulting data reconstruction with that of a model based on a neural network. which has been previously reported as a data-mining algorithm suitable for reconstructing this signal. Our results present evidence that the stochastic approach outperforms the neural network in the high frequency domain (1 Hz). Although neural network retrieves accurate step-forward predictions. with low mean square errors. the stochastic approach predictions better preserve the statistics and the frequency components of the original signal. retaining high accuracy levels. The implementation of our stochastic approach is available as open source code and can easily be adapted for other situations involving stochastic data reconstruction. Based on our findings we argue that such an approach could be implemented in signal reconstruction for monitoring purposes or for abnormal behaviour detection.

Through a standard fatigue analysis. we show that it is possible to accurately estimate fatigue loads in any wind turbine within one wind park. using only the load measurements at one single turbine and the set of wind speed measurements. Our framework consists of deriving a stochastic differential equation that describes the evolution of the torque at one wind turbine driven by the wind speed. The stochastic equation is derived directly from the measurements and is afterwards used for predicting the fatigue loads for neighboring turbines. Such a framework could be used to mitigate the financial efforts usually necessary for placing measurement devices in all wind turbines within one wind farm.

Dune fields seem to present a characteristic dune size and spacing. which suggests a cooperative behavior based on dune interaction. In Duran et al.

This approach was based on a mean-field model ignoring the spatial distribution of dune fields.

Generally. such modelling is hampered by the non-stationary features of wind speed data that. to a large extent. reflect the turbulent dynamics in the atmosphere. We study how these features can be captured by nested ARIMA models. In this approach. wind speed fluctuations in given time windows are modelled by one stochastic process. and the parameter variation between successive windows by another one. For deriving the wind speed model. we use 20 months of data collected at the FINO1 platform at the North Sea and use a variable transformation that best maps the wind speed onto a Gaussian random variable. We find that wind speed increments can be well reproduced for up to four standard deviations. The distributions of extreme variations. however. strongly deviate from the model predictions.

Understanding of cycling behaviour and subsequent development of interventions has typically been undertaken using an individualist approach. often relying on psychologically based models of behaviour. This paper argues that Social Practice Theory (SPT) may be a valuable addition to practitioner’s toolboxes by providing an alternative means of understanding the complex dynamics between the elements that constitute the practice of utility cycling. allowing it to be considered as a social issue. rather than focusing solely on individual behaviour. This is demonstrated within the paper by the use of SPT to reanalyse quantitative and qualitative datasets that explore views and experiences of both cyclists and non-cyclists.

Even if they were. most of us now live in a complex world that has allowed us to become detached from the natural patterns and drivers that have shaped humans and human consciousness over millennia of evolution.  To try and understand how and why people behave the way they do in modern society requires us not just to understand the human side of the equation. but also to understand a great deal about the social context in which this behaviour occurs.  The purpose of this paper is to set out a number of different perspectives that can be used to understand and interpret behaviour.  It sets these  out within a framework that demonstrates how each approach can contribute something valuable towards developing a broad view of behaviour.

Despite a population of only 100.000 and very little local industry. studies have shown that the city experiences levels of nitrogen dioxide. ozone. particulates and sulphur dioxide exceeding the UK Air Quality Standards. Because of Norwich's situation within a large. predominantly rural area a large non-resident workforce is one factor that contributes to large. often very congested traffic flows. The city's location close to the European mainland also exposes it to polluted airmasses transported from the continent. especially in the case of particulates and ozone. In order to assess the relative contributions of local and regional sources. data from rural and urban monitoring sites are to be used in conjunction with ADMS-Urban and the UK Meteorological Office's NAME model.,True,ASFOgXUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,23,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006477112407,1411846426822244754,/scholar?cites=1411846426822244754,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49474394/a_3A100647711240720161009-19265-10lqtwu.pdf,0,0,0

Based on these contentions we suggest the need for a ‘toolkit’to be assembled to take a new approach to enabling a transition to the wider use of low carbon mobility. This approach would be centred around evidence that there is much wider variation and flexibility in people’s travel patterns than has previously been recognised.

In this paper we chart the developments in networking thinking in two disciplinary areas – social network analysis and social anthropology – in order to highlight the enduring difficulties and problems with network thinking as well as its potential. The first half of the paper explores the uses of network approaches over the past fifty years. situating theoretical and methodological questions in their broader disciplinary contexts.

1260668,Roads: An anthropology of infrastructure and expertise,2015,Penny Harvey and Hannah Knox,,,,,Cornell University Press,Roads matter to people. This claim is central to the work of Penny Harvey and Hannah Knox. who in this book use the example of highway building in South America to explore what large public infrastructural projects can tell us about contemporary state formation. social relations. and emerging political economies. Roads focuses on two main sites: the interoceanic highway currently under construction between Brazil and Peru. a major public/private collaboration that is being realized within new. internationally ratified regulatory standards; and a recently completed one-hundred-kilometer stretch of highway between Iquitos. the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon. and a small town called Nauta. one of the earliest colonial settlements in the Amazon. The Iquitos-Nauta highway is one of the most expensive roads per kilometer on the planet. Combining ethnographic and historical research. Harvey and Knox shed light on the work of engineers and scientists. bureaucrats and construction company officials. They describe how local populations anticipated each of the road projects. even getting deeply involved in questions of exact routing as worries arose that the road would benefit some more than others. Connectivity was a key recurring theme as people imagined the prosperity that will come by being connected to other parts of the country and with other parts of the world. Sweeping in scope and conceptually ambitious.

Drawing from our ethnography of the construction of two roads in Peru. we trace the disruptive and destabilising processes through which roads come to hold the promise of transformation. We approach roads with curiosity as to their capacity to enchant with respect to three specific promises: speed. political integration and economic connectivity.

Road building is a dangerous business. The sheer weight and volume of mud. rocks and water that is mobilised and shifted. analysed and altered. manipulated and moved to turn crumbling tracks into an asphalted highway is a feat of human control over an unpredictable material world.

CRM applications thus promise to deliver more. real-time accurate information about consumer habits and behaviours therefore allowing organisations to maximise their extraction of business value.

More at home underground in the oppressive heat of the mine. than in the cosmopolitan society life of Lima. he is defined by his incapacity for conventional norms of social attachment and his unswerving belief in the structural integrity of the mine that he oversees as he works to transform nature in the name of progress. However. Echecopar’s world is literally shaken to its core when disaster befalls the mine and a cave collapses killing 180 workers. The play follows Echecopar’s denial of the impending catastrophe that is foretold by the shuddering and shaking of the mountain walls and the exhortations of his colleagues. his response to the disaster as it unfolds and the subsequent transformation that the event brings about in Echecopar’s character. Master of all he surveys (Burnett 2000). yet powerless in the face of disaster. working in the name of social transformation yet seemingly indifferent to the social world that surrounds him. Echecopar provides a caricature of the modernist engineer. His attitude to impending disaster exemplifies the detachment that is necessary to make action possible in a world of dangerous uncertainties. And yet as the story unfolds. his character transforms as he struggles to reconcile such detachment with the impulse to engage with the complex and unforeseen social effects of engineering practice.

Over the ensuing ten years we have accrued many debts to those who have variously inspired. assisted. cajoled. critiqued. signposted. reassured. and supported us in bringing the book to completion. Although it is now impossible to reconstruct the specifics of many of these conversations. they have all undoubtedly affected our thinking about what roads are. what they do. and what they can reveal about our contemporary world. Indeed. roads have proved to be a remarkably generative topic of conversation. inspiring comment. insight. and opinion from disparate family members. friends. and colleagues in the United Kingdom.

1260690,Ethnographies of Place,2010,Penny Harvey and Hannah Knox,,Understanding Social Research: Thinking Creatively about Method,,107-119,Sage,In this chapter we discuss our ethnographic explorations of the elusive qualities of place. We are interested in how places are constantly in the process of becoming otherwise and elsewhere as people come and go. as environments evolve. as plans are enacted and unplanned consequences unfold. Our interest in ‘places in process’ raises questions about description. As anthropologists we are particularly interested in how other people describe place and our work thus requires us to address the intrinsic multiplicity of place. 1 Attention to multiplicity alerts us to the ways in which descriptive practices entail epistemological and ontological claims. Ontologically. description requires some notion of what it is that is being described. the relevant entities and their relational fields. Epistemologically. descriptive claims are claims that reveal choices about how best to know and to persuade others of the relevance and credibility of one’s own description. Descriptive accounts are in this sense claims on reality that. in their multiplicity. are constantly set against alternatives. In some contexts these alternatives become explicit sites of tension and negotiation. We chart a course through this complex politics of description by focusing on the notion of ‘adequate description’. hoping thereby to maintain awareness of description as an oriented practice. a purposeful activity. Our interests in the ethnography of place emerged within the context of a collaborative research project which we carried out in Peru from 2005–2006.2 The research. which focused on two road construction projects. critically explored the promise of technological development projects to deliver …,True,VHyMXmcAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,8,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10017895289471413028&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10017895289471413028,/scholar?cites=10017895289471413028,,,,0,0,0

Penny Harvey, Eleanor Conlin Casella, Gillian Evans, Hannah Knox, Christine McLean, Elizabeth B. Silva, Nicholas Thoburn & Kath Woodward. Routledge, London & New York",,312-322,,This chapter 1 deals with the production of materiality in contemporary financial markets. It addresses one of the major changes that markets have been witnessing for more than twenty years now. namely the general movement towards automation and the related ‘dematerialization’of financial instruments and stock exchanges. Early signs of such a movement took place in the mid-1980s. when electronic systems began to substantially frame financial practices. performing simple tasks and easing the dissemination of information. 2 This evolution has recently been explored. thanks to a series of works in the history of markets (Lee 1998. Michie 2006). in the sociology ofmarket automation (Muniesa 2003 and 2007. Pardo-Guerra 2010a and 2010b) and electronic trading (Preda 2009a). and through anthropological accounts of shifting practices (Zaloom 2006) or insider narrations (Leinweber 2009). But digitizing the market infrastructure was and still is the first step towards greater automation of financial transactions. The introduction of technologies such as the telegraph (Preda 2006). the pantelegraph (Preda 2009b) and later the telephone (Muniesa 2008) heralded the quest for integrated interfaces and devices being able to receive. store. record and stabilize flows and chunks of financial information: in fact. spreadsheets. charts and market mappings are just the visible tip of the iceberg (Knorr Cetina and Bruegger 2002a and 2002b.

For example. carbonates are extensively used for reconstruction of the Earth’s past climatic variations by determining ocean. lake. and soil paleotemperatures. Furthermore. diagenetic minerals and their formation or alteration temperature may provide information about the burial history of important geological units and can have practical applications. for instance. for reconstructing the geochemical and thermal histories of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is a relatively new technique that can provide the formation temperature of carbonate minerals without requiring a priori knowledge of the isotopic composition of the initial solution.

The study of fluid flow in porous media at the pore-scale consists of two key procedures: Imaging - reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) pore space images; and modelling such as with single and two-phase flow simulations with Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) or Pore-Network (PN) Modelling. Here we analyse pore-scale results to predict petrophysical properties such as porosity. single-phase permeability and multi-phase properties at different length scales.

The capillary roughness is modeled using a random distribution of coarse grained particles forming the wall. The Lucas−Washburn equation is used as a reference for analyzing the imbibition curves obtained by simulation.

The aggregation was studied in situ in the crude oil using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. We observe that the kinetics of asphaltene aggregation strongly depends upon the Hildebrand solubility parameter of the mixture. The aggregation process. which occurs when adding precipitant close to the precipitation onset point. can be described by a diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) process. A slight change of the Hildebrand solubility parameter away from the precipitation onset point into the precipitation regime leads to a different kinetic mechanism. In this regime. we observe that the aggregate size increases almost linearly over time. which is an indication of the crossover between DLA and reaction-limited aggregation (RLA).

We show that all solutions for the steady-state extensional viscosity η E are unstable when the elongational rates ɛ˙ exceed some critical value. In some cases the only real solution for the extensional viscosity is negative at intermediate values of the elongational rate. This critical elongational rate is not unfeasibly large. eg. 250 s− 1 for a typical EHAC solution. We note that the extension rates at which enhanced pressure drop is observed experimentally in porous media flow is generally well below the onset of the instability in the B–M model.

In particular the influence of micelle size. pore geometry and flow rate on the ability of worms to pass through the pores was studied. The ways in which these parameters influence the conformational properties of the worms and the spatial distribution of micelles inside the simulation cell was also investigated.

Available macroscopic Rheological Equations of State (REoS) are often inadequate to predict flow behaviour in complex geometries or even to describe the full set of rheological measurements. In this paper. we show how the link between surfactant structure and rheology can be explored through the use of mesoscopic particulate simulations. We describe the development of a realistic Brownian Dynamics model. where the persistence length of the micelle is the smallest length scale. Most of the parameters for the BD model are obtained from atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations to establish the link to the chemistry of the surfactant.

1260711,Cement plugs: stability and failure by buoyancy-driven mechanism,1999,JP Crawshaw and I Frigaard,,,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,Setting cement plugs off bottom is a well recognised problem in the industry. Different causes of failure have been identified over the years and many have been addressed by improving practices used in the field. A remaining problem is the instability of the lower interface between the cement and the fluid below. driven by the greater density of the cement. That is. once a cement plug has been injected into the wellbore it must resist the tendency to fall through the less dense drilling fluid below until the cement has set. The fluid properties which ensure stability have never been satisfactorily established and it is this gap which is addressed by the current work.Theoretical and experiment results are presented in this paper which allow the estimation of the yield stresses required of the fluids to stabilise a cement plug under any conditions of hole size. inclination and density difference between the cement and the fluid …,True,X8SrgBQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,34,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-56959-MS,6607745289668190348,/scholar?cites=6607745289668190348,,,,0,0,0

The choice of material of the plasma-facing components (PFCs) can have significant impact on the loads that arise during a disruption. With the ITER-like wall (ILW) in JET made of beryllium in the main chamber and tungsten in the divertor. the main finding is a low fraction of radiation.

The large reduction in the carbon content (more than a factor ten) led to a much lower Z eff (1.2–1.4) during L-and H-mode plasmas. and radiation during the burn-through phase of the plasma initiation with the consequence that breakdown failures are almost absent.

The main difference is a significantly lower fraction (by up to a factor of 5) of energy radiated during the disruption process. yielding higher plasma temperatures after the thermal quench and thus longer current quench times. Thus. a larger fraction of the total energy was conducted to the wall resulting in larger heat loads. Active mitigation by means of massive gas injection became a necessity to avoid beryllium melting already at moderate levels of thermal and magnetic energy (ie already at plasma currents of 2 MA). A slower current quench. however. reduced the risk of runaway generation.

Throughout the course of the current pre-conceptual design analysis phase for the European DEMO. it is necessary to define scenarios by considering from the early phases their compatibility with the available diagnostics. of the actuators for plasma control and with the response of the heating and current drive systems.

Croatia,Due to the outstanding properties of 2D and 3D textile composites. the use of 3D fiber reinforced in high-tech industrial domains (spatial. aeronautic. automotive. naval. etc…) has been expanded in recent years. Thus. the evaluation of their elastic properties is crucial for the use of such types of composites in advanced industries. The analytical or numerical modeling of textile composites in order to evaluate their elastic properties depend on the prediction of the elastic properties of unidirectional composite materials with long fibers composites “UD”. UD composites represent the basic element in modeling all laminates or 2D or 3D fabrics. They are considered as transversely isotropic materials composed of two phases: the reinforcement phase and the matrix phase. Isotropic fibers (eg glass fibers) or anisotropic fibers (eg carbon fibers) represent the reinforcement phase while. in general. isotropic materials (eg epoxy. ceramics. etc…) represent the matrix phase (Figure 1).The effective stiffness and compliance matrices of a transversely isotropic material are defined in the elastic regime by five independent engineering constants: longitudinal and transversal Young’s moduli E11 and E22. longitudinal and transversal shear moduli G12 and G23. and major Poisson’s ratio ν12 (Noting that direction 1 is along the fiber). The minor Poisson’s ratio ν23 is related to E22 and G12. The effective elastic properties are evaluated in terms of mechanical properties of fibers and matrix (Young’s and shear moduli. Poisson’s ratios and the fiber volume fraction Vf).

The difficulties of application of the Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf-Laird method are discussed and a new method based on the statistical approach to analysis of the hysteresis loop (SAP method) is proposed. In contrast to the Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf-Laird method. this method allows evaluation of the effective elastic moduli and the effective stresses in tension and in compression without ambiguity.

The aerosol equation of motion includes only a Stokes drag force and the influence of the aerosols on the gas flow is assumed to be negligible. Since the flow is vertical. aerosols deposit as a consequence of the turbulent fluctuations and their own inertia. It is shown that the eddies which are responsible for aerosol deposition are the same eddies that control turbulence production. Typical aerosol trajectories are shown and related to eddy structure. A free‐flight theory suggested by Friedlander and Johnstone [Ind. Eng.

One example is mechanical power from mobile internal combustion engines to drive heavy-duty vehicles (eg Diesel trucks). ships and rail-cars. Another example is electrical power from decentralized power plants co-generating heat and power from a variety of primary energy sources. Increasing energy prices and increasing awareness of the environmental impacts associated with energy use are motivating an exploration of opportunities to generate power through Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) from abundantly available and largely underutilized low temperature heat. Heat at temperatures lower than about 250 oC can be extracted from gases exhausted from truck or marine engines. flue gases from boilers or industrial furnaces or incinerators. hot brine from underground reservoirs (often co-produced with petroleum and natural gas) or solar collectors.

1260987,Velocity fluctuation interpretation in the near wall region of a dense riser,2008,Ronald W Breault and Christopher P Guenther and Lawrence J Shadle,182,Powder Technology,2,137-145,Elsevier,Tests were conducted in a cold flow circulating fluidized bed to gather computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model validation data. Particle velocity measurements were obtained with an LDV system under various operating conditions at locations near the wall to provide data in terms of a time series of particle velocity values. Time scale criteria were developed to characterize the variance of the velocity fluctuations from LDV measurements as either granular temperature or granular turbulent kinetic energy. By applying these criteria to categorize the variations in the velocities for adjacent particles passing the sample volume. the resulting granular temperatures were found to be much smaller than the granular (particle) turbulent kinetic energy. Average values for the granular temperature in this system ranged between 0.02 to 0.1 m2/s2. while the particle turbulent kinetic energy ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 m2/s2.

The products of CLC of methane are CO2 and H2O. After condensation of H2O. a concentrated CO2 gas stream is produced and ready for sequestration. An important issue for the CLC process is the selection of metal oxide as an oxygen carrier. because it must retain its reactivity through many cycles. In this study. isothermal thermogravimetric analysis is used to evaluate the rates of reduction of CuO impregnated in bentonite with methane (CH4) over the range 1023–1173 K for 20%. 50%. and 100% CH4 over 10 reduction cycles.

In many instances. the key to a successful process operation is how well the solids transfer and control system has been designed.

In this study. a transient method was applied which readily allows one to identify operational features and critical transitions. The method is based on stopping the solids flow rate into the riser when riser is operating in fully dense transport regime. The analysis of transient pressure drop data across the riser during a solids flow cut-off experiment against its time derivative demonstrate the three distinct operating regimes that exist as the gas deplete the solid out of the riser.

1261028,Identifying and learning from sustainable development pathways,2016,William F Lamb,,,,,,On May 9th 2013 the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii recorded an average daily atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of 400 parts per million (Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 2013). This milestone was largely symbolic. but when compared to ice core samples it is the highest concentration recorded in 800.000 years and a 40% increase over preindustrial levels (IPCC. 2013). These heightened levels of CO2. the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes. are the result of anthropogenic land use change. industrial and fossil fuel emissions. and are the primary driver of observed warming in recent decades.Climate change is expected to have severe and long term impacts on physical. biological and human systems worldwide. Such impacts may be borne out through changes in the water cycle. shifts in disease vectors. and more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves. droughts and tropical cyclones (IPCC. 2014a). Developing countries are known to have particular geographies that enhance their risks: many are located in the drought-prone. arid sub-Saharan Africa. and flood-prone coastal areas in South Asia and the Pacific. Such risks in these countries will likely be exacerbated by limited funds. fragile institutions and a lack of technical knowledge for adaptation. rendering the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions a morally unambiguous and urgent endeavour (Gough. 2015; Winkler et al.. 2011).,True,2MMJ6MgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,2,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/60832156/FULL_TEXT.PDF,9199924256919009116,/scholar?cites=9199924256919009116,,,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/60832156/FULL_TEXT.PDF,0,0,0

In case of small rotors. in which the chord-to-radius ratios are generally high not to limit the blade Reynolds number. the performance of turbine blades has been suggested to be moreover influenced by the so-called “flow curvature effects”.

A better understanding of their aerodynamics is required to improve on designs. for example through the development of more accurate low-order (e.g. blade element momentum) models. Many of these models neglect the impact of the curved paths that are followed by blades on their performance. It has been theorized that the curved streamlines of the flow impart a virtual camber and incidence on them. giving a performance analogous to a cambered blade in a rectilinear flow.To test the extent of this effect. wind tunnel experiments have been conducted in a rectilinear flow to obtain lift and drag for three airfoils: a NACA 0018 and two conformal transforms of the profile.

In these new installations. however. the real working conditions can be far from the nominal ones. In particular. the turbine functioning can be noticeably affected by misalignments between the oncoming flow and the axis of the rotor; differently from horizontal-axis wind turbines. whose performance is decreased by a skew angle. H-Darrieus turbines are thought to take advantage from this condition in some cases.In this study. an improved model for the performance prediction of H-Darrieus rotors under skewed flow was developed.

This VAWT type has several advantages over horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) for wind energy capture in the built environment: its blades typically feature a simpler geometry than HAWT blades. as VAWT blades are usually straight. with neither twist nor taper. whereas HAWT blades are twisted and tapered in most cases. VAWTs often have a simpler build. as the generator and the gear box are usually at the turbine base. making maintenance operations simpler and cheaper due to the ease of access of these components.

The BGNRs have been subsequently imaged in high-resolution TEM mode at 80 kV. During imaging. the interaction of the electrons with the sample induces structural transformations in the BGNR. such as closure of the edges and thinning. leading to the formation of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT). We demonstrate using molecular dynamics simulations that the produced SWCNT is. in fact. a flattened SWCNT with elliptical circumference.

Attaching salen covalently to the C60 cage only marginally slows down metal binding at the salen functionality compared to metal binding to free salen. Coordination of metal cations to salen–C60 introduces to these fullerene derivatives strong absorption bands across the visible spectrum from400 to 630 nm. the optical features of which are controlled by the nature of the transition metal. The redox properties of the metal–salen–C60 complexes are determined both by the fullerene and by the nature of the transition metal. enabling the generation of a wide range of fullerene-containing charged species. some of which possess two or more unpaired electrons.

To synthesize 1. 3-diarylmidazolium salts. it was necessary to isolate the intermediate N. N'-diarylethylenediimines prior to their cyclization. Although this additional step required more time and reagents. it led to a much more efficient overall process. It also proved very convenient to carry out the synthesis of imidazolinium salts in parallel to their imidazolium counterparts via the reduction of the diimines into diammonium salts. The critical assembly of the C 2 precarbenic unit was best achieved with paraformaldehyde and chlorotrimethylsilane in the case of imidazolium derivatives. whereas the use of triethyl orthoformate under microwave irradiation was most appropriate for the fast and efficient synthesis of imidazolinium salts.

1261107,Increasing Conversion Efficiency in Fuel Ethanol Production from Lignocellulosic Biomass by Polygeneration-and a Paradoxon between Energy and Exergy in Process Integration,2010,Martin Gassner and François Maréchal,,,CONF,,,In the public and scientific debate on biofuels. ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is generally the most popular alternative that may allow for a sustainable production. Compared to thermochemical processing of biomass which assures a complete conversion of the feedstock. it yet suffers from an inherently lower fuel yield due to the resistance of lignin to biological degradation. Based on a recently developed process model for fuel ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. this paper discussed the cogeneration alternatives for the conversion of the residual lignin. Whereas an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) increase the power cogeneration efficiency compared to the conventional combustion and power generation in a steam Rankine cycle. it is shown that alternative gasification and methanation to Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) allows for roughly doubling the fuel yield from biomass.The paper further demonstrates the paradox situation that conventional energy recovery is limited by the available energy. and not. as usually. the available exergy from the waste heat. In order to overcome this limitation. a more general energy integration approach that allows for increasing the cogeneration efficiency in this kind of situations is proposed.,True,w9D2YoIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,7,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/150006,6172067708886696927,/scholar?cites=6172067708886696927,,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/150006/files/ECOS2010_paper104.pdf,0,0,0
1261108,Long-term NOx emission behavior of heavy duty gas turbines: an approach for model-based monitoring and diagnostics,2017,Moritz Lipperheide and Frank Weidner and Manfred Wirsum and Martin Gassner and Stefano Bernero,,,,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection,Accurate monitoring of gas turbine performance is a means to an early detection of performance deviation from the design point and thus to an optimized operational control. In this process. the diagnosis of the combustion process is of high importance due to strict legal pollution limits as aging of the combustor during operation may lead to an observed progression of NOx emissions. The method presented here features a semi-empirical NOx formulation incorporating aging for the GT24/GT26 heavy duty gas turbines: Input parameters to the NOx-correlation are processed from actual measurement data in a simplified gas turbine model. Component deterioration is accounted for by linking changes in air flow distribution and control parameters to specific operational measurements of the gas turbine. The method was validated on three different gas turbines of the GE GT24/GT26 fleet for part-and baseload operation …,True,w9D2YoIAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,6,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/GT/proceedings-abstract/GT2017/V006T05A001/242799,3445226573917902599,/scholar?cites=3445226573917902599,,,,0,0,0

1261110,Nordic energy innovation systems,2008,Mads Borup and Per Dannemand Andersen and Staffan Jacobsson and Atle Midttun,,November (NORDEN: Nordic Energy Research),,,,There are large potentials in employing the innovation system perspective to the energy area. Policy building on real insight in the innovation systems is until now seldom. This study gathers and discusses the knowledge about the Nordic energy innovation systems with special focus on the patterns of cooperation and of integration of needs with technological opportunities. In addition. the study investigates a row of innovation indicators. Four technology areas are in focus: bioenergy. hydrogen technology & fuel cells. solar cells. and wind energy. The study shows that the Nordic region is clearly visible in the general world picture of energy innovation. On many types of energy technology. the Nordic countries have leading competences. Energy innovation is a major activity area in Nordic economy. Nordic policy makers have obvious interests in the innovativeness and competitiveness of Nordic firms in the large global markets that are expected to grow fast. The Nordic energy innovation systems are characterised by multiplicity of actors and considerable cooperation and discussion across actor groups. The innovation systems on specific technologies are complex. historical constructions that are highly dependent on the specific industries and competence and resource bases they are anchored in. The innovation systems are significantly different from country to country and from technology to technology. It is needed that policy is strategically targeted and capable of taking the variations. the strengths and weaknesses in the individual technology areas. into consideration. Only thereby can ambitious policy be established.
