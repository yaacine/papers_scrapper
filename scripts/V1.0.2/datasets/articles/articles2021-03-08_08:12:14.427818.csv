Three complexes and one tosylated ligand were characterized by X-ray diffraction. In the absence of additional mono- or bidentate ligands. linear tetradentate aminopyridines form distorted square-planar complexes with copper(II). This coordination mode is different from cis-configurations adopted by aminopyridine ligands in octahedral complexes. The degree of the tetrahedral distortion. caused by steric repulsion between pyridine rings. increases with an increase in the chelate ring sizes (555 vs. 656 sequence).

The BF4–. ClO4–. and BPh3CN– salts of the Fe(II) complex of this ligand were also synthesized. The X-ray crystal structure of the BF4– complex (2) at 100 K had Fe–N bond lengths of 1.976 Å. indicative of a low spin Fe(II) complex. while at room temperature. the structure of this complex had a Fe–N bond distance close to 2.07 Å. indicative of an admixture of approximately 50% low-spin and 50% high-spin. The solid-state structure of the complex with a ClO4– counterion was determined at 5 different temperatures between 173 and 293 K. which allowed the thermodynamic parameters for the spin-crossover to be estimated.

Na+ K+. Rb+. Cs+ Tl+ and Ag+) and M2+(Pic−)2 (M2+ = Ca+. Sr+.Ba+. Pb+. and UO2 2+) from water to a chloroform or to a dichloromethane solution. The extractant molecules are mono-podands R-O-(CH2-O-CH2-)n-O-R containing an ether chain and terminal phosphoryl groups: R = (Ph)2P(O)-C6H4 -; n = 3.4 (I - H) and R = (Ph)2P(O)-CH2-C6H4 -. n = 1. 3. 4 (III - V). We found that podand displays a remarkable Ba2+/Ca2+ extraction selectivity. All podands extract alkali and alkaline earth picrates in dichloromethane (as dissociated ion pairs) better than in chloroform (as non-dissociated ion pairs). Based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of the complexes IM2+ and IM2+(Pic−)2 in the gas phase and in chloroform we suggest that the high selectivity of I for Ba2+ is due to (i) the formation of the complex …,True,99qYmzAAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,22,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07366299908934625,4939776662216757348,/scholar?cites=4939776662216757348,,,0,0,0

The first examples of Co(II) paraCEST agents with bound water ligands are presented here. Four Co(II) macrocyclic complexes based on 1.4.7-triazacyclononane and containing either pendent alcohol or pendent amide groups were prepared. Two of the macrocycles encapsulate the Co(II) and contain no water ligands as shown by X-ray crystallographic studies. and two complexes have macrocycles with only five ligand donor groups to leave an open coordination site for bound water. The ionization of alcohol. water. or amide groups in the complexes was characterized by using pH potentiometry. These data show that one of the complexes has a readily deprotonated group with a pKa close to 6. which is assigned as an …,True,99qYmzAAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC,20,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b02977,11680203165930245804,/scholar?cites=11680203165930245804,,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10057642,0,0,0
