1171399,Review of policies and measures for energy efficiency in industry sector,2011,Kanako Tanaka,39,Energy Policy,10,6532-6550,Elsevier,Energy efficiency in industry plays key roles in improving energy security. environmental sustainability and economic performance. It is particularly important in strategies to mitigate climate change. The evidence of great potential for cost-effective efficiency-derived reductions in industrial energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have prompted governments to implement numerous policies and measures aimed at improving their manufacturing industries’ energy efficiency. What can be learned from these many and varied initiatives? This paper provides foundation for policy analysis for enhancing energy efficiency and conservation in industry. by surveying more than 300 policies. encompassing about 570 measures. implemented by governments in IEA countries.

Cambridge. United Kingdom and New York. NY. USA.,An absolute reduction in emissions from the industry sector will require deployment of a broad set of mitigation options beyond energy efficiency measures (medium evidence. high agreement). In the last two to three decades there has been continued improvement in energy and process efficiency in industry. driven by the relatively high share of energy costs. In addition to energy efficiency. other strategies such as emissions efficiency (including eg. fuel and feedstock switching. carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)). material use efficiency (eg. less scrap. new product design). recycling and re-use of materials and products. product service efficiency (eg. car sharing. maintaining buildings for longer. longer life for products). or demand reductions (eg. less mobility services. less product demand) are required in parallel (medium evidence. high agreement).[Section 10.4. 10.7],True,HwcwkRcAAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC,202,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/53224/2/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter10.pdf,10313784533624309648,/scholar?cites=10313784533624309648,,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/53224/2/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter10.pdf,0,0,0

CO2 accounts for more than 90% of CO2-eq GHG emissions from the industrial sector (Price et al.. 2006; US EPA. 2006b). These CO2 emissions arise from three sources:(1) the use of fossil fuels for energy. either directly by industry for heat and power generation or indirectly in the generation of purchased electricity and steam;(2) non-energy uses of fossil fuels in chemical processing and metal smelting; and (3) non-fossil fuel sources. for example cement and lime manufacture. Industrial processes also emit other GHGs. eg: Nitrous oxide (N2O) is emitted as a byproduct of adipic acid. nitric acid and caprolactam production; HFC-23 is emitted as a byproduct of HCFC-22 production. a refrigerant. and also used in fluoroplastics manufacture; Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are emitted as byproducts of aluminium smelting and in semiconductor manufacture; Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is emitted in the manufacture. use and. decommissioning of gas insulated electrical switchgear. during the production of flat screen panels and semiconductors. from magnesium die casting and other industrial applications; Methane (CH4) is emitted as a byproduct of some chemical processes; and CH4 and N2O can be emitted by food industry waste streams.

In this work. we increased the absorption coefficient of the dye cis-(NCS)2 bis(2.2‘-bipyridyl-4.4‘-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) used in such cells by having the dye adsorbed on silver islands. We studied the effect of the surface area of silver (per surface area of substrate) and the effect of dye concentration on this enhancement. This technique significantly enhanced the absorption coefficient of the Ru-dye for the metal−ligand charge-transfer transition. which generates electrons and holes in dye-sensitized solar cells.

1171409,Assessing measures of energy efficiency performance and their application in industry,2008,Kanako Tanaka,,,,,,This paper explores different measures of energy efficiency performance (hereafter referred to as 'MEEP'): absolute energy consumption. energy intensity. diffusion of specific energy-saving technology and thermal efficiency. It discusses their advantages and disadvantages and their roles within policy frameworks. MEEP may be necessary at several stages during policy design: in a developing regulatory framework; during the actual application; and in evaluation after policy implementation. Policy makers should consider the suitability of MEEP at each of these stages. based on criteria such as reliability. feasibility and verifiability. The paper considers the importance of so-called boundary definitions when measuring energy performance. and how these affect the appropriateness of country comparisons to guide policy decisions. The paper also addresses the limitations of both energy intensity and technology diffusion indicators as measures of energy efficiency performance. A case study on Japan's iron and steel industry illustrates the critical role of proper boundary definitions for a meaningful assessment of energy efficiency in industry. Depending on the boundaries set for the analysis. the energy consumption per ton of crude steel ranges from 16 to 21 GJ. Both a proper understanding of various methods to assess energy efficiency and the linkage with policy objectives and frameworks are important. Using the diffusion rates of specific energy-efficient processes is a technology-oriented approach which seeks to encourage the retrofitting or replacement of less efficient equipment.

Some countries in Latin America have already taken first steps towards green fiscal reforms. This paper provides an overview of the major challenges for the successful implementation of such reforms and discusses how they could be overcome. The authors first discuss the role of country-specific economic and political enabling conditions that need to be in place for successful implementation for green successful reforms. Second. they emphasize the importance of comprehensive reform plans that include all relevant ministries and agencies and are well-aligned with other policy objectives. such as energy security and industrial development.

CHP and wind generation,2000,Henrik Lund and Poul Alberg Østergaard,25,Energy,4,299-312,Pergamon,This paper defines two electric grids for the area of Jutland in Denmark. namely the existing grid versus a “nature protection grid”. in which all 400 kV AC overhead lines are replaced by 150 kV lines. According to official Danish policies for laying underground cables. such a replacement makes it economically feasible on a long-term basis to replace all overhead lines with underground cables. The two grids are then tested against different energy demand and supply systems in a load-flow analysis. It is found that the “nature protection grid” is well suited for the implementation of sustainable energy systems exploiting both CHP and renewable energy sources such as wind power if certain strategies for the technical regulation of decentralised CHP units are used.,True,GR6pVioAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,95,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544299000754,3487978427746402052,/scholar?cites=3487978427746402052,,,0,0,0

In this case. wind power only provides economic benefits in terms of saved marginal fuel and operation and maintenance costs. At higher penetrations. it becomes increasingly important for the energy system to be able to operate without costly reserve capacity awaiting fluctuations in demand or wind power generation. Existing transmission interconnections have mainly been established in order to assist in reducing the reserve capacity of thermal power systems.

Many of these models focus on the integration of various renewable energy resources and the transformation of existing fossil-based energy systems into future sustainable energy systems. The models are diverse and often end up with different results and recommendations. This paper analyses this diversity of models and their implicit or explicit theoretical backgrounds. In particular. two archetypes are defined and compared. On the one hand. the prescriptive investment optimisation or optimal solutions approach. On the other hand the analytical simulation or alternatives assessment approach. Awareness of the dissimilar theoretical assumption behind the models clarifies differences between the models. explains dissimilarities in results. and provides a theoretical and methodological foundation for understanding and interpreting results from the two archetypes.

They are obtained from 12 different block copolymers of varying molecular weight (∼10−100 kg/mol) and PEO weight fraction (fw ∼ 0.1−0.8) through addition of different amounts of inorganic components. Eight different morphologies as well as composites with biphasic character are observed. Individual block copolymers show up to five different well-defined morphologies upon addition of the inorganic sols.

We have developed a bottom-up approach to functional. porous. high-temperature ceramics structured on eight distinct length scales integrating functional Pt nanoparticles from the near-atomic to the macroscopic level. Structuring is achieved through a combination of micromolding and multicomponent colloidal self-assembly. The resulting template is filled with a solution containing a solvent. a block copolymer. a ceramic precursor. and a nanoparticle catalyst precursor as well as a radical initiator.

Micropatterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces with pillars of 30 μm length and 10 μm diameter were fabricated using photolithography and moulding. Adhesion properties were determined with a flat probe as a function of preload. For low and moderate applied compressive preloads. measured adhesion was 7.5 times greater than on flat controls whereas for high applied preloads adhesion dropped to very low values. In situ imaging shows that the increased preload caused the pillars to deform by bending and/or buckling and to lose their adhesive contact. The elasticity of PDMS aids the pillar recovery to the upright position upon removal of preload enabling repeatability of the switch.,True,A9jqJ80AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,59,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493110002419,2360862041574842431,/scholar?cites=2360862041574842431,,https://oar.tib.eu/jspui/bitstream/123456789/18/1/inm201126.pdf,0,0,0

Despite the advances. it remains challenging to produce materials that are sticky on demand. In this feature article we highlight recent efforts to develop reversibly switchable adhesives. that exhibit the ability to trigger adhesion in response to an environmental change – for example. pH. solvent. temperature. mechanics. and electro/magnetic field. We review two initially separate design principles to induce switchable adhesion: (1) chemical functionality and (2) topography.

A two-component epoxy system was used to produce epoxy compositions with different viscoelastic properties. Pillar arrays with flat punch tip geometries were fabricated with a two-step soft lithography process. Adhesion properties were measured with a home-built adhesion tester using a spherical sapphire probe as a counter-surface. Compared to flat controls. micropatterned epoxy samples with low viscoelasticity (i.e.. low damping factors) showed at least a 20-fold reduction in pull-off force per actual contact area for both low (E′ = 2.3 MPa) and high (E′ = 2.3 GPa) storage moduli.

Despite this abundance and success. the crosslinking chemistry is still poorly understood. In this study. to simplify the system. yet to capture the essential chemistry. model compounds 4-methyl catechol and propylamine are used. The reaction of 4-methyl catechol (2 mM) with propylamine (6 mM) is carried out in the presence of NaIO4 (2 mM) in 10 mM Na2CO3 aqueous solution. A variety of spectroscopic/spectrometric and chromatographic methods such as 1H NMR. LC-MS. and UV-VIS are used to track the reaction and identify the products/intermediates. It is found that the crosslinking chemistry of a catechol and an amine is both fast and complicated. Within five minutes. more than 60 products are formed. These products encompass 19 different masses ranging from molecular weight of 179 to 704. By combining time-dependent data. it is inferred that the dominant reaction pathways: the majority is formed via aryloxyl-phenol coupling and Michael-type addition. whereas a small fraction of products is formed via Schiff base reactions.,True,A9jqJ80AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,52,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166490,10826427085301519897,/scholar?cites=10826427085301519897,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166490,0,0,0

Pore sizes could be tuned by utilizing block copolymers with different molecular weights. The resulting mesoporous TiO2/carbon was successfully used as an anode material for Li ion batteries. Without addition of conducting aid (Super P). the electrode showed high capacity during the first insertion/desertion cycle due to carbon wiring inside the walls of mesoporous TiO2/carbon. The electrode further showed stable cycle performance up to 50 cycles and the specific charge capacity at 30 C was 38 mA h (g of TiO2)−1. which indicates CCM‐TiO2/carbon can be used as a material for high rate use.        ,True,A9jqJ80AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,46,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/macp.201000687,7536043121281517765,/scholar?cites=7536043121281517765,,,0,0,0
