A large set of temperature and/or concentration dependent optical absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra in a solution of dyads bearing different number of electrons and/or with a hydrogenated PTM residue offer reliable information on the formation of homo dimers and mixed valence dimers. The results shed light on the reciprocal influence of intramolecular electron transfer (IET) within a dyad and the intermolecular charge transfer (CT) occurring in a dimer between the TTF residues and are rationalized based on a theoretical model that describes both interactions.,True,v9hEFyUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,63,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja400281b,12897981166052889896,/scholar?cites=12897981166052889896,,,0,0,0

Specifically. the methylation of the ferrocene unit increases the strength of the donor group stabilizing the zwitterionic state in polar solvents and leading to an intriguing coexistence of neutral and zwitterionic species in solvents of intermediate polarity. Bistability in the crystalline phase is demonstrated by temperature dependent Mössbauer spectra.

In recent years. electroactive organic molecules have also emerged as promising building blocks for the design and construction of crystalline porous frameworks such as metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) for applications in electronics. Such porous materials present certain additional advantages such as. for example. an immense structural and functional versatility. combination of porosity with multiple electronic properties and the possibility of tuning their physical properties by post-synthetic modifications. In this Review. we summarize the main electroactive organic building blocks used in the past few years for the design and construction of functional porous materials (MOFs and COFs) for electronics with special emphasis on their electronic structure and function relationships.

Reported herein is a synthetic route that provides access to Ag–Cu alloys at ambient pressures and temperatures. This method involves solution-depositing a homogeneous mixture of silver(I) 2-ethylhexanoate and copper(II) bis-(2-ethylhexanoate) on a substrate. and photolyzing the thin films with ultraviolet light in an inert dinitrogen atmosphere. This photodeposition procedure is shown to furnish metastable phases of alloys with ∼10 atomic weight% (at%) copper incorporated into the silver lattice.

Effective electrocatalysts can facilitate these conversions in an economical manner. Our group has developed photodeposition techniques for synthesizing amorphous thin-film metal oxide electrocatalysts. The thicknesses of amorphous metal oxide films were determined by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). XRF measurements recorded on the films provided a strong linear correlation with the thicknesses determined by cross-sectional SEM. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) determined by double-layer capacitance measurements did not universally show a linear relationship with film thicknesses. These results highlight the limitations of using ECSA to determine electrocatalyst film thickness. The noninvasive XRF technique is demonstrated to be a superior method for reporting on the thickness and loadings of thin metal oxide films. XRF measurements were made on iron-nickel oxy/hydroxide (FeNiOx) films that are widely known to mediate the oxygen evolution reaction at modest current densities (10 mA cm-²). These measurements enabled the determination of the electrochemical stability and metal composition of these electrocatalyst films when subjected to sustained electrolysis in strong base at a current density J= 200 mA cm-². Most of the iron in the film was liberated during the first 24 h of electrolysis and deposited on the cathode.

In this work. we used a thermal decomposition method to synthesize MnO nanoparticles. and we controlled the reaction temperature and Mn (II): oleylamine: oleic acid ratios to obtain varied sizes ranging from 90 nm to 800 nm. The prepared MnO nanoparticles were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Magnetic measurements (MH loops and MT curves) were used to study the magnetic properties of the prepared MnO nanoparticles. The results showed that surface defects caused surface anisotropy that resulted in low temperature ferromagnetic behavior of the nanoparticles (90 nm–220 nm). The coercivity of 1500 Oe were obtained.

Whilst the X-ray diffraction data for the chiral studied systems display a broad reflection centered at 2q∼ 208 (l= CuKα). the higher crystallinity of OPE 3. endowed with three linear decyl chains. results in a diffractrogram with a number of wellresolved reflections that can be accurately indexed as a columnar packing arranged in 2D oblique cells. Compounds (S)-1a and (R)-1b—endowed with (S)-and (R)-3. 7-dimethyloctyloxy chains—transfer their chirality to the supramolecular structures formed upon their self-assembly. and give rise to helical nanostructures of opposite handedness. A helicity switch is noticeable for the case of chiral (S)-2 decorated with (S)-2-methylnonyloxy chains which forms right-handed helices despite it possesses the same stereoconfiguration for their stereogenic carbons as (S)-1a that self-assembles into left-handed helices. The stability and the mechanism of the supramolecular polymerization in solution have been investigated by UV/Vis experiments in methylcyclohexane. These studies demonstrate that the larger the distance between the stereogenic carbon and the aromatic framework is. the more stable the aggregate is. Additionally. the self-assembly mechanism is conditioned by the peripheral substituents: whereas compounds (S)-1a and (R)-1b self-assemble in a cooperative manner with a low degree of cooperativity. the aggregation of (S)-2 and 3 is well described by an isodesmic model.

It also modifies the surface structure and composition of the host mineral. affecting its crystallization kinetics. Here. we investigate the effect of hexavalent chromium. Cr (VI). on the nucleation and growth of gypsum by conducting two types of experiments:(i) in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) observations of the growth of gypsum {010} surfaces in the presence of Cr (VI) and (ii) gypsum precipitation experiments by mixing aqueous solutions containing variable amounts of Cr (VI). Gypsum precipitation is progressively delayed when occurring from solutions bearing increasing Cr (VI) concentrations. Chemical analyses of gypsum precipitates show that gypsum incorporates small Cr (VI) amounts that correlate with the content of this ion in the aqueous solution. Gypsum cell parameters variation reflects this incorporation. At the molecular scale. Cr (VI) induces a slowdown of step advance rates on gypsum {010} surfaces accompanied by the roughening of nanostep edges and the so-called “template effect”. This effect involves the reproduction of the original nanotopography after the completion of individual advancing monolayers and appears as a general nanoscale phenomenon occurring during growth of solid solutions from aqueous solutions even in the case of compositionally-restricted solid solutions.

Each bis-macrocycle consists of two rings attached to antipodal meso positions of a central Zn porphyrin through single CÀC bonds. Each ring incorporates a 2. 9-diphenyl-1. 10-phenanthroline chelation site. The axles contain two coplanar bidentate sites derived from the 2. 2о-bipyridine motif. The building blocks were assembled by using a one-pot threading-and-stoppering reaction. which afforded the [4] rotaxane in 50% yield. The “gatheringand-threading” effect of copper (I) was utilised in the formation of a [4] pseudorotaxane. which was immediately converted to the corresponding [4] rotaxane by a quadruple CuAAC stoppering reaction. The rotaxane contains two face-to-face zinc porphyrins. which allowed the coordination of ditopic guest substrates.

In this thesis we describe new porphyrin-based multi-rotaxanes. whose syntheses constitute interesting challenges.Porphyrins linked to two or four coordinating macrocycles were synthesised. The ""gathering-andthreading"" effect of copper(I) was used to thread molecular rods through the rings; the subsequent introduction of stoppers led to the formation of rotaxanes. In the case of the porphyrinic bis-macrocycle a [4]rotaxane was obtained. Host/guest complexation studies with rigid nitrogen ligands showed that the rotaxane behaves as a distensible molecular receptor that can adopt an ""inflated"" or ""deflated"" conformation and adjust its shape to the size of the guest.

A novel approach is proposed here. involving the direct grafting of silica surfaces with the aid of a siloxydithiocarbamate precursor.

The growing interest in such organic modifications can be attributed to the characteristics of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) materials. Moreover. the amorphous character of their frameworks offers a large number of available silanol groups that can easily react with various functional groups and allows the strong and stable coupling of organic moieties to the silica network. An important attention has been also given to the shape modeling of these hybrid materials with a particular effort on the elaboration of thin films and monoliths.

1211767,Low-temperature fabrication of aluminium oxide thin films,2010,Xiaofei Duan,,,,,,Chemical and structural characteristics of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) exhibit key properties of the material. Metastable γ. δ and θ-Al2O3 are important in catalytic industry. gas-sensing and optical devices. These transitional phases can be converted to the thermally stable α phase. which has a hexagonal close-packing structure and exhibits excellent thermal stability. chemical and wearing resistance. and rigidity.                                              Processing conditions for crystalline films can vary depending upon the degree of crystallinity required. Typical formation of θ-Al2O3 from boehmite (γ-AlOOH) by heating requires a significantly high temperature exceeding 800°C.                                              This thesis reports the fabrication of Al2O3 thin films on Si <1 0 0> wafers at a temperature of 500 °C (amorphous) and 550°C (crystalline). This was achieved through a unique approach utilising a novel single-source chemical vapour deposition (SSCVD) technique. The precursor was designed to have structurally octahedral Al-O cores enshrouded by large carbamate ligands. which increase the molecule’s volatility but are easily removable upon decomposition. It also showed the growth orientation α <1 1 3> formed at 10-6 Torr was different from δ <4 0 0> formed at 10-2 Torr. suggesting the thermally stable phase was produced at a lower background pressure.                                              For comparison. a solvothermal approach using the same precursor in a high pressure autoclave produced Al2O3 thin films at temperatures as low as 65°C. The low-temperature decomposition of aluminium diisopropyl-carbamate was elucidated to be via the β-elimination of the …,True,SD7CH28AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/35778,,,,https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/35778/265737_Duan_final%20dessertation_eVersion.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Infrared spectra of a colloidal stearate-capped ZnO catalyst substrate were assigned at room temperature using zinc stearate as a reference compound. Heating was shown to create a monodentate species that allowed conformational change to occur. leading to altered binding geometry of the stearate ligands upon cooling. CO2 and H2 adsorption measurements demonstrated that the ligand shell was permeable and did not cover the entire surface. allowing adsorption and reaction with at least some portion of the ZnO surface. It has been demonstrated that stearate ligands did not prevent the usual chemisorption processes involved in catalytic reactions on a model ZnO catalyst system. yet the ligand-support system is dynamic under …,True,Y4hrBOQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1366/13-07174,3884325848777638422,/scholar?cites=3884325848777638422,,,0,0,0

1211792,Novel Organometallic Mixed Valence Complexes,2010,NEIL BROWN,,,,,,Organometallic mixed valence complexes have been studied extensively over the past 30 years providing many synthetic and theoretical challenges. This thesis has sought to provide the field with a unique family of mixed valence complexes through which theories of electron transfer in weakly coupled systems can be tested. The metal fragment Mo(dppe)(η7-C7H7) is unique amongst its half-sandwich counterparts providing low formal oxidation states and a well resolved EPR signal and forms the basis of these studies. Before undertaking a study of the electronic structure of [{(Mo(dppe)(η7-C7H7)}2{μ- C≡CXC≡C}]n+ systems. and associated issues regarding mixed valence characteristics and carbon-chain mediated metal-metal interactions. mono-metallic molybdenum acetylide complexes that serve as model systems were studied in detail and their electronic structure fully rationalised. Thus. in Chapter two. a range of para substituted molybdenum aryl acetylides. Mo(C≡CC6H4X-4)(dppe)(η7-C7H7). featuring a range of electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents. are described. These compounds have been studied using a range of spectroscopic. crystallographic. electrochemical. spectroelectrochemical. and computational techniques establishing metal centred oxidation character. This is a consequence of cycloheptatrienyl ring destabilising the filled dz2 metal d-orbtial which then forms the HOMO. The poor symmetry match of this dz2 orbital and the alkynyl π-system effectively decouples the molybdenum fragment from the alkynyl substituent.

The vast majority of syntheses require the use of an organic structure‐directing agent (OSDA). which has economic and environmental shortcomings. In the search for alternative zeolites to common industrial catalysts. such as ZSM‐5 (MFI). a promising candidate is ZSM‐11 (MEL). a close structural analogue of MFI. ZSM‐11 is comprised of 3‐dimensional straight channels that have less diffusion limitations than MFI. Side‐by‐side comparisons of ZSM‐11 and ZSM‐5 catalysts reveal the former exhibits significantly longer time‐on‐stream lifetime in many reactions; however. there are several difficulties associated with the preparation of ZSM‐11. which include the ability to identify inexpensive OSDAs that produce small crystals in high yield.

The rational design of these OSDAs often entails the identification of molecules with a geometry that is commensurate with the channels and cages of the target zeolite structure. Syntheses tend to employ only a single OSDA. but there are a few examples where two or more organics operate synergistically to yield a desired product.

These monomers have been copolymerized into films with the conventional aliphatic acrylic monomer 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) using neat cast mixed monomer films and photoinitiation.

The electrochemical behavior of SiCoNP modified electrode showed two redox couples. the first and second redox couples were observed at anodic potential (Epa) 1= 0.36 and 0.60 V vs. Ag/AgCl attributed to the oxidation of Co (II) to Co (III) and Fe (II)(CN) 5NO/Fe (III)(CN) 5NO. respectively. The modified carbon paste electrode with SiCoNP was tested in the hydrazine electrooxidation. In the hydrazine electrooxidation. the H+ release was observed and the two metal centers are involved in this process. The proposed mechanism has been described and based on studies of the effect of hydrogen ion concentration in the redox process of bivalent compound formed. Thus a large increase in hydrogen ion concentration promotes the formation of an intermediate electroactive species with an anodic peak at 0.56 V. The nature of this species is not well established but may be related to protonation of cyanide or NO groups present.

For instance. at neutral pH. t1/2 = 30 min are found for DBT degradation and mineralization. In neutral and acid media the rate limiting step for mineralization is the same as for degradation and corresponds to the DBT sulfone formation. Benzaldehyde is the major reaction product. In addition. it also acts as an intermediate in the mineralization to CO2 + water + sulfate. The results support the Langmuir–Hinshelwood degradation mechanism. Therefore. instead of pseudo-first-order rate constants. apparent rate constants that depend on concentration are obtained. Only at basic pH these apparent rate constant are independent of the [DBT]0.

The green modification process can be carried out on any lignocellulosic material. for example. chemical. chemi-thermomechanical or thermo-mechanical pulps. bleached or unbleached.

Inc.,The consumption of natural gas (NG) is rapidly increasing worldwide as it is becoming the second largest fuel source after coal. However. many of the world gas reserves contain high levels of subquality NG including the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2). hydrogen sulfide (H2S). nitrogen (N2). benzene/toluene/xylene (BTX) etc.. in varying amounts (up to 50% v/v in some reserves). which constitute several problems. Membrane‐based NG sweetening/upgrading processes emerge as among the fastest growing technologies. due to their lower capital cost. higher energy savings. greater economic viability. etc. as compared to conventional technologies. Thus. a defective‐free. multilayer thin‐film composite membrane is developed from 6FDA‐Durene/6FDA‐CARDO block co‐polyimide for the separation of sour gas from NG.

Such biosensors have become particularly important for probing biased signaling and allostery in G protein-coupled receptor drug screening efforts. However. assumptions about the portability of such biosensors between cell types may lead to misinterpretation of drug effects on specific signaling pathways in a given cellular context.

Notch-regulated target genes before and after T lineage commitment change dynamically. and we show that this partially reflects shifts in genome-wide DNA binding by RBPJ. the transcription factor activated by complex formation with the Notch intracellular domain.

Because of limited availability of high quality antibodies against GPCRs. much of the work done on β2AR took advantage of heterologous expression systems. Overexpressed proteins may overwhelm the cellular regulatory machinery leading potentially to responses distinct from the native protein. To address this issue we generated a stable cell line with a tetracycline-inducible β2AR tagged with a FLAG epitope. such that we are able to control the quantity of receptor produced. This allows us to induce a discrete pulse of FLAG-β2AR transcription and translation allowing us to follow the complete life cycle of the protein from synthesis as an immature protein to degradation.

However. existing method of profiling mRNAs effectively averages transcriptional dynamics over many hours due to hours-long life time of most mRNAs. To capture the instantaneous activity of the transcriptome that reflects the rapid regulatory changes in cells. we imaged up to 10.421 nascent transcription active sites (TAS) in single mouse embryonic stem cells using seqFISH followed by multiple rounds of single molecule FISH and immunofluorescence. We observed that nascent transcription active sites appear to be distributed on the surface of individual chromosome territories and are dispersed throughout the nucleus. In addition. there are significant variability in the number of active transcription sites in single cells. representing globally more active to quiescent states. These states interconverted on the time scale of 2 hours as determined by a single cell pulse-chase experiment.

VO2(PLAG−H) (2) and K[VO2(PLAG−2H)]∙H2O (3) have been synthesized and    characterized by IR and UV-Vis spectral analysis and in case of 1 and 3 by    X-ray crystallography as well. The reaction of aqueous ammoniacal solution of    NH4VO3 and PLAG resulted in formation of 1. which in MeOH undergoes    spontaneous transformation into 2. which. in turn. in the reaction with KOH    transforms into 3. In these complexes PLAG is coordinated in a common    tridentate ONN mode. via phenoxide oxygen atom and nitrogen atoms of    azomethine and imino groups of the aminoguanidine fragment. In all previously    characterized complexes PLAG was coordinated in neutral form.

We show in this work that phagocytic uptake of apoptotic cells or bodies. in the absence of serum or soluble survival factors. inhibits apoptosis and maintains viability of primary cultures of murine peritoneal and bone marrow Mφ with a potency approaching that of serum-supplemented medium. Apoptotic uptake also profoundly inhibits the proliferation of bone marrow Mφ stimulated to proliferate by M-CSF. While inhibition of proliferation is an unusual property for survival factors. the combination of increased survival and decreased proliferation may aid the Mφ in its role as a scavenger during resolution of inflammation.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about a quarter of the diseases facing mankind today occur due to prolonged exposure to environmental pollution. However most of these environment-related diseases are not easily detected and may be acquired during childhood and manifested later in adulthood. Toxic pollution occurs when synthetic chemicals are discharged or natural chemicals accumulate to toxic levels in the environment. causing reductions in wildlife numbers. degrading ecosystem functions and threatening human health. Environmental toxicology is a relatively recent field that examines the occurrence of. exposure to. and form of toxicants in the environment. and the comparative effects of these toxicants on different organisms.

Using pH potentiometric UV–vis titrations and stopped-flow kinetic measurements. it was shown that the dominant Cr(VI) species are Cr2O72−. HCrO4− and CrO42− in an aqueous solution of Cr(VI) under ambient conditions ([Cr(VI)] = 7.7 mM–155 mM. pH = 2–11. I = 1.00 M NaClO4. T = 25.0 °C). This paper provides a comprehensive interpretation of the kinetic features of the dimerization equilibria of Cr(VI) in the acidic – alkaline pH range from pH 2 to 11. Under acidic conditions. the conversion of HCrO4− and Cr2O72− is catalyzed by H+. This observation is consistent with the formation of a protonated intermediate. which is presumably HCr2O7−. The forward and backward rate constants for the 2 HCrO4− ⇌ Cr2O72− + H2O reaction were determined at various pH …,True,-_CI8uEAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020169317303948,4595284935036754325,/scholar?cites=4595284935036754325,,,0,0,0
1212103,A redox strategy to tailor the release properties of Fe (III)-alginate aerogels for oral drug delivery,2018,Péter Veres and Dániel Sebők and Imre Dékány and Pavel Gurikov and Irina Smirnova and István Fábián and József Kalmár,188,Carbohydrate polymers,,159-167,Elsevier,Iron(III)-crosslinked alginate aerogel beads (d = 3–5 mm) were prepared and loaded with ibuprofen by using the technique of adsorptive deposition from supercritical CO2. Additional formulations were prepared where the aerogels were co-impregnated by ibuprofen and ascorbic acid. The release of ibuprofen from the Fe(III)-alginate is much faster in pH = 7.4 (PBS) than in pH = 2.0 (HCl). which can be explained by the faster dissolution and higher swelling of the alginate matrix in PBS. By decreasing the size of the beads and using a higher G content alginate the release rate could be slightly increased. A marked acceleration of drug release was achieved in both HCl and PBS by incorporating ascorbic acid into the Fe(III)-alginate aerogel preparations. The explanation is that in aqueous media ascorbic acid in situ reduces the crosslinking Fe(III) to Fe(II). The latter does not interact strongly with alginate. which …,True,-_CI8uEAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,25,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144861718301243,1101666629088262637,/scholar?cites=1101666629088262637,,http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/17012/1/3327895_CARBPOL-D-17-04182-R1_MS.pdf,0,0,0

It is shown that both of these schemes are easily confused with the reversible second–order reaction in a routine kinetic study. The kinetic traces predicted by both schemes are sufficiently close to pseudo–first–order curves so that it is practically impossible to identify the deviations based on data with the usual experimental errors. which was also demonstrated by fitting simulated theoretical curves to exponential functions. The dependence of the pseudo–first–order rate constants on the concentration of the excess reagent features the same trend as in the case of a reversible reaction: A straight line with an intercept is observed.

The model system for the kinetic experiments is the hydrolysis and condensation of titanium(IV)-bis(ammonium-lactato)dihydroxide under basic conditions. The formation of nanoparticles was followed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV–vis spectrometric methods. The turbidity (i.e.. the apparent absorbance at 500 nm) of a stable TiO2 suspension is shown to be proportional to the TiO2 concentration at a constant particle size and proportional to the size at a constant Ti concentration. The compilation of the DLS and UV–vis data yields characteristic sigmoid-shaped kinetic curves for the evolution of particle size.

Eu 3+. Tb 3+. Er 3+. and Tm 3+. with 9. 10-anthracenedicarboxylic acid (H 2 ADC) in dimethylformamide (DMF) under hydrothermal conditions. The 3-D networks crystalize in the triclinic system with P-1 space group with the following compositions:(i){{[Ln 2 (ADC) 3 (DMF) 4· DMF]} n. Ln= Eu (1) and Tb (2)} and (ii){{[Ln 2 (ADC) 3 (DMF) 2 (OH 2) 2· 2DMF· H 2 O]} n. Ln= Er (3) and Tm (4)}. The metal centers exist in various coordination environments; nine coordinate in (i). while seven and eight coordinate in (ii). The deprotonated ligand. ADC. assumes multiple coordination modes. with its carboxylate functional groups severely twisted away from the plane of the anthracene moiety. The structures show ligand-based photoluminescence. which appears to be significantly quenched when compared with that of the parent H 2 ADC solid powder. Structure 2 is the least quenched and showed an average photoluminescence lifetime from bi-exponential decay of 0.3 ns. On exposure to ionizing radiation. the structures show radioluminescence spectral features that are consistent with the isolation of the ligand units in its 3-D network. The spectral features vary among the 3-D networks and appear to suggest that the latter undergo significant changes in their molecular and/or electronic structure in the presence of the ionizing radiation.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Poly[4‐(4‐vinylbenzyloxy)‐2‐hydroxylbenzaldehyde] was evaluated for removing low concentrations of lead(II) in ppb levels from aqueous media. The effects of the pH condition and the initial lead concentrations on removal were examined. It was found that the metal absorption is best described with the Langmuir model. The RL values obtained between 0.01 and 0.23 indicate that favorable absorption occurs in the studied concentration ranges. The kinetic study revealed that the metal removal proceeds at a very fast pace—less than 30 s—to reach the maximum capacity. The data fit the description of pseudo–second‐order rate.

1212158,Quinoline scaffold as a privileged substructure in antimicrobial drugs,2011,R Musiol and T Magdziarz and A Kurczyk,,"Science against microbial pathogens: communicating current research and technological advances. Badajoz, Spain: Formatex",,72-83,,Drug design is a complex issue that still lack general approach with proven reliability. Combinatorial chemistry and HTS techniques did not appear to be effort-effective. As an alternative we have the fragment based design and more recently so called the privileged structures approach. We believe that some structural subunits are especially effective in design of bioeffectors. However it is not clear what makes one molecular scaffold more privileged than another. Overall frequency of appearance of molecular scaffold in bioactive compounds or natural substances may be used as a good factor of qualitative discriminator of privileged structures. According this. the quinoline scaffold. due to its frequent appearance in bioactive substances can be regarded as a privileged structure. It is abundant in number of natural compounds such as alkaloids: quinine. camptothecin or cinchonidine. In synthetic medicinal chemistry the quinoline motif is widely exploited revealing a spectrum of activity covering anticancer. antifungal. antibacterial and antiprotozoic effects. In fact. introducing chloroquine into treatment of malaria more than 60 years ago triggered a new era of quickly developing antimicrobial drugs through nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones. In this review we wish to explore antimicrobial quinolines as an important class of drugs from both natural and synthetic sources.,True,Ipa707MAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,18,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Musiol/publication/224054184_Quinoline_scaffold_as_a_privileged_substructure_in_antimicrobial_drugs/links/00b4952b094b15a3f0000000/Quinoline-scaffold-as-a-privileged-substructure-in-antimicrobial-drugs.pdf,13621240022008642417,/scholar?cites=13621240022008642417,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Musiol/publication/224054184_Quinoline_scaffold_as_a_privileged_substructure_in_antimicrobial_drugs/links/00b4952b094b15a3f0000000/Quinoline-scaffold-as-a-privileged-substructure-in-antimicrobial-drugs.pdf,0,0,0

Recent advances emphasize the importance of understanding the whole chain of causal events leading to observable toxic outcomes. Here we describe an integrative modeling strategy based on these ideas that guided the design of eTOXsys. the prediction system used by the eTOX project. Essentially. eTOXsys consists of a central server that marshals requests to a collection of independent prediction models and offers a single user interface to the whole system. Every of such model lives in a self‐contained virtual machine easy to maintain and install. All models produce toxicity‐relevant predictions on their own but the results of some can be further integrated and upgrade its scale. yielding in vivo toxicity predictions.

In our research. we applied a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and a water tracking approach to describe the water accessible volume of Solanum tuberosum epoxide hydrolase. Using water as a molecular probe. we were able to identify small cavities linked with the active site:(i) one made up of conserved amino acids and indispensable for the proper positioning of catalytic water and (ii) two others in which modification can potentially contribute to enzyme selectivity and activity. Additionally. we identified regions suitable for de novo tunnel design that could also modify the catalytic properties of the enzyme. The identified hot-spots extend the list of the previously targeted residues used for modification of the regioselectivity of the enzyme.

Initial precursor interaction with the TiN(O) surface at 450 K results in an ad-layer consisting of Cu(I)hfac and hfac. Subsequent exposure to atomic deuterium at 450 K results in volatilization of organic species and reduction of Cu(I) to Cu(0).

1212199,Surface Effects in the MOCVD of Copper,1994,GM Nuesca and J Prasad and JA Kelber,337,MRS Online Proceedings Library (OPL),,,Cambridge University Press,Recent findings concerning the surface chemistry of Cu(I)) and Cu(II) betadiketonate precursors on metal and TiN surfaces are reviewed. Interactions of Cu(I) hexafluoroacetylacetonate (L) (Cu(I)(hfac)(L); L=Lewis base) with the surface result in an adsorbed Cu(I)hfac intermediate. Cu(II)(hfac)2 adsorbtion yields the Cu(I)hfac intermediate plus adsorbed hfac. Subsequent exposure to atomic hydrogen volatilizes the adsorbed hfac and results in the reduction of Cu(I) via disproportionation: 2Cu(I)(hfac) ⇒ Cu(0) + Cu(II)(hfac)2 (desorbed). These results demonstrate that disproportionation can occur on contaminant free surfaces under UHV conditions. and that the mechanisms for Cu(I) and Cu(II)/H2 film growth are similar.

It is well-known that Hh regulates the activity of the Gli family of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors in mammals. In Drosophila the function of the Gli proteins is performed by a single transcription factor with an identical DNA binding consensus sequence. Cubitus Interruptus (Ci). We have demonstrated previously that conjugation of a specific 17 base-pair oligonucleotide to a Co(III) Schiff base complex results in a targeted inhibitor of the Snail family C2H2 zinc finger …,True,tk0EOBwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,49,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/mp2005577,15784359945501427018,/scholar?cites=15784359945501427018,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3313626/,0,0,0

Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) occurs from a Ru(II) bipyridal complex to a covalently attached Co(III) complex and is gated by conformational changes that occur in tens of nanoseconds. Reduction of the Co(III)-sb by PET initiates displacement of the inert axial imidazole ligands. promoting coordination to active site histidines of α-thrombin. Upon exposure to 455 nm light. the rate of ligand exchange with 4-methylimidazole. a histidine mimic. increases by approximately 5-fold. as observed by NMR spectroscopy.

The concept of refractive index “before mixing” is introduced and shown to be given by the volume‐fraction mixing rule of the pure‐component refractive indices (Arago–Biot formula). The refractive index of thermodynamically ideal liquid mixtures is demonstrated to be given by the volume‐fraction mixing rule of the pure‐component squared refractive indices (Newton formula). This theoretical formulation entails a positive change of refractive index upon ideal mixing. which is interpreted in terms of dissimilar London dispersion forces centred in the dissimilar molecules making up the mixture.

An important function of carbon nanotubes is to improve transport of electrons within the film. Co-deposition of the peroxidase enzyme together with the cobalt porphyrin catalytic centers leads to bifunctional synergistic effect that is evident from sizeable positive shift of the oxygen reduction potentials and significant increase of voltammetric currents. The bio-electrocatalytic system also exhibits relatively much higher reductive activity towards hydrogen peroxide.

1212326,New strategies in the electroctalytic reduction of oxygen for fuel and biofuel cells,,Paweł J Kulesza and Katarzyna A Karnicka and Andrzej Ernst and Beata Baranowska and Magdalena Skunik,,,,,,Platinum has been established as the most powerful electrocatalyst for the 4-electron reduction of oxygen to water in acid medium in a conventional fuel cell. The reaction becomes less efficient and its efficiency suffers from the formation of the hydrogen peroxide intermediate at lower Pt loadings or at higher current densities. Recent progress in the area concerns fabrication of electrocatalysts in a form of carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles assembled within organized multilayers or inks deposited on a proton-conducting membrane. Important issues include the stabilization of Pt nanoparticles (to prevent their agglomeration causing decrease of the active surface area). the enhancement of their reactivity (eg by modification of their surfaces or by formation of novel bimetallic systems). the interfacial protection of nanostructured Pt from poisoning (eg by the development of methanol or CO tolerant systems using …,True,88tKI4wAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7502126774794384915&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Most of research concerns alkanothiols and their derivatives that can be successfully employed to obtain monolayer coverages on gold. An interesting alternative originates from the possibility of self-assembling inorganic (eg polyoxometallate) monolayers because they provide potentially better stability. and they undergo reversible stepwise electron transfer reactions of importance to such technologies as electrocatalysis. electrochromism. molecular electronics and sensing. We have recently pursued the concept based on multiple formation of two-dimensional arrays composed alternately of a conducting polymer. such as polyaniline or polypyrrole. and a heteropolyanion of molybdenum or tungsten.

From the perspective of our research. it is important to learn about consumer attitudes. of a specific product. such as honey. so as to potentially strengthen the economic position of honey producers. The purpose of this article was to explore the consumers’ perceptions of organic and local honey in the Republic of Serbia and identify factors that contribute to predicting consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for organic and local honey. The ordinal regression was used to determine which factors influence the WTP for organic and local honey. and the findings show that the consumers were WTP more for organic honey than for local honey. Socio-economic characteristics of respondents and honey attributes affect consumers’ WTP. The higher monthly household income positively influences the WTP for organic honey. while on the other hand. the higher level of education has a positive influence on the WTP for local honey. The WTP for organic honey positively affected by the perceived importance of honey attributes. such as food safety and support for the local community. The frequency of the purchase of the local honey. the recommendations for the local honey purchase and the perceived importance of attributes. such as the care for the environment and nutritional properties. have a positive influence on the consumers’ WTP for local honey.

For this purpose. two types of ceramic roofing tiles (extruded and pressed) aged 6 to 10 years were examined. as well as ceramic model systems formed with Cu-slag and Cu-oxide powder additions. The identified lichen family was Verrucariales. The fundamental interactions between lichens and the ceramic materials have been identified as the physico-chemical processes based on oxalic acid action which cause the aging and finally thedestruction of materials. Cu-oxide as the raw mixture additive changed the quality of the surface tile. having a positive effect on the response of the ceramic tiles to the oxalic acid action.

1212363,Statistical models for the prediction of shear strength parameters at Sirsa. India,2014,Surendra Roy and Gurcharan Dass,4,International Journal of Civil and Structural Engineering,4,483,Integrated Publishing Association,Shear strength is the principal engineering property of soil. which controls the stability of a soil mass under structural loads. Therefore. it is always required to measure before design of foundation of any structure. In this study. a detailed survey was carried out within a 5 km radius of Sirsa and 10 locations were identified for soil sampling. The soil samples were collected at 50 cm depth from ground surface and analysed for different geotechnical properties like bulk density. dry density. natural moisture content. specific gravity. particle size. liquid limit. plastic limit. plasticity index and shear strength parameters (cohesion and angle of shearing resistance). With the help of particle size distribution curves. coefficient of uniformity and coefficient of curvature were evaluated to find out the gradation of particles. Influence of the geotechnical properties on shear strength parameters was studied. Stepwise regression procedure was carried out for the selection of most influencing variables. Incorporating selected variables. multiple regression models were developed for the prediction of shear strength parameters. The performance of the multiple regression models were assessed in terms of correlation coefficient. F-statistics and residuals pattern.

Numerical results show that on curved paths. high scanning speeds lowers the temperatures and results in narrower features produced. It was found that generated patterns are symmetric with respect to centerline of heating trajectory. unless large beam spots are used at very high curvature paths. Theoretical predictions show that excessively high scanning speeds also result in an asymmetry of temperature field. Peak temperatures decrease at highly curved paths (R/w0 < 10); this decrease is more pronounced as the scanning speed is increased. It is shown that no feature size broadening will occur at the cross junctions. but a slight increase in feature size is expected near vertex of …,True,f7D--jcAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/asp/jctn/2008/00000005/00000010/art00013,2406522923589198148,/scholar?cites=2406522923589198148,,,0,0,0

1212452,Patterning Self-assembled Monolayers on Gold Using a Laser Beam,2007,Mohammad Reza Shadnam,,,,,,One of the unique properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) is that SAMs can systematically modify certain properties of substrates. eg wettability and adhesion. depending on their tail group. Therefore. SAMs have been patterned using several methods. A “Direct Laser Patterning”(DLP) methodology has been developed to manipulate surface wetting properties using a SAM on gold film (alkanethiol type). In DLP a focused Argon laser beam causes the SAM to thermally desorb in desired regions and leave bare substrate behind. which is subsequently backfilled with another alkanethiol of interest through solution deposition. The kinetics of SAM desorption into gaseous media under ambient pressure is also considered using curve fitting of experimentally measured SAM coverage data at different temperatures to the Eyring equation.

This process is a key step in making patterned surfaces. In many applications making curvilinear features is useful. Heating of a surface by a CW laser along a nonlinear trajectory is considered using Green's functions. Temperature profiles are calculated for heating along circular-arc trajectories of different curvatures. The effect of heating trajectory's radius of curvature and heating spot's velocity (Laser scanning rate) on resulting surface temperature is studied. It is shown that within the range of parameters considered. the induced surface temperature profiles are symmetric. It is also shown that change of heating trajectory's radius of curvature by one order of magnitude at heating velocity of 0.1 mm/s changes the induced surface temperatures by 12 K; this temperature increase will be 36 K at 1 mm/s.

In this work. we explore the NN bond cleaving ability of a high-spin iron(II) hydride dimer with concomitant release of H2. Specifically. this diiron(II) complex reacts with azobenzene (PhNNPh) to perform a four-electron reduction. where two electrons come from H2 reductive elimination and the other two come from iron oxidation. The rate law of the H2 releasing reaction indicates that diazene binding occurs prior to H2 elimination. and the negative entropy of activation and inverse kinetic isotope effect indicate that H–H bond formation is the rate-limiting step. Thus. substrate binding causes reductive elimination of H2 that formally reduces the metals. and the metals use the additional two electrons to cleave the N–N multiple bond.,True,XusoYpkAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,26,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b04654,7073186380841998718,/scholar?cites=7073186380841998718,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5499983/,0,0,0

Med. Chem. Int. J,,1-5,,Introduction Nanotechnology is versatile subject. which deals with biology. chemistry. physics and engineering. The term “Nano” is derived from Greek word which means dwarf and size of particle varies from 1-100nm [1]. Nanotechnology is the synthesis of nanoparticles which exhibit different sizes. shapes and morphology. Nanoparticles being very small in size posses large surface area to volume ratio due to which nanoparticles exhibit very different properties such as electrical. magnetic and optical properties than its bulk material [2]. In nanoparticle synthesis it is very important to control not only the particle size but also the particle shape and morphology as well. Therefore. controlling the shape and structure of nanoparticles seems to be the most attractive fields of current research.Nanoparticles and nano devices contain potential to reduce pollutants such as water and air pollutants which can be used for efficient alternate energy production. Nanoparticles show activity against bacteria. fungus as well as Virus. Various chemical and physical methods are known for preparation of silver and other metal nanoparticles. These methods are very costly and toxic to the environment [3]. The use of plant parts like seed. fruit. bark. stem. leaf etc. for the synthesis of nanoparticles is quite novel method compared to the chemical and physical method [4]. This is cost effective and easily scaled up process. Photo chemicals present in the plant posses anti-oxidant or reducing properties which are responsible for reduction of metal compounds. Methods used for the synthesis of nanoparticles are eco-friendly. bio-compatible. non-toxic and clean [5].,True,XusoYpkAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,25,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prabhuodeyara_M_Gurubasavaraj/publication/320101348_Organic_Medicinal_Chem_IJ_Effect_of_Concentration_and_pH_on_the_Size_of_Silver_Nanoparticles_Synthesized_by_Green_Chemistry/links/59ce1a51458515cc6aaa032b/Organic-Medicinal-Chem-IJ-Effect-of-Concentration-and-pH-on-the-Size-of-Silver-Nanoparticles-Synthesized-by-Green-Chemistry.pdf,6373907283970892918,/scholar?cites=6373907283970892918,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Prabhuodeyara_M_Gurubasavaraj/publication/320101348_Organic_Medicinal_Chem_IJ_Effect_of_Concentration_and_pH_on_the_Size_of_Silver_Nanoparticles_Synthesized_by_Green_Chemistry/links/59ce1a51458515cc6aaa032b/Organic-Medicinal-Chem-IJ-Effect-of-Concentration-and-pH-on-the-Size-of-Silver-Nanoparticles-Synthesized-by-Green-Chemistry.pdf,0,0,0

Cham,Generation of highly Lewis acidic metal center in a catalytic system has been one of the key challenges in olefin polymerization. Highly acidic metal center can easily bind with a nucleophilic monomer and starts the polymerization process. With this objective in mind. we categorically designed and synthesized catalysts containing enhanced Lewis acidic metal centers of catalytically active metal centers with enhanced Lewis acidity. We have developed a carefully designed synthetic approach of introducing oxygen between two different metal centers to produce multimetallic systems. The attachment of the oxygen between the two metal centers also brings the metals into close proximity at the molecular level. resulting in a pronounced chemical communication between the metals. The compounds containing covalently bridged metal centers have often modified the fundamental properties of the individual metal …,True,XusoYpkAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3418_2019_29,,,,,0,0,0

These oxides can also act as catalysts themselves and can serve as models for the catalyst-substrate interaction. 2-5 In this context. the study of transition metal oxides is not only an attractive subject of academic research but also relevant to the applied aspects of their chemistry. The immense research interest in this field of organometallic oxides is initiated by the remarkable properties of methylaluminoxane (MAO) as activator for metallocene catalysts in olefin polymerization6. 7 and the valuable catalytic properties of organorhenium oxides. 8The main disadvantage of these heterogeneous transition metal oxides is that they have complicated structural features and are insoluble in solvents advantageous for polymerization reactions. Investigations by Sinn and Kaminsky9 revealed that soluble metallocene catalysts in combination with methylaluminoxane achieve extremely high activities in the polymerization of olefins leading to the new developments in this field. These investigations are accompanied by an increased understanding of the factors that are important for stabilizing polymerizationactive metal centers and controlling their activity and selectivity.

The expression of RBD. engineered with a sortase-recognition motif for protein-based carrier coupling. was achieved at high yields by plasmid transient transfection or human type-5-adenoviral infection of the cells. in a period of only two and three weeks. respectively. Both production methods were evaluated in 3L-controlled bioreactors with upstream and downstream bioprocess improvements. resulting in a product recovery with over 95% purity.

The monosaccharide and sialic acid content was similar in the RBD protein from the two production approaches. It also exhibited a proper conformational structure as recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against key native Spike epitopes.

This led to the production of three new compounds. identified as acyl tetramic acids. and numerous minor metabolites. Consideration of the structures of these compounds indicates that the putative C‐terminal thiolester reductase (R) domain does not act as a reductase. but appears to act as a Dieckmann cyclase (DKC).

Expression of ACE1 alone produced a polyenyl pyrone (magnaporthepyrone). which is regioselectively epoxidised and hydrolysed to give different diols. 6 and 7. in the two host organisms. Analysis of the three introns present in ACE1 determined that A. oryzae does not process intron 2 correctly. while M. oryzae processes all introns correctly in both appressoria and mycelia. Co-expression of ACE1 and RAP1 in A. oryzae produced an amide 8 which is similar to the PKS-NRPS derived backbone of the cytochalasans.

This structure is similar to that of ferricrocin synthetase. which makes a siderophore that is involved in intracellular iron storage in other filamentous fungi. Heterologous expression of FSN1 in Aspergillus oryzae resulted in the accumulation of a secreted metabolite that was identified as ferrirhodin. This siderophore was found to be present in both mycelium and culture filtrates of F. sacchari. whereas ferricrocin is found only in the mycelium. thus suggesting that ferricrocin is an intracellular storage siderophore in F. sacchari. whereas ferrirhodin is used for iron acquisition.

The precision of the loadings is considered important because these estimates are often utilized to interpret chemometric models or selection of meaningful wavenumbers. Standard laboratory chemistry methods were employed on a mixed genus/species hardwood sample set. PLS and PCR. before and after 1st derivative pretreatment. was utilized for model building and loadings investigation. As demonstrated by others. PLS was found to provide better predictive diagnostics. However. PCR exhibited a more precise estimate of loading peaks which makes PCR better for interpretation. Application of the 1st derivative appeared to assist in improving both PCR and PLS loading precision. but due to the small sample size. the two chemometric methods could not be compared statistically. This work is important because to date most research works have committed to PLS because it yields better predictive performance.

Normally. several kinds of plant fibrous materials used in one process are needed to be identified and characterized in advance. It is easy to identify them when they are in raw condition. However. most of the materials are semi products which are ground. rotted or pre-hydrolyzed. To classify these samples which include different species with high accuracy is a big challenge. In this research. both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were chosen to classify six different species of samples. including softwood. hardwood. bast and aquatic plant. Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) and partial least squares (PLS) were used. The algorithm to classify different species of samples using PLS was created independently in this research. Results found that the six species can be successfully classified using SIMCA and PLS methods. and these two methods show similar results. The identification rates of kenaf. ramie and pine are 100%. and the identification rates of lotus. eucalyptus and tallow are higher than 94%.

The shear strength of the adhered strands was calculated to examine the effect of bio-oil addition on epoxy resin performance. The chemical structure. curing behavior. and microstructure were investigated to analyze the interaction between wood substrate and resins. Results showed that the strength of pine wood-resin joints gradually decreased as more bio-oil was added. However. this effect was not apparent when the substitution rate was lower than 30%. ATR-FTIR analysis confirmed that complex chemical reactions take place between wood constituents and epoxy/bio-oil resins involved in the cross-linking at the interface. The reaction degree of-OH and COC functional groups plays a key role in regulating the bonding stress of the wood bond line. The addition of bio-oil accelerated the polycondensation cross-linking process. resulting in a decreased cure temperature.

Встановлено. що додаткове споживання самками коропів ретинілацетату у кількості 2500 та 5000 ІО/кг корму призводить до вірогідного збільшення вмісту вітаміну А в їх організмі. Додаткова кількість ретинілацетату у комбікормі самок коропа призводить до накопичення вітаміну А в ікрі та личинках коропа. а також до збільшення маси отриманої ікринки та інтенсивнішого росту личинок. Виявлено вищу абсолютну плодючість самок коропів. яким додатково згодовували вітамін А у переднерестовий період.Ріст і репродуктивна функція коропів значною мірою залежить від рівня в його організмі жиророзчинних вітамінів. зокрема вітаміну А [1]. Його дефіцит призводить до зниження резистентності. сповільнення росту та порушення репродуктивної функції. що негативно впливає на рентабельність ставового рибництва [2]. При додаванні вітаміну А до раціону майже всі ознаки дефіциту за декілька тижнів зникають [2]. Особливо важливим у цьому аспекті є забезпечення потреби коропів у період нересту.

Few adsorption studies conducted on erythrosine removal from solution and the tested adsorbents showed modest adsorption values for this dye. Pittsburgh commercial activated carbon showed a reasonable adsorption performance for erythrosine from solution with a maximum capacity of 89.3 mg/g at 40 °C and pH 7. The formation of a complete mono-layer was not established where the fraction of surface coverage was only 0.21.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Kinetics and mechanism of oxidation of benzoin (H2B) by ferrozine (Fz) or 2.2'‐bipyridine (bipy) have been carried out in aqueous HNO3 medium. The rate shows first‐order dependence on [H2B] and [Fe3+] and inverse second‐order dependence on [H+]. The rate of reaction increased with increase in the ligand concentration. The increase in dielectric constant will increase the rate. while increase in [HNO3] decreased it. Substituent and temperature effects on the rates have been investigated. The rate laws derived are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. Plausible mechanisms are suggested. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

All tubes exhibited severe carburisation. while some of them lost their structural integrity and sagged. The tube material was based on a Fe–Ni–Cr alloy system with three varying compositions. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to characterize the microstructure and elemental composition of the tube material. Microhardness was tested to determine their mechanical strength. Experimental results indicated that the sagged tubes exhibited a higher degree of carburisation as compared to other tubes. The microstructure of these tubes also revealed coarser Cr-carbide precipitation and a continuous carbide lattice at austenite grain boundaries. It was concluded that exposure to excessive temperature during service was responsible for the degradation of all tube materials.

Accordingly. the inventors devised unique circuitry for correcting or preventing this distortion. One exemplary circuit uses a voltage divider. comprising a pair of transistors. to set the DC or average voltage of the clock signals input to the digital circuit at a level approximating the logic threshold voltage of the digital circuit. In another example. a feedback circuit drives the DC or average voltage of signals input to the digital circuit to match a reference voltage that is substantially equal to the logic threshold voltage. In both examples. equating the DC or average voltage of the clock signals to the logic threshold voltage of the digital circuit reduces or prevents duty-cycle distortion.,True,DUXINEUAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,13,https://patents.google.com/patent/US6690202B1/en,1809174919510035483,/scholar?cites=1809174919510035483,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ae/2a/ab/0552649731a5c9/US6690202.pdf,0,0,0

India,High-throughput screening (HTS) involves testing of compound libraries against validated drug targets using quantitative bioassays to identify ‘hit’ molecules that modulate the activity of target. which forms the starting point of a drug discovery effort. Eicosanoids formed via cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways are major players in various inflammatory disorders. As the conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit both the constitutive (COX-1) and the inducible (COX-2) isoforms have gastric and renal side effects and the recently developed COX-2 selective anti-inflammatory drugs (COXIBs) have cardiac side effects. efforts are being made to develop more potent and safer anti-inflammatory drugs. Current assay methods for these enzymes. such as oxygraphic. radioisotopic. spectrophotometric etc. are not compatible for screening of large number of compounds as in drug discovery programs. In the present study. HTS-compatible assays for COX-1. COX-2 and 5-LOX were developed for screening of compound libraries with the view to identify potential anti-inflammatory drug candidates. A spectrophotometric assay involving co-oxidation of tetramethyl-p-phenylene diamine (TMPD) during the reduction of prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) to PGH2 was adopted and standardized for screening of compounds against COX-1 and COX-2.

When grouped with pharyngeal cancer. it is the sixth most common cancer globally. The major risk factors being cigarette smoking that includes tobacco. alcohol abuse and viral infections such as HPV. lead to this condition by inducing inflammatory changes in the oral cavity. Inflammation. a crucial. complex host defense against biologic. chemical. physical and endogenous irritants. is considered as the seventh hallmark of cancer involved in all the stages of carcinogenesis. from initiation. progression to invasion. Inflammatory cells such as macrophages. mast cells and lymphocytes produce several tumor inducing substances such as IL1β. IL-6. TNF-α. NF-κB. MMPs. COX-2 which induce remodeling of extracellular matrix components. inhibit apoptosis resulting in immortalization of tumor cells. Although there have been significant advances in cancer therapeutic modalities. available anti-tumor drugs display limited efficacy and sometimes carry a risk of severe adverse side effects. To address this issue. a number of epidemiological examinations in human populations and experimental animal studies provide evidence that certain dietary supplements such as Curcumin.

Through the incorporation of a custom. photolabile cross-linker. we encapsulated cargoes ranging in size from small molecules to full-sized proteins within DNA nanocages and then released such cargoes upon brief exposure to light. This novel molecular uncaging technique offers a general approach for precisely releasing a large variety of bioactive molecules. allowing investigation into their mechanism of action. or finely tuned delivery with high temporal precision for broad biomedical and materials applications.,True,1F7Wl9sAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,54,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00530,5406442945580714388,/scholar?cites=5406442945580714388,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959465/,0,0,0

1212826,Permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier via mucosal engrafting: implications for drug delivery to the brain,2013,Benjamin S Bleier and Richie E Kohman and Rachel E Feldman and Shreshtha Ramanlal and Xue Han,8,PloS one,4,e61694,Public Library of Science,Utilization of neuropharmaceuticals for central nervous system(CNS) disease is highly limited due to the blood-brain barrier(BBB) which restricts molecules larger than 500Da from reaching the CNS. The development of a reliable method to bypass the BBB would represent an enormous advance in neuropharmacology enabling the use of many potential disease modifying therapies. Previous attempts such as transcranial catheter implantation have proven to be temporary and associated with multiple complications. Here we describe a novel method of creating a semipermeable window in the BBB using purely autologous tissues to allow for high molecular weight(HMW) drug delivery to the CNS. This approach is inspired by recent advances in human endoscopic transnasal skull base surgical techniques and involves engrafting semipermeable nasal mucosa within a surgical defect in the BBB. The mucosal graft thereby creates a permanent transmucosal conduit for drugs to access the CNS. The main objective of this study was to develop a murine model of this technique and use it to evaluate transmucosal permeability for the purpose of direct drug delivery to the brain. Using this model we demonstrate that mucosal grafts allow for the transport of molecules up to 500 kDa directly to the brain in both a time and molecular weight dependent fashion. Markers up to 40 kDa were found within the striatum suggesting a potential role for this technique in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. This proof of principle study demonstrates that mucosal engrafting represents the first permanent and stable method of bypassing the BBB thereby providing a …,True,1F7Wl9sAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,34,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061694,12183025740636619688,/scholar?cites=12183025740636619688,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061694,0,0,0

We finally demonstrated multiplexed in situ protein imaging using the technique in both cultured cells and mouse retina sections.,True,1F7Wl9sAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/274456v3.abstract,1151878278026896392,/scholar?cites=1151878278026896392,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/05/10/274456.full.pdf,0,0,0
1212845,Fluorescent in situ sequencing of DNA barcoded antibodies,2020,Richie E Kohman and George M Church,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Biological tissues contain thousands of different proteins yet conventional antibody staining can only assay a few at a time because of the limited number of spectrally distinct fluorescent labels. The capacity to map the location of hundreds or thousands of proteins within a single sample would allow for an unprecedented investigation of the spatial proteome. and give insight into the development and function of diseased and healthy tissues. In order to achieve this goal. we propose a new technology that leverages established methodologies for in situ imaging of nucleic acids to achieve near limitless multiplexing. The exponential scaling power of DNA technologies ties multiplexing to the number of DNA nucleotides sequenced rather than the number of spectrally distinct labels. Here we demonstrate that barcode sequencing can be applied to in situ proteomics by sequencing DNA conjugated antibodies bound to biological samples. In addition. we show a signal amplification method which is compatible with barcoded antibodies.,True,1F7Wl9sAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.060624v1.abstract,15688420518517079276,/scholar?cites=15688420518517079276,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/04/28/2020.04.27.060624.full.pdf,0,0,0
