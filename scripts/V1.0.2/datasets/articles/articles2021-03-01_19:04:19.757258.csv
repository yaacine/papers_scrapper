While the fossil record for wild horses in Europe prior to horse domestication is scarce. there have been suggestions that wild populations from various European regions might have contributed to the gene pool of domestic horses. To distinguish between regions where domestic populations are mainly descended from local wild stock and those where horses were largely imported. we investigated patterns of genetic diversity in 24 European horse breeds typed at 12 microsatellite loci. The distribution of high levels of genetic diversity in Europe coincides with the distribution of predominantly open landscapes prior to domestication. as suggested by simulation-based vegetation reconstructions. with breeds from Iberia and the Caspian Sea region having significantly higher genetic diversity than breeds from central Europe and the UK. which were largely forested at the time the first domestic horses appear there. Our results suggest that not only the Eastern steppes. but also the Iberian Peninsula provided refugia for wild horses in the Holocene. and that the genetic contribution of these wild populations to local domestic stock may have been considerable. In contrast. the consistently low levels of diversity in central Europe and the UK suggest that domestic horses in these regions largely derive from horses that were imported from the Eastern refugium. the Iberian refugium. or both.,True,-E70hNwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,77,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018194,13396524917338341684,/scholar?cites=13396524917338341684,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018194,0,0,0

The genetic basis of variation in facial shape and length represents a possible example of this phenomenon. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). which is involved in osteoblast differentiation. contains a functionally-important tandem repeat of glutamine and alanine amino acids. The ratio of glutamines to alanines (the QA ratio) in this protein seemingly influences the regulation of bone development. Notably. in domestic breeds of dog. and in carnivorans in general. the ratio of glutamines to alanines is strongly correlated with facial length. In this study we examine whether this correlation holds true across placental mammals. particularly those mammals for which facial length is highly variable and related to adaptive behavior and lifestyle (e.g.. primates. afrotherians. xenarthrans). We obtained relative facial length measurements and RUNX2 sequences for 41 mammalian species representing 12 orders. Using both a phylogenetic generalized least squares model and a recently-developed Bayesian comparative method. we tested for a correlation between genetic and morphometric data while controlling for phylogeny. evolutionary rates. and divergence times. Non-carnivoran taxa generally had substantially lower glutamine-alanine ratios than carnivorans (primates and xenarthrans with means of 1.34 and 1.25. respectively. compared to a mean of 3.1 for carnivorans). and we found no correlation between RUNX2 sequence and …,True,-E70hNwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,39,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-12-103,14443627673990735216,/scholar?cites=14443627673990735216,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-12-103,0,0,0

1098061,On the origin and spread of horse domestication,2012,Vera Warmuth,,,,,,For several decades. the origin of domestic horses has been the focus of research across multiple disciplines. yet many aspects of the horse domestication process remain poorly understood. One of the reasons for the difficulty in establishing a coherent scenario of horse domestication is that archaeological. mtDNA. and Y chromosome data have yielded ambiguous results. possibly because each class of markers reflects different aspects of the domestication process. In this thesis. I use large autosomal genetic datasets from horses sampled across Eurasia to investigate the origin and spread of horse domestication. I begin by characterising genetic diversity of horses from the Eurasian steppes and neighbouring regions. thus laying the groundwork for a more thorough analysis into the demographic history of horses. I then investigate the origin and mode of spread of horse domestication in the Eurasian steppe region using a spatially explicit genetic model. I show that horse domestication was initiated in the western part of the steppes. and that the spread of horse domestication involved both movement of domestic herds and extensive recruitment of wild horses from across this vast region. a scenario which integrates both archaeological and molecular evidence. Having established the route of spread of early domestic horses out of their domestication origin in the western steppe. I go on to investigate the routes and levels of gene flow among Eastern Eurasian horse populations post-domestication. I show that the ancient Silk Roads have played an important role in shaping the genetic structure of Eastern Eurasian horses. facilitating gene flow …,True,-E70hNwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,2,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/246227,16073185928614728911,/scholar?cites=16073185928614728911,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/246227/Warmuth_PhD_thesis.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0

Gaunitz et al. 1 posit that Przewalski’s horses (PH) are feral descendants of Botai/Borly4 horses (BB). The genetic evidence provided by Gaunitz et al. 1 for BB as direct ancestors of PH is weak. In drift-based ancestry tests only one of seven PH showed evidence of BB horse ancestry. and it is unclear how well test assumptions were met and damage errors typical of aDNA were accounted for. Second. the observation that PH are'nested within BB horses' in some of the phylogenetic trees presented is equally compatible with PH being the never-domesticated descendants of the same wild horse population drawn upon by the Botai culture. If that were the case. the whole argument of PH being feral rather than wild collapses.According to Gaunitz et al.(2018) the leopard-spotting allele was present in BB.

Numerous models have been proposed. many of which display realistic-looking dynamics. but nonetheless rely on untested assumptions about how individuals integrate information to guide movement. Here we infer behavioral rules directly from experimental data. We begin by analyzing trajectories of golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) swimming in two-fish and three-fish shoals to map the mean effective forces as a function of fish positions and velocities. Speeding and turning responses are dynamically modulated and clearly delineated.

Understanding. and controlling. collective behavior is dependent on determining the low-level dynamical principles from which spatial and temporal patterns emerge; a key question is whether different group-level patterns result from all components of a system responding to the same external factor. individual components changing behavior but in a distributed self-organized way. or whether multiple collective states co-exist for the same individual behaviors. Using schooling fish (golden shiners. in groups of 30 to 300 fish) as a model system. we demonstrate that collective motion can be effectively mapped onto a set of order parameters describing the macroscopic group structure. revealing the existence of at least three dynamically-stable collective states; swarm. milling and polarized groups. Swarms are characterized by slow individual motion and a relatively dense. disordered structure. Increasing swim speed is associated with a transition to one of two locally-ordered states. milling or highly-mobile polarized groups. The stability of the discrete collective behaviors exhibited by a group depends on the number of group members. Transitions between states are influenced by both external (boundary-driven) and internal (changing motion of group members) factors.

The simulation results support our argument that the thermostat should be viewed as an integral part of the coarse-grained dynamics rather than a tool for approaching thermal equilibrium.

The DPD model is viewed as a coarse graining of a detailed dynamics that displays a clear timescale separation. Based on the Mori–Zwanzig projection operator method we derive a consistency equation for the stochastic interaction in DPD. The consistency equation can be solved by an iterative bootstrapping procedure. Combined with standard techniques for estimating the conservative interaction. our method makes it possible to reconstruct all the forces in a coarse-grained DPD model.

Anticipation enters the picture by calculating the interparticle forces from linear extrapolations of the particle positions some time τ in the future. Simulations show that for intermediate values of τ. compared to a transient time scale defined by the potential and the initial conditions. the particles form rotating clusters in which the particles are arranged in a hexagonal pattern.

1098084,Determining interaction rules in animal swarms,2010,Anders Eriksson and Martin Nilsson Jacobi and Johan Nyström and Kolbjørn Tunstrøm,21,Behavioral Ecology,5,1106-1111,Oxford University Press,In this paper. we introduce a method for determining local interaction rules in animal swarms. The method is based on the assumption that the behavior of individuals in a swarm can be treated as a set of mechanistic rules.The principal idea behind the technique is to vary parameters that define a set of hypothetical interactions. as for example. a rule for aligning with neighbors. The parameter values are optimized so that the deviation between the observed movements in an animal swarm and the movements predicted by the assumed rule set is minimal. We demonstrate the method by reconstructing the interaction rules from the trajectories produced by a computer simulation.,True,N6I7eIwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,76,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/21/5/1106/198857,3045523084889603782,/scholar?cites=3045523084889603782,,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/5/1106/198857?view=extract,0,0,0

In this study we present a novel approach to identify subpopulations and dispersal barriers based on estimates of dispersal probabilities on the landscape scale. A theoretical framework is presented where the landscape connectivity matrix is analyzed for clusters as a signature of partially isolated subpopulations. Identification of subpopulations is formulated as a minimization problem with a tuneable penalty term that makes it possible to generate population subdivisions with varying degree of dispersal restrictions.

Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence. several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these. the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far. this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design.

In our approach there is an emphasis on societal activities that affect nature and on the internal societal resource use. as opposed to environmental quality indicators. In this way the indicators may give a warning signal to an unsustainable use of resources early in the chain from causes in societal activities to environmental effects. The aim is that these socio-ecological indicators shall serve as a tool in planning and decision-making processes at various administrative levels in society. The formulation of the indicators is made with respect to four principles of sustainability. which lead to four complementary sets of indicators. The first deals with the societal use of lithospheric material. The second deals with emissions of compounds produced in society. The third set of indicators concerns societal manipulation of nature and the long-term productivity of …,True,MhYy_k0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,504,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0921800996000286,12195579089630140067,/scholar?cites=12195579089630140067,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.9699&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done. biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat. electricity or hydrogen) to society. Here we present estimates of the costs and conversion efficiency of electricity. hydrogen and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass with CO2 capture and storage.

In this paper we formulate a model of geographic activity distribution with spatial correlations on the level of land lots where multiplicative growth is assumed to be dominant but not exclusive. The purpose is to retain the explanatory power of earlier models due to Simon. Gibrat and others while attaining some additional properties that are attractive for both empirical and modelling purposes. In this sense. the model presented here is a combination of the two factors that have been identified as central to urban evolution but rarely appear unified in the same model: transportation costs and multiplicative growth.

In a species-poor environment like the Baltic Sea this is particularly critical as major ecosystem functions may be upheld by single species. A complex interplay between demographic and genetic characteristics of species and populations determines risks of local extinction. chances of re-establishment of lost populations. and tolerance to environmental changes by evolution of new adaptations. Recent studies show that Baltic populations of dominant marine species are locally adapted. have lost genetic variation and are relatively isolated. In addition. some have evolved unusually high degrees of clonality and others are representatives of endemic (unique) evolutionary lineages.

It is certainly true that over short distances. viz.. in the range of tens of kilometres or less. a moderately long-lived planktotrophic larva represents an effective mechanism of dispersal. However. turbulent mixing and mortality will decrease the concentration of planktotrophic larvae. and at some distance from the ancestral population the density of settlers may be too low to enable future matings between adults of low mobility. On the other hand. adults. juveniles or benthic egg masses drifted over long distances may colonize new habitats. The crucial point is the type of larval development of the organism.

The aims of this work are to select priority areas for the conservation of the species. identify extinction risk areas. evaluate the current degree of protection and define a strategy for the conservation of this species in Portugal. We used an evaluation model of areas in a GIS environment. Conservation priority areas represent 15% of the distribution area of the species in Portugal. Populations with high risk of extinction are located primarily along the littoral strip. About 50% of the conservation priority areas are already included in the Portuguese protected areas (PPA). The conservation strategy for the species needs efficient protection of habitats. increase of PPA and creation of Regional Reserves for the littoral populations.

Thirteen microsatellite markers were examined in 277 animals born in 1998. belonging to eight subpopulations corresponding to eight northern Portuguese geographic regions. Mean heterozygosity (Ho) in the Garrano breed was 0.732. ranging from 0.531 to 0.857 across subpopulations. Allelic frequencies and diversity differed significantly between regions. suggesting the existence of genetic differentiation within the breed confirmed by the population differentiation estimator FST.

We investigated the population structure of this species using conventional electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing to screen 24 protein loci from II representative populations of the Iberian Peninsula. Thirteen polymorphic loci displaying a total of 30 alleles revealed significant partitioning of genetic variation among populations (F sT= 0.448). Analysis of standard genetic variability measures and allelic distribution profiles indicated that the most variable populations are located in the main distribution area of the species: the north-western corner of the Iberian Peninsula and the Spanish Central System. In contrast. southern isolated populations showed depleted levels of genetic diversity. indicating that severe restrictions to gene flow together with small population sizes are promoting genetic uniformity. We suggest that present-day patterns of genetic diversity in L. schreiberi populations are concordant with the biogeographical hypothesis of a recent expansion to the south followed by a history of contraction and fragmentation resulting in today's isolated southern populations.,True,XsgjJBIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,16,http://podarcis.de/AF/Bibliografie/BIB_3621.pdf,6053251803184822488,/scholar?cites=6053251803184822488,,http://podarcis.de/AF/Bibliografie/BIB_3621.pdf,0,0,0

1098459,Statistical tools to aid domestic breeds’ management.,2006,J Morais and J Malta-Vacas and C Luís and MM Oom,20,30th International Conference on Animal Genetics,,,,Domestic breeds play a determining role on local economies. There are still many communities that depend on these breeds for their subsistence. For instance. the use of the horse has changed throughout times but horse breeds still have their importance within the agricultural environment. Genetic variability of domestic breeds is usually under very strict local management systems and suffers from the negative effects of selective pressure and cross breeding. For this reason. special attention must be paid to genetic erosion symptoms. If genetic identity of native breeds must be preserved. a delicate balance must be maintained between gene flow and genetic isolation of local populations. New clustering and assignment methods are important statistical aids to address this problem. Bayesian methods and frequency based methods were tested. in the present work. for their efficacy in allocating individuals to their populations of origin and detecting genetic structure within populations. We have genotyped 50 individuals form each of the three Portuguese native horse breeds as a case study and we compared Structure. GeneClass2 and Whichrun for their efficiency versus computing time. We also compared the performance of clustering methods opposing genetic distance measures to a Bayesian method implemented in Structure.

1098471,Optimal egg size and clutch size: effects of environment and maternal phenotype,1986,Geoffrey A Parker and Michael Begon,128,The American Naturalist,4,573-592,University of Chicago Press,In this paper. we develop a series of models for predicting optimal egg size and clutch size in different environments and for different maternal phenotypes. The models investigate the interaction between three components of fitness: (1) the intrinsic effect of egg size. (2) the density effect. the effect of the density of competing offspring (including competition with sibs and with non-sibs). and (3) the hierarchy effect. the effect of egg size relative to the sizes of competing eggs laid by other females. The environmental effects that we consider are the intensities of sib and non-sib competition. the number of egg-laying females. and some aspects of seasonal development. The particular aspects of maternal phenotype examined are foraging efficiency and the gametic reserve available at the time of egg laying (broadly equivalent to female size).

A key question is whether patterns of coinfection arise because infection by one parasite species affects susceptibility to others or because of inherent differences between hosts. We used time-series data from individual hosts in natural populations to analyze patterns of infection risk for a microparasite community. detecting large positive and negative effects of other infections. Patterns remain once variations in host susceptibility and exposure are accounted for. Indeed. effects are typically of greater magnitude. and explain more variation in infection risk. than the effects associated with host and environmental factors more commonly considered in disease studies.

A crucial element in understanding disease dynamics. therefore. is the ‘transmission term’ describing the rate at which susceptible hosts are ‘converted’ into infected hosts by their contact with infectious material. Recently. the conventional form of this term has been increasingly questioned. and new terminologies and conventions have been proposed. Here. therefore. we review the derivation of transmission terms. explain the basis of confusion. and provide clarification. The root of the problem has been a failure to include explicit consideration of the area occupied by a host population. alongside both the number of infectious hosts and their density within the population.

Recent research. however. indicates that host susceptibility should be considered carefully if we are to understand the mechanism by which parasite dynamics influence host dynamics and vice versa. Studies in insects. fish. amphibians and rodents show that infection occurrence and intensity are more probable and more severe in individuals with an underlying poor condition. Moreover. infection itself results in further deterioration of the host and a ‘vicious circle’ is created.

Here. we review current scientific evidence for the drivers and epidemiology of emerging wildlife-borne zoonoses in urban landscapes. where anthropogenic pressures can create diverse wildlife–livestock–human interfaces. We argue that these interfaces represent a critical point for cross-species transmission and emergence of pathogens into new host populations. and thus understanding their form and function is necessary to identify suitable interventions to mitigate the risk of disease emergence.

Here. through a combination of serology and PCR. we demonstrate conclusively that the main hosts in Great Britain are bank voles. wood mice and short-tailed field voles.

We present a graphical isocline framework for studying disease establishment in systems with two host species. based on treating host species as resources. The isocline approach provides a natural generalization to multi‐host systems of two related concepts in disease ecology – the basic reproductive rate of a parasite. and threshold host density.

Phosphorylated IκBα is then ubiquitinated. which targets it for degradation by the 26S proteasome (13). thereby releasing NF-κB dimers from the cytoplasmic NF-κB–IκB complex and allowing them to translocate to the nucleus. NF-κB then binds to κB enhancer elements of target genes. inducing transcription of proinflammatory genes. IKK also phosphorylates IκBβ and IκBε. Phosphorylation of IκBβ leads to prolonged NF-κB activation (14). which can in part be explained by the delay in IκBβ resynthesis after degradation.

Early theories on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis focused on autoantibodies and immune complexes. T-cell-mediated antigen-specific responses. T-cell-independent cytokine networks. and aggressive tumour-like behaviour of rheumatoid synovium have also been implicated. More recently. the contribution of autoantibodies has returned to the forefront. Based on the pathogenic mechanisms. specific therapeutic interventions can be designed to suppress synovial inflammation and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.,True,87J6g1IAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3867,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01661,15520752754846749965,/scholar?cites=15520752754846749965,,http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/medical/pathophys/immunology/2004/misc/articles/RA_review.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we have examined the inflammatory response in mice with conditional knockouts of the hypoxia responsive transcription factor HIF-1α. its negative regulator VHL. and a known downstream target. VEGF. We find that activation of HIF-1α is essential for myeloid cell infiltration and activation in vivo through a mechanism independent of VEGF. Loss of VHL leads to a large increase in acute inflammatory responses. Our results show that HIF-1α is essential for the regulation of glycolytic capacity in myeloid cells: when HIF-1α is absent. the cellular ATP pool is drastically reduced. The metabolic defect results in profound impairment of myeloid cell aggregation. motility. invasiveness. and bacterial killing.

The pathogenesis of RA is complex and includes many cell types. including T cells. B cells. and macrophages. Fibroblast‐like synoviocytes (FLS) in the synovial intimal lining also play a key role by producing cytokines that perpetuate inflammation and proteases that contribute to cartilage destruction. Rheumatoid FLS develop a unique aggressive phenotype that increases invasiveness into the extracellular matrix and further exacerbates joint damage. Recent advances in understanding the biology of FLS. including their regulation regulate innate immune responses and activation of intracellular signaling mechanisms that control their behavior. provide novel insights into disease mechanisms.

Inc.,The role of immunologic processes in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is indisputable. Histopathologic and ultrastructural studies of rheumatoid synovium show synovial lining cell hyperplasia. along with subintimal chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates that include T cells. B cells. and macrophages. Rheumatoid factor. anti-collagen and other locally produced antibodies. and a number of soluble mediators that contribute to joint destruction. such as prostaglandins and collagenase. are produced in large amounts by synovial tissue cells. In most models of RA synovitis it is theorized that T cells orchestrate the local inflammatory response. In these paradigms. an arthrotropic agent. such as a virus or bacterial cell wall fragments. or an “autoantigen.” such as type I1 collagen. proteoglycan. or Ia molecules. serves as a stimulus for T cell activation.

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are a key component of this invasive synovium and have a major role in the initiation and perpetuation of destructive joint inflammation. The pathogenic potential of FLS in RA stems from their ability to express immunomodulating cytokines and mediators as well as a wide array of adhesion molecule and matrix-modelling enzymes. FLS can be viewed as' passive responders' to the immunoreactive process in RA. their activated phenotype reflecting the proinflammatory milieu. However.

1098511,Immunologic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis,2005,Gary S Firestein,11,,3,S39-S44,LWW,Although much is known about the etiology and pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). our understanding of the immune pathways remains incomplete. The observed clinical and pathologic manifestations result from activation of several interrelated immune pathways. Current concepts of RA pathogenesis. supported by animal models. laboratory studies. and clinical observation. have reestablished and revised some of the original views. Early proposals emphasized the importance of autoantibodies and immune complexes in the initiation of RA. suggested a role for T cells in the inflammatory response characteristic of RA. and based disease perpetuation on an imbalance in the cytokine networks. We now recognize that each of these interrelated mechanisms significantly contributes to RA pathogenesis. including T cells that can help initiate and perpetuate the disease.

T cell‐independent mechanisms from beginning to end,2002,Gary S Firestein and Nathan J Zvaifler,46,,2,298-308,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,A little over a decade ago. we reviewed studies on the role of T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and concluded that the prevailing paradigm was not consistent with the data (1). At the time. the primacy of T cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease was undisputed. Based on a series of studies demonstrating a surprising paucity of T cell cytokines in the joints of our patients and the dominance of macrophage and fibroblast products (2–4). we proposed that the perpetuation of RA was not necessarily an antigen-specific process and that T cells were only one of several important players. Recently. the potential role of T cells in the pathogenesis of RA was reviewed. and their ambiguous contribution was emphasized (5). Now. 12 years later. we think it reasonable to revisit these issues. It is important. though. to frame the questions appropriately.

Instead of using Cartesian coordinates for protein conformational analysis. T-Analyst is based on internal bond-angle-torsion coordinates in which internal torsion angle movements. such as side-chain rotations. can be easily detected. The program computes entropy and automatically detects and corrects angle periodicity to produce accurate rotameric states of dihedrals. It also clusters multiple conformations and detects dihedral rotations that contribute hinge-like motions. Correlated motions between selected dihedrals can also be observed from the correlation map. T-Analyst focuses on showing changes in protein flexibility between different states and selecting representative protein conformations for molecular docking studies.

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication. followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications. giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25.498 genes encoding proteins from 11.000 families. similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans-the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families. indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes.

Cloning of the Arabidopsis EIN2 gene identifies a central component of the ethylene signaling pathway. The amino-terminal integral membrane domain of EIN2 shows similarity to the disease-related Nramp family of metal-ion transporters. Expression of the EIN2 CEND is sufficient to constitutively activate ethylene responses and restores responsiveness to jasmonic acid and paraquat-induced oxygen radicals to mutant plants. EIN2 is thus recognized as a molecular link between previously distinct hormone response pathways.

We compared retroviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV). and murine leukemia virus (MLV). Effects of gene activity on integration targeting were assessed by transcriptional profiling of infected cells. Integration by HIV vectors. analyzed in two primary cell types and several cell lines. strongly favored active genes. An analysis of the effects of tissue-specific transcription showed that it resulted in tissue-specific integration targeting by HIV. though the effect was quantitatively modest. Chromosomal regions rich in expressed genes were favored for HIV integration. but these regions were found to be interleaved with unfavorable regions at CpG islands. MLV vectors showed a strong bias in favor of integration near transcription start sites. as reported previously.

TFs) bind to them. Therefore. motif finding is important to understand the mechanisms of gene regulation. De novo discovery of regulatory elements. like transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). has long been a major challenge to gain insight on mechanisms of gene regulation. Recent advances in experimental profiling of genome-wide signals such as histone modifications and DNase I hypersensitivity sites allow scientists to develop better computational methods to enhance motif discovery. However. existing methods for motif finding suffer from high false positive rates and slow speed. and it's difficult to evaluate the performance of these methods systematically.

1098641,CTF: a CRF-based transcription factor binding sites finding system,2012,Yupeng He and Yizhe Zhang and Guangyong Zheng and Chaochun Wei,13,BMC genomics,8,1-9,BioMed Central,Identifying the location of transcription factor bindings is crucial to understand transcriptional regulation. Currently. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed with high-throughput Sequencing (ChIP-seq) is able to locate the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) accurately in high throughput and it has become the gold-standard method for TFBS finding experimentally. However. due to its high cost. it is impractical to apply the method in a very large scale. Considering the large number of transcription factors. numerous cell types and various conditions. computational methods are still very valuable to accurate TFBS identification. In this paper. we proposed a novel integrated TFBS prediction system. CTF. based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Integrating information from different sources. CTF was able to capture patterns of TFBSs contained in different features (sequence. chromatin and etc) and predicted the TFBS locations with a high accuracy. We compared CTF with several existing tools as well as the PWM baseline method on a dataset generated by ChIP-seq experiments (TFBSs of 13 transcription factors in mouse genome). Results showed that CTF performed significantly better than existing methods tested. CTF is a powerful tool to predict TFBSs by integrating high throughput data and different features. It can be a useful complement to ChIP-seq and other experimental methods for TFBS identification and thus improve our ability to investigate functional elements in post-genomic era.

A critical control component of environmentally-responsive gene networks is the histone variant H2A.Z which provides transcriptional plasticity and prevents undesired gene activation.

Here we report that phosphorylation-regulated proteolytic processing of EIN2 triggers its endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–to–nucleus translocation. ER-tethered EIN2 shows CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1) kinase–dependent phosphorylation. Ethylene triggers dephosphorylation at several sites and proteolytic cleavage at one of these sites. resulting in nuclear translocation of a carboxyl-terminal EIN2 fragment (EIN2-C′). Mutations that mimic EIN2 dephosphorylation. or inactivate CTR1. show constitutive cleavage and nuclear localization of EIN2-C′ and EIN3 and EIN3-LIKE1–dependent activation of ethylene responses.

Loss of NR2E3 in rods shifts their epigenomes to a more cone-like state. The data further reveal wide differences in DNA methylation between retinal photoreceptors and brain neurons. Surprisingly. we also find a substantial fraction of DNA hypo-methylated regions in adult rods that are not in active chromatin. Many of these regions exhibit hallmarks of regulatory regions that were active earlier in neuronal development. suggesting that these regions could remain undermethylated due to the highly compact chromatin in mature rods.

However. the mechanisms that guide the epigenome through this transition and their evolutionary conservation remain elusive. Here we report widespread DNA demethylation of enhancers during the phylotypic period in zebrafish. Xenopus tropicalis and mouse. These enhancers are linked to developmental genes that display coordinated transcriptional and epigenomic changes in the diverse vertebrates during embryogenesis. Binding of Tet proteins to (hydroxy) methylated DNA and enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in these regions implicated active DNA demethylation in this process.

Although reassignment of stop codons has been found in extant organisms. a model organism is lacking to investigate the reassignment process and to direct code evolution. Complete reassignment of a stop codon is precluded by release factors (RFs). which recognize stop codons to terminate translation. Here we discovered that RF1 could be unconditionally knocked out from various Escherichia coli stains. demonstrating that the reportedly essential RF1 is generally dispensable for the E. coli species. The apparent essentiality of RF1 was found to be caused by the inefficiency of a mutant RF2 in terminating all UAA stop codons; a wild type RF2 was sufficient for RF1 knockout.

Recently. chromosome conformation capture (3C) based technologies. such as Hi-C and TCC. have been developed to provide a genome-wide. three-dimensional (3D) view of chromatin organization. Appropriate methods for analyzing these data and fully characterizing the 3D chromosomal structure and its structural variations are still under development. Here we describe a novel Bayesian probabilistic approach. denoted as “Bayesian 3D constructor for Hi-C data” (BACH). to infer the consensus 3D chromosomal structure. In addition. we describe a variant algorithm BACH-MIX to study the structural variations of chromatin in a cell population. Applying BACH and BACH-MIX to a high resolution Hi-C dataset generated from mouse embryonic stem cells. we found that most local genomic regions exhibit homogeneous 3D chromosomal structures. We further constructed a model for the spatial arrangement of chromatin. which reveals structural properties associated with euchromatic and heterochromatic regions in the genome. We observed strong associations between structural properties and several genomic and epigenetic features of the chromosome. Using BACH-MIX. we further found that the structural variations of chromatin are correlated with these genomic and epigenetic features. Our results demonstrate that BACH and BACH-MIX have the potential to provide new insights into the chromosomal architecture of mammalian cells.,True,XBzi73oAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC,203,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002893,11492364193636114212,/scholar?cites=11492364193636114212,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002893,0,0,0

Sox2 and Nanog. These core factors form a regulatory circuit controlling the transcription of a number of pluripotency factors including themselves. Although previous studies have identified transcriptional regulators of this core network. the cis-regulatory DNA sequences required for the transcription of these key pluripotency factors remain to be defined. We analyzed epigenomic data within the 1.5 Mb gene-desert regions around the Sox2 gene and identified a 13kb-long super-enhancer (SE) located 100kb downstream of Sox2 in mouse ESCs. This SE is occupied by Oct4. Sox2. Nanog. and the mediator complex. and physically interacts with the Sox2 locus via DNA looping. Using a simple and highly efficient double-CRISPR genome editing strategy we deleted the entire 13-kb SE and characterized transcriptional defects in the resulting monoallelic and biallelic deletion clones with RNA-seq. We showed that the SE is responsible for over 90% of Sox2 expression. and Sox2 is the only target gene along the chromosome.

Recent reports also throw light into the role of microRNAs as critical effectors in the intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. Evidence suggests that both virus and hosts encode microRNAs. The exclusive dependence of viruses on the host cellular machinery for their propagation and survival also make them highly susceptible to the vagaries of the cellular environment like small RNA mediated interference. It also gives the virus an opportunity to fight and/or modulate the host to suite its needs. Thus the range of interactions possible through miRNA-mRNA cross-talk at the host-pathogen interface is large.

These motifs have been intensively investigated on the DNA level. but their overall biological relevance remains elusive. Only recently has research concerning the function of G-quadruplexes in RNAs commenced. Here. we demonstrate for the first time. that an RNA G-quadruplex structure inhibits translation in vivo in eukaryotic cells. We investigated the function of a highly conserved. thermodynamically stable RNA G-quadruplex in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA of the human Zic-1 zinc-finger protein. Using dual luciferase reporter assay. we demonstrate that the Zic-1 RNA G-quadruplex represses protein synthesis inside eukaryotic cells.

Currently. many efforts are focused on studying miRNA expression patterns. as well as miRNA target validation.

Furthermore. the over expressed cluster modulates the expression of a number of genes involved in apoptosis including FADD (Fas Associated protein with Death Domain). Bioinformatically. FADD is predicted to be the target of hsa-miR-27a and interestingly. FADD protein was found to be up regulated consistent with very less expression of hsa-miR-27a in HEK293T cells. This effect was direct. as hsa-miR-27a negatively regulated the expression of FADD 3′UTR based reporter construct.

To generate a comprehensive view of the mechanisms controlling early hematopoietic precursor self-renewal and differentiation. we used systems-based approaches and murine EML multipotential hematopoietic precursor cells as a primary model. EML cells give rise to a mixture of self-renewing Lin-SCA+CD34+ cells and partially differentiated non-renewing Lin-SCA-CD34− cells in a cell autonomous fashion. We identified and validated the HMG box protein TCF7 as a regulator in this self-renewal/differentiation switch that operates in the absence of autocrine Wnt signaling. We found that Tcf7 is the most down-regulated transcription factor when CD34+ cells switch into CD34− cells. using RNA–Seq. We subsequently identified the target genes bound by TCF7. using ChIP–Seq. We show that TCF7 and RUNX1 (AML1) bind to each other's promoter regions and that TCF7 is necessary for the production of the short isoforms. but not the long isoforms of RUNX1. suggesting that TCF7 and the short isoforms of RUNX1 function coordinately in regulation. Tcf7 knock-down experiments and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses suggest that TCF7 plays a dual role in promoting the expression of genes characteristic of self-renewing CD34+ cells while repressing genes activated in partially differentiated CD34− state. Finally a network of up-regulated transcription factors of CD34+ cells was constructed.

Cerebellar Bergmann glia are radial astrocytes that are implicated in motor behavior and exhibit Ca2+ excitation. However. Ca2+ excitation in these cells has not previously been studied in behaving animals. Using two-photon microscopy we found that Bergmann glia exhibit three forms of Ca2+ excitation in awake. behaving mice. Two of these are ongoing within the cerebellar vermis.

Here. we investigate genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in mouse rods and cones and correlate differences in these features with gene expression. histone marks. transcription factor binding. and DNA sequence motifs. Loss of NR2E3 in rods shifts their epigenomes to a more cone-like state. The data further reveal wide differences in DNA methylation between retinal photoreceptors and brain neurons. Surprisingly. we also find a substantial fraction of DNA hypo-methylated regions in adult rods that are not in active chromatin. Many of these regions exhibit hallmarks of regulatory regions that were active earlier in neuronal development. suggesting that these regions could remain undermethylated due to the highly compact chromatin in mature rods.

Dynamic gain or loss of DNA methylation reshapes the genomic landscape of cells during early differentiation. and in post-mitotic mammalian brain cells these changes continue to accumulate throughout the phases of cortical maturation in childhood and adolescence. There is also evidence for dynamic changes in the methylation status of specific genomic loci during the encoding of new memories. and these epigenome dynamics could play a causal role in memory formation.

Identification of cis-regulatory elements responsible for cell-type specific gene expression is essential for understanding the origin of the cellular diversity. Conventional assays to map cis-elements via open chromatin analysis of primary tissues fail to resolve their cell type specificity and lack the sensitivity to identify cis-elements in rare cell types. Single nucleus analysis of transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) can overcome this limitation. but current analysis methods begin with pre-defined genomic regions of accessibility and are therefore biased toward the dominant population of a tissue.

Many methods have been proposed to remove artifacts from EEG recordings. especially those arising from eye movements and blinks. Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on parallel EEG and electrooculographic (EOG) recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. Because EEG and ocular activity mix bidirectionally. regressing out eye artifacts inevitably involves subtracting relevant EEG signals from each record as well.

Typically these methods find a set of basis images and represent faces as a linear combination of those images. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular example of such methods. The basis images found by PCA depend only on pairwise relationships between pixels in the image database. In a task such as face recognition. in which important information may be contained in the high-order relationships among pixels. it seems reasonable to expect that better basis images may be found by methods sensitive to these high-order statistics. Independent component analysis (ICA). a generalization of PCA. is one such method. We used a version of ICA derived from the principle of optimal information transfer through sigmoidal neurons.

The memory representations for pronunciations are learned by practice and are shared among many processing units. The performance of NETtalk has some similarities with observed human performance.(i) The learning follows a power law.(; i) The more words the network learns. the better it is at generalizing and correctly pronouncing new words.(iii) The performance of the network degrades very slowly as connections in the network are damaged: no single link or processing unit is essential.(iv) Relearning after damage is much faster than learning during the original training.(v) Distributed or spaced practice is more effective for long-term retention than massed practice. Network models can be constructed that have the same performance and learning characteristics on a particular task. but differ completely at the levels of synaptic strengths and single-unit responses. However. hierarchical clustering techniques applied to NETtalk reveal that these different networks have similar internal representations of letter-to-sound correspondences within groups of processing units.

There has been substantial progress in these different communities and surprising convergence has developed between the formalisms. The awareness of this convergence and the growing interest of researchers in understanding the essential unity of the subject underlies the current volume. Two research communities which have used graphical or network formalisms to particular advantage are the belief network community and the neural network community. Belief networks arose within computer science and statistics and were developed with an emphasis on prior knowledge and exact probabilistic calculations. Neural networks arose within electrical engineering. physics and neuroscience and have emphasised pattern recognition and systems modelling problems. This volume draws together researchers from these two communities and presents both kinds of networks as instances of a general unified graphical formalism.

It is now widely accepted that independent component analysis (ICA) may be a useful tool for isolating artifacts and/or cortical processes from electroencephalographic (EEG) data. We present results of simulations demonstrating that ICA decomposition. here tested using three popular ICA algorithms. Infomax.

1098827,The neurotropic parasite Toxoplasma gondii increases dopamine metabolism,2011,Emese Prandovszky and Elizabeth Gaskell and Heather Martin and JP Dubey and Joanne P Webster and Glenn A McConkey,6,PloS one,9,e23866,Public Library of Science,The highly prevalent parasite Toxoplasma gondii manipulates its host's behavior. In infected rodents. the behavioral changes increase the likelihood that the parasite will be transmitted back to its definitive cat host. an essential step in completion of the parasite's life cycle. The mechanism(s) responsible for behavioral changes in the host is unknown but two lines of published evidence suggest that the parasite alters neurotransmitter signal transduction: the disruption of the parasite-induced behavioral changes with medications used to treat psychiatric disease (specifically dopamine antagonists) and identification of a tyrosine hydroxylase encoded in the parasite genome. In this study. infection of mammalian dopaminergic cells with T. gondii enhanced the levels of K+-induced release of dopamine several-fold. with a direct correlation between the number of infected cells and the quantity of dopamine released. Immunostaining brain sections of infected mice with dopamine antibody showed intense staining of encysted parasites. Based on these analyses. T. gondii orchestrates a significant increase in dopamine metabolism in neural cells. Tyrosine hydroxylase. the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis. was also found in intracellular tissue cysts in brain tissue with antibodies specific for the parasite-encoded tyrosine hydroxylase. These observations provide a mechanism for parasite-induced behavioral changes. The observed effects on dopamine metabolism could also be relevant in interpreting reports of psychobehavioral changes in toxoplasmosis-infected humans.,True,u9gIs-YAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,403,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023866,6656372729236601680,/scholar?cites=6656372729236601680,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023866,0,0,0

The encoded enzymes metabolize phenylalanine as well as tyrosine with substrate preference for tyrosine. Thus the enzymes catabolize phenylalanine to tyrosine and tyrosine to l-DOPA. The catalytic domain descriptive of this class of enzymes is conserved with the parasite enzyme and exhibits similar kinetic properties to metazoan tyrosine hydroxylases. but contains a unique N-terminal extension with a signal sequence motif. One of the genes. TgAaaH1. is constitutively expressed while the other gene. TgAaaH2. is induced during formation of the bradyzoites of the cyst stages of the life cycle. This is the first description of an aromatic amino acid hydroxylase in an apicomplexan parasite.

Both genomes encode ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) that are distinct from the nuclear-encoded rRNAs. Secondary structure analysis of all the P. falciparum rRNAs indicates that only the large subunit (LSU) rRNA encoded by the plastid-like genome is the target for thiostrepton. Indeed we find that thiostrepton inhibits growth of the parasite in the micromolar range which is 10-fold below concentrations with observable effects on total protein synthesis. We have further examined selective effects of thiostrepton on the plastid function by comparing differential effects of the drug on cytoplasmic and organellar encoded transcripts.

The natural function of the RNAi machinery is to generate endogenous short double-stranded RNAs to regulate gene expression. It has been shown that treatment of Plasmodium falciparum. the etiologic agent of malaria. with dsRNA induces degradation of the corresponding microRNA (miRNA). yet typical RNAi-associated genes have not been identifiable in the parasite genome. To clarify this discrepancy we set out to clone short RNAs from P. falciparum-infected red blood cells and from purified parasites. We did not find any short RNA that was not a rRNA or tRNA fragment.

If genes encoding metabolic enzymes are horizontally transferred and are advantageous. they are likely to become fixed. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has played a key role in prokaryotic evolution and its importance in eukaryotes is increasingly evident. High levels of endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) accompanied the establishment of plastids and mitochondria. and more recent events have allowed further acquisition of bacterial genes. Here. we present the first comprehensive multi-species analysis of E/HGT of genes encoding metabolic enzymes from bacteria to unicellular eukaryotes. The phylogenetic trees of 2.257 metabolic enzymes were used to make E/HGT assertions in ten groups of unicellular eukaryotes. revealing the sources and metabolic processes of the transferred genes. Analyses revealed a preference for enzymes encoded by genes gained through horizontal and endosymbiotic transfers to be connected in the metabolic network.

The location of the parasite encysted in the brain may influence this behavior. However. most studies are based on the highly susceptible rodent. the mouse.   Methodology/Principal Findings Latent toxoplasmosis was induced in rats (10 rats per T. gondii strains) of the same age. strain. and sex. after oral inoculation with oocysts (natural route and natural stage of infection) of 11 T. gondii strains of seven genotypes. Rats were euthanized at two months post inoculation (p.i.) to investigate whether the parasite genotype affects the distribution. location. tissue cyst size. or lesions. Tissue cysts were enumerated in different regions of the brains. both in histological sections as well in saline homogenates. Tissue cysts were found in all regions of the brain. The tissue cyst density in different brain regions varied extensively between rats with many regions highly infected in some animals. Overall. the colliculus was most highly infected although there was a large amount of variability. The cerebral cortex. thalamus. and cerebellum had higher tissue cyst densities and two strains exhibited tropism for the colliculus and olfactory bulb. Histologically. lesions were confined to the brain and eyes. Tissue cyst rupture was frequent with no clear evidence for reactivation of tachyzoites.

The chronic stages of infection have been considered dormant. although several studies have found correlations of infection with an array of host behavioral changes. These may facilitate parasite transmission and impact neurological diseases. During infection. in addition to the presence of the parasites within neurons. host-mediated neuroimmune and hormonal responses to infection are also present. T. gondii induces numerous changes to host neurons during infection and globally alters host neurological signaling pathways. as discussed in this review. Understanding the neurophysiological changes in the host brain is imperative to understanding the parasitic mechanisms and to delineate the effects of this single-celled parasite on health and its contribution to neurological disease.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,This article describes the implementation of a new docking approach. The method uses a Tabu search methodology to dock flexibly ligand molecules into rigid receptor structures. It uses an empirical objective function with a small number of physically based terms derived from fitting experimental binding affinities for crystallographic complexes. This means that docking energies produced by the searching algorithm provide direct estimates of the binding affinities of the ligands. The method has been tested on 50 ligand‐receptor complexes for which the experimental binding affinity and binding geometry are known. All water molecules are removed from the structures and ligand molecules are minimized in vacuo before docking.

They are becoming increasingly important in the biological sciences for the tasks of inferring cellular networks [1]. modelling protein signalling pathways [2]. systems biology. data integration [3]. classification [4]. and genetic data analysis [5]. The representation and use of probability theory makes BNs suitable for combining domain knowledge and data. expressing causal relationships. avoiding overfitting a model to training data. and learning from incomplete datasets. The probabilistic formalism provides a natural treatment for the stochastic nature of biological systems and measurements. This primer aims to introduce BNs to the computational biologist. focusing on the concepts behind methods for learning the parameters and structure of models. at a time when they are becoming the machine learning method of choice.There are many applications in biology where we wish to classify data; for example. gene function prediction.

The encoded enzymes metabolize phenylalanine as well as tyrosine with substrate preference for tyrosine. Thus the enzymes catabolize phenylalanine to tyrosine and tyrosine to l-DOPA. The catalytic domain descriptive of this class of enzymes is conserved with the parasite enzyme and exhibits similar kinetic properties to metazoan tyrosine hydroxylases. but contains a unique N-terminal extension with a signal sequence motif. One of the genes. TgAaaH1. is constitutively expressed while the other gene. TgAaaH2. is induced during formation of the bradyzoites of the cyst stages of the life cycle.

Since <2% of CpG sites are covered by the Illumina 450K array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing is still too expensive for many samples. computationally predicting DNA methylation levels based on 450K data would be valuable to discover more RA-related genes. Results: We developed a computational model that is trained on 14 tissues with both whole genome bisulfite sequencing and 450K array data. This model integrates information derived from the similarity of local methylation pattern between tissues. the methylation information of flanking CpG sites and the methylation tendency of flanking DNA sequences.

Identifying unique transcriptional regulators of oncogenic signaling. and targeting cancer-cell-specific enhancers that may be active only in specific tumor cell lineages. could provide the necessary high specificity. but a scarcity of functionally validated enhancers in cancer cells presents a significant hurdle to this strategy. We address this limitation by carrying out large-scale functional screens for pro-growth enhancers using highly multiplexed CRISPR-based perturbation and sequencing in multiple cancer cell lines. We used this strategy to identify 488 pro-growth enhancers in a colorectal cancer cell line and 22 functional enhancers for the MYC and MYB key oncogenes in an additional nine cancer cell lines.  The majority of pro-growth enhancers are accessible and presumably active only in cancer cells but not in normal tissues. and are enriched for elements associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. We further identify master transcriptional regulators and demonstrate that the cancer pro-growth enhancers are modulated by lineage-specific transcription factors acting downstream of growth signaling pathways.

Identifying unique transcriptional regulators of oncogenic signaling. and targeting cancer-cell-specific enhancers that may be active only in specific tumor cell lineages. could provide the necessary high specificity. but a scarcity of functionally validated enhancers in cancer cells presents a significant hurdle to this strategy. We address this limitation by carrying out large-scale functional screens for pro-growth enhancers using highly multiplexed CRISPR-based perturbation and sequencing in multiple cancer cell lines. We used this strategy to identify 488 pro-growth enhancers in a colorectal cancer cell line and 22 functional enhancers for the MYC and MYB key oncogenes in an additional nine cancer cell lines.  The majority of pro-growth enhancers are accessible and presumably active only in cancer cells but not in normal tissues. and are enriched for elements associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. We further identify master transcriptional regulators and demonstrate that the cancer pro-growth enhancers are modulated by lineage-specific transcription factors acting downstream of growth signaling pathways.

Dysregulation of these elements can result in many cardiovascular diseases that are major leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In addition. genetic variants associated with cardiovascular disease risk are enriched within cis-regulatory elements. However. the location and activity of these cis-regulatory elements in individual cardiac cell types remains to be fully defined. Methods: We performed single nucleus ATAC-seq and single nucleus RNA-seq to define a comprehensive catalogue of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) and gene expression patterns for the distinct cell types comprising each chamber of four non-failing human hearts. We used this catalogue to computationally deconvolute dynamic enhancers in failing hearts and to assign cardiovascular disease risk variants to cCREs in individual cardiac cell types. Finally. we applied reporter assays. genome editing and electrophysiogical measurements in in vitro differentiated human cardiomyocytes to validate the molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular disease risk variants. Results: We defined >287.000 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in human hearts at single-cell resolution. which notably revealed gene regulatory programs controlling specific cell types in a cardiac region/structure-dependent manner and during heart failure. We further report enrichment of cardiovascular disease risk variants in cCREs of distinct cardiac cell types. including a strong enrichment of atrial fibrillation variants in cardiomyocyte cCREs. and …,True,dV1fNBMAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.11.291724v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/09/12/2020.09.11.291724.full.pdf,0,0,0

However. the interaction of such motifs with each other. and their form of integration into the full network has not been previously examined. By studying the transcriptional regulatory network of the bacterium. Escherichia coli. we demonstrate that the two previously identified motif types in the network (i.e.. feed-forward loops and bi-fan motifs) do not exist in isolation. but rather aggregate into homologous motif clusters that largely overlap with known biological functions. Moreover. these clusters further coalesce into a supercluster. thus establishing distinct topological hierarchies that show global statistical properties similar to the whole network. Targeted removal of motif links disintegrates the network into small. isolated clusters. while random disruptions of equal number of links do not cause such an effect. Individual motifs aggregate into homologous motif clusters and a supercluster forming the backbone of the E. coli transcriptional regulatory network and play a central role in defining its global topological organization.,True,MppndAIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,262,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-10,1458849596692787521,/scholar?cites=1458849596692787521,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-10,0,0,0

Mice with decreased ARRDC3 levels were protected from obesity due to increased energy expenditure through increased activity levels and increased thermogenesis of both brown and white adipose tissues. ARRDC3 interacted directly with β-adrenergic receptors. and loss of ARRDC3 increased the response to β-adrenergic stimulation in isolated adipose tissue.

Many of these factors impact also on white adipose tissue (WAT). which has been shown to be a determinant of lifespan. Interrogating a transcriptional network for predicted causal regulatory interactions in a collection of mouse WAT from F2 crosses with a seed set of 60 known longevity genes. we identified a novel transcriptional subnetwork of 742 genes which represent thus-far-unknown longevity genes.

We present a predictive model of the immune component of IBD that informs causal relationships among loci previously linked to IBD through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using functional and regulatory annotations that relate to the cells. tissues. and pathophysiology of IBD. Our model consists of individual networks constructed using molecular data generated from intestinal samples isolated from three populations of patients with IBD at different stages of disease. We performed key driver analysis to identify genes predicted to modulate network regulatory states associated with IBD. prioritizing and prospectively validating 12 of the top key drivers experimentally.

Genetic linkage of IBD to chromosome 3 has been observed previously. A high density analysis of chromosome 3p was performed to confirm prior linkages and elucidate potential genetic associations.Forty three microsatellite markers on chromosome 3 were genotyped in 353 affected sibling pairs of North European Caucasian extraction (average marker density 2 cM in the linkage interval). Marker order was defined by genetic and radiation hybrid techniques.The maximum single point logarithm of odds (LOD) score was observed for Crohn9s disease at D3S3591.

In genetic linkage studies of seven unrelated families we mapped a gene for LQT to the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5). near the Harvey ras-1 gene (H ras-1). To determine if the same locus was responsible for LQT in additional families. we performed linkage studies with DNA markers from this region (H ras-1 and MUC2). Pairwise linkage analyses resulted in logarithm of odds scores of -2.64 and -5.54 for kindreds 1977 and 1756. respectively. To exclude the possibility that rare recombination events might account for these results. we performed multipoint linkage analyses using additional markers from chromosome 11p15.5 (tyrosine hydroxylase and D11S860).

A drug target should have several characteristics: known biological function; robust assay systems for in vitro characterization and high-throughput screening; and be specifically modified by and accessible to small molecular weight compounds in vivo. Ion channels have many of these attributes and can be viewed as suitable targets for small molecule drugs.

BANAJI mong earthly organisms. humans have a unique propensity to introspect or look inward into the contents of their own minds. and to share those obser-vations with others. With the ability to introspect comes the palpable feeling of"" knowing.” of being objective or certain. of being mentally in control of one's thoughts. aware of the causes of one's thoughts. feelings. and actions. and of making decisions deliberately and rationally. Among the noteworthy discoveries of 20th century psychology was a challenge posed to this assumption of rationality. From the groundbreaking theorizing of Herbert Simon (1955) and the mindboggling problems posed by Kahneman. Slovik. and Tversky (1982) to striking demonstrations of illusions of control (Wegner. 2002). the paucity of introspection (Nisbett and Wilson. 1977). and the automaticity of everyday thought (Bargh. 1997). psychologists have shown the frailties of the minds of their species. As psychologists have come to grips with the limits of the mind. there has been an increased interest in measuring aspects of thinking and feeling that may not be easily accessed or available to consciousness. Innovations in measurement have been undertaken with the purpose of bringing under scrutiny new forms of cognition and emotion that were previously undiscovered and especially by asking if traditional concepts such as attitude and preference. belief and stereotype. selfconcept and self-esteem can be rethought based on what the new measures reveal. These newer measures do not require introspection on the part of the subject.

As such. the development of techniques for measurement is critical to the successful development of theory. This paper presents a technique — the Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT) — that joins a family of existing techniques for measuring implicit social cognition generally. with a focus on attitude (evaluation). To expand the measurement potential supplied by its closest cousin. the Implicit Association Test (IAT). the GNAT can be used to examine automatic social cognition toward a single target category. That is. the GNAT obtains a measure of implicit social cognition without requiring the direct involvement of complementary or contrasting objects. Also. by implementing a response deadline in the procedure. this version of the GNAT trades off response latency for sensitivity as the dependent variable measure.

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However. ordinary biases in human reasoning. such as hindsight bias. make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called preregistration.

1099601,Health of the Implicit Association Test at age 3,2001,Anthony G Greenwald and Brian A Nosek,,,,,PsyArXiv,Since its first publication in 1998. the Implicit Association Test (IAT) has been used repeatedly to measure implicit attitudes and other automatic associations. Although there have also been a few studies critical of the IAT. there now exists substantial evidence for the IAT= s convergent and discriminant validity. including new evidence reported in several of the articles in this special issue. IAT attitude measures have often correlated only weakly with explicit (self-report) measures of the same associations. It therefore seems appropriate to conclude that the IAT assesses constructs that are often (but not always) distinct from the corresponding constructs measured by self-report.,True,ztt_j28AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,652,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/sv8bv/,10868478693422595588,/scholar?cites=10868478693422595588,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/sv8bv/download,0,0,0

Many models have been proposed to explain cancer development. The descriptions employ exponential. potential. logistic or Gompertzian growth laws. Some of these models are concerned with the interaction between cancer and the immunological system. Among other properties. these models are concerned with the microscopic behavior of tumors and the emergence of cancer. We propose a modification of a previous model by Stepanova. which describes the specific immunological response against cancer. The modification consists of the substitution of a Gompertian law for the exponential rate used for tumoral growth. This modification is motivated by the numerous works confirming that Gompertz's equation correctly describes solid tumor growth.

Previous groups have proposed an approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits. based on an analogy with statistical mechanics. We present a modified version of that approach. which makes the analogy more precise and applies quite generally to describe the evolution of allele frequencies. We calculate explicitly how the macroscopic quantities (i.e.. quantities that depend on the quantitative trait) depend on evolutionary forces. in a way that is independent of the microscopic details. We first show that the stationary distribution of allele frequencies under drift. selection. and mutation maximizes a certain measure of entropy. subject to constraints on the expectation of observable quantities.

If alleles have equal effects. all combinations that result in the same deviation from the optimum are equivalent.

In reality. alleles vary in their effects. making the fitness landscape asymmetric and complicating analysis of the equilibria. We show that that the resulting genetic variance depends on the fraction of alleles near fixation. which contribute by . and on the total mutational effects of alleles that are at intermediate frequency.

The main dogma is the existence of density-dependence mechanisms. which can be modelled with distinct functional forms that depend on the size of the population. One important class of regulatory functions is the θ-logistic. which generalizes the logistic equation. Using this model as a motivation. this paper introduces a simple dynamical reformulation that generalizes many growth functions. The reformulation consists of two equations. one for population size. and one for the growth rate. Furthermore. the model shows that although population is density-dependent. the dynamics of the growth rate does not depend either on population size. nor on the carrying capacity. Actually. the growth equation is uncoupled from the population size equation. and the model has only two parameters. a Malthusian parameter ρ and a competition coefficient θ.

Also. early proto-organisms had to rely on simple anaerobic bioenergetic processes. In this work I propose that amino acid fermentation powered metabolism in the RNA world. and that this was facilitated by proto-adapters. the precursors of the tRNAs. Amino acids were used as carbon sources rather than as catalytic or structural elements. In modern bacteria. amino acid fermentation is known as the Stickland reaction. This pathway involves two amino acids: the first undergoes oxidative deamination. and the second acts as an electron acceptor through reductive deamination. This redox reaction results in two keto acids that are employed to synthesise ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation.

Here. we discuss some models of ecology and evolution and argue that ecological change. resulting in Red Queen dynamics. facilitates (but does not ensure) innovation.

Strong open-endedness requires the continual appearance of evolutionary novelties and/or innovations.

These macroscopic variables are the expectations of: the trait mean and its square. the genetic variance. and of a measure of heterozygosity. and are derived from a generating function that is in turn derived by maximizing an entropy measure. These four macroscopics are enough to accurately describe the dynamics of the trait mean and of its genetic variance (and in principle of any other quantity).

It was shown that late logarithmic intensification asymptotically reduces the tumor cell population to zero. Using the same total amount of therapy. the schedule following a logarithmic function produces a larger reduction of tumor cell population than the schedule using a therapy with constant intensity. On the other hand. a logarithmic intensification should be more tolerable by the patients than a faster temporal growth therapy. We have shown that during the treatment the dose intensity should not be decreased at any time while the therapy is applied. because this will allow the tumor to relapse. The therapy intensity should be continuously increased as possible.

This approach. however. does not account for other cultural features such as contentions. By contentions it is meant that agents learn other agents' traits but decide not to transmit these. This work introduces a version termed Flouted Naming Game which allows convergence to stable states of cultural contentions as an alternative outcome of the Naming Game. Which regime is achieved depends on a basic asymmetry on the cognitive reward of two opposing cultural forms. Moreover. it is found that there is a sharp phase transition between the two behavioural strategies.

However. it is not ensured that a simple. elegant. and intuitive inequality such as HR will result. Other complications against mathematical elegance arise when taking into account the structure of the population. which in turn can require different definitions or interpretations of relatedness. An apt picture of HR can be drawn by an analogy (7). If Earth were flat. a two-dimensional (2D) map would be absolutely accurate. and a straight line drawn between two cities would in fact give the shortest path between them. However. Earth is embedded in three dimensions. and 2D maps. by any cartographic projection. cannot be fully accurate. As anyone who flies on planes can tell. paths of jets (say. between Amsterdam and Boston) tend to look curved in the airline brochures. giving the false impression that jets spend more fuel and time than needed. But the shortest lines on a curved surface tend to look curved on a flat surface. Despite this distortion. flat maps can be very useful. For example. there is little inaccuracy of distance between two cities that are close to each other (like London and Amsterdam).When scientists seek to find the right expression of relatedness so that an HR-like rule holds. they do something like finding the shortest path on a 2D map of a curved surface. depending on the projection used.

As originally portrayed. this process is only one round of variation generation and selection. even if it requires several years. Evolution by natural selection works differently: variants are generated and then selected in iterative rounds. The field of “Neural Darwinism” 1– 3 fails to include generation of variants and thus could justifiably be regarded as a misnomer because the process that it describes is not evolutionary in the strict sense 8. Evidence indicated that the development of the brain is more “constructivist” 9 than pictured by the original selectionist accounts: for example. repeated rounds of neuron addition and loss happen during development 10. Structural plasticity (synaptic remodelling) is now known to be a lifelong process with implications for memory and learning (eg 11. 12).

However. parasitic replicators would take over and would have prevented life from taking off unless the replicators were compartmentalized in reproducing protocells. Paradoxically. control of protocell reproduction would seem to require evolved replicators. We show here that a simpler population structure. based on cycles of transient compartmentalization (TC) and mixing of RNA replicators. is sufficient to prevent takeover by parasitic mutants. TC tends to select for ensembles of replicators that replicate at a similar rate. including a diversity of parasites that could serve as a source of opportunistic functionality. Thus.

Ever since the seminal result of Manfred Eigen in 1971 showing that early template replication suffers from an error threshold. research has tackled the issue of how early genomes could have been dynamically stable without highly evolved mechanisms such as accurate replication and chromosomes. We review the theory of the origin. maintenance and enhancement of the RNA world as an evolving population of dynamical systems. Investigation of sequence space has revealed how structures are allocated in sequence space and how this affects the nature of the error threshold that sets the selectively maintainable genome length. New applications of old dynamical theory are still possible: the application of Gause’s principle of competitive exclusion. based on resource utilisation. to RNA replication predicts that at most four pairs (plus and minus strands) can stably be maintained on four nucleotides. Other mechanisms of early template coexistence should be regarded as additional means to raise the number of coexisting species above the number set by the competitive exclusion principle. One such example is the hypercycle in which templates were postulated to help replication of the next member in a cycle superimposed on individual replication cycles. Although the hypercycle is ecologically unstable it is evolutionarily unstable because it cannot efficiently compete against emerging parasites. Population structure can modify this conclusion but not without further qualification. The simplest form of population structure is limited diffusion on a surface.

It is built on the assumption that catalytically active replicators (most probably RNA-like macromolecules) may have been responsible for booting up life almost four billion years ago. The many different incarnations of nucleotide sequence (string) replicator models proposed recently are all attempts to explain on this basis how the genetic information transfer and the functional diversity of prebiotic replicator systems may have emerged. persisted and evolved into the first living cell. We have postulated three necessary conditions for an RNA World model system to be a dynamically feasible representation of prebiotic chemical evolution:(1) it must maintain and transfer a sufficient diversity of information reliably and indefinitely.(2) it must be ecologically stable and (3) it must be evolutionarily stable. In this review. we discuss the best-known prebiotic scenarios and the corresponding models of string-replicator dynamics and assess them against these criteria. We suggest that the most popular of prebiotic replicator systems. the hypercycle. is probably the worst performer in almost all of these respects. whereas a few other model concepts (parabolic replicator. open chaotic flows. stochastic corrector. metabolically coupled replicator system) are promising candidates for development into coherent models that may become experimentally accessible in the future.

Ribozymes are known to be able to catalyze many reaction types. including cofactor-aided metabolic transformations. In a metabolically complex RNA world. early division of labor between genes and enzymes could have evolved. where the ribozymes would have been transcribed from the genes more often than the other way round. benefiting the encapsulating cells through this dosage effect. Here we show. by computer simulations of protocells harboring unlinked RNA replicators. that the origin of replicational asymmetry producing more ribozymes from a gene template than gene strands from a ribozyme template is feasible and robust. Enzymatic activities of the two modeled ribozymes are in trade-off with their replication rates. and the relative replication rates compared to those of complementary strands are evolvable traits of the ribozymes. The degree of trade-off is shown to have the strongest effect in favor of the division of labor. Although some asymmetry between gene and enzymatic strands could have evolved even in earlier. surface-bound systems. the shown mechanism in protocells seems inevitable and under strong positive selection.

In line with a general mathematical concept published elsewhere. the niche of a species is described by the measures of the two-way interactions between the species and the resources. Increasing migration rate tends to equalize the population sizes between the habitats and diminish the dependence of the niches on the environmental tolerances of the species.

In the context of RNA replication a distinction between the genotypic and the phenotypic error threshold has been made; where the latter concerns the maintenance of secondary structure rather than sequence. RNA secondary structure is treated as a proxy for function. The phenotypic error threshold allows higher per digit mutation rates than its genotypic counterpart. and is known to increase with the frequency of neutral mutations in sequence space. Here we show that the degree of neutrality. i.e. the frequency of nearest-neighbour (one-step) neutral mutants is a remarkably accurate proxy for the overall frequency of such mutants in an experimentally verifiable formula for the phenotypic error threshold; this we achieve by the full numerical solution for the concentration of all sequences in mutation-selection balance up to length 16. We reinforce our previous result that currently known ribozymes could be selectively maintained by the accuracy known from the best available polymerase ribozymes. Furthermore. we show that in silico stabilizing selection can increase the mutational robustness of ribozymes due to the fact that they were produced by artificial directional selection in the first place.

Here we show by analytical and numerical calculations that Gause's principle of competitive exclusion holds for template replicators if resources (nucleotides) affect growth linearly and coexistence is at fixed point attractors. Cases of complementary or homologous pairing between building blocks with parallel or antiparallel strands show no deviation from the rule that the nucleotide compositions of stably coexisting species must be different and there cannot be more coexisting replicator species than nucleotide types. Besides this overlooked mechanism of template coexistence we show also that interesting sequence effects prevail as parts of sequences that are copied earlier affect coexistence more strongly due to the higher concentration of the corresponding replication intermediates. Template and copy always count as one species due their constraint of strict stoichiometric coupling. Stability of fixed-point coexistence tends to decrease with the length of sequences. although this effect is unlikely to be detrimental for sequences below 100 nucleotides. In sum. resource partitioning (niche differentiation) is the default form of competitive coexistence for replicating templates feeding on a cocktail of different nucleotides. as it may have been the case in the RNA world.

Yet. the theoretical background for understanding these changes is far from clear. Since fishing down in marine ecosystems is well-documented trend. and its top-down cascading effects in food webs have been richly documented. it is a current question whether overfishing. in general. can also influence regime shifts at lower levels. We model simple marine ecosystems by dynamical food webs and investigate the probability of regime shifts emerging among primary consumers. We considered cases where only one of the primary consumers is persistent in the stationary state. By perturbing the death rates in the food web. we studied the circumstances when the previously persistent primary producer is indirectly changed by …,True,0OxHLXcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,11,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1556/ComEc.10.2009.2.14,17866638974314547564,/scholar?cites=17866638974314547564,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1556/ComEc.10.2009.2.14.pdf,0,0,0

We complement this selectionist picture by a proof-of-principle model of evolutionary search in the brain. that accounts for new variations in theory space.

We employ a population of attractor networks with palimpsest memory.

We have developed the Metabolically Coupled Replicator System (MCRS). a spatially explicit simulation modelling approach to prebiotic RNA-World evolution on mineral surfaces. in which we incorporate the most important experimental facts and theoretical considerations to comply with recent knowledge on RNA and prebiotic evolution. In this paper the MCRS model framework has been extended in order to investigate the dynamical and evolutionary consequences of adding an important physico-chemical detail. namely explicit replicator structure – nucleotide sequence and 2D folding calculated from thermodynamical criteria – and their possible mutational changes. to the assumptions of a previously less detailed toy model. For each mutable nucleotide sequence the corresponding 2D folded structure with minimum free energy is calculated. which in turn is used to determine the fitness components (degradation rate. replicability and metabolic enzyme activity) of the replicator. We show that the community of such replicators providing the monomer supply for their own replication by evolving metabolic enzyme activities features an improved propensity for stable coexistence and structural adaptation. These evolutionary advantages are due to the emergent uniformity of metabolic replicator fitnesses imposed on the community by local group selection and …,True,0OxHLXcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,9,https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-015-0049-6,15985006908271863720,/scholar?cites=15985006908271863720,,https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-015-0049-6,0,0,0

It is based on the evolution of patterns that represent candidate solutions to a problem. and are stored and reproduced by a population of attractor networks. In our first experiment. we used human data as a benchmark and showed that the model behaves comparably to humans: it shows an improvement in performance if it is pretrained and primed appropriately. just like human participants in Kershaw et al.'s 2013 experiment. In the second experiment. we further investigated the effects of pretraining and priming in a two-by-two design and found a beginner's luck type of effect: solution rate was highest in the condition that was primed. but not pretrained with patterns relevant for the task. In the third experiment. we showed that deficits in computational capacity and learning abilities decreased the performance of the model. as expected.

It is clearer why sex is advantageous for the prokaryotes and eukaryotes but the benefit of sex for protocells with individually replicating ribozymes is not yet fully understood. In this context sex is the simple horizontal gene transfer among two protocells that undergo transient fusion. Many authors argue that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was very common in the early stage of evolution. However. HGT is a risky mechanism considering both the disruption of optimal compositions and the spread of parasites among protocells.

The replicator concept is at the core of genetics-first theories of the origin of life. which suggest that self-replicating oligonucleotides or their similar ancestors may have been the first “living” systems and may have led to the evolution of an RNA world. But problems with the nonenzymatic synthesis of biopolymers and the origin of template replication have spurred the alternative metabolism-first scenario. where self-reproducing and evolving proto-metabolic networks are assumed to have predated self-replicating genes. Recent theoretical work shows that “compositional genomes” (i.e.. the counts of different molecular species in an assembly) are able to propagate compositional information and can provide a setup on which natural selection acts.

Here. using in silico evolution of chemical networks. we show that there exists a diversity of remarkably simple and plausible chemical solutions to the associative learning problem. the simplest of which uses only one core chemical reaction. We then asked to what extent a linear combination of chemical concentrations in the network could approximate the ideal Bayesian posterior of an environment given the stimulus history so far?

Network indices are increasingly used to identify them. e.g. for conservation biological purposes. The problem is that the calculation of these indices is based on the particular network model of the studied food web. which can include network construction errors. For example. additional. unnecessary trophic links can be built in. or. to the contrary. functional links can be left out.

Metabolism-first approaches propose that mutually catalytic sets of simple organic molecules could be capable of self-replication and rudimentary chemical evolution. In particular. the graded autocatalysis replication domain (GARD) model. depicting assemblies of amphiphilic molecules. has received considerable interest. The system propagates compositional information across generations and is suggested to be a target of natural selection. However. evolutionary simulations indicate that the system lacks selectability (i.e. selection has negligible effect on the equilibrium concentrations).

This unit is a path of activity through a network of neurons. analogous to a path taken through a hidden Markov model. To prove in principle the capabilities of this new kind of informational substrate. we show how a population of paths can be used as the hereditary material for a neuronally implemented genetic algorithm. (the swiss-army knife of black-box optimization techniques) which we have proposed elsewhere could operate at somatic timescales in the brain. We compare this to the same genetic algorithm that uses a standard ‘genetic’ informational substrate. i.e. non-overlapping discrete genotypes. on a range of optimization problems. A path evolution algorithm (PEA) is defined as any algorithm that implements natural selection of paths in a network substrate. A PEA is a previously unrecognized type of natural selection that is well suited for implementation by biological neuronal networks with structural plasticity. The important similarities and differences between a standard genetic algorithm and a PEA are considered. Whilst most experiments are conducted on an abstract network model. at the conclusion of the paper a slightly more realistic neuronal implementation of a PEA is outlined based on Izhikevich spiking neurons.

Bees. in particular. have been argued to be able to count up to four items and solve complex numerical tasks. Here we present an exceedingly simple neural circuit that. when provided with the actual visual input that the bee is receiving while carrying out the task. can make reliable estimates on the number of items in the display. Thus we suggest that the elegance of numerical problem solving in bees might not lie in the formation of numerical concepts (such as “more.” “less.” or “zero”). but in the use of specific flight movements to scan targets. which streamlines the visual input and so renders the task of counting computationally inexpensive.

We explored the relative importance of the morphological and locomotor signals that spider-mimicking moths use to deceive their jumping spider predators. Two hypotheses explain why animals use multicomponent signals for communication: the ‘back-up signal’ hypothesis which suggests that multiple traits increase accuracy. and the ‘multiple message’ hypothesis which suggests that the different traits serve different purposes or target different signal receivers. We conducted predation tests using the putative spider-mimicking moths Brenthia coronigera (visual and locomotor mimicry) and Choreutis hyligenes (only locomotor mimicry) and a control moth species displaying no mimicry.

A crucial first step in recognition is the identification of edges and the segmentation of the visual field into areas that belong together. Honeybees and bumblebees acquire visual information through three types of photoreceptors; however. they only use a single receptor type—the one sensitive to longer wavelengths—for edge detection and movement detection. Here. we show that these long-wavelength receptors (peak sensitivity at ~544 nm. i.e.. green) provide the most consistent signals in response to natural objects.

In insects. there is a wealth of data available on the physiology of photoreceptors and on colour-dependent behaviour. but less is known about the neural mechanisms that link the two.

Here. we present a simple mathematical model for colour processing in the optic lobes of bees to explore how this diversity might arise. We found that the model can reproduce the physiological spectral tuning curves of the 22 neurons that have been described so far.

First. they demonstrate a clear effect of target-mask similarity on visual gap-resolution in eccentric vision: increasing target-mask similarity systematically decreases resolution performance. Second. spatial precueing has no effect on gap-resolution performance.

As reading does not train all parts of the retina in the same way but favors regions on the side in the direction of scanning. visual word recognition should be better at retinal locations that are frequently used during reading. In two studies that probed word and letter discriminations we provided evidence for a correlation between eye fixation pattern during reading and performance. We showed that effects of reading-related visual training were stimulus-specific in the sense that it affected the perception of words but not that of visually unfamiliar non-words. This stimulus specificity was also evident in the legibility of individual characters of the Roman and the Hebrew scripts—two scripts that are read in opposing directions.

Consequently. such studies remain inconclusive regarding whether motor brain structures are recruited directly in language processing or through post-linguistic conceptual imagery. In the present study. we introduce a grip-force sensor that allows online measurements of language-induced motor activity during sentence listening. We use this tool to investigate whether language-induced motor activity remains constant or is modulated in negative. as opposed to affirmative. linguistic contexts.   Methodology/Principal Findings Participants listened to spoken action target words in either affirmative or negative sentences while holding a sensor in a precision grip. The participants were asked to count the sentences containing the name of a country to ensure attention. The grip force signal was recorded continuously. The action words elicited an automatic and significant enhancement of the grip force starting at approximately 300 ms after target word onset in affirmative sentences; however. no comparable grip force modulation was observed when these action words occurred in negative contexts.   Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that this simple experimental paradigm can be used to study the online crosstalk between language and the motor systems in an ecological and economical manner. Our data further confirm that the motor brain structures that can be called upon during action word processing are not mandatorily involved; the crosstalk is …,True,PxQoduEAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,125,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050287,16180429089067013318,/scholar?cites=16180429089067013318,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050287,0,0,0

In addition. it was found that the eyes land on Kanji characters more frequently than on Hiragana or Katakana characters. Further analysis for two- and three-character words indicated that the eye's landing-site distribution differs depending on type of the characters in the word: the eyes prefer to land at the word beginning only when the initial character of the word is a Kanji character.

Word-recognition performance is maximal when the eye fixates a region near the word’s center. and decreases to both sides of this “optimal viewing position.” The reason for this phenomenon is assumed to be the strong drop-off of visual acuity: the visibility of letters decreases with increasing eccentricity from fixation location. Consequently. fewer letters can be identified when the beginning or ending of a word is fixated than when its center is fixated. The present study is a test of this visual acuity hypothesis. If the phenomenon is caused by letter visibility. then it should be sensitive to variations of visual conditions in which the letters are presented. By increasing the interletter distances of the word(e.g..a_t_t_e_m_ p_ t). letter visibility was decreased.

Performance is maximal with the eye slightly left of the center of the word and decreases drastically to both sides of thisoptimal viewing position. While manipulations of lexical factors have only marginal effects on this phenomenon. previous studies have pointed to a relation between the viewing position effect (VPE) and letter legibility: When letter legibility drops. the VPE becomes more exaggerated. To further investigate this phenomenon. we improved letter legibility by magnifying letter size in a way that was proportional to the distance from fixation (e.g.. TABLE). Contrary to what would be expected if the VPE were due to limits of acuity. improving the legibility of letters has only a restricted influence on performance.

We notice that not all letters are equally visible to the reader. The letter that is most visible is the letter that is fixated. The visibility of the other letters depends on the distance between the letters and the fixation location. whether the letters are outer or inner letters of the word. and whether the letters lie to the left or to the right of the fixation location. Because of these three factors. word recognition depends on the viewing position. In languages read from left to right. the optimal viewing position is situated between the beginning and the middle of the word. This optimal viewing position is the result of an interplay of four variables: the distance between the viewing position and the farthest letter. the fact that the word beginning is usually more informative than the word end. the fact that during reading words have been recognised a lot of …,True,PxQoduEAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,109,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9817.2005.00266.x,8504740881816957429,/scholar?cites=8504740881816957429,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01086622/document,0,0,0

The debate has thus been centered on the question of whether motor activation is an integral part of the lexical semantics (embodied theories) or the result of a post-lexical construction of a situation model (disembodied theories). However. research in psycholinguistics show that lexical semantic processing and context-dependent meaning construction are narrowly integrated. An understanding of the role of motor structures in action-language processing might thus be better achieved by focusing on the linguistic contexts under which such structures are recruited. Here. we therefore analyzed online modulations of grip force while subjects listened to target words embedded in different linguistic contexts. When the target word was a hand action verb and when the sentence focused on that action an early increase of grip force was observed. No comparable increase was detected when the same word occurred in a context that shifted the focus towards the agent’s mental state. There mere presence of an action word is thus not sufficient to trigger motor activation. Moreover. when the linguistic context set up a strong expectation for a hand action. a grip force increase was observed even when the tested word was a pseudo-verb. The presence of a known action word is thus not required to trigger motor activation.

From a visual point of view the absence of a ‘word length effect’ is a rather surprising phenomenon. Given that every additional letter moves outer letters of a word farther into parafoveal vision. the probability that an entire word will be perceived during a fixation should decrease as words become longer. The word length effect which is expected but not observed with skilled readers is. however. noticed in beginning readers. Reading performance of first graders decreases linearly as words become longer and only after several years of reading experience word length ceases to influence performance.

This lateral masking (LM) effect is known to depend on target eccentricity and spacing between target and flankers (Bouma. 1970). indicating that LM arises in early visual processing due to interactions among visual features.

There was a change in grip force when subjects heard verbs that related to manual action. Grip force increased from about 100 ms following the verb presentation. peaked at 380 ms and fell abruptly after 400 ms. signalling a possible inhibition of the motor simulation evoked by these words.

Experiment 1 revealed that training reduces crowding mainly for trained strings. This was corroborated in Experiment 2. where no training effects were obvious after 3 days of training when strings changed from trial to trial. Experiment 3 specified that after a short amount of training. learning effects remained specific to trained strings and also to the trained retinal eccentricity and the interletter spacing used in training.

Our study aimed at identifying neural markers of social interaction and goal variations in a non-verbal task. For this. we recorded simultaneously the electroencephalogram from two participants (dual-EEG). an actor and an observer. and their arm/hand kinematics in a real face-to-face paradigm. The observer watched “biological actions” performed by the human actor and “non-biological actions” performed by a robot. All actions occurred within an interactive or non-interactive context depending on whether the observer had to perform a complementary action or not (e.g.. the actor presents a saucer and the observer either places the corresponding cup or does nothing).

Recently. we have shown that neurons in the cat visual cortex have oscillatory responses in the range 40–60 Hz (refs 1. 2) which occur in synchrony for cells in a functional column and are tightly correlated with a local oscillatory field potential. This led us to hypothesize that the synchronization of oscillatory responses of spatially distributed. feature selective cells might be a way to establish relations between features in different parts of the visual field 2. 3. In support of this hypothesis. we demonstrate here that neurons in spatially separate columns can synchronize their oscillatory responses.

For one to detect and recognize an object within a scene. the features comprising the object must be identified and segregated from those comprising other objects.

By contrast. more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception. viewing it as an active and highly selective process.

In the visual system. it is still unresolved how responses of feature-detecting neurons can be bound into representations of perceptual objects. Recent crosscorrelation studies show that visual cortical neurons synchronize their responses depending on how coherent features are in the visual field.

1099727,Development and plasticity of cortical processing architectures,1995,Wolf Singer,270,,5237,758-764,American Association for the Advancement of Science,One of the basic functions of the cerebral cortex is the analysis and representation of relations among the components of sensory and motor patterns. It is proposed that the cortex applies two complementary strategies to cope with the combinatorial problem posed by the astronomical number of possible relations: (i) the analysis and representation of frequently occurring. behaviorally relevant relations by groups of cells with fixed but broadly tuned response properties; and (ii) the dynamic association of these cells into functionally coherent assemblies. Feedforward connections and reciprocal associative connections. respectively. are thought to underlie these two operations. The architectures of both types of connections are susceptible to experience-dependent modifications during development. but they become fixed in the adult.

The role of the cortical neuron revisited,1996,Peter König and Andreas K Engel and Wolf Singer,19,,4,130-137,Elsevier Current Trends,Neurons can operate in two distinct ways. depending on the duration of the interval over which they effectively summate incoming synaptic potentials. If this interval is of the order of the mean interspike interval or longer. neurons act effectively as temporal integrators and transmit temporal patterns with only low reliability. If. by contrast. the integration interval is short compared to the interspike interval. neurons act essentially as coincidence detectors. relay preferentially synchronized input. and the temporal structure of their output is a direct function of the input pattern. Recently. interest in this distinction has been revived because experimental and theoretical results suggest that synchronous firing of neurons might play an important role for information processing in the cortex.

The behavior of optimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice of the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak signal-to-noise ratios. but they are often lacking high-frequency details and are perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity expected at the higher resolution. In this paper. we present SRGAN. a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image super-resolution (SR). To our knowledge. it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic natural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this. we propose a perceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content loss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold using a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition. we use a content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in pixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic textures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive mean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual quality using SRGAN.

In these methods. the low resolution (LR) input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter. commonly bicubic interpolation. before reconstruction. This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper. we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this. we propose a novel CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition. we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By doing so. we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map. whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation.

New media formats. changing hardware technology. as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need. but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture. which makes it suitable for high-resolution images.

In order to elimi-nate potential biases in reporting mental contents due to verbal elaboration. subjects' responses in experiments are often limited to binary decisions or discrete choices that do not require conscious re ection upon their mental contents. However. it is unclear what such impoverished data can tell us about the potential richness and dy-namics of subjects' mental representations. To address this problem. we used ideal observer models that for-malise choice behaviour as (quasi-) Bayes-optimal. given subjects' representations in long-term memory. acquired through prior learning. and the stimuli currently avail-able to them. Bayesian inversion of such ideal observer models allowed us to infer subjects' mental representation from their choice behaviour in a variety of psychophysical tasks. The inferred mental representations also allowed us to predict future choices of subjects with reasonable accuracy. even in tasks that were dierent from those in which the representations were estimated.

The predominant strategy to keep up with these shifts is to train predictive models continuously. on fresh data. in order to prevent them from becoming stale. However. in many ad systems positive labels are only observed after a possibly long and random delay. These delayed labels pose a challenge to data freshness in continuous training: fresh data may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested by the training algorithm.

We show that to the contrary. signal cost is unnecessary for honest signaling even when interests conflict. We illustrate this principle by constructing examples of cost-free signaling equilibria for the two paradigmatic signaling games of Grafen (1990) and Godfray (1991). Our findings may explain why some animal signals use cost to ensure honesty whereas others do not and suggest that empirical tests of the signaling hypothesis should focus not on equilibrium cost but. rather. on the cost of deviation from equilibrium. We use these results to apply costly signaling theory to the low-cost signals that make up human language.

1099760,The cost of honesty and the fallacy of the handicap principle,2011,Szabolcs Számadó,81,,1,3-10,Academic Press,Honest signalling assumes a correlation between an observable signal and a nonobservable quality. There are many mutually nonexclusive mechanisms that can achieve such a correlation; however. for a long time the handicap principle has been identified as the main solution to this problem. In short. it claims that signals need to be costly to be honest and that honest signallers have to pay this extra cost at the equilibrium (i.e. signals have to be handicaps). Honesty. however. is not maintained by the realized cost paid by honest signallers at the equilibrium but by the potential cost of cheating. Whether this potential cost implies a realized cost for honest signallers depends on the biological details of the system and thus this cost cannot be predicted a priori without knowledge of these details. Accordingly. depending on these details. signals need not be costly to be honest. even under conflict of interest.

Simple models constructed to further investigate the issue were able both to prove and to disprove some of its claims.

Enquist (1985. Animal Behaviour. 33. 1152–1161) showed that communication of such information is possible by means of choice of action in aggressive encounters. The key assumption of Enquist's model is that weak individuals signalling that they are strong (i.e. cheaters) cannot get away without fighting even if they want to. if they meet an honest strong individual. However. this assumption was not elaborated further and Enquist's model is often cited in support of Zahavi's handicap principle.

A complicated conundrum exists as defectors have an advantage over cooperators. whenever cooperation is costly so consequently. not cooperating pays off. In addition. the discovery that humans and some animal populations. such as lions. are polymorphic. where cooperators and defectors stably live together -- while defectors are not being punished--. is even more puzzling. Here we offer a novel explanation based on a Threshold Public Good Game (PGG) that includes the interaction of individual and group level selection. where individuals can contribute to multiple collective actions. in our model group hunting and group defense. Our results show that there are polymorphic equilibria in Threshold PGGs; that multi-level selection does not select for the most cooperators per group but selects those close to the optimum number of cooperators (in terms of the Threshold PGG). In particular for medium cost values division of labour evolves within the group with regard to the two types of cooperative actions (hunting vs. defense). Moreover we show evidence that spatial population structure promotes cooperation in multiple PGGs. We also demonstrate that these results apply for a wide range of non-linear benefit function types. We demonstrate that cooperation can be stable in Threshold PGG. even when the proportion of so called free riders is high in the population. A fundamentally new mechanism is proposed how laggards. individuals that have a high tendency to defect during one specific group action can actually contribute to the fitness of the group. by …,True,t9oS4oIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,62,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-336,374596092220478477,/scholar?cites=374596092220478477,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-336,0,0,0

At such equilibria. every signaller sends a distinct signal. and signal receivers are able to exactly infer the signaller's condition from the signal sent. In this paper. we introduce a vector–field solution method that simplifies the process of solving for separating equilibria. Using this approach. we show that continuous signalling games can have low–cost separating equilibria despite conflicting interests between signaller and receiver. We find that contrary to prior arguments. honesty does not require wasteful signals. Finally. we examine signalling games in which different signallers have different minimal–cost signals. and provide a mathematical justification for the argument that even non–signalling traits will be exaggerated beyond their phenotypic optimum when they are used by other individuals to …,True,t9oS4oIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,56,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2002.1068,13978181254904497080,/scholar?cites=13978181254904497080,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693066/pdf/12495516.pdf,0,0,0

The aim of the present article is to investigate this proposal with the help of a simple game-theoretical model. It was found: (1) that the use of cost-free signals is an ESS against the invasion of handicapped signals even if cheating is played as part of a mixed strategy in the population; (2) that the use of handicaps may be an ESS against cost-free signals but only if we assume that the invading cost-free signal is not accepted by weak individuals as a signal of strength; (3) that the establishment of a handicapped signal in the first place is an unresolved problem. because both cost free signals and negative-handicaps are evolutionarily stable against the invasion of handicaps; (4) that in contrast to handicaps the …,True,t9oS4oIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,45,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519303931766,8078493721277510176,/scholar?cites=8078493721277510176,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fbd2/63bb079934b7a3be55245c5c87dd67923180.pdf,0,0,0

The frequency of cooperators in a spatially explicit SD game can be lower than it would be in an infinitely large well-mixed population. However. the source of this effect cannot be identified with certainty as spatially explicit games differ from well-mixed games in two aspects: (i) they introduce spatial correlations.

Such commitment can efficiently prevent the invasion of potentially weak cheaters pretending to be strong at a very low cost of harassment suffered by such weak individuals. Moreover. as long as such commitment is present. this cost is not a function of the contested resource; thus the value of the resource can be orders of magnitude higher than the potential cost imposed on cheaters. yet the system remains honest and evolutionarily stable.

Although lifetime injection drug use was uncommon (8% of men. 3% of women). many Hungarian inmates had engaged in unprotected sex and had had high-risk sex partners: a quarter of men had primary partners who sold sex. about half of them had sex with female prostitutes. 13% of women had worked as prostitutes. and 9% of all inmates indicated having had sex in prison.

It is unknown whether mitochondria were acquired early or late. and whether it was captured via phagocytosis or syntrophic integration. We present dynamical models to directly simulate the emergence of mitochondria in an ecoevolutionary context. Our results show that regulated farming of prey bacteria and delayed digestion can facilitate the establishment of stable endosymbiosis if prey-rich and prey-poor periods alternate. Stable endosymbiosis emerges without assuming any initial metabolic benefit provided by the engulfed partner. in a wide range of parameters. despite that during good periods farming is costly.

1099775,Why does costly signalling evolve? Challenges with testing the handicap hypothesis,2015,Szabolcs Számadó and Dustin J Penn,110,Animal behaviour,,e9,Europe PMC Funders,Zahavi’s handicap hypothesis (Grafen. 1990; Zahavi. 1975; Zahavi & Zahavi. 1997) is a popular explanation for the evolution of honest and costly signalling. The general idea is that individuals honestly signal their quality because signalling is costly and therefore lowquality individuals cannot afford to produce dishonest signals. However. this hypothesis is controversial for several reasons.(1) Zahavi suggested that selection favours the evolution of honest signalling because (and not despite) of their costs. and he made the radical suggestion that when it comes to the evolution of signalling. natural selection favours waste rather than efficiency.(2) Zahavi argued that this idea is a general principle. not merely a hypothesis. which explains honest signalling in most or all contexts.(3) There are several versions of the handicap hypothesis. but attempts to provide theoretical support have largely failed.

Here we provide a critical review of the Handicap Principle and its theoretical development. We explain why this idea is erroneous. and how it nevertheless became widely accepted as the leading explanation for honest signalling. In 1975. Zahavi proposed that elaborate secondary sexual characters impose ‘handicaps’ on male survival. not due to inadvertent signalling trade‐offs. but as a mechanism that functions to demonstrate males' genetic quality to potential mates. His handicap hypothesis received many criticisms. and in response. Zahavi clarified his hypothesis and explained that it assumes that signals are wasteful as well as costly. and that they evolve because wastefulness enforces honesty.

Grose (Biol Philos 2011) embarks to explain both the success of the theory and the empirical difficulties that exist despite this success.

Here I argue that pre-hunt communication was the starting context of the evolution of human language. Hunting of big game created a shared interest; animals and hunting actions are easy to imitate; the need to plan created a pressure for increasing complexity; and finally. cultural inheritance of hunting tools and know-how made the transition unique. I further argue that this “first step” was actually a two-stage process where first indexical and iconic signs evolved to coordinate recruitment for the hunt; then later. in the second stage. the complexity of this communication system increased as a response to the increased demand to coordinate group-hunting effort (including division of labor).

There are many ways organisms can adapt to moving targets. One of the ways is genetic evolution. when natural selection acts on variation in the population. selecting against those alleles that provide the least fit to the environment. The second way is by utilizing the phenotypic plasticity of a genotype. The third way is by means of systems and organs. which have evolved to cope with fast-changing environments and which have genetic underpinnings also. A set of genes can give rise to different phenotypes depending on the environment in which development takes place.

We complement experimental biological studies by an in silico approach in that we simulate the evolution of neuronal networks under selection for language-related skills. At the heart of this project is the Evolutionary Neurogenetic Algorithm (ENGA) that is deliberately biomimetic. The design of the system was inspired by important biological phenomena such as brain ontogenesis. neuron morphologies. and indirect genetic encoding. Neuronal networks were selected and were allowed to reproduce as a function of their performance in the given task.

1099782,Language evolution: competing selective scenarios,2006,Szabolcs Számadó and Eörs Szathmáry,,Trends Ecol. Evol. Submitted,,,,The recent blossoming of evolutionary linguistics resulted in a variety of theories that attempt to provide a selective scenario for the evolution of early language. There are scenarios focusing on almost all of the possible uses of human language one can think of: mate choice. mating contract. pair bonding. parent-offspring communication. gossip. rituals. grooming. tool making. and hunting. This is definitely a positive change after the infamous ban of the French Academy of Sciences; however. the overabundance of these theories makes many researchers sceptical towards such theorising. We think. agreeing with the sceptics. that a more rigorous approach is needed towards the construction of such theories. Despite the well-founded scepticism there is no agreement as to what criteria should be used to evaluate the validity of the various competing theories. Here we would like to fill the gap and provide a guideline upon which the various historical narratives can be judged. Some of these criteria follow from our evolutionary stance. some follow from biological and historical constraints. and others follow from common sense and the latest results of game theory. None of these criteria is highly constraining in itself. but we think that taken together these criteria can provide a powerful evolutionary framework to think about the evolution of human language.,True,t9oS4oIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,9,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.212.7311&rep=rep1&type=pdf,11148848143924238318,/scholar?cites=11148848143924238318,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.212.7311&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1099783,Deception undermines the stability of cooperation in games of indirect reciprocity,2016,Szabolcs Számadó and Ferenc Szalai and István Scheuring,11,PloS one,1,e0147623,Public Library of Science,Indirect reciprocity is often claimed as one of the key mechanisms of human cooperation. It works only if there is a reputational score keeping and each individual can inform with high probability which other individuals were good or bad in the previous round. Gossip is often proposed as a mechanism that can maintain such coherence of reputations in the face of errors of transmission. Random errors. however. are not the only source of uncertainty in such situations. The possibility of deceptive communication. where the signallers aim to misinform the receiver cannot be excluded. While there is plenty of evidence for deceptive communication in humans the possibility of deception is not yet incorporated into models of indirect reciprocity. Here we show that when deceptive strategies are allowed in the population it will cause the collapse of the coherence of reputations and thus in turn it results the collapse of cooperation. This collapse is independent of the norms and the cost and benefit values. It is due to the fact that there is no selection for honest communication in the framework of indirect reciprocity. It follows that indirect reciprocity can be only proposed plausibly as a mechanism of human cooperation if additional mechanisms are specified in the model that maintains honesty.,True,t9oS4oIAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147623,3129575999675940,/scholar?cites=3129575999675940,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147623,0,0,0

1099793,Internal wiring of cartesian verbs and prepositions,2018,Bob Coecke and Martha Lewis and Dan Marsden,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05770,,,,Categorical compositional distributional semantics (CCDS) allows one to compute the meaning of phrases and sentences from the meaning of their constituent words. A type-structure carried over from the traditional categorial model of grammar a la Lambek becomes a'wire-structure'that mediates the interaction of word meanings. However. CCDS has a much richer logical structure than plain categorical semantics in that certain words can also be given an'internal wiring'that either provides their entire meaning or reduces the size their meaning space. Previous examples of internal wiring include relative pronouns and intersective adjectives. Here we establish the same for a large class of well-behaved transitive verbs to which we refer as Cartesian verbs. and reduce the meaning space from a ternary tensor to a unary one. Some experimental evidence is also provided.,True,ZMC6TIAAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,6,https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05770,3248342099896162861,/scholar?cites=3248342099896162861,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05770,0,0,0
1099794,Compositionality for recursive neural networks,2019,Martha Lewis,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.10723,,,,Modelling compositionality has been a longstanding area of research in the field of vector space semantics. The categorical approach to compositionality maps grammar onto vector spaces in a principled way. but comes under fire for requiring the formation of very high-dimensional matrices and tensors. and therefore being computationally infeasible. In this paper I show how a linear simplification of recursive neural tensor network models can be mapped directly onto the categorical approach. giving a way of computing the required matrices and tensors. This mapping suggests a number of lines of research for both categorical compositional vector space models of meaning and for recursive neural network models of compositionality.,True,ZMC6TIAAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10723,1211568807017490784,/scholar?cites=1211568807017490784,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10723,0,0,0

We show here how this phenomenon is naturally accommodated within a compositional distributional model of meaning. This model describes the meaning of a composite concept by accounting for interaction between its constituents via their grammatical roles. We give two illustrative examples to show how the qualitative phenomena are exhibited.

1099798,Cats climb entails mammals move: preserving hyponymy in compositional distributional semantics,2020,Gemma De las Cuevas and Andreas Klinger and Martha Lewis and Tim Netzer,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.14134,,,,To give vector-based representations of meaning more structure. one approach is to use positive semidefinite (psd) matrices. These allow us to model similarity of words as well as the hyponymy or is-a relationship. Psd matrices can be learnt relatively easily in a given vector space . but to compose words to form phrases and sentences. we need representations in larger spaces. In this paper. we introduce a generic way of composing the psd matrices corresponding to words. We propose that psd matrices for verbs. adjectives. and other functional words be lifted to completely positive (CP) maps that match their grammatical type. This lifting is carried out by our composition rule called Compression. Compr. In contrast to previous composition rules like Fuzz and Phaser (aka KMult and BMult). Compr preserves hyponymy. Mathematically. Compr is itself a CP map. and is therefore linear and generally non-commutative. We give a number of proposals for the structure of Compr. based on spiders. cups and caps. and generate a range of composition rules.

However. it fails to model the fact that language can change. We give an approach to DisCoCat that allows us to represent language models and translations between them. enabling us to describe translations from one language to another. or changes within the same language. We unify the product space representation given in (Coecke et al.. 2010) and the functorial description in (Kartsaklis et al.. 2013). in a way that allows us to view a language as a catalogue of meanings. We formalize the notion of a lexicon in DisCoCat. and define a dictionary of meanings between two lexicons. All this is done within the framework of monoidal categories.

Compositional distributional models of meaning have been argued to deal well with finer shades of meaning variation known as polysemy. but are not so well equipped to handle word senses that are etymologically unrelated. or homonymy. Moving from vectors to density matrices allows us to encode a probability distribution over different senses of a word. and can also be accommodated within a compositional distributional model of meaning. In this paper we present three new neural models for learning density matrices from a corpus. and test their ability to discriminate between word senses on a range of compositional datasets.

We compositionally build game-theoretic semantics of sentences by taking the semantic category to be the category whose morphisms are open games.

1099804,Modelling compositionality of vague concepts,2015,Martha Anne Flinders Lewis,,,,,,This thesis is concerned with modelling ways in which humans combine and modify concepts. We develop a framework for the hierarchical composition of vague concepts. based on random set theory. prototype theory. and embedded within conceptual spaces. We call this the Hierarchical Conceptual Spaces (HCS) framework. The framework allows for the construction of concepts at varying levels of complexity. We relate the HCS framework to models in the literature. arguing that we can account for key aspects of human concept use in a systematic and grounded way. In particular. we show that the characterisation of concepts as weighted sums of attributes may be accommodated as a special case of the HCS framework under specific conditions. We use the idea of necessity from possibility theory to characterise the weight of each attribute. We then go on to apply the HCS framework in order to model data on human concept use from the psychological literature. We find that there is at least some support for the HCS framework in modelling human concept use. We further investigate an alternative type of compositionality. that of linguistic hedges. We derive a model of linguistic hedges that is semantically grounded. in which hedges are formed by considering the dependence of the threshold of a hedged concept on the threshold of the original concept. We give a basic model and two generalisations. show that the models can be composed and investigate the behaviour in the limit of composition.

Reaction times in a visual XOR task are slower than in AND/OR tasks in which pairs of shapes are categorised. This behaviour is explained by the time needed to perceive shapes in the various tasks. using a parallel drift diffusion model. The parallel model explains reaction times in an extension of the XOR task. up to 7 shapes. Subsequently. the behaviour is explained by a combined model that assumes perceptual chunking. processing shapes within chunks in parallel. and chunks themselves in serial. The pure parallel model also explains reaction times for ALL and EXISTS tasks. An extension to the perceptual chunking model adds time taken to apply a logical rule.

We implement the framework in a multi-agent simulation of language evolution and show that shared combination weights emerge. The expected value and the variance of these weights across agents may be predicted from the distribution of elements in the conceptual space. as determined by the underlying environment. together with the rate at which agents adopt others' concepts.

There is furthermore a history of vector space models in cognitive science. Theories of categorization such as those developed by Nosofsky [1986] and Smith et al.[1988] utilise notions of distance between feature vectors.

The same compositional approach has been applied to this formalism. giving conceptual spaces theory a richer model of compositionality than previously [Bolt et al.. 2018]. Compositional approaches have also been applied in the study of strategic games and Nash equilibria. In contrast to classical game theory. where games are studied monolithically as one global object. compositional game theory works bottom-up by building large and complex games from smaller components.

New Mexico,,,,The literature on ethnic migration suggests that natural disasters. armed conflict. economics and cultural networks are key drivers of migration. The dearth of georeferenced ethnic data. however. limits the value of econometric analysis. We build an agent-based model to simulate crisis-driven migration. Agents within a multi-ethnic population monitor their spatial environments to formulate perceptions of the risk of being persecuted. The expected utility of staying within a given neighborhood is inversely related to the perceived probability of persecution. Cultural networks temper an agent's security calculus. with strong social ties dampening the human security dilemma. Agents express preferences regarding the different ethnic groups in their spatial environment and social network. Social networks expand over time. but are often negatively impacted by exogenous social shocks. The resulting migratory patterns and ethnic clustering is a product of the confluence of event location and magnitude. ethnic tension. demographic factors and breadth of networks.

A complicated conundrum exists as defectors have an advantage over cooperators. whenever cooperation is costly so consequently. not cooperating pays off. In addition. the discovery that humans and some animal populations. such as lions. are polymorphic. where cooperators and defectors stably live together -- while defectors are not being punished--. is even more puzzling. Here we offer a novel explanation based on a Threshold Public Good Game (PGG) that includes the interaction of individual and group level selection. where individuals can contribute to multiple collective actions. in our model group hunting and group defense. Our results show that there are polymorphic equilibria in Threshold PGGs; that multi-level selection does not select for the most cooperators per group but selects those close to the optimum number of cooperators (in terms of the Threshold PGG). In particular for medium cost values division of labour evolves within the group with regard to the two types of cooperative actions (hunting vs. defense). Moreover we show evidence that spatial population structure promotes cooperation in multiple PGGs. We also demonstrate that these results apply for a wide range of non-linear benefit function types. We demonstrate that cooperation can be stable in Threshold PGG. even when the proportion of so called free riders is high in the population. A fundamentally new mechanism is proposed how laggards. individuals that have a high tendency to defect during one specific group action can actually contribute to the fitness of the group. by …,True,OpZ9oEcAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,62,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-336,374596092220478477,/scholar?cites=374596092220478477,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-336,0,0,0

Ever since the seminal result of Manfred Eigen in 1971 showing that early template replication suffers from an error threshold. research has tackled the issue of how early genomes could have been dynamically stable without highly evolved mechanisms such as accurate replication and chromosomes. We review the theory of the origin. maintenance and enhancement of the RNA world as an evolving population of dynamical systems. Investigation of sequence space has revealed how structures are allocated in sequence space and how this affects the nature of the error threshold that sets the selectively maintainable genome length. New applications of old dynamical theory are still possible: the application of Gause’s principle of competitive exclusion. based on resource utilisation. to RNA replication predicts that at most four pairs (plus and minus strands) can stably be maintained on four nucleotides. Other mechanisms of early template coexistence should be regarded as additional means to raise the number of coexisting species above the number set by the competitive exclusion principle. One such example is the hypercycle in which templates were postulated to help replication of the next member in a cycle superimposed on individual replication cycles. Although the hypercycle is ecologically unstable it is evolutionarily unstable because it cannot efficiently compete against emerging parasites. Population structure can modify this conclusion but not without further qualification. The simplest form of population structure is limited diffusion on a surface.

Many situations. for example. cooperative hunting. group foraging. territorial defense. predator watching. or parental care. can be adequately described as a snowdrift game. In this paper. we investigate the asynchronous version of the game in which. contrary to the rather unrealistic assumption of simultaneous moves. one of the players acts first and the other responds by knowing its decision. Players are assigned to be first or second movers randomly and with the same probability. We found that both a synergistic effect of cooperation (i.e.. cooperative effort is better than the sum of the individual efforts) and population structure (low dispersal. spatial confinement. or group formation) are crucial for mutual cooperation to emerge. Otherwise. only one of the players will carry the burden of cooperation.,True,OpZ9oEcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,38,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/17/4/633/215790,11972440133826506682,/scholar?cites=11972440133826506682,,https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/17/4/633/215790,0,0,0

Ribozymes are known to be able to catalyze many reaction types. including cofactor-aided metabolic transformations. In a metabolically complex RNA world. early division of labor between genes and enzymes could have evolved. where the ribozymes would have been transcribed from the genes more often than the other way round. benefiting the encapsulating cells through this dosage effect. Here we show. by computer simulations of protocells harboring unlinked RNA replicators. that the origin of replicational asymmetry producing more ribozymes from a gene template than gene strands from a ribozyme template is feasible and robust. Enzymatic activities of the two modeled ribozymes are in trade-off with their replication rates. and the relative replication rates compared to those of complementary strands are evolvable traits of the ribozymes. The degree of trade-off is shown to have the strongest effect in favor of the division of labor. Although some asymmetry between gene and enzymatic strands could have evolved even in earlier. surface-bound systems. the shown mechanism in protocells seems inevitable and under strong positive selection.

Despite the ubiquitous presence of mutualism. its evolutionary origin and stability has remained enigmatic. Here. we study this problem by generalizing Doebeli and Knowlton's spatial model for the evolution of mutualism [Doebeli. M.. Knowlton. N.. 1998. The evolution of interspecific mutualism. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95. 8676–8680]. We show that spatial environmental heterogeneity facilitates the evolution of mutualistic interactions under a wide range of plausible conditions. Our model exhibits complex spatial patch dynamics. with environmental heterogeneity reducing among patch migration and leading to increased phenotypic diversity. Moreover. under such environmental heterogeneity. we also observe that both mutualism and exploitative interactions can be permanently present in the same population.,True,OpZ9oEcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X04000546,13388457121107652892,/scholar?cites=13388457121107652892,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45494217/ecolcomp05.pdf,0,0,0

Assortative linking promotes cooperation particularly for medium sized associations,2010,Ádám Kun and Gergely Boza and István Scheuring,10,BMC evolutionary biology,1,173,BioMed Central Ltd,Evolution of cooperative behaviour is widely studied in different models where interaction is heterogeneous. although static among individuals. However. in nature individuals can often recognize each other and chose. besides to cooperate or not. to preferentially associate with or to avoid certain individuals. Here we consider a dynamical interaction graph. in contrast to a static one. We propose several rules of rejecting unwanted partners and seeking out new ones. and study the probability of emergence and maintenance of cooperation on these dynamic networks. Our simulations reveal that cooperation can evolve and be stable in the population if we introduce preferential linking. even if defectors can perform it too. The fixation of cooperation has higher probability than that of on static graphs. and this effect is more prevalent at high benefit to cost ratios. We also find an optimal number of partners. for which the …,True,OpZ9oEcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2148-10-173,759725423466736253,/scholar?cites=759725423466736253,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2148-10-173,0,0,0

The single presumed example is the endosymbiogenetic origin of mitochondria. which is hidden behind the event horizon of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. While eukaryotes are monophyletic. it is unlikely that during billions of years. there were no other prokaryote–prokaryote endosymbioses as symbiosis is extremely common among prokaryotes. e.g.. in biofilms. Therefore. it is even more precarious to draw conclusions about potentially existing (or once existing) prokaryotic endosymbioses based on a single example. It is yet unknown if the bacterial endosymbiont was captured by a prokaryote or by a (proto-)eukaryote. and if the process of internalization was parasitic infection. slow engulfment. or phagocytosis.

There appears to be a discrepancy between understanding systemic risk from a natural-science perspective and the unresolved challenges that arise when humans with their initiatives and interactions are included in systemic-risk considerations. It is therefore necessary to investigate possible fundamental differences and similarities of systemic risk with and without accounting for human involvement. Focusing on applied and implementation aspects of measuring. modeling. and managing systemic risks. we identify three important and distinct features characterizing such fundamental differences: indetermination. indecision. and responsibility.

This is due in part to the fact that systemic risk research focuses on the connection of elements within a system. while risk analysis research focuses more on individual risk to single elements. We therefore investigate how current systemic risk research can be related to traditional risk analysis approaches from a conceptual as well as an empirical point of view. Based on Sklar’s Theorem. which provides a one-to-one relationship between multivariate distributions and copulas. we suggest a reframing of the concept of copulas based on a network perspective.

Empirical evidence supports the idea that animal and plant hosts can combine ‘private resources’ with the ecological phenomenon known as ‘community bistability’ to favour some microbial strains over others. We briefly review evidence showing that hosts can: (i) protect the growth of beneficial strains in an isolated habitat. (ii) use antibiotics to suppress non-beneficial. competitor strains. and (iii) provide resources that only beneficial strains are able to translate into an increased rate of growth. reproduction. or antibiotic production. We then demonstrate in a spatially explicit. individual-based model that these three mechanisms act similarly by selectively promoting the initial proliferation of preferred strains. that is. by acting as a private resource. The faster early growth of preferred strains. combined with the phenomenon of ‘community bistability.’ allows those strains to continue to dominate the microbiome even after the private resource is withdrawn or made public. This is because after a beneficial colony reaches a sufficiently large size. it can resist invasion by parasites without further private support from the host. We further explicitly model localized microbial interactions and diffusion dynamics. and we show that an intermediate level of antibiotic diffusion is the most efficient mechanism in promoting preferred strains and that there is a wide range of parameters under which hosts can promote the assembly of a self-sustaining defensive microbiome. This in turn supports the idea that hosts readily evolve to promote host …,True,OpZ9oEcAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,5,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007109&rev=1,5633848860731314173,/scholar?cites=5633848860731314173,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007109&rev=1,0,0,0

We suggest that. rather. individual risks and systemic risks represent two ends of a continuum and therefore should not be analyzed in isolation. but in an integrative manner. Such a perspective can further be related to the notion of resilience and opens up options for developing an integrated framework for increasing the resilience of systems to both types of risks simultaneously. Systemic risks are sometimes called network risks to emphasize the importance of inter-linkages. while. in contrast. individual risks originate from individual events that directly affect an agent and happen independently from the rest of the system.

Such interactions will often involve plasticity in investment behavior. in response to the interacting partner's investments. Our aim here is to investigate the evolution and stability of reciprocal investment behavior in interspecific interactions. a key phenomenon strongly supported by experimental observations. In particular. we present a comprehensive analysis of a continuous reciprocal investment game between mutualists. both in well-mixed and spatially structured populations. and we demonstrate a series of novel mechanisms for maintaining interspecific mutualism. We demonstrate that mutualistic partners invariably follow investment cycles. during which mutualism first increases. before both partners eventually reduce their investments to zero. so that these cycles always conclude with full defection. We show that the key mechanism for stabilizing mutualism is phase polymorphism along the investment cycle. Although mutualistic partners perpetually change their strategies. the community-level distribution of investment levels becomes stationary. In spatially structured populations. the maintenance of polymorphism is further facilitated by dynamic mosaic structures. in which mutualistic partners form expanding and collapsing spatial bubbles or clusters. Additionally. we reveal strategy-diversity thresholds. both for well-mixed and spatially structured mutualistic communities. and discuss factors for meeting these thresholds. and thus maintaining mutualism.

Ilmola et al.. 2013; Keating et al.. 2014; Linkov et al.. 2016; Mochizuki et al.. 2018). The popular understanding of resilience comes from engineering. which traditionally referred to the resistance of a system to disturbance and to the speed at which such a system returns to equilibrium (Davoudi. 2012). CS Holling. widely held to be the father of the concept. defined resilience differently. focusing on the “persistence of systems and their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between populations or state variables”(Holling. 1973. p. 14). For Holling. understanding this ability requires a careful assessment of the dynamical interactions between a system’s components. Insufficiently resilient systems are exposed to knock-outs. with perturbations potentially triggering large and lasting system-wide collapses. a threat nowadays referred to as systemic risk. A distinguishing feature of such risks is that they emerge from the complex interactions among individual elements or agents and their associated individual risks; systemic risk is therefore also sometimes called network risk (Helbing. 2013). In contrast. individual risk originates from single events that directly affect an agent. in isolation from the rest of the system. It is often defined as the “effect of uncertainty on objectives”(ISO. 2009). and is typically quantified by assessing the probability of an event and its corresponding impacts (UNISDR. 2017).While the realization of individual risks may lead to a disaster in part of a …,True,OpZ9oEcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/15611/1/Hochrainer-Stigler-et-al-for-IRGC-Resilience-Guide-Vol-2-2018.pdf,,,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/15611/1/Hochrainer-Stigler-et-al-for-IRGC-Resilience-Guide-Vol-2-2018.pdf,0,0,0

1099857,Behavior genetics and postgenomics,2012,Evan Charney,35,Behavioral and brain sciences,5,331,Cambridge University Press,The science of genetics is undergoing a paradigm shift. Recent discoveries. including the activity of retrotransposons. the extent of copy number variations. somatic and chromosomal mosaicism. and the nature of the epigenome as a regulator of DNA expressivity. are challenging a series of dogmas concerning the nature of the genome and the relationship between genotype and phenotype. According to three widely held dogmas. DNA is the unchanging template of heredity. is identical in all the cells and tissues of the body. and is the sole agent of inheritance. Rather than being an unchanging template. DNA appears subject to a good deal of environmentally induced change. Instead of identical DNA in all the cells of the body. somatic mosaicism appears to be the normal human condition. And DNA can no longer be considered the sole agent of inheritance. We now know that the epigenome. which regulates gene expressivity. can be inherited via the germline. These developments are particularly significant for behavior genetics for at least three reasons: First. epigenetic regulation. DNA variability. and somatic mosaicism appear to be particularly prevalent in the human brain and probably are involved in much of human behavior; second. they have important implications for the validity of heritability and gene association studies. the methodologies that largely define the discipline of behavior genetics; and third. they appear to play a critical role in development during the perinatal period and. in particular. in enabling phenotypic plasticity in offspring.

According to the competition model. the listener uses verbal cues in a probabilistic manner to make judgments concerning the grammatical roles of the different noun phrases in a sentence. The order in which children develop control of these cues is said to depend on cue validity.

This constancy of artifacts of intervention thus allows unbiased assessment of differences between and among treatments because effects of any such artifacts contribute equally to each treatment and therefore cancel out in contrasts. Unfortunately. this assumption will be violated whenever an artifact of intervention and the experimental treatment interact. As one illustration of the lack of appreciation of this assumption. we review those marine ecological studies that employ tethering of mobile prey organisms as a technique by which to assess the relative intensity of predation as a function of changing habitat.

The kelp were largely excluded from a zone in the lowest intertidal zone where the surf grass Phyllospadix sp. grew. but were abundant on all other rock surfaces.

There were also interactions among E. laevigata of the same year-class. expressed as a density-dependent mortality of very small algae. and as faster growth rates and greater number of branches of kelp at low densities.

Mortality following sedimentation for sand-flat bivalves is shown to be density-dependent solely because of the historical influence of crowding. Consequently. the density dependence is actually caused by the interaction between the stress of sedimentation and the density history of the organisms.

Echinometra mathaei (de Blainville) at Rottnest Island. Western Australia. displays variation in the size of Aristotle's lantern relative to the maximum diameter of the test. This variation was associated with local variations in density of urchins at each of two sites in each of two years (1980 and 1981); this association with density was consistent with the proposal that relatively larger lanterns are a response to decreased food availability. Furthermore. variation of relative lantern size associated with local density was similar in magnitude to the variation displayed between sites and between years.

Eucalyptus argutifolia Grayling and Brooker. Multi-locus estimates of the outcrossing rate were high in most populations (t m= 0.79–0.96). and no relationship between population size and the outcrossing rate was evident. In addition. significant amounts of interspecific hybridization were found in some small populations (up to 47 per cent of the seeds assayed).

Recent population genetic models have focused on the relative costs and benefits of migration between populations. On the one hand. migration may limit adaptive divergence by preventing local populations from matching their local selective optima. On the other hand. migration may also contribute to the genetic variance necessary to allow populations to track these changing optima. Empirical evidence for these contrasting effects of gene flow in natural situations are lacking. largely because it remains difficult to acquire.

We investigated levels of multiple paternity in loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) from three rookeries in Western Australia by analysing polymorphic species-specific genetic markers. We predicted that the level of multiple paternity would be related to female population size and hence the large rookery at Dirk Hartog Island would have higher rates of multiple paternity than two smaller mainland rookeries at Gnaraloo Bay and Bungelup Beach.

Australia's largest freshwater fish. M. peelii. was the most sensitive to hypoxia but given that we evaluated tolerances of juveniles (0.99±0.04 g; mean mass ±SE). the low tolerance of this species could not be attributed to its large maximum attainable body mass (>100.000 g). Concentrations of dissolved oxygen causing 50% mortality (LC50) in freshwater ranged from 0.25±0.06 mg l−1 in T. tandanus to 1.58±0.01 mg l−1 in M. peelii over 48 h at 25–26°C. Logistic models predicted that first mortalities may start at oxygen concentrations ranging from 2.4 mg l−1 to 3.1 mg l−1 in T. tandanus and M. peelii respectively within blackwater simulations.

1099949,Stable isotope analysis of aquatic invertebrate communities in irrigated rice fields cultivated under different management regimes,2005,AL Wilson and DS Ryder and RJ Watts and MM Stevens,39,Aquatic Ecology,2,189-200,Springer Netherlands,In this study we have used stable isotope analysis to identify major food resources driving food webs in commercial rice agroecosystems and to examine the effects of agricultural management practices on the trophic structure of these food webs. Potential carbon sources and aquatic macroinvertebrate consumers were collected from large-scale rice farms in south-eastern Australia cultivated under three different crop management regimes conventional-aerial (agrochemicals applied. aerially sown). conventional-sod (agrochemicals applied. directly sown) and organic-sod (agrochemical-free. directly sown). Evidence from stable isotope analysis demonstrated the importance of food sources. such as biofilm and detritus. as the principal energy sources driving aquatic food webs in rice agroecosystems.

We reveal the complex history of the gene MaMyb2 in shaping flower colour divergence within a recent radiation of monkeyflowers. In the Mimulus aurantiacus species complex. red-flowered M. a. ssp. puniceus and yellow-flowered M. a. ssp. australis are partially isolated because of differences in pollinator preferences. Phylogenetic analyses based on genome-wide variation across the complex suggest two origins of red flowers from a yellow-flowered ancestor: one in M. a. ssp. puniceus and one in M. a. ssp. flemingii.

However. interpreting the genomic “landscape” of speciation is difficult. because many evolutionary processes can impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first chromosome-level assembly for the group. we use whole-genome sequencing and simulations to shed light on the processes that have shaped the genomic landscape during a radiation of monkeyflowers. After inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the 9 taxa in this radiation. we show that highly similar diversity (π) and differentiation (FST) landscapes have emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was strongly predicted by the local density of functional elements and the recombination rate. suggesting that the landscapes have been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the varying divergence times between pairs of taxa. we show that the correlations between FST and genome features arose almost immediately after a population split and have become stronger over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest that background selection (BGS; i.e.. selection against deleterious mutations) alone is too subtle to generate the observed patterns. but scenarios that involve positive selection and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative explanations. Finally. tests for introgression among these taxa reveal widespread evidence of heterogeneous selection against gene flow during this radiation.

Teale and Zoe R. Hamilton,83,,,159-171,,Three species of camaenid land snails occur on Barrow Island: Quistrachia barrowensis and two previously unassigned species of Rhagada. Based on morphological re-evaluation and analysis of sequences of the mitochondrial gene COI. we have revised the taxonomy of these species. providing a clearer understanding of their geographic distributions and origins. The supposed Barrow Island endemic Q. barrowensis is synonymous with Q. montebelloensis from the Montebello and Lowendal Islands. The small species of Rhagada. confined to the northern tip of Barrow Island. is conspecific with R. plicata. whose distribution also includes the Montebellos and the Lowendals. The large species of Rhagada is described here as R. barrowensis sp. nov.. known only from Barrow Island and adjacent Pascoe Island. The three camaenids represent deeply divergent lineages with different geographic origins. indicating that the local diversity on Barrow Island has come about through a complex history.

1099973,Is it time to abandon the biological species concept? No,2020,Roger K Butlin and Sean Stankowski,,National Science Review,,,Oxford University Press (OUP),The Oxford English Dictionary defines a concept as.“an idea of a class of objects. a general notion”. It follows from this definition that a concept cannot be rejected in the way that an hypothesis might be rejected if its predictions are inconsistent with observations. Instead. a concept must be judged by its heuristic value: does it help in making sense of the natural world?The Biological Species Concept (BSC) was designed to aid understanding of biological diversity. particularly the ubiquitous observation that sexually-reproducing organisms exist in more or less distinct phenotypic and genetic clusters rather than in a continuum of forms. It does so by focusing attention on the contrast between successful interbreeding within groups and reproductive isolation between them. Distinct groups can form in other ways. and can occur in organisms that lack regular sexual reproduction. This has led to alternative conceptualisations of the units of diversity (1. 2). However. the fact that the BSC is highlighted in every biology textbook and lecture course. more than 80 years after it was introduced and formalised (3. 4). is testament to its continued utility. Perhaps most importantly. the BSC identifies a research programme for understanding the origin of biological diversity by equating the process of speciation with the evolution of reproductive isolation. This has been the foundation of a huge body of research in evolutionary biology since the NeoDarwinian synthesis which has led to a much deeper understanding of species and speciation. although the job is certainly not yet completed.,True,eabF5JUAAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC,3,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/162055/1/Butlin_Stankowski.pdf,15230254959639814206,/scholar?cites=15230254959639814206,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/162055/1/Butlin_Stankowski.pdf,0,0,0

Fourteen bores were sampled six times over 3 or 4 years to assess the reliability of net‐hauling sampling in broad‐scale survey to collect the groundwater fauna present at a site and to identify short‐range endemic (SRE) species.3.

The stygofaunal species occur in an array of different groundwater environments including porous. karstic and fractured-rock aquifers. springs and hyporheic habitats. Sampling coverage has been highly skewed in terms of areal coverage and the different types of groundwater environments represented‒96% of sampled sites are bores or wells. while springs and hyporheic habitats have rarely been sampled. The higher-level systematic diversity of the region is quite comprehensive in global terms. but the species-level taxonomy of most groups is still incomplete. There appears to be significant regional endemism in the Pilbara stygofauna. including some relict freshwater lineages.

Penthesilenula and Darwinula. from different continents. We applied two methods for detecting cryptic species. namely the K/θ method and the General Mixed Yule Coalescent model (GMYC). We could confirm the existence of species in all five darwinulid morphospecies and additional cryptic diversity in three morphospecies. namely in Penthesilenula brasiliensis.

The number of cryptic species within one morphospecies varied between seven (P. brasiliensis). five to six (D. stevensoni) and two (P. aotearoa). respectively. depending on the method used. Cryptic species mainly followed continental distributions. We also found evidence for coexistence at the local scale for Brazilian cryptic species of P. brasiliensis and P. aotearoa.

The Pilbara is also rich in mineral resources. which are being heavily exploited. and most of the region is under pastoral lease. with both land uses potentially having an impact upon aquatic systems. In order to provide information for improved conservation planning. including environmental impact assessment and reserve system design. a survey of wetland fauna was undertaken as part of a broader biodiversity survey of the region. This paper describes patterns in the distribution of the region’s aquatic invertebrate diversity and identifies environmental correlates of those patterns. Invertebrates and environmental variables were surveyed at 100 wetlands in spring and autumn between 2003 and 2006. The Pilbara appears to have a particularly diverse fauna for an arid zone. with just over 1000 species collected. an average of 94 species per sample and a maximum sample richness of 226 species. About a fifth of the fauna is known to date only from the Pilbara.

Other than in karstic calcrete. the subterranean spaces in the Western Australian vadose zone are small and often of similar size to the troglofauna inhabiting them. Here we describe how troglofauna can be sampled in the vadose zone using a technique called scraping. in which a haul net is dropped down a hole drilled for geological exploration. We analysed of the results of 10.895 sampling events in which both the scraping and trapping techniques were used. In the Pilbara region of Western Australia. where most of the fieldwork occurred. scraping collected approximately three-quarters more troglofaunal animals than trapping and more than twice as many troglofauna species per sample. Most orders of troglofauna were collected in greater numbers by scraping than trapping. However. the yields from both troglofauna sampling techniques are low and. even when the results of both techniques are combined to constitute a single unit of sample effort. the currently prescribed effort for environmental impact assessment will document only about half the species present at a site.

Using the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) as a model. we used quantitative PCR to characterise variation in the expression response of heat-shock genes (hsp60. hsp70 and hsp90; molecular chaperones involved in cellular stress response) to an acute non-lethal heat shock. We show significant variation in gene expression at the clutch and population levels for some. but not all hsp genes.

Genetic studies of population structure and dispersal rarely disentangle these differences and usually provide only lifetime‐averaged information that can be considered by managers. We address this limitation by combining age‐specific autocorrelation analysis of microsatellite genotypes. hydrodynamic modelling and genetic simulations to reveal changes in the extent of dispersal during the lifetime of a marine fish. We focus on an exploited coral reef species. Lethrinus nebulosus. which has a circum‐tropical distribution and is a key component of a multispecies fishery in northwestern Australia.

More recently there has been a paradigm shift in the understanding of coral dispersal. driven largely by genetic evidence. which has put greater emphasis on self-recruitment and larval retention. There is now a growing body of evidence that morphologically cryptic species exist within many recognized ‘species’ of stony corals. Here. we characterise levels of genetic divergence within and between five species of Acropora sampled from disparate populations spanning the Indo-Pacific Oceans.

The physical factors and the changes to ocean chemistry that they drive can all be measured with great precision. Changes in the biological composition of communities in different ocean regions are far more challenging to measure because most biological monitoring methods focus on a limited taxonomic or size range. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has the potential to solve this problem in biological oceanography. as it is capable of identifying a huge phylogenetic range of organisms to species level. Here we develop and apply a novel multi-gene molecular toolkit to eDNA isolated from bulk plankton samples collected over a five-year period from a single site. This temporal scale and level of detail is unprecedented in eDNA studies. We identified consistent seasonal assemblages of zooplankton species. which demonstrates the ability of our toolkit to audit community composition. We were also able to detect clear departures from the regular seasonal patterns that occurred during an extreme marine heatwave. The integration of eDNA analyses with existing biotic and abiotic surveys delivers a powerful new long-term approach to monitoring the health of our world’s oceans in the context of a rapidly changing climate.,True,sSiCEjYAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,30,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007943,15198416219128017792,/scholar?cites=15198416219128017792,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007943,0,0,0

A recent publication by Garnett and Christidis [1] expressed concerns regarding the difficulty that taxonomic changes represent for conservation efforts and proposed the establishment of a system to govern taxonomic changes. Their proposal to “restrict the freedom of taxonomic action” through governing subcommittees that would “review taxonomic papers for compliance” and their assertion that “the scientific community’s failure to govern taxonomy threatens the effectiveness of global efforts to halt biodiversity loss. damages the credibility of science. and is expensive to society” are flawed in many respects.

Using data from the Fauna Europaea database and the Zoological Record. we show that contrary to general belief. developed and heavily-studied parts of the world are important reservoirs of unknown species. In Europe. new species of multicellular terrestrial and freshwater animals are being discovered and named at an unprecedented rate: since the 1950s. more than 770 new species are on average described each year from Europe. which add to the 125.000 terrestrial and freshwater multicellular species already known in this region. There is no sign of having reached a plateau that would allow for the assessment of the magnitude of European biodiversity. More remarkably. over 60% of these new species are described by non-professional taxonomists. Amateurs are recognized as an essential part of the workforce in ecology and astronomy. but the magnitude of non-professional taxonomist contributions to alpha-taxonomy has not been fully realized until now.

With a biodiversity crisis looming and ongoing impediments to taxonomy. how can systematic research continue to document species and infer the ‘Tree of Life’. and still maintain its significance to conservation science and to protecting the very species it strives to understand? Here we advocate a systematic research program dedicated to documenting short-range endemic taxa. which are species with naturally small distributions and. by their very nature. most likely to be threatened by habitat loss. habitat degradation and climate change. This research can dovetail with the needs of industry and government to obtain high-quality data to inform the assessment of impacts of major development projects that affect landscapes and their biological heritage.

In moving from solely describing patterns following fire to predicting changes. plant ecologists have successfully elucidated generalizations based on functional traits. Using species traits might also allow better predictions for fauna. but there are few empirical tests of this approach. 2. We examined whether species traits changed with post‐fire age for spiders in 27 sites. representing a chronosequence of 0–20 years post‐fire. We predicted a priori whether spiders with ten traits associated with survival. dispersal. reproduction. resource‐utilization and microhabitat occupation would increase or decrease with post‐fire age.

Koch. 1871) as type species. Two other species are included in the genus: B. brounii (Urquhart. 1885) comb. nov.(here removed from synonymy with B. heroine) and B. collina (Keyserling. 1886) comb. nov.(= Araneus reversus Hogg. 1914. new synonymy). A phylogenetic analysis places Backobourkia within the ‘coxal hook clade’of the subfamily Araneinae Clerck. 1758 and close to Eriophora Simon. 1864; however. Backobourkia differs from other Australasian Araneinae by the proposed synapopomorphy of a long flange at the base of the median apophysis in males. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) supports the monophyly of Backobourkia in a limited dataset that includes exemplars of Australasian Araneidae and Eriophora ravilla (CL Koch. 1844)(type species of Eriophora Simon. 1864). Backobourkia brounii and B. heroine are sister taxa in this analysis. Backobourkia collina is unusual within the genus and amongst most Araneinae as it displays extreme sexual size dimorphism (SSD). with females on average more than four times the size of males. Comparison with the other two Backobourkia species (and other Araneinae) suggests male dwarfism rather than female gigantism for this SSD. Some morphological differences of B. collina males to its congeners are evident. possibly due to its reduced size.

Differences in foraging activity were tested in the context of single foraging cycles with and without the opportunity to retrieve food.

These techniques have potential application to the initial surveys of candidate habitats for Marine Protected Areas. and to the subsequent monitoring necessary to manage them. Remote video techniques can be used in shelf depths beyond the limits of diver-based Underwater Visual Census (UVC). and stereo-video systems can also be used to complement and enhance normal UVC by allowing very precise and accurate estimates of fish morphometrics (and hence weight). Some video techniques are very cost-effective and can help remove some major sources of observer bias in underwater observations. by removing the need for skilled observers in the field and by allowing simultaneous collection of a much wider suite of information in a permanent record that can be analysed later. This medium is directly accessible to an unlimited audience.

1100096,Calibration stability of an underwater stereo-video system: Implications for measurement accuracy and precision,1998,Euan S Harvey and Mark R Shortis,32,Marine Technology Society Journal,2,3-17,Washington. DC: Marine Technology Society,Assessment of population structure is often used to detect and analyse the impact on marine fauna of environmental factors or commercial fishing. A primary tool in the characterisation of population structure is the distribution of the lengths of a large sample of individual specimens of a particular species. Rather than use relatively unreliable visual estimates by SCUBA divers. an under-water stereo video system has been developed to improve the accuracy of the measurement of lengths of highly indicative species such as reef fish. In common with any system used for accurate measurements. calibration of the camera system is of paramount importance to realise the maximum possible accuracy from the system. Further. the determination of the relative orientation of the two cameras is vital to the correct estimation of fish lengths. Also at issue is the stability of the calibrations and relative orientation of the cameras during deployments to capture video sequences of marine life. as any variations will inevitably lead to systematic errors and therefore inaccuracies in the measured lengths. This paper describes a series of experiments concerning the determination and testing of camera calibration. relative orientation and stability of the underwater stereo video system. The strategy for the integrated determination of calibration and orientation is described. Variations in calibration and orientation parameters are quantified in terms of magnitude and significance.

A primary tool in the characterisation of population structure is the distribution of the lengths or biomass of a large sample of individual specimens of a particular species. Rather than use relatively unreliable visual estimates by divers. an underwater stereo-video system has been developed to improve the accuracy of the measurement of lengths of highly indicative species such as reef fish. In common with any system used for accurate measurements. the design and calibration of the underwater stereo-video system are of paramount importance to realise the maximum possible accuracy from the system. Aspects of the design of the system. the calibration procedure and algorithm. the determination of the relative orientation of the two cameras. stereo-measurement and stereo-matching. and the tracking of individual specimens are discussed.

However. deeper waters are increasingly recognised as a potential source of refuge that may help sustain fishery resources. We used a combination of historical catch data over a 20-year time period and fishery-independent surveys to investigate the effects of SCUBA spearfishing on coral reef fish populations in the southern Mariana Islands. Two jurisdictions were studied; Guam. where SCUBA spearfishing is practiced. and the nearby Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). where SCUBA spearfishing has been banned since 2003. Fishery-independent data were collected using baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) stratified by depth. marine protected area status and jurisdiction. Herbivores (primary consumers) dominated spearfishing catches. with parrotfish (scarines) and surgeonfish/unicornfish (acanthurids) the main groups harvested. However. the large. endangered humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) was the main species by weight landed by SCUBA spearfishers. SCUBA spearfishing was associated with declining size of scarines over time and catches shifting from a dominance of large parrotfishes to a mixed assemblage with increasing proportions of acanthurids. Comparisons between Guam and the nearby CNMI revealed differences in the assemblage of fished species and also greater size of scarines and acanthurids in deep water where SCUBA fishing is banned.

We use a phylogeny based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16S gene of representatives of the limnetic and pantropical Pachychilidae to infer the relationships within this particular group of cerithioideans and the evolution of reproductive strategies. The phylogeny presented herein implies a new systematization and suggests that viviparity has appeared three times among the Pachychilidae. This is supported by the finding of very distinct reproductive morphologies in different lineages of viviparous taxa that are exclusively found in Southeast Asia.

The geography of the eastern Mediterranean region has changed dramatically since the Middle Miocene as a result of motions of adjoining lithospheric plates and regional-scale vertical crustal motions (uplift and subsidence). For several hundred thousand years between 6 and 5 million years ago (Mya). the Mediterranean basin was isolated from the Atlantic Ocean. and became desiccated (the Messinian Salinity Crisis; MSC). Geological data suggest that the endemic water frog lineage on Cyprus was isolated by the flooding of the Mediterranean basin by salt water at the end of the MSC. circa 5.5–5.3 Mya.

1100119,From DNA taxonomy to barcoding–how a vague idea evolved into a biosystematic tool,2007,Frank Köhler,83,Zoosystematics and evolution,S1,44-51,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,The paper briefly reviews the development of the concept of DNA barcoding. a technique that proposes to identify species by analysis of short DNA sequences. The differences between this method and the concept of a DNA taxonomy based on sequence data as a universal reference system in biology are illucidated. The promises. limitations and restrictions of the different approaches are discussed. Barcoding is a useful systematic tool especially in connection with classical methods. It represents a valuable complement to conventional practice when applied to problems beyond the reach of morphological studies. such as the determination of larval stages. DNA barcoding studies detached from the fundament of integrative systematic research. however. are problematical. (© 2007 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

We show that a number of previous systematic assumptions about Brotia are in need of correction. Based on our analyses. we suggest a revised and more specific characterisation of this genus and outline the taxonomic and systematic implications of our findings. Accordingly. Brotia is restricted herein to viviparous pachychilids possessing as morphological characteristics a subhaemocoelic brood pouch. a pallial oviduct with only a simple. deep. and papillated spermatophore bursa. as well as embryonic shells with a wrinkled apical whorl. This typical embryonic shell structure results from a peculiar mode of ontogeny that includes a yolk sac protruding from the apical whorl during most stages of embryonic development. which are retained in the maternal brood pouch. A molecular phylogeny based on two mitochondrial gene fragments (646 bp of COI and 826 bp of 16S) shows that Brotia as encompassed here forms a monophyletic group. The application of the revised concept results in a significantly reduced number of species assigned to Brotia with implications also for a considerable reduction of the distributional area covered by members of the genus.

The model. which treats conditional strategies as polygenic threshold traits. indicates that. given requisite genetic variation in reaction norms. conditional strategies will evolve to their optimum level and be maintained by stabilizing selection. provided environmental variation results in a fitness trade-off for the alternative conditional phenotypes. The precise value for the evolutionary optimum is found to depend primarily on the probability density function of the environmental variation that influences the production of the conditional phenotypes and the magnitude of the fitness trade-offs of the conditional phenotypes across such environmental variation.

Similar to strategic models. the results show that environmental heterogeneity. cue reliability. and environment‐dependent fitness trade‐offs for the alternative tactics of the conditional strategy interact to determine when conditional strategies will be favored and that conditional strategies should be a common form of adaptive variation in nature. The results also show that conditional and unconditional development can be maintained in one of two ways: by frequency‐dependent selection or by the maintenance of genetic variation that exceeds the threshold for induction.

This “questing” behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent. such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing. with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing. but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy. which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.,True,65IfapcAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,30,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110028,13949611699834309794,/scholar?cites=13949611699834309794,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110028,0,0,0

Environmentally‐cued pupal colour in swallowtail butterflies has been hypothesized to evolve as a consequence of (a) the evolution of a preference for pupation sites above the ground that vary in colour and (b) natural selection for crypsis on such sites.2. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the field survival of green and brown Papilio polyxenes Fabr. pupae placed on green or brown pupation sites that were either above the ground on near the ground.3. Green pupae on green sites above the ground had a significantly higher probability of survival than did all other pupal colour and pupation site combinations.4.

However. unlike most butterﬂies. pupal color in many species of swallowtails varies. with pupae being either green or various shades of brown or grey.

The genetic and environmental components of variation in the darkness of brown pupae of the swallowtail butterfly Papilio polyxenes were investigated. Variation in darkness was found to be both genetic and environmental. with the darkness of the pupation site having a significant influence on the darkness of pupae. thus allowing for the production of cryptic brown pupae in nature.

This study used baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) to compare species richness. fish abundance and size along 42.3 km of subsea pipeline and in adjacent areas of varying habitats. The pipeline is laid in an onshore-offshore direction enabling surveys to encompass a range of depths from 9 m nearshore out to 140 m depth offshore. Surveys off the pipeline were performed across this depth range and in an array of natural habitats (sand. macroalgae. coral reef) between 1 km and 40 km distance from the pipeline. A total of 14.953 fish were observed comprising 240 species (131 on the pipeline and 225 off-pipeline) and 59 families (39 on the pipeline and 56 off-pipeline) and the length of 8.610 fish were measured. The fish assemblage on and off the pipeline was similar in depths of <80 m. In depths beyond 80 m. the predominant habitat off-pipeline was sand and differences between fish assemblages on and off-pipeline were more pronounced. The pipeline was characterised by higher biomass and abundances of larger-bodied. commercially important species such as: Pristipomoides multidens (goldband snapper).

Brazil has 3.3% of its exclusive economic zone protected by 73 different NTRs. however. most of them currently lack scientific knowledge and understanding of their ecological role. particularly regarding rocky reefs in subtropical regions. In this context. this study aimed to contrast a network of NTRs with comparable fished sites across a coastal biogeographic gradient to investigate the effect of fishing and habitat variability on the abundance and body size of rocky reef fish. We used Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video (stereo-BRUVs) and Diver Operated stereo-Video (stereo-DOVs) systems to simultaneously sample reef fish and habitat. Model selection and results identified habitat and biogeographic variables. such as distance from shore. as important predictor variables. explaining several aspects of the fish assemblage. The effect of protection was important in determining the abundance and body size of targeted species. in particular for epinephelids and carangids.

Despite this. little is known about the reproduction behaviour or where individuals copulate. In October 2015. two zebra sharks-one male and one female-were observed on a baited remote underwater stereo-video system (stereo-BRUVs) with the male shark biting the end of the female’s caudal fin as they swam together in 53 m water depth off the coast of the Dampier Archipelago. Western Australia. This is the first recorded observation of free-living zebra sharks displaying pre-copulatory behaviour at this depth and is documented to be the early stages of courting. whereby the male is trying to slow and tire the female to then obtain a better position for clasper insertion. Observations of pre-copulatory behaviour in sharks are extremely rare and even more so in the depths sampled here. Documenting similar behaviours and building on singular observations to work towards a better understanding of the zebra sharks reproductive behaviour is needed to identify critical habitats and allow for better informed management decisions.,True,pHO-koQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/chasing-tail-putative-pre-copulatory-behaviour-in-free-living-zeb,,,,https://sciencematters.io/articles/201903000016,0,0,0

The discovery of this striking pattern of gene expression inspired myriad evolutionary theories. the most successful of which identify scenarios that create an asymmetry between the maternally and paternally inherited gene copies that favors silencing of one of the copies. Most notably. imprinting can evolve when gene dosage affects kin interactions (typically involving conflict) or when silencing enhances coadaptation by coordinating traits expressed by interacting kin.

We transplanted 19 656 flies of two Australian tropical rainforest fly species (Drosophila birchii and D. bunnanda) along an elevation gradient in 972 vials at different intraspecific and interspecific densities. to test for effects of abiotic and biotic environmental variation on fitness. We recorded the number of male and female offspring of each species produced after one generation in the field.

The effect of density was much greater at the warm. low elevation site than at sites higher up the gradient. Surprisingly. increasing interspecific. but not intraspecific. density was also associated with the production of offspring with a strongly male-biased sex ratio in both D. birchii and D. bunnanda. By contrast. in vials where only one of the species was present. the mean sex ratio was equal or slightly female-biased. Comparison of productivity of mixed and single-species vials suggests that higher mortality of female larvae in interspecific competition can partially. but not completely. explain the observed sex ratio difference.

We quantified mating latency. mating duration and productivity in males of the tropical fruitfly. Drosophila birchii. from 30 isofemale lines collected from across two elevational gradients. when they were given opportunities to mate with up to four females consecutively. Male remating rates were low compared to other Drosophila (only 14 – 27% of males achieved a fourth mating). with mean mating durations approximately doubling across successive copulations. However. although successive remating produced progressively fewer offspring. it consistently increased overall male reproductive success. with males that mated four times more than doubling offspring number compared to males mating only once. We also found no reduction in the productivity of sons emerging from later matings. indicating a sustained cumulative fitness benefit to remating. Heritable variation was observed for most traits (H2 = 0.035 – 0.292) except mating latency. but there was no divergence in trait means with elevation. The observed restricted remating ability of male D. birchii. despite the clear benefits of remating. may be due to a low encounter rate with females in the field. leading to high investment per gamete (or ejaculate).

1100229,Investigating the evolutionary significance of morphological variation in the Australian sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma,2011,Rachel Binks,,,,,,[Truncated abstract] Marine invertebrates often display remarkable levels of intraspecific morphological variation. This variation can indicate ecological processes. such as adaptation or phenotypic plasticity to local environments. but can also reveal important evolutionary processes driving genetic and reproductive divergence within a species. Examining highly variable species. therefore. can provide valuable insights into the steps that lead to speciation in marine environments. The Australian sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma exhibits variation in colouration and spine morphology. Observations of the latter trait have been used to describe two subspecies that are broadly distributed between east and west coasts of Australia; however the variation characterising these subspecies has never been thoroughly examined. and little is otherwise known of their evolutionary relationship. This thesis aims to quantify the variation between these subspecies and investigate the processes that have contributed to their divergence. Following a brief introduction.

These features are expected to influence patterns of genetic structuring throughout the landscape either by promoting or restricting the movement of pollen and seed. Whilst a growing body of literature exists for the fauna endemic to this region. less is known about the forces shaping the evolution of plant taxa. In this study we investigate the phylogeography of two iconic Pilbara tree species. the Hamersley Bloodwood (Corymbia hamersleyana) and Western Gidgee (Acacia pruinocarpa). by assessing patterns of variation and structure in several chloroplast DNA regions and nuclear microsatellite loci developed for each species. Gene flow was found to be extensive in both taxa and there was evidence of long-distance seed dispersal across the region (pollen to seed ratios of 6.67 and 2.96 for C. hamersleyana and A. pruinocarpa. respectively). which may result from flooding and strong wind gusts associated with extreme cyclonic activity.

1100233,Genetic assessment of Aluta quadrata across the Western Range,2019,Rachel Binks and Margaret Byrne and Stephen van Leeuwen,,,,,,Knowledge of genetic diversity and structure is important for the management of rare and restricted species. particularly where they may be impacted by anthropogenic activities or industrial operations. Because genetic diversity underpins the ability of populations to persist and adapt to environmental changes or disturbance. genetic assessments of restricted species can provide an indication of the current health and future stability of populations (Ellstrand & Elam 1993). inform the design of strategies for population augmentation and translocation (Bischoff et al. 2010). and provide a basis for defining management units within a species (Palsbøll et al. 2006). Recent developments in genomic technologies have provided costeffective opportunities for high resolution estimation of genetic diversity and structuring to inform conservation management.This exemplar study. which is a collaboration between Rio Tinto and Biodiversity and Conservation Science at the Department of Biodiversity. Conservation and Attractions. expands on a previous study that investigated genetic diversity and structuring of Aluta quadrata across the three disjunct populations of the species’ restricted distribution on the southern edge of the Hamersley Range (Byrne et al. 2016).

In addition. high pressure freezing (HPF) and cryosubstitution were used to fix the radula tissue of juvenile specimens.

Although restricted to very small (< 200 m) samples. the quality of juvenile radulae processed by HPF was excellent. The improvements in tissue preservation gained by using microwave and cryo-preservation techniques are therefore critical for obtaining accurate ultrastructural information of the radula in marine molluscs.

The modern model of the ecosystem as a hierarchy with emergent properties is exemplified in reefs as massive structures formed by small colonial organisms. the self-similarity of these structures across large spatial scales. and the uniformity of function by diverse biological communities. Emergent properties arise through the integration of processes up the levels of organization and larger spatial and temporal scales encompassed by a whole reef.

Oxygen production and consumption were measured by respirometery; sediment removed by corals was collected simultaneously. All corals exposed to sediments showed an increase in respiration rate at night and a decrease in net photosynthesis during the day. Lowered net photosynthesis was due to both light shading and respiratory increase. Integrated 24 hour P/R ratios for control and sediment-exposed corals were calculated.

This pattern is frequently used to assess ontogeny for a variety of fossil archosaurs that may or may not follow the same sequence and timing of suture closure. Phytosaurs are one of the few basal archosaur groups with a sample size large enough to help test whether the crocodylian pattern of suture closure is plesiomorphic for Pseudosuchia and Archosauria. Analysis of a large sample of North American phytosaur specimens confirms that phytosaurs share the crocodylian state of closure. and so this pattern is probably plesiomorphic for the Pseudosuchia.

Use of LVFs is widespread because of their supposed global application and ability to be correlated with the marine stages of the timescale. New magnetostratigraphic and radioisotopic data indicate that the traditional correlation of Late Triassic LVFs requires revision. although some authors maintain that these original correlations are sound. and that the new correlations of the marine stages to the numerical timescale are in error. Here. we examine the available evidence for cross-correlation of Late Triassic LVFs with the marine stages and numerical timescale.

1100293,Was dinosaurian physiology inherited by birds? Reconciling slow growth in Archaeopteryx,2009,Gregory M Erickson and Oliver WM Rauhut and Zhonghe Zhou and Alan H Turner and Brian D Inouye and Dongyu Hu and Mark A Norell,4,PLoS One,10,e7390,Public Library of Science,Background Archaeopteryx is the oldest and most primitive known bird (Avialae). It is believed that the growth and energetic physiology of basalmost birds such as Archaeopteryx were inherited in their entirety from non-avialan dinosaurs. This hypothesis predicts that the long bones in these birds formed using rapidly growing. well-vascularized woven tissue typical of non-avialan dinosaurs.  Methodology/Principal Findings We report that Archaeopteryx long bones are composed of nearly avascular parallel-fibered bone. This is among the slowest growing osseous tissues and is common in ectothermic reptiles. These findings dispute the hypothesis that non-avialan dinosaur growth and physiology were inherited in totality by the first birds. Examining these findings in a phylogenetic context required intensive sampling of outgroup dinosaurs and basalmost birds. Our results demonstrate the presence of a scale-dependent maniraptoran histological continuum that Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds follow. Growth analysis for Archaeopteryx suggests that these animals showed exponential growth rates like non-avialan dinosaurs. three times slower than living precocial birds. but still within the lowermost range for all endothermic vertebrates.  Conclusions/Significance The unexpected histology of Archaeopteryx and other basalmost birds is actually consistent with retention of the phylogenetically earlier paravian dinosaur condition when size is considered. The first birds were simply feathered dinosaurs with respect to growth and energetic physiology. The evolution of the novel pattern in modern forms occurred later in the group's history.,True,_9h4HhcAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,153,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007390,6536356690764738853,/scholar?cites=6536356690764738853,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007390,0,0,0

As paleontologists—and in an area of systematics restricted solely to morphological data—we take exception to many of the arguments put forward by SEA and feel we may provide a unique perspective in the debate.In their paper. SEA argued for a redefined role for morphology in phylogeny reconstruction. one in which “rigorous and critical anatomical studies of fewer morphological characters. in the context of molecular phylogenies. is a more fruitful approach to integrating the strengths of morphological data with those of sequence data”(p. 539).

Very little. however. is known about the carnivorous dinosaurs that inhabited Haţeg Island. and it is unclear whether they were also dwarfed. aberrant. or primitive.

Neosuchia) from the Cretaceous of Asia,2015,Alan H Turner,10,,2,e0118116,Public Library of Science,The crocodyliform Shamosuchus is known from numerous Late Cretaceous localities in southern and eastern Mongolia and fragmentary remains from Uzbekistan. Seven species of Shamosuchus have been named from six localities in Mongolia and three in Uzbekistan. Six species originally described as Paralligator were later referred to Shamosuchus. Only the type species. Shamosuchus djadochtaensis has been examined in detail. Many of the named species of Shamosuchus show striking similarity in size and cranial morphology but most are based on partial remains suggesting that the true species diversity is overestimated. A review of all species referred to Shamosuchus recognizes three valid taxa: Shamosuchus djadochtaensis. S. gradilifrons. and S. major. Shamosuchus sungaricus. S. borealis. and S. karakalpakensis are nomena dubia. whereas S. ancestralis. S. ulgicus. S. tersus. and S. ulanicus are junior subjective synonyms of S. gradilifrons. Phylogenetic analysis of 318 phenotypic characters recovers a Paralligatoridae clade consisting of Shamosuchus. Rugosuchus. Batrachomimus. Glen Rose Form. and Wannchampsus. Shamosuchus is non-monophyletic: S. djadochtaensis is near the base of Paralligatoridae whereas S. gradilifrons + S. major are the most deeply nested. The name Paralligator is resurrected for this clade. Rugosuchus and Batrachomimus are sister taxa to Paralligator. Paralligatoridae is closely related to Theriosuchus. hylaeochampsids and a speciose Allodaposuchus clade. which together are the sister group of Borealosuchus plus Crocodylia.

Use of LVFs is widespread because of their supposed global application and ability to be correlated with the marine stages of the timescale.

Recognizing that reliable biochronology depends on well-documented and testable biostratigraphic models. we propose a simple set of three units to serve as a biochronology “starter kit”: one local biostratigraphic unit (a multiple taxon interval teilzone or biozone). one regional or global chronostratigraphic unit (an estimated holochronozone). and one biochronologic unit (an estimated holochron). These units are applied to the Otischalkian. Adamanian. Revueltian. and Apachean “faunachrons.” with all units being defined by multiple phytosaur taxa representing the appearance of monophyla.

1100331,Revised phylogenetic analysis of the Aetosauria (Archosauria: Pseudosuchia); assessing the effects of incongruent morphological character sets,2016,William G Parker,4,PeerJ,,e1583,PeerJ Inc.,Aetosauria is an early-diverging clade of pseudosuchians (crocodile-line archosaurs) that had a global distribution and high species diversity as a key component of various Late Triassic terrestrial faunas. It is one of only two Late Triassic clades of large herbivorous archosaurs. and thus served a critical ecological role. Nonetheless. aetosaur phylogenetic relationships are still poorly understood. owing to an overreliance on osteoderm characters. which are often poorly constructed and suspected to be highly homoplastic. A new phylogenetic analysis of the Aetosauria. comprising 27 taxa and 83 characters. includes more than 40 new characters that focus on better sampling the cranial and endoskeletal regions. and represents the most comprenhensive phylogeny of the clade to date. Parsimony analysis recovered three most parsimonious trees; the strict consensus of these trees finds an Aetosauria that is divided into two main clades: Desmatosuchia. which includes the Desmatosuchinae and the Stagonolepidinae. and Aetosaurinae. which includes the Typothoracinae. As defined Desmatosuchinae now contains Neoaetosauroides engaeus and several taxa that were previously referred to the genus Stagonolepis. and a new clade. Desmatosuchini. is erected for taxa more closely related to Desmatosuchus. Overall support for some clades is still weak. and Partitioned Bremer Support (PBS) is applied for the first time to a strictly morphological dataset demonstrating that this weak support is in part because of conflict in the phylogenetic signals of cranial versus postcranial characters.

Synapsids (including therapsids) form the bulk of tetrapod diversity (in terms of both number of species and abundance) from Early Permian to Middle Triassic times and thus can provide critical information on the nature of the Permo-Triassic extinction in the terrestrial realm.

In contrast to the origin of many other higher taxa. the origin of mammals from within cynodont-grade therapsids is not considered to coincide with a major morphological change. but rather to be simply the culmination of a series of more and more mammallike transitional forms. To test these assertions. an asymmetrical cladogram extending from primitive ""pelycosaurs"" to morganucodontid mammaliaforms was created.

1100347,Simplification as a trend in synapsid cranial evolution,2001,Christian A Sidor,55,Evolution,7,1419-1442,Blackwell Publishing Ltd, The prevalence and meaning of morphological trends in the fossil record have undergone renewed scrutiny in recent years. Studies have typically focused on trends in body size evolution. which have yielded conflicting results. and have only rarely addressed the question as to whether other morphological characteristics show persistent directionality over long time scales. I investigated reduction in number of skull and lower jaw bones (through loss or fusion) over approximately 150 million years of premammalian synapsid history. The results of a new skull simplification metric (SSM). which is defined as a function of the number of distinct elements. show that pronounced simplification is evident on both temporal (i.e.. stratigraphic) and phylogenetic scales. Postcranial evolution exhibits a similar pattern.

1100383,Conceptualizing vertebrate faunal dynamics: new perspectives from the Triassic and Eocene of Western North America,2013,Michelle Renae Stocker,,,,,,Conceptualizations of actual biological patterns as preserved in the fossil record must accommodate the results of biotic and abiotic drivers of faunal dynamics. However. those conceptualizations also may reflect cognitive biases resulting from foundational philosophical stances. Whether fossils are conceptualized as the remains of biological entities or as geological objects will affect both taxonomic identifications and secondary inferences derived from those identifications. In addition. operational research bias centered on relativistic views of ‘importance’ of particular components (i.e.. taxonomic or skeletal region) of the assemblage results in preferential documentation of some taxa and marginalization of others. I explored the consequences of those specific cognitive and operational biases through examination of Triassic and Eocene faunal assemblages in western North America. For the Triassic I focused on taxonomic and systematic treatments of Paleorhinus. a group of phytosaurs important for the establishment of biochronologic correlations. Specimen-level reexamination of Paleorhinus supported a restricted usage of Paleorhinus as a clade. dissolved a biochronologic connection between terrestrial and marine deposits. and indicated a prior compression of the early part of the Late Triassic as a result of previous conceptualizations of species. I reexamined the Otis Chalk tetrapod assemblage in light of new specimens and modern phylogenetic frameworks.

Though geographically widespread. fossils of this clade are relatively rare in Late Triassic assemblages. The middle Norian (∼ 212 Ma) Hayden Quarry of northern New Mexico. USA. in the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation. has yielded isolated postcranial elements and associated skull elements of a new species of rauisuchid. Vivaron haydeni gen. et. sp. nov. is diagnosed by the presence of two posteriorly directed prongs at the posterior end of the maxilla for articulation with the jugal. The holotype maxilla and referred elements are similar to those of the rauisuchid Postosuchus kirkpatricki from the southwestern United States. but V. haydeni shares several maxillary apomorphies (eg. a distinct dropoff to the antorbital fossa that is not a ridge. a straight ventral margin. and a well defined dental groove) with the rauisuchid Teratosaurus suevicus from the Norian of Germany. Despite their geographic separation. this morphological evidence implies a close phylogenetic relationship between V. haydeni and T. suevicus. The morphology preserved in the new Hayden Quarry rauisuchid V. haydeni supports previously proposed and new synapomorphies for nodes within Rauisuchidae.

As paleontologists—and in an area of systematics restricted solely to morphological data—we take exception to many of the arguments put forward by SEA and feel we may provide a unique perspective in the debate.In their paper. SEA argued for a redefined role for morphology in phylogeny reconstruction. one in which “rigorous and critical anatomical studies of fewer morphological characters. in the context of molecular phylogenies. is a more fruitful approach to integrating the strengths of morphological data with those of sequence data”(p. 539).

The material includes a distal left femur and an articulated right pes. including the astragalus. distal tarsals. and metatarsals I–IV. The material is referable to Sauropodomorpha and represents a non− eusauropod. sauropodomorph more derived than the most basal members of Sauropodomorpha (eg. Saturnalia. Theco− dontosaurus. Efraasia. and Plateosaurus) based on a combination of plesiomorphic and derived character states. Several autapomorphies present in both the femur and metatarsus suggest that this material represents a distinct sauropodomorph taxon. herein named Glacialisaurus hammeri gen. et sp. nov. Some of the derived characters present in the Antarctic taxon suggest affinities with Coloradisaurus and Lufengosaurus (eg. proximolateral flange on plantar surface of meta− tarsal II. well− developed facet on metatarsal II for articulation with medial distal tarsal. subtrapezoidal proximal surface of metatarsal III). Preliminary phylogenetic analyses suggest a close relationship between the new Antarctic taxon and Lufengosaurus from the Early Jurassic Lufeng Formation of China. However. the lack of robust support for the taxon’s phylogenetic position. and current debate in basal sauropodomorph phylogenetics limits phylogenetic and biogeographic inferences drawn from this analysis.

1100403,Phylogenetic analysis of Pelecaniformes (Aves) based on osteological data: implications for waterbird phylogeny and fossil calibration studies,2010,Nathan D Smith,5,Plos one,10,e13354,Public Library of Science,Background Debate regarding the monophyly and relationships of the avian order Pelecaniformes represents a classic example of discord between morphological and molecular estimates of phylogeny. This lack of consensus hampers interpretation of the group's fossil record. which has major implications for understanding patterns of character evolution (e.g.. the evolution of wing-propelled diving) and temporal diversification (e.g.. the origins of modern families). Relationships of the Pelecaniformes were inferred through parsimony analyses of an osteological dataset encompassing 59 taxa and 464 characters. The relationships of the Plotopteridae. an extinct family of wing-propelled divers. and several other fossil pelecaniforms (Limnofregata. Prophaethon. Lithoptila. ?Borvocarbo stoeffelensis) were also assessed. The antiquity of these taxa and their purported status as stem members of extant families makes them valuable for studies of higher-level avian diversification.  Methodology/Principal Findings Pelecaniform monophyly is not recovered. with Phaethontidae recovered as distantly related to all other pelecaniforms. which are supported as a monophyletic Steganopodes. Some anatomical partitions of the dataset possess different phylogenetic signals. and partitioned analyses reveal that these discrepancies are localized outside of Steganopodes. and primarily due to a few labile taxa.

Argentina have yielded a rich fauna of dinosaurs and other vertebrates. The diversity of saurischian dinosaurs is particularly high. especially in the late Cenomanian-early Turonian Huincul Formation. which has yielded specimens of rebacchisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods. and abelisaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods. Continued sampling is adding to the known vertebrate diversity of this unit.   Methodology/ Principal Findings A new. partially articulated mid-sized theropod was found in rocks from the Huincul Formation. It exhibits a unique combination of traits that distinguish it from other known theropods justifying erection of a new taxon. Gualicho shinyae gen. et sp. nov. Gualicho possesses a didactyl manus with the third digit reduced to a metacarpal splint reminiscent of tyrannosaurids. but both phylogenetic and multivariate analyses indicate that didactyly is convergent in these groups. Derived characters of the scapula. femur. and fibula supports the new theropod as the sister taxon of the nearly coeval African theropod Deltadromeus and as a neovenatorid carcharodontosaurian. A number of these features are independently present in ceratosaurs. and Gualicho exhibits an unusual mosaic of ceratosaurian and tetanuran synapomorphies distributed throughout the skeleton.

Combining data from the fossil record with molecular phylogenetics represents an exciting synthetic approach to this challenge.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Extant and fossil crocodilians have long been divided into taxonomic and/or ecological groups based on broad patterns of skull shape. particularly the relative length and width of the snout. However. these patterns have not been quantitatively analyzed in detail. and their biomechanical and functional implications are similarly understudied. Here. we use geometric morphometrics and finite element analysis to explore the patterns of variation in crocodilian skull morphology and the functional implications of those patterns. Our results indicate that skull shape variation in extant crocodiles is much more complex than previously recognized. Differences in snout length and width are the main components of shape variation. but these differences are correlated with changes in other regions of the skull.

Benton,280,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,,,,Adaptive radiations are central to macroevolutionary theory. Whether triggered by acquisition of new traits or ecological opportunities arising from mass extinctions. it is debated whether adaptive radiations are marked by initial expansion of taxic diversity or of morphological disparity (the range of anatomical form). If a group rediversifies following a mass extinction. it is said to have passed through a macroevolutionary bottleneck. and the loss of taxic or phylogenetic diversity may limit the amount of morphological novelty that it can subsequently generate. Anomodont therapsids. a diverse clade of Permian and Triassic herbivorous tetrapods. passed through a bottleneck during the end-Permian mass extinction.

Many past phylogenetic hypotheses were corroborated. but others conflict with the results of this analysis. Most notably. Diictodon.

These findings are consistent with novel evolutionary scenarios for characters such as the presence of postcanine teeth and anterior palatal ridges. The Relative Completeness Index and Gap Excess Ratio were used to examine the degree of fit between the most parsimonious cladograms of this study and the stratigraphic record of the dicynodonts. Although the results of this analysis suggest that the preferred cladogram is relatively consistent with stratigraphy. the presence of some ghost ranges and ghost lineages imply that the fossil record of dicynodonts is not as complete as is sometimes stated.

Our analysis documents that a shift in trophic structure between Campanian and Maastrichtian communities in North America led Maastrichtian communities to experience more secondary extinction at lower levels of primary production shutdown and possess a lower collapse threshold than Campanian communities.

The most obvious distinguishing feature is the presence of tusks and/or postcanine teeth in T. microtrema and their absence in O. bainii.

One outstanding long-term transition is the replacement of basal therapsids (stem-group mammals) by archosauromorphs. including dinosaurs. as the dominant large-bodied terrestrial fauna during the Triassic (approx. 252–201 million years ago). This landmark event preceded more than 150 million years of archosauromorph dominance.

1100477,Estimating the effects of sampling biases on pterosaur diversity patterns: implications for hypotheses of bird/pterosaur competitive replacement,2009,Richard J Butler and Paul M Barrett and Stephen Nowbath and Paul Upchurch,35,Paleobiology,3,432,Paleontological Soc,Pterosaurs were the first flying vertebrates and formed important components of terrestrial and marginal marine ecosystems during the Mesozoic. They became extinct during the latest Cretaceous (latest Maastrichtian). at. or near. the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. following an apparent decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous. This reduction in species richness has been linked to the ecological radiation of birds in the Early Cretaceous and the proposal that birds competitively excluded pterosaurs from many key niches. However. although competition is often posited as a causal mechanism for many of the clade-clade replacements observed in the fossil record. these hypotheses are rarely tested.

The split between lepidosauromorphs and archosauromorphs (the crocodile-lizard. or bird-lizard. divergence) is considered one of the key calibration points for molecular analyses of tetrapod phylogeny. Saurians have a very rich Mesozoic and Cenozoic fossil record. but their late Paleozoic (Permian) record is problematic. Several Permian specimens have been referred to Sauria. but the phylogenetic affinity of some of these records remains questionable.

Phylogenetic analyses have placed rhabdodontids among basal ornithopods as the sister taxon to the clade consisting of Tenontosaurus. Dryosaurus. Camptosaurus. and Iguanodon. Recent studies considered Zalmoxes. the best known representative of the clade. to be significantly smaller than closely related ornithopods such as Tenontosaurus. Camptosaurus. or Rhabdodon. and concluded that it was probably an island dwarf that inhabited the Maastrichtian Haţeg Island.   Methodology/Principal Findings Rhabdodontid remains from the Santonian of western Hungary provide evidence for a new. small-bodied form. which we assign to Mochlodon vorosi n. sp. The new species is most similar to the early Campanian M. suessi from Austria. and the close affinities of the two species is further supported by the results of a global phylogenetic analysis of ornithischian dinosaurs.

1100501,The evolution of sauropod feeding mechanisms,2000,PAUL Upchurch and PAUL M Barrett,,,,79-122,Cambridge University Press,Sauropods were gigantic. long-necked. herbivorous dinosaurs. which dominated many Jurassic and Cretaceous terrestrial faunas. First appearing in the fossil record during the Early Jurassic. they rapidly achieved a nearly global distribution. with apparent peaks in diversity and abundance in the Kimmeridgian. Hauterivian-Barremian. and Campanian-Maastrichtian (Mclntosh 1990; Weishampel 1990; Hunt et al. 1994; Barrett 1998).Early discoveries of poorly preserved sauropod material were interpreted as the remains of marine crocodiles (Owen 1841. 1842). Better preserved specimens (Cetiosaurus) from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire. however. allowed Phillips (1871: 294) to recognize that these animals were terrestrial dinosaurs which probably ate plants. This discovery was soon overshadowed by spectacular material from the western United States (Cope i877a. b; Marsh i877a. b. 1878. 1879). prompting Marsh (1878) to create the new dinosaurian subgroup Sauropoda. The retracted nostrils in the skull of Diplodocus (Marsh 1884). and the gigantic size of these animals. led many workers to conclude that sauropods must have been aquatic (Cope 1878; Marsh 1883; Hatcher 1901; Hay 1908). This' aquatic'hypothesis had an important effect on interpretations of sauropod feeding habits and mechanisms. If such gigantic animals were restricted to food available in or near bodies of water. they probably ate soft aquatic vegetation or invertebrates (Hay 1908; Holland 1924; Haas 1963). This view was seemingly supported by the'weak and inefficient'masticatory apparatus of most sauropods. especially the'tooth-comb'of Diplodocus. which …,True,b9YCKvsAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,161,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7656792691570877948&hl=en&oi=scholarr,7656792691570877948,/scholar?cites=7656792691570877948,,,0,0,0

1100507,Prosauropod dinosaurs and iguanas: speculations on the diets of extinct reptiles,2000,PAUL M Barrett,,,,42-78,Cambridge University Press,A thorough knowledge of extant taxa is required when attempting paleobiological interpretations of extinct animals (Lauder 1995; Witmer 1995). Skeletal material. though informative. can provide only a limited amount of information on soft-tissue and behavioral characteristics. It is not possible to identify with certainty the actual diet of any extinct animal because we cannot observe the animal feeding. Fossilized gut contents (enterolites) and feces (coprolites) may provide some dietary information. but convincing enterolites are rare and coprolites are almost never associated with the animal that produced them. In some cases. direct comparison of the feeding adaptations of extinct taxa with closely related extant forms ('Extant Phylogenetic Bracket'approach sensu Witmer 1995) is possible. allowing these interpretations to be made with some confidence (eg. between extinct and extant mammals). Some groups. however. have no present-day representatives for relevant comparison. For example. study of extant birds and crocodilians provides only limited insight into the paleobiology of non-avian dinosaurs. In cases where the phylogenetic approach to assessing function in extinct organisms is not feasible. there is a tendency to rely on ahistorical biomechanical modeling (Weishampel 1995). Such modeling is often based on the identification and study of suitable extant analogues. The choice of extant taxa for comparison. however. is often limited. and many studies are forced to utilize animal models that may be distantly related to the extinct taxon under consideration.

A Middle Triassic dinosauriform from Tanzania,2013,Sterling J Nesbitt and Paul M Barrett and Sarah Werning and Christian A Sidor and Alan J Charig,9,Biology Letters,1,20120949,The Royal Society,The rise of dinosaurs was a major event in vertebrate history. but the timing of the origin and early diversification of the group remain poorly constrained. Here. we describe Nyasasaurus parringtoni gen. et sp. nov.. which is identified as either the earliest known member of. or the sister–taxon to. Dinosauria. Nyasasaurus possesses a unique combination of dinosaur character states and an elevated growth rate similar to that of definitive early dinosaurs. It demonstrates that the initial dinosaur radiation occurred over a longer timescale than previously thought (possibly 15 Myr earlier). and that dinosaurs and their immediate relatives are better understood as part of a larger Middle Triassic archosauriform radiation.

A comparison of evolutionary rates and morphological disparity of basal dinosaurs and their chief “competitors.” the crurotarsan archosaurs. shows that dinosaurs exhibited lower disparity and an indistinguishable rate of character evolution. The radiation of Triassic archosaurs as a whole is characterized by declining evolutionary rates and increasing disparity. suggesting a decoupling of character evolution from body plan variety.

The earliest diverse archosaur faunal assemblages are known from the Middle Triassic (c. 244 Ma). implying that the archosaur radiation began in the Early Triassic (252.3–247.2 Ma). Understanding of this radiation is currently limited by the poor early fossil record of the group in terms of skeletal remains.   Methodology/Principal Findings We redescribe the anatomy and stratigraphic position of the type specimen of Ctenosauriscus koeneni (Huene). a sail-backed reptile from the Early Triassic (late Olenekian) Solling Formation of northern Germany that potentially represents the oldest known archosaur. We critically discuss previous biomechanical work on the ‘sail’ of Ctenosauriscus. which is formed by a series of elongated neural spines. In addition. we describe Ctenosauriscus-like postcranial material from the earliest Middle Triassic (early Anisian) Röt Formation of Waldhaus. southwestern Germany. Finally. we review the spatial and temporal distribution of the earliest archosaur fossils and their implications for understanding the dynamics of the archosaur radiation.

This paper reviews published studies and provides new data on archosaur lineage origination. diversity and lineage evolution. morphological disparity. rates of morphological character change. and faunal abundance during the Triassic–Early Jurassic. The fundamental archosaur lineages originated early in the Triassic. in concert with the highest rates of character change. Disparity and diversity peaked later. during the Norian. but the most significant increase in disparity occurred before maximum diversity. Archosaurs were rare components of Early–Middle Triassic faunas. but were more abundant in the Late Triassic and pre-eminent globally by the Early Jurassic. The archosaur radiation was a drawn-out event and major components such as diversity and abundance were discordant from each other. Crurotarsans (crocodile-line archosaurs) were more disparate. diverse. and abundant than avemetatarsalians (bird-line archosaurs. including dinosaurs) during the Late Triassic. but these roles were reversed in the Early Jurassic. There is no strong evidence that dinosaurs outcompeted or gradually eclipsed crurotarsans during the Late Triassic.

The specimen. which consists of a proximal left femur. was recovered from the shallow marine rocks of the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Cedar District Formation (Nanaimo Group) and is interpreted as pertaining to a large theropod on the basis of its hollow medullary cavity and proximally placed fourth trochanter. The Washington theropod represents one of the northernmost occurrences of a Mesozoic dinosaur on the west coast of the United States and one of only a handful from the Pacific coast of Laramidia during the Cretaceous. Its isolated nature and preservation in marine rocks suggest that the element was washed in from a nearby fluvial system. If the femur pertains to a tyrannosauroid. which seems likely given its size and the widespread occurrence of the group across Laramidia during Late Cretaceous times. then it would represent an earlier occurrence of large body size than previously recognized (complete femur length estimated at 1.2 meters).

Comparatively few studies have investigated the effects of mass extinctions on terrestrial ecosystems. where the preservation of fossils is sparser than in the seas. The End-Permian Mass Extinction is the largest mass extinction in Earth history. wiping out approximately 80% of marine species. with a comparable effect on land. For tetrapod vertebrates the most complete record of their evolution from the middle Permian. across the Permo-Triassic mass extinction boundary and into the Triassic comes primarily from a single place: the Karoo Basin of South Africa. Therefore. what is known about the development and collapse of complex tetrapod ecosystems in the Permian. and the subsequent rebuilding of new systems in the wake of the mass extinction. is geographically restricted. This Dissertation addresses relatively understudied records of tetrapod evolution and adds geographic complexity to our understanding of mass extinction and recovery.

The vertebrate assemblage of the Ntawere is one of a handful that can be tied to the Karoo biostratigraphically. and therefore acts as a comparison point in the post-extinction world.

The possession of an impedance-matching tympanic middle ear is characteristic of all terrestrial vertebrates with a sophisticated hearing sense and an adaptively important feature of many modern terrestrial vertebrates. Whereas tympanic ears seem to have evolved multiple times within tetrapods. especially among crown-group members such as frogs. mammals. squamates. turtles. crocodiles. and birds. the presence of true tympanic ears has never been recorded in a Paleozoic amniote. suggesting they evolved fairly recently in amniote history.Methodology/Principal FindingsIn the present study. we performed a morphological examination and a phylogenetic analysis of poorly known parareptiles from the Middle Permian of the Mezen River Basin in Russia. We recovered a well-supported clade that is characterized by a unique cheek morphology indicative of a tympanum stretching across large parts of the temporal region to an extent not seen in other amniotes. fossil or extant. and a braincase specialized in showing modifications clearly related to an increase in auditory function. unlike the braincase of any other Paleozoic tetrapod.

Furthermore. a preliminary study of the rates of diversification in parareptiles is performed on the basis of topological information on species diversity. While acknowledging that the bias of the fossil record also needs to be considered for a more definitive statement on parareptile diversification. our results show that a significant increase in diversification rate could be recorded only among Triassic procolophonoids. making it difficult to interpret evolutionary novelties such as herbivory or impedance-matching hearing as being key innovations that might have driven diversification. doi: 10.1002/mmng. 200800011,True,iMlee_QAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,72,https://fr.copernicus.org/articles/12/71/2009/,10705780297338997917,/scholar?cites=10705780297338997917,,https://fr.copernicus.org/articles/12/71/2009/fr-12-71-2009.pdf,0,0,0

Recent fieldwork in the Upper Permian Usili Formation (Songea Group) has led to the discovery of a tetrapod assemblage in a conglomeratic unit at its base.

Maximum likelihood. and Bayesian likelihood approaches. All methods use the principle of parsimony in some form. Hennigian–based approaches are justified ontologically by the Darwinian concepts of phylogenetic conservatism and cohesion of homologies. embodied in Hennig's Auxiliary Principle. and applied by outgroup comparisons. Parsimony is used as an epistemological tool. applied a posteriori to choose the most robust hypothesis when there are conflicting data. Quantitative methods use parsimony as an ontological criterion: Maximum parsimony analysis uses unweighted parsimony. Maximum likelihood weight all characters equally that explain the data. and Bayesian likelihood relying on weighting each character partition that explains the data. Different results most often stem from insufficient data. in which case each quantitative method treats ambiguities differently. All quantitative methods produce networks. The networks can be converted into trees by rooting them. If the rooting is done in accordance with Hennig's Auxiliary Principle. using outgroup comparisons. the resulting tree can then be interpreted as a phylogenetic hypothesis. As the size of the data set increases. likelihood methods select models that allow an increasingly greater number of a priori possibilities. converging on the Hennigian perspective that nothing is prohibited a priori. Thus. all methods produce similar results. regardless of data type. especially when their networks are rooted using outgroups.

Parareptilia).,2018,Constanze Bickelmann and Linda A Tsuji,21,Fossil Record,1,,, Ontogenetic series of extinct taxa are rare. However. if preserved. fossil embryos and juveniles can provide evidence of developmental plasticity as related to ecological specialization. Here. we describe articulated and isolated juvenile material found in close association with an adult mesosaurid Stereosternum tumidum (MB.R.2089) from Lower Permian sediments in Brazil. housed in the collection of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin. Stylopodial. zeugopodial. and autopodial elements are not yet completely ossified in the juveniles. as indicated by compression artifacts on the surface of the bone. These correspond to internal ossification processes. which have been demonstrated in other aquatic taxa. Quantitative analysis of measurements in juvenile and adult material reveals differing growth rates between limb elements: hind limb zeugopodia. which are massive and elongate in the adult as needed for propulsion. are already comparatively larger in the juvenile than the humeri. femora. and also the zeugopodia of the forelimb. This pattern differs from that seen in another extinct aquatic reptile. Hovasaurus boulei. Nevertheless. we attribute the accelerated growth rate or earlier onset of ossification to be a potential developmental pathway generating limb element variation in the adult present in 280 million year old mesosaurs. which are known for their fully aquatic lifestyle. in which the hind limbs play a more prominent role than the forelimbs.,True,iMlee_QAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,2,https://fr.copernicus.org/articles/21/109/2018/,1936469746585745807,/scholar?cites=1936469746585745807,,https://fr.copernicus.org/articles/21/109/2018/,0,0,0

1100594,Basal saurischia,2004,Max C Langer,2,The Dinosauria,,25-46,University of California Press,The name Saurischia was coined by Seeley in lectures given in 1887. published in 1888. to designate those dinosaurs possessing a propubic pelvis. This plesiomorphic feature distinguishes them from ornithischians. which have an opisthopubic pelvis. Despite its general acceptance as a taxonomic unit since the proposal of the name (Huene 1932; Romer 1956; Colbert 1964a; Steel 1970). the monophyly of Saurischia was heavily questioned in the 1960s and 1970s (Charig et al. 1965; Charig 1976b; Reig 1970; Romer 1972c; Thulborn 1975; Cruickshank 1979). Its status as a natural group was. however. fixed by Bakker and Galton (1974). Bonaparte (1975b) and. more importantly. Gauthier (1986). who formally established the monophyly of the group. The taxa discussed in this chapter (table 2.1) are usually considered to be among the oldest known dinosaurs. They include the most basal saurischians. as well as various forms of uncertain affinity once assigned to the group. The most important of these records come from the South American beds of Ischigualastian age (Bonaparte 1982b). usually dated as Carnian (Rogers et al. 1993; Lucas 1998). These comprise the Ischigualasto Formation in northwestern Argentina. which has yielded Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis (Reig 1963) and Eoraptor lunensis (Sereno et al. 1993). and the Upper Santa Maria Formation. in southern Brazil. which yielded Staurikosaurus pricei (Colbert 1970).

This is enhanced by the discovery of Sacisaurus agudoensis. a new dinosauriform from the Caturrita Formation of Brazil. Various morphological features suggest its close phylogenetic affinity to Silesaurus. and both may be basal ornithischian dinosaurs.

This includes 21 named species. two of which were regarded as nomina dubia. and 19 consensually assigned to Dinosauria. Additional eight supraspecific taxa have been identified based on fragmentary specimens and numerous dinosaur footprints known in Brazil. In fact. most Brazilian specimens related to dinosaurs are composed of isolated teeth and vertebrae. Despite the increase of fieldwork during the last decade. there are still no dinosaur body-fossils of Jurassic age and the evidence of ornithischians in Brazil is very limited. Dinosaur faunas from this country are generally correlated with those from other parts of Gondwana throughout the Mesozoic. During the Late Triassic. there is a close correspondence to Argentina and other south-Pangaea areas. Mid-Cretaceous faunas of northeastern Brazil resemble those of coeval deposits of North Africa and Argentina.

Their importance for crocodyliform evolution and biogeography is widely recognized. and many new taxa have been recently described. In most phylogenetic analyses of Mesoeucrocodylia. the entire clade is represented only by Baurusuchus pachecoi. and no work has attempted to study the internal relationships of the group or diagnose the clade and its members.   Methodology/Principal Findings Based on a nearly complete skull and a referred partial skull and lower jaw. we describe a new baurusuchid from the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation (Bauru Group). Late Cretaceous of Brazil. The taxon is diagnosed by a suite of characters that include: four maxillary teeth. supratemporal fenestra with equally developed medial and anterior rims. four laterally visible quadrate fenestrae. lateral Eustachian foramina larger than medial Eustachian foramen. deep depression on the dorsal surface of pterygoid wing. The new taxon was compared to all other baurusuchids and their internal relationships were examined based on the maximum parsimony analysis of a discrete morphological data matrix.   Conclusion The monophyly of Baurusuchidae is supported by a large number of unique characters implying an equally large morphological gap between the clade and its immediate outgroups.

The Early Cretaceous neosuchian clade Susisuchidae is typically regarded as phylogenetically near Eusuchia. The putative susisuchid Isisfordia duncani was initially described as a transitional form exhibiting incipient versions of these eusuchian traits. Here we examine aspects of the morphology of Isisfordia and comment on the morphology of its putative sister taxon Susisuchus. Our reexamination supports the notion of Isisfordia possessing transitional vertebral morphology but we present a new interpretation of its palate construction that shows it to be more plesiomorphic than previously thought. The secondary choana of Isisfordia is not pterygoid bound. Instead. long palatines expand distally lapping under the pterygoid to form the anterior border of the choana as is common among many advanced neosuchians. Incorporation of these observations into an expanded phylogenetic dataset of neosuchian crocodyliforms results in a new phylogenetic hypothesis for Susisuchidae.

Chronostratigraphically-constrained fossils are the only direct evidence of absolute timing of species divergence. Strict temporal calibration of fossil-only phylogenies provides minimum divergence estimates. and various methods have been proposed to estimate divergences beyond these minimum values. We explore the utility of simultaneous estimation of tree topology and divergence times using BEAST tip-dating on datasets consisting only of fossils by using relaxed morphological clocks and birth-death tree priors that include serial sampling (BDSS) at a constant rate through time. We compare BEAST results to those from the traditional maximum parsimony (MP) and undated Bayesian inference (BI) methods. Three overlapping datasets were used that span 250 million years of archosauromorph evolution leading to crocodylians. The first dataset focuses on early Sauria (31 taxa. 240 chars.). the second on early Archosauria (76 taxa. 400 chars.) and the third on Crocodyliformes (101 taxa. 340 chars.). For each dataset three time-calibrated trees (timetrees) were calculated: a minimum-age timetree with node ages based on earliest occurrences in the fossil record; a ‘smoothed’ timetree using a range of time added to the root that is then averaged over zero-length internodes; and a tip-dated timetree. Comparisons within datasets show that the smoothed and tip-dated timetrees provide similar estimates. Only near the root node do BEAST estimates fall outside the smoothed timetree range.

Pritchard and Michelle Stocker and William G. Parker,22,Paleontologia Electronica,3,,Coquina Press,Archosauromorphs are a diverse and successful group of reptiles that radiated into a series of groups around the time of the end-Permian extinction. One of these groups of archosauromorphs. tanystropheids. consists of diverse forms. and some of the largest members of the group possessed extremely elongated cervical vertebrae (greater than five times longer than tall). resulting in a hyperelongate neck. These derived tanystropheids have been found in Tethyan marine deposits of Pangaea. Four partial cervical vertebrae from a hyperelongate-necked tanystropheid from the Middle Triassic Moenkopi Formation of Arizona and New Mexico are described in this paper. These cervical vertebrae are assigned to Tanystropheidae. specifically the clade that includes the hyperelongate-necked Tanystropheus based on character states. which include an elongate centrum (length to height ratio of 6.2). the presence of epipophyses. and an elongate axial centrum. The Moenkopi tanystropheid elements were found in lower latitude fluvial sequences without any marine influence. corresponding to western Pangaea. whereas Tanystropheus-like tanystropheids are typically associated with marginal marine environments in middle to high latitudes of eastern Pangaea.

1100629,The early evolution of diapsid reptiles and the origin of Sauria,2015,Adam Carl Pritchard,,,,,,All living reptiles belong to the crown clade Sauria. a subgroup of the ancient amniote clade Diapsida. Modern divergence estimates suggest an origin for Sauria in the Permian Period. just prior to the Permo-Triassic Extinction. which wiped out an estimated 95% of species. Although the Permian record of Diapsida is quite small. the subsequent Triassic record is substantial. with a huge array of body sizes and bauplans evident very early in the period. However. phylogenetic hypotheses for these early-diverging taxa are wildly inconsistent. such that our understanding of the origin and early radiation of the crown reptile clade during the Permian and Triassic is very poorly understood. For this dissertation. I present new insights into this important diversification event using novel phylogenetic data matrices. I employ this phylogenetic context to interpret a small reptile fauna from a Triassic fossil site in New Mexico. to resolve a problematic fossil lineage through description of the first three-dimensional material from the group and analysis of those fossils. and to examine the broad-scale patterns of taxonomic and morphological diversification before and after the PTE.  I first employ this analysis to examine well-preserved fossils of early-diverging diapsid groups from the Upper Triassic Hayden Quarry (Chinle Formation) of New Mexico. a site that preserves some of the best fossil materials of small vertebrates in North America.

A data set sampling variables of extant avian melanosomes reveals that those forming most iridescent arrays are distinctly narrow. Quantitative comparison of these data with melanosome imprints densely sampled from a previously unknown specimen of the Early Cretaceous feathered Microraptor predicts that its plumage was predominantly iridescent. The capacity for simple iridescent arrays is thus minimally inferred in paravian dinosaurs.

By contrast. the complex changes in morphology that occurred between the earliest form of avian flapping flight and the emergence of the flight capabilities of extant birds remain comparatively little explored. Any such work has been limited by a comparative paucity of fossils illuminating bird evolution near the origin of the clade of extant (i.e. ‘modern’) birds (Aves). Here we recognize three species from the Early Cretaceous of China as comprising a new lineage of basal ornithurine birds. Ornithurae is a clade that includes. approximately. comparatively close relatives of crown clade Aves (extant birds) and that crown clade.

Within this group of theropod dinosaurs. considerable debate has surrounded the phylogenetic position of the large-bodied allosauroid Acrocanthosaurus atokensis from the Lower Cretaceous Antlers Formation of North America. Several prior analyses recover Acrocanthosaurus atokensis as sister taxon to the smaller-bodied Allosaurus fragilis known from North America and Europe. and others nest Acrocanthosaurus atokensis within Carcharodontosauridae. a large-bodied group of allosauroids that attained a cosmopolitan distribution during the Early Cretaceous.   Methodology/Principal Findings Re-evaluation of a well-preserved skull of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis (NCSM 14345) provides new information regarding the palatal complex and inner surfaces of the skull and mandible. Previously inaccessible internal views and articular surfaces of nearly every element of the skull are described. Twenty-four new morphological characters are identified as variable in Allosauroidea. combined with 153 previously published characters. and evaluated for eighteen terminal taxa. Systematic analysis of this dataset recovers a single most parsimonious topology placing Acrocanthosaurus atokensis as a member of Allosauroidea. in agreement with several recent analyses that nest the taxon well within Carcharodontosauridae.

This approach is based on global parsimony analysis of several temnospondyl amphibians. in which some ontogenetic sequences have been highlighted. Forty-one homologous morphoanatomical character states have been separated into larval. juvenile and adult stages of each of six tetrapod species. The taxonomic congruence (TC) approach involves comparing trees based on larval. juvenile and adult character states. These so-called ‘ontotrees’ are not congruent. either in their topologies or in the distribution of the character states.

Nesbitt,7,PeerJ,,e6331,,Understanding growth patterns is central to properly interpreting paleobiological signals in tetrapods. but assessing skeletal maturity in some extinct clades may be difficult when growth patterns are poorly constrained by a lack of ontogenetic series. To overcome this difficulty in assessing the maturity of extinct archosaurian reptiles—crocodylians. birds and their extinct relatives—many studies employ bone histology to observe indicators of the developmental stage reached by a given individual. However. the relationship between gross morphological and histological indicators of maturity has not been examined in most archosaurian groups. In this study. we examined the gross morphology of a hypothesized growth series of Dromomeron romeri femora (96.6–144.4 mm long). the first series of a non-dinosauriform dinosauromorph available for such a study. We also histologically sampled several individuals in this growth series. Previous studies reported that D. romeri lacks well-developed rugose muscle scars that appear during ontogeny in closely related dinosauromorph taxa. so integrating gross morphology and histological signal is needed to determine reliable maturity indicators for early bird-line archosaurs. We found that. although there are small. linear scars indicating muscle attachment sites across the femur. the only rugose muscle scar that appears during ontogeny is the attachment of the M. caudofemoralis longus. and only in the largest-sampled individual.

Griffin,6,New Jersey State Museum Investigations,,2–10,,Typical archosaurian bone tissues and the broad biological features they indicate (eg. growth rate. basic metabolic strategy) are now well understood. However. definitions. diagnoses. and the paleobiological implications of uncommon osteohistological features. such as medullary bone (indicating female reproductive activity) or pathological tissues. remain contentious. Here. I describe unusual bone tissue from a neotheropod fibula from the Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation of New Mexico. Most of the interior portion of the cortex of this element consists of normal primary woven-fibered bone. However. nearly the entire outer portion of the cortex is composed of a woven-fibered network of spicules. with large vascular canals and abundant osteocyte lacunae. This unusual tissue is separated from the normal tissue by a line of arrested growth. In two places the unusual bone'invades' the inner cortex and extends to the endosteal surface. Tissue stratification indicates that this invading bone was deposited after normal primary bone. The unusual bone was deposited within the medullary cavity internal to the endosteal lamellae in several regions. and several second endosteal lamellae is present in these regions. Surprisingly. the unusual bone grades into normal woven-fibered primary bone~ 1 mm beneath the subperiosteal surface. and the bone remains vascularized to this surface.

1100699,The evolution of intraspecific variation. growth. and body size in early theropod dinosaurs,2016,Christopher T Griffin,,,,,,Understanding the changes undergone during the life of an organism is often crucial to properly interpreting the evolutionary history of a group. For extinct organisms. this process can only be directly studied through growth series of fossils representing individuals at different stages of maturity. The growth patterns of the earliest dinosaurs (230–190 million years ago). in particular the morphological changes undergone during the life history of an individual (i.e.. ontogeny) is poorly understood.  To tackle this problem. I studied the changes undergone during growth of two early theropod dinosaurs. Coelophysis bauri and Megapnosaurus rhodesiensis. To reconstruct the growth of these dinosaurs I used ontogenetic sequence analysis (OSA). I found that. unlike living birds. early dinosaurs possessed an extremely high amount of intraspecific variation in growth. This variation had been previously interpreted as sexual difference; however. I found no evidence of this. Because this variation is widespread among early dinosaurs and their relatives. I hypothesize that this is the ancestral condition of dinosaurian growth. and that this was lost along the evolution to birds. These ontogenetic events are conserved through evolution. and I used this to assess the maturity of large Triassic theropods: I suggest that all known large-bodied Triassic theropods were still growing rapidly at death. and that the maximum body size of Triassic theropods was higher than previously supposed. Theropods were large before the end Triassic mass extinction. unlike what has been previously hypothesized.,True,ipY88EkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/73682,13864808922075918652,/scholar?cites=13864808922075918652,,https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/73682/Griffin_CT_T_2016.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

In vertebrates. chemorepellent signaling is mediated through the tyrosine kinase. src-1. and the tyrosine phosphatase. shp-2. Tetrahymena thermophila has been used as a model system for chemorepellent signaling because its avoidance response is easily characterized under a light microscope. Our experiments showed that netrin-1 peptide is a chemorepellent in T. thermophila at micromolar concentrations. T. thermophila adapts to netrin-1 over a time course of about 10 minutes. Netrin-adapted cells still avoid GTP. PACAP-38. and nociceptin. suggesting that netrin does not use the same signaling machinery as any of these other repellents. Avoidance of netrin-1 peptide was effectively eliminated by the addition of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. genistein. to the assay buffer; however. immunostaining using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed similar fluorescence levels in control and netrin-1 exposed cells. suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for signaling to occur. In addition. ELISA indicates that a netrin-like peptide is present in both whole cell extract and secreted protein obtained from Tetrahymena thermophila. Further study will be required in order to fully elucidate the signaling mechanism of netrin-1 peptide in this organism.,True,ipY88EkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2016/7142868.pdf,16110008226116692404,/scholar?cites=16110008226116692404,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2016/7142868.pdf,0,0,0

Gardiner's (1982) and Løvtrup's (1985) study of amniote phylogeny exemplifies this differential treatment. and we focused on that group of organisms to test the proposition that fossils cannot overturn a theory of relationships based only on the Recent biota. Our parsimony analysis of amniote phylogeny. special knowledge contributed by fossils being scrupulously avoided. led to the following best fitting classification. which is similar to the novel hypothesis Gardiner published: (lepidosaurs (turtles (mammals (birds. crocodiles)))).

Prior to the appearance of various forms specialized for feeding on plants. tetrapods could access the plentiful vegetal resources only indirectly through detritivory and consumption of invertebrates that fed on plants and/or plant detritus (Olson 1961. 1966). The oldest plant-eating tetrapods are known from the Late Pennsylvanian (Late Carboniferous) of North America and Europe. However. herbivores did not form a major component of the known terrestrial tetrapod assemblages from the Early Permian. Only during the Late Permian. some 40 million years after their first appearance. did plant-eating tetrapods become abundant and much diversified in the fossil record. At that time. a'modern'pattern of trophic interactions was established. with a vast standing crop of herbivores sustaining a relatively small number of top carnivores.

1100759,A phylogenetic framework for evolutionary study of the nightshades (Solanaceae): a dated 1000-tip tree,2013,Tiina Särkinen and Lynn Bohs and Richard G Olmstead and Sandra Knapp,13,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-15,BioMed Central,The Solanaceae is a plant family of great economic importance. Despite a wealth of phylogenetic work on individual clades and a deep knowledge of particular cultivated species such as tomato and potato. a robust evolutionary framework with a dated molecular phylogeny for the family is still lacking. Here we investigate molecular divergence times for Solanaceae using a densely-sampled species-level phylogeny. We also review the fossil record of the family to derive robust calibration points. and estimate a chronogram using an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock. Our densely-sampled phylogeny shows strong support for all previously identified clades of Solanaceae and strongly supported relationships between the major clades. particularly within Solanum. The Tomato clade is shown to be sister to section Petota. and the Regmandra clade is the first branching member of the Potato clade. The minimum age estimates for major splits within the family provided here correspond well with results from previous studies. indicating splits between tomato & potato around 8 Million years ago (Ma) with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) 7–10 Ma. Solanum & Capsicum c. 19 Ma (95% HPD 17–21). and Solanum & Nicotiana c. 24 Ma (95% HPD 23–26). Our large time-calibrated phylogeny provides a significant step towards completing a fully sampled species-level phylogeny for Solanaceae. and provides age estimates for the whole family. The chronogram now includes 40% of known species and all but two monotypic genera. and is one of the best sampled angiosperm family phylogenies both in terms of taxon sampling and resolution published …,True,yHApU78AAAAJ:AXkvAH5U_nMC,353,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-13-214,15986443339214367664,/scholar?cites=15986443339214367664,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-13-214,0,0,0

1100761,Tobacco to tomatoes: a phylogenetic perspective on fruit diversity in the Solanaceae,2002,Sandra Knapp,53,,377,2001-2022,Oxford University Press,The Solanaceae contains many species of agricultural importance. Several of these are cultivated for their fruits. such as the tomato. the pepper and the aubergine. The family is very diverse in fruit type with capsules. drupes. pyrenes. berries. and several sorts of dehiscent non‐capsular fruits occurring in the 90+ genera. In this paper. recent work on fruit type evolution in angiosperms is reviewed in relation to dispersal agents and habitat ecology. Defining fruit types in the Solanaceae in a simple five state system. then mapping them onto a previously published molecular phylogeny based on chloroplast DNA allows discussion of the evolution of these fruit types in a phylogenetic framework. Capsules are plesiomorphic in the family. and although berries are a synapomorphy (shared derived character) for a large clade including the genus Solanum (tomatoes and aubergines). they have arisen several times in the …,True,yHApU78AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,316,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-abstract/53/377/2001/497225,3502518252651536183,/scholar?cites=3502518252651536183,,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/53/377/2001/497225,0,0,0

It has evolved more than 60 times via the co-option of genes present in C3 ancestors followed by alteration of the patterns and levels of expression and adaptive changes in the coding sequences [4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12]. but the evolutionary path to C4 photosynthesis is still poorly understood. The grass lineage Alloteropsis offers unparalleled opportunities for studying C4 evolution. because it includes a C3 taxon and five C4 species that vary significantly in C4 anatomy and biochemistry [13. 14]. Using phylogenetic analyses of nuclear genes and leaf transcriptomes. we show that fundamental elements of the C4 pathway in the grass lineage Alloteropsis were acquired via a minimum of four independent lateral gene transfers from C4 taxa that diverged from this group more than 20 million years ago.

Physiological models predict that atmospheric CO2 concentration selected for C4 grasses only after it dropped below a critical threshold during the Oligocene (∼30 Ma). a hypothesis supported by phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses. However the same models predict that CO2 should have reached much lower levels before selecting for C4 eudicots. making C4 eudicots younger than C4 grasses. In this study. different phylogenetic datasets were combined in order to conduct the first comparative analysis of the age of C4 origins in eudicots. Our results suggested that all lineages of C4 eudicots arose during the last 30 million years. with the earliest before 22 Ma in Chenopodiaceae and Aizoaceae. and the latest probably after 2 Ma in Flaveria.

With the largest phylogeny yet compiled for grasses. we present an example of a key physiological innovation that promoted high diversification rates. C4 photosynthesis. a complex suite of traits that improves photosynthetic efficiency under conditions of drought. high temperatures. and low atmospheric CO2. has evolved repeatedly in one lineage of grasses and was consistently associated with elevated diversification rates. In most cases there was a significant lag time between the origin of the pathway and subsequent radiations. suggesting that the ‘C4 effect’ is complex and derives from the interplay of the C4 syndrome with other factors. We also identified comparable radiations occurring during the same time period in C3 Pooid grasses. a diverse. cold-adapted grassland lineage that has never evolved C4 photosynthesis. The mid to late Miocene was an especially important period of both C3 and C4 grass diversification. coincident with the global development of extensive. open biomes in both warm and cool climates.

Consequently. C4 photosynthesis provides a competitive advantage in all conditions where photorespiration costs become important. especially at high temperatures and in arid and saline conditions (Sage. 2001). Despite being used by only 3% of extant angiosperm species (Sage. 2004). C4 plants account for one-fifth of global terrestrial primary production (Ehleringer et al.. 1997).

Smith (Hymenoptera: Formicidae),2006,MH Villet and K Harman and KJ Wilkins,14,African Entomology,2,367-372,Sabinet,Although workers of Plectroctena mandibularis laid trails with their stings while foraging. the trails appeared to be for individual orientation. because they never recruited nestmates to prey. However. both workers and queens laid trails when recruiting nestmates of either caste to new nest sites. During trail-laying. fluted hairs on the posterior edge of tergite VI were dragged along the ground. presumably applying a pheromone to the substrate. Anatomical and behavioural evidence suggests that pygidial gland secretions moved from the intersegmental pygidial gland between tergites VI and VII into a fingerprint-like. lamellar cuticular reservoir on the pygidium. and from there via the hairs to the substrate. These results suggest that recruitment may be crucial to moving nests but of value only to certain types of foraging. and that recruitment might even have originated in the Formicidae in the context of colony relocation …,True,QGs3cRUAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,5,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sabinet/ento/2006/00000014/00000002/art00016,15081334263405244332,/scholar?cites=15081334263405244332,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/145031058.pdf,0,0,0

The early classifications and generic circumscriptions of Lindley (1830-1840). Bentham and Hooker (1883) and Schlechter (1927) relied mainly on morphological characters. especially floral features. The problem with such reliance on floral features at higher levels of classification is that floral morphology is extremely plastic in evolutionary terms. so that unrelated species may have developed similar structures in response to similar selection. particularly pollinator pressures. Such parallelisms are rife in Orchidaceae. so it is necessary to apply more objective criteria and character choices in trying to unravel the complexities of the family's history. Robert L. Dressler's (Phylogeny and Classification of the Orchid Family. Cambridge University Press. 1993) classification introduced characters from pollen. seeds. and anatomy to supplement traditional characters. The recent surge in molecular approaches. especially multigene analyses. combined with several other types of new data. had not only contradicted key elements of Dressler's concepts at higher levels but will result in the recircumscription of many genera.

As a tool for future comparative studies. we compiled a supertree of angiosperm families from published phylogenetic studies. Sequence data from the plastid rbcL gene were used to estimate relative timing of branching events. calibrated by using robust fossil dates. The frequency of shifts in diversification rate is largely constant among time windows but with an apparent increase in diversification rates within the more recent time frames. Analyses of species numbers among families revealed that diversification rate is a labile attribute of lineages at all levels of the tree. An examination of the top 10 major shifts in diversification rates indicates they cannot easily be attributed to the action of a few key innovations but instead are consistent with a more complex process of diversification …,True,hVLMjrkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,624,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/7/1904.short,3203716557609818860,/scholar?cites=3203716557609818860,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/7/1904.full.pdf,0,0,0

Their success stems from a physiological CO2-concentrating pump. which leads to high photosynthetic efficiency in warm climates and low atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Remarkably. their dominance of tropical environments was achieved in only the past 10 million years (Myr). less than 3% of the time that terrestrial plants have existed on Earth. We critically review the proposal that declining atmospheric CO2 triggered this tropical revolution via its effects on the photosynthetic efficiency of leaves.

We examined acclimation in a vertical profile of leaves through a canopy of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The crop was grown at an elevated CO2 partial pressure of 55 Pa within a replicated field experiment using free-air CO2 enrichment. Gas exchange was used to estimate in vivo carboxylation capacity and the maximum rate of ribulose-1.5-bisphosphate-limited photosynthesis. Net photosynthetic CO2 uptake was measured for leaves in situ within the canopy. Leaf contents of ribulose-1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). light-harvesting-complex (LHC) proteins. and total N were determined. Elevated CO2 did not affect carboxylation capacity in the most recently expanded leaves but led to a decrease in lower. shaded leaves during grain development.

It has evolved more than 60 times via the co-option of genes present in C3 ancestors followed by alteration of the patterns and levels of expression and adaptive changes in the coding sequences [4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12]. but the evolutionary path to C4 photosynthesis is still poorly understood. The grass lineage Alloteropsis offers unparalleled opportunities for studying C4 evolution. because it includes a C3 taxon and five C4 species that vary significantly in C4 anatomy and biochemistry [13. 14]. Using phylogenetic analyses of nuclear genes and leaf transcriptomes. we show that fundamental elements of the C4 pathway in the grass lineage Alloteropsis were acquired via a minimum of four independent lateral gene transfers from C4 taxa that diverged from this group more than 20 million years ago.

We tested the generality of these paradoxical findings in grass species representing the known evolutionary diversity of C4 NADP‐me and C3 photosynthetic types.

C4 grasses in control treatments were characterized by higher CO2 assimilation rates and water potential. but lower stomatal conductance and nitrogen content.

We experimentally tested three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses concerning phenomena that can determine the species specificity of this association throughout the foundation stage of the colonies: (1) interspecific competition results in the overwhelming presence of A. decemarticulatus queens or incipient colonies; (2) exclusion filters prevent other ant species from entering the leaf pouches; and (3) host-recognition influences the choice of founding queens. especially A. decemarticulatus. Neither interspecific competition. nor the purported exclusion filters that we examined play a major role in maintaining the specificity of this association.

From an empirical point of view. mutualisms are ubiquitous and of major importance to ecosystems. suggesting the existence of mechanisms that enhance the maintenance of such relationships. We focused on the obligatory myrmecophytic association between the Neotropical plant Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae) and the ant Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). The plant shelters the ants in leaf pouches in exchange for protection from phytophagous insects. We experimentally demonstrated that the ants partially castrate their host plant by destroying almost two-thirds of its floral buds.

Here we verify if myrmecotrophy (where plants obtain nutrients from the refuse of their associated ants) can explain the stability of the tripartite association between the myrmecophyte Hirtella physophora. the ant Allomerus decemarticulatus and an Ascomycota fungus. The plant shelters and provides the ants with extrafloral nectar. The ants protect the plant from herbivores and integrate the fungus into the construction of a trap that they use to capture prey; they also provide the fungus and their host plant with nutrients. During a 9-month field study. we over-provisioned experimental ant colonies with insects. enhancing colony fitness (i.e.. more winged females were produced). The rate of partial castration of the host plant. previously demonstrated. was not influenced by the experiment. Experimental plants showed higher δ15N values (confirming myrmecotrophy). plus enhanced vegetative growth (e.g.. more leaves produced increased the possibility of lodging ants in leaf pouches) and fitness (i.e.. more fruits produced and more flowers that matured into fruit).

Whether mutualism accelerates diversification in both interacting lineages is an open question. Research suggests that plants that attract ant mutualists have higher diversification rates than non-ant associated lineages. We ask whether the reciprocal is true: does the interaction between ants and plants also accelerate diversification in ants. i.e. do ants and plants cooperate-and-radiate? We used a novel text-mining approach to determine which ant species associate with plants in defensive or seed dispersal mutualisms. We investigated patterns of lineage diversification across a recent ant phylogeny using BiSSE. BAMM. and HiSSE models. Ants that associate mutualistically with plants had elevated diversification rates compared to non-mutualistic ants in the BiSSE model. with a similar trend in BAMM. suggesting ants and plants cooperate-and-radiate. However. the best-fitting model was a HiSSE model with a hidden state. meaning that diversification models that do not account for unmeasured traits are inappropriate to assess the relationship between mutualism and ant diversification. Against a backdrop of diversification rate heterogeneity. the best-fitting HiSSE model found that mutualism actually decreases diversification: mutualism evolved much more frequently in rapidly diversifying ant lineages. but then subsequently slowed diversification. Thus. it appears that ant lineages first radiated. then cooperated with plants.,True,2aMqSQwAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,9,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007323,12214179593607875130,/scholar?cites=12214179593607875130,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007323,0,0,0

This instability can be counter-balanced by the host’s retaliation against exploiters. Such responses are crucial to the maintenance of the relationship. We focus on this issue in an obligate ant–plant mutualism in which the ants are known to partially castrate their host plant. We studied plant responses to various levels of castration in terms of (1) global vegetative investment and (2) investment in myrmecophytic traits. Castration led to a higher plant growth rate. signalling a novel case of gigantism induced by parasitic castration. On the other hand. completely castrated plants produced smaller nesting and food resources (i.e. leaf pouches and extra floral nectaries).

The use of the galleries represents an innovative prey capture strategy compared with the more typical strategy of foraging on leaves. However. because of a limited worker force in their colonies. the prey capture behaviour of the ants results in a trade-off between plant protection (i.e. the ants patrol the foliage and attack intruders including herbivores) and ambushing prey in the galleries. which has a cascading effect on the fitness of all of the partners.

DNA metabarcoding refers to the automated identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample containing entire organisms or from a single environmental sample containing degraded DNA (soil. water. faeces. etc.).

The availability of next‐generation sequencing platforms and the ecologists’ need for high‐throughput taxon identification have facilitated the emergence of DNA metabarcoding.

Several DNA regions have been proposed as barcodes and the region selected strongly influences the output of a study. However. formal comparisons between barcodes remained limited until now. Here we present a standard method for evaluating barcode quality. based on the use of a new bioinformatic tool that performs in silico PCR over large databases. We illustrate this approach by comparing the taxonomic coverage and the resolution of several DNA regions already proposed for the barcoding of vertebrates. To assess the relationship between in silico and in vitro PCR. we also developed specific primers amplifying different species of Felidae. and we tested them using both kinds of PCR Tests on specific primers confirmed the correspondence between in silico and in vitro PCR. Nevertheless. results of in silico and in vitro PCRs can be somehow different. also because tuning PCR conditions can increase the performance of primers with limited taxonomic coverage. The in silico evaluation of DNA barcodes showed a strong variation of taxonomic coverage (i.e.. universality): barcodes based on highly degenerated primers and those corresponding to the conserved region of the Cyt-b showed the highest coverage.

Diet analysis is. however. a challenge in many small herbivores with a secretive life style. In this paper. we compare novel (high-throughput pyrosequencing) DNA barcoding technology for plant mixture with traditional microhistological method. We analysed stomach contents of two ecologically important subarctic vole species. Microtus oeconomus and Myodes rufocanus. with the two methods. DNA barcoding was conducted using the P6-loop of the chloroplast trn L (UAA) intron. Although the identified plant taxa in the diets matched relatively well between the two methods. DNA barcoding gave by far taxonomically more detailed results.

However. the status of grass invasions in South Africa has not been documented recently. OBJECTIVES: To update Sue Milton's 2004 review of grasses as invasive alien plants in South Africa. provide the first detailed species level inventory of alien grasses in South Africa and assess the invasion dynamics and management of the group. METHOD: We compiled the most comprehensive inventory of alien grasses in South Africa to date using recorded occurrences of alien grasses in the country from various literature and database sources. Using historical literature. we reviewed past efforts to introduce alien grasses into South Africa. We sourced information on the origins. uses. distributions and minimum residence times to investigate pathways and patterns of spatial extent. We identified alien grasses in South Africa that are having environmental and economic impacts and determined whether management options have been identified. and legislation created. for these species. RESULTS: There are at least 256 alien grass species in the country. 37 of which have become invasive. Alien grass species richness increased most dramatically from the late 1800s to about 1940. Alien grass species that are not naturalised or invasive have much shorter residence times than those that have naturalised or become invasive. Most grasses were probably introduced for forage purposes. and a large number of alien grass species were trialled at pasture research stations. A large number of alien grass species in South Africa are of Eurasian origin …,True,GwJXHYEAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,28,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0006-82412017000200016,8728592995617581314,/scholar?cites=8728592995617581314,,http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0006-82412017000200016,0,0,0

We tested whether dimensions of the native range (measured by the area-of-occupancy and its scaling patterns) of 720 Australian eucalypts (genera Angophora. Eucalyptus and Corymbia) could explain introduction and invasion success. We also compared our results with a previous study on 979 Australian acacias (previously grouped in Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) to investigate whether features of their native ranges explained the much higher invasion success in this group compared to eucalypts. From nine databases we found records that 373 eucalypts have been introduced to areas outside their native ranges; 82 of these have become naturalised. and eight are invasive.

However. we argue that robust and useful generalisations in invasion science can be made by considering “invasion syndromes” which we define as “a combination of pathways. alien species traits. and characteristics of the recipient ecosystem which collectively result in predictable dynamics and impacts. and that can be managed effectively using specific policy and management actions”. We describe this approach and outline examples that highlight its utility. including: cacti with clonal fragmentation in arid ecosystems; small aquatic organisms introduced through ballast water in harbours; large ranid frogs with frequent secondary transfers; piscivorous freshwater fishes in connected aquatic ecosystems; plant invasions in high-elevation areas; tall-statured grasses; and tree-feeding insects …,True,GwJXHYEAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,21,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-020-02220-w,1626302750752208751,/scholar?cites=1626302750752208751,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-020-02220-w,0,0,0

We tested this hypothesis using the cosmopolitan grass genus Phalaris (Poaceae). consisting of 19 species that range from diploid to tetraploid to hexaploid. Specifically. we tested whether (1) polyploids occupy more extreme environments and/or (2) have broader niche breadths and/or (3) whether the polyploid species’ distributions indicate a niche shift from diploid species.• Methods: We employed a bootstrapping approach using distribution data for each species and eight environmental variables to investigate differences between species in the means. extremes. and breadths of each environmental variable.

Most examples are. however. drawn from the northern hemisphere and long-term rates of population decline are not well documented as historical data are often lacking. We use a large and long-term (1931–2013) repeat photography dataset together with environmental data and fire records to account for the decline of the critically endangered Widdringtonia cedarbergensis. Eighty-seven historical and repeat photo-pairs were analysed to establish 20th century changes in W. cedarbergensis demography. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was fitted to determine the relative importance of environmental factors and fire-return interval on mortality for the species. From an initial total of 1313 live trees in historical photographs. 74% had died and only 44 (3.4%) had recruited in the repeat photographs. leaving 387 live individuals. Juveniles (mature adults) had decreased (increased) from 27% (73%) to 8% (92%) over the intervening period. Our model demonstrates that mortality is related to greater fire frequency. higher temperatures. lower elevations. less rocky habitats and aspect (i.e. east-facing slopes had the least mortality). Our results show that W. cedarbergensis populations have declined significantly over the recorded period. with a pronounced decline in the last 30 years. Individuals that established in open habitats at lower. hotter elevations and experienced a greater fire frequency appear to be more vulnerable to mortality than individuals growing within protected. rocky environments at higher. cooler locations with less frequent fires.
