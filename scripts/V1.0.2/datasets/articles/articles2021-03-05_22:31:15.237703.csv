1113231,Controlled scalable synthesis of uniform. high-quality monolayer and few-layer MoS 2 films,2013,Yifei Yu and Chun Li and Yi Liu and Liqin Su and Yong Zhang and Linyou Cao,3,Scientific reports,1,1-6,Nature Publishing Group,Two dimensional (2D) materials with a monolayer of atoms represent an ultimate control of material dimension in the vertical direction. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS 2) monolayers. with a direct bandgap of 1.8 eV. offer an unprecedented prospect of miniaturizing semiconductor science and technology down to a truly atomic scale. Recent studies have indeed demonstrated the promise of 2D MoS 2 in fields including field effect transistors. low power switches. optoelectronics and spintronics. However. device development with 2D MoS 2 has been delayed by the lack of capabilities to produce large-area. uniform and high-quality MoS 2 monolayers. Here we present a self-limiting approach that can grow high quality monolayer and few-layer MoS 2 films over an area of centimeters with unprecedented uniformity and controllability. This approach is compatible with the standard fabrication process in semiconductor industry …,True,GzfwcWcAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,786,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01866,10230265524812579314,/scholar?cites=10230265524812579314,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01866,0,0,0

BNNSs suspended on an SiO2  trench were clamped by a metal film via microfabrication based on electron beam lithography. Calculated by the plate theory of a doubly clamped plate under a concentrated load. the bending modulus of BNNSs was found to increase with the decrease of sheet thickness and approach the theoretical C33  value of a hexagonal BN single crystal in thinner sheets (thickness<50 nm).

The nanosheet growth is subject to strong influences of the diffusion of source materials through the boundary layer of gas flows. This boundary layer diffusion is found to be the rate-determining step of the growth under typical experimental conditions. evidenced by a substantial dependence of the nanosheet’s size on diffusion fluxes. We also find that high-quality GeS nanosheets can grow only in the diffusion-limited regime. as the crystalline quality substantially deteriorates when the rate-determining step is changed away from the boundary layer diffusion.

We present the synthesis of single-crystalline SnSe2 nanoplates by a noncatalytic vapor deposition process and demonstrate that the growth is subject to strong influences from substrates. The effect of substrates is evidenced by a temperature-dependent morphological difference in the nanoplates grown on mica and silicon substrates. At a growth temperature of 280 °C. the diameter of the nanoplates grown on mica is larger than those grown on silicon by a ratio of 6.2.

Because molecules near a metallic surface experience a different environment than in free space. their spontaneous radiative emission rate is generally enhanced 7. 8. 9. Such enhancement. measured by means of the Purcell factor. arises as a consequence of the overlap between the surface plasmon mode frequency and the emission spectrum of the molecule. However. such overlap is available only for a few narrow bands of frequency due to the limited plasmonic materials existing in nature 10. 11.

In contrast. an optical far-field superlens (FSL) device has a remarkable transmission property that leads to a one-to-one relationship between the far-field and the near-field angular spectra. This property makes the device suitable for imaging beyond the diffraction limit from far-field measurement. This specific FSL is composed of a properly designed periodically corrugated metallic slab-based superlens. Through the numerical design and parameter study. we show that the transmission property of this FSL is based on a specific strong-broadband wavenumber excitation of surface-plasmon polaritons supported by the nanostructured metallic grating.,True,4_FqgIkAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,183,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=josab-23-11-2383,9668508963506070919,/scholar?cites=9668508963506070919,,https://www.zhaowei.us/data/Journals/JOSAB_Stephane.pdf,0,0,0

The focusing mechanism is explained by using a simple coherent interference model of SPP generation on the circular grating by the incident field. Experimental results concur well with theoretical predictions and highlight the requirement for the phase matching of SPP sources in the grating to achieve the maximum enhancement of the SPP wave at the focal point. NSOM measurements show that the plasmonic lens achieves more than a 10-fold intensity enhancement over the intensity of a single ring of the in-plane field components at the focus when the grating design is tuned to the SPP wavelength.

In such surveys. the cost. endurance. and utility of the vehicle swarm needs to be carefully optimized. One of the main challenges when designing these systems is coming up with an appropriate way to localize each vehicle in relation to the rest of the swarm. Current methods for underwater localization are restrictive in either cost. power consumption. or range.This dissertation considers the self-localization of a deforming swarm of subsurface vehicles using ambient acoustic noise in the ocean. The experiments presented consider a group of independent underwater vehicles that passively record ambient sounds in the ocean with a single hydrophone while they float with subsurface currents. Three different self-localization approaches are considered. The first involves estimating the acoustic impulse response between moving vehicles using cross-correlations of ambient noise. a known first step towards a self- localization estimate. Accurate estimates of the acoustic impulse response are shown between moving vehicle pairs. However. motion between the receivers limits the amount of time averaging that can be done. making the estimation susceptible to anisotropies in the ambient noise field. To overcome these anisotropies. the next approach jointly estimates the vehicle geometry and the directionality of the ambient noise field. without prior knowledge of either estimate.

1113357,Test of a small domestic boiler using different pellets,2004,J Dias and M Costa and JLT Azevedo,27,Biomass and Bioenergy,6,531-539,Pergamon,This paper presents results from an experimental study performed on a 13 kWth commercial domestic boiler using pellets as fuel. Four different types of pellets were used and. for each one. the boiler was tested as a function of its capacity and the fan regulation affecting excess air. Measurements were performed for boiler heat load. pellets consumption rate. flue-gas temperature and composition. Mass balances allowed the calculation of the flue-gas flow rate and associated heat losses. Losses from incomplete combustion have also been quantified. Under boiler steady-state conditions the flue-gas O2 concentration changes with boiler load and ventilation due to the regulation scheme of the boiler. Flue-gas CO shows a minimum for values of O2 in the flue-gases of about 13%. NOx emissions are independent of excess air for low values of nitrogen in the fuel whereas. for larger values.

CO. and N2 have been prepared in such a way that the constant pressure adiabatic flame temperature for all reacting mixtures was kept constant. In this study. the equivalence ratio was also kept constant. For comparison purposes. the combustion of pure methane in the same porous burner has also been studied. The results indicated that. for this burner design. the macroscopic flame shape of the fuel mixtures remains approximately the same as compared to pure methane but the former flames move further upstream from the burner exit. This is caused by the increase of the laminar flame speed as …,True,FwrMBxQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,57,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ef9010324,3817388372925147783,/scholar?cites=3817388372925147783,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47962512/On_the_Combustion_of_Hydrogen-Rich_Gaseo20160810-10335-1k2bmhz.pdf,0,0,0

New data are reported for gas phase species concentration. temperature and particle burnout for two primary zone stoichiometric ratios. 1.15 (unstaged flame) and 0.95 (staged flame). other operating conditions being fixed. The results revealed that the reduction in primary zone stoichiometric ratio caused a decrease in NOx emissions from 421 to 180 mg/N m3@6%O2. an increase in CO emissions from 51 to 168 mg/N m3@6%O2 and a reduction in particle burnout from 81.8% to 76.5%. It was concluded that the reduction of the O2 availability in the primary zone inhibits the NO formation. mainly via the fuel mechanism. but it affects negatively both the CO and the char oxidation processes because. under staging conditions. both processes tend to occur in the vicinity of the over fire …,True,FwrMBxQAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,55,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236108003128,15795923645973387650,/scholar?cites=15795923645973387650,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,Two‐dimensional near‐incompressible steady lid‐driven cavity flows (Re = 100–7.500) are simulated using multi‐relaxation‐time (MRT) model in the parallel lattice Boltzmann BGK Bhatnager–Gross–Krook method (LBGK). Results are compared with those using single‐relaxation‐time (SRT) model in the LBGK method and previous simulation data using Navier–Stokes equations for the same flow conditions. Effects of variation of relaxation parameters in the MRT model. effects of number of the lattice points. improved computational convergence and reduced spatial oscillations of solution near geometrically singular points in the flow field using LBGK method due to MRT model are highlighted in the study.

The SHLL method is a purely vector-split approximation of the classical HLL method (Harten et al.. 1983 [1]) which assumes the presence of local wave propagation in the algebraic derivation of fluxes across cell surfaces. The conventional HLL flux expression terms are interface-split and wave propagation velocities estimated (where required) based on local conditions. Due to the highly local nature of the SHLL fluxes. the scheme is very efficiently applied to GPU computation since the flux. initialisation and update phases of the computation are all vectorized processes.

From 1990 to 2008 CO2 emissions in developed countries (defined as countries with emission-reduction commitments in the Kyoto Protocol. Annex B) have stabilized. but emissions in developing countries (non-Annex B) have doubled. Some studies suggest that the stabilization of emissions in developed countries was partially because of growing imports from developing countries. To quantify the growth in emission transfers via international trade. we developed a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008. We find that the emissions from the production of traded goods and services have increased from 4.3 Gt CO2 in 1990 (20% of global emissions) to 7.8 Gt CO2 in 2008 (26%).

1113424,System LCOE: What are the costs of variable renewables?,2013,Falko Ueckerdt and Lion Hirth and Gunnar Luderer and Ottmar Edenhofer,63,Energy,,61-75,Pergamon,LCOE (levelized costs of electricity) are a common metric for comparing power generating technologies. However. there is criticism particularly towards evaluating variable renewables like wind and solar PV (photovoltaics) power based on LCOE because it ignores variability and integration costs. We propose a new metric System LCOE that accounts for integration and generation costs. For this purpose we develop a new mathematical definition of integration costs that directly relates to economic theory. As a result System LCOE allow the economic comparison of generating technologies and deriving optimal quantities in particular for VRE (variable renewable sources). To demonstrate the new concept we quantify System LCOE from a simple power system model and literature values. We find that at high wind shares integration costs can be in the same range as generation costs of wind power and conventional …,True,RbVxswsAAAAJ:_B80troHkn4C,455,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544213009390,108395784104478561,/scholar?cites=108395784104478561,,http://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/edenh/publications-1/SystemLCOE.pdf,0,0,0

All five global energy-environment-economy models show that achieving low greenhouse gas concentration targets is technically feasible and economically viable. The ranking of the importance of individual technology options is robust across models. For the lowest stabilization target (400 ppm CO2 eq). the use of bio-energy in combination with CCS plays a crucial role. and biomass potential dominates the cost of reaching this target. Without CCS or the considerable extension of renewables the 400 ppm CO2 eq target is not achievable. Across the models. estimated aggregate costs up to 2100 are below 0.8% global GDP for 550 ppm CO2 eq stabilization and below 2.5% for the 400 ppm CO2 eq pathway.,True,RbVxswsAAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC,441,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/2367,5516411472375684214,/scholar?cites=5516411472375684214,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2367,0,0,0

This paper proposes a framework to analyze and quantify these costs. We propose a definition of integration costs based on the marginal economic value of electricity. or market value – as such a definition can be more easily used in economic cost-benefit assessment than previous approaches. We suggest decomposing integration costs intro three components. according to the principal characteristics of wind and solar power: temporal variability. uncertainty. and location-constraints. Quantitative estimates of these components are extracted from a review of 100 + published studies.

1113429,Induced technological change: Exploring its implications for the economics of atmospheric stabilization: Synthesis report from the innovation modeling comparison project,2006,Ottmar Edenhofer and Kai Lessmann and Claudia Kemfert and Michael Grubb and Jonathan Kohler,,The Energy Journal,Special Issue# 1,,International Association for Energy Economics,This paper summarizes results from ten global economy-energy-environment models implementing mechanisms of endogenous technological change (ETC). Climate policy goals represented as different CO2 stabilization levels are imposed. and the contribution of induced technological change (ITC) to meeting the goals is assessed. Findings indicate that climate policy induces additional technological change. in some models substantially. Its effect is a reduction of abatement costs in all participating models. The majority of models calculate abatement costs below 1 percent of present value aggregate gross world product for the period 2000-2100. The models predict different dynamics for rising carbon costs. with some showing a decline in carbon costs towards the end of the century. There are a number of reasons for differences in results between models; however four major drivers of differences are identified. First. the extent of the necessary CO2 reduction which depends mainly on predicted baseline emissions. determines how much a model is challenged to comply with climate policy. Second. when climate policy can offset market distortions. some models show that not costs but benefits accrue from climate policy. Third. assumptions about long-term investment behavior. eg foresight of actors and number of available investment options. exert a major influence. Finally. whether and how options for carbon-free energy are implemented (backstop and end-of-the-pipe technologies) strongly affects both the mitigation strategy and the abatement costs.,True,RbVxswsAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC,321,https://www.iaee.org/energyjournal/article/2134,18250279093725230431,/scholar?cites=18250279093725230431,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2134,0,0,0
1113430,Causes of the EU ETS price drop: Recession. CDM. renewable policies or a bit of everything?—New evidence,2014,Nicolas Koch and Sabine Fuss and Godefroy Grosjean and Ottmar Edenhofer,73,Energy Policy,,676-685,Elsevier,The price of EU allowances (EUAs) in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) fell from almost 30€/tCO2 in mid-2008 to less than 5€/tCO2 in mid-2013. The sharp and persistent price decline has sparked intense debates both in academia and among policy-makers about the decisive allowance price drivers. In this paper we examine whether and to what extent the EUA price drop can be justified by three commonly identified explanatory factors: the economic recession. renewable policies and the use of international credits. Capitalizing on marginal abatement cost theory and a broadly extended data set. we find that only variations in economic activity and the growth of wind and solar electricity production are robustly explaining EUA price dynamics. Contrary to simulation-based analyses. our results point to moderate interaction effects between the overlapping EU ETS and renewable policies.

Nine modeling teams participated in the project to explore the consequences of global emissions following the proposed policy stringency of the national pledges from the Copenhagen Accord and Cancún Agreements to 2030. Specific features compared to earlier assessments are the explicit consideration of near-term 2030 emission targets as well as the systematic sensitivity analysis for the availability and potential of mitigation technologies. Our estimates show that a 2030 mitigation effort comparable to the pledges would result in a further “lock-in” of the energy system into fossil fuels and thus impede the required energy transformation to reach low greenhouse-gas stabilization levels (450 ppm CO2e).

In this Perspective. we synthesize findings regarding the optimal use of carbon revenues from both traditional economic analyses and studies in behavioural and political science that are focused on public acceptability. We then compare real-world carbon pricing regimes with theoretical insights on distributional fairness. revenue salience. political trust and policy stability.

For such policies. the issue of endogenous technological change becomes important. both to estimate the overall costs and to identify the intertemporally cost-effective combination of mitigation options. In this paper. we first discuss the recent literature that evaluates the potential for endogenous technological change to reduce mitigation costs. and the efforts to incorporate endogenous technological change into pre-existing integrated assessment models.

These contain a third of the world's population and a large proportion of the people and economic activities most at risk from sea-level rise and from the heatwaves. storms and floods whose frequency and/or intensity climate change is likely to increase. Section I outlines both the potentials for adaptation and the constraints. Section II discusses the scale of urban change. Section III considers direct and indirect impacts of climate change on urban areas and which nations. cities and population groups are particularly at risk. This highlights how prosperous. well-governed cities could generally adapt. but most of the world's urban population lives in cities or smaller urban centres ill-equipped for adaptation. A key part of adaptation concerns infrastructure and buildings-but much of the urban population in Africa. Asia and Latin America lack the infrastructure to adapt. Most international agencies have long refused to support urban programmes. especially those that address these problems. Section IV discusses innovations by urban governments and community organizations and in financial systems that address such problems. including the relevance of recent innovations in disaster-risk reduction for adaptation. It notes how few city and national governments are taking any action on adaptation.

Such a bargain may be achievable if we can realign the policy architecture of the climate regime to its original stated goals of sustainable development.,True,xlEibT0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,261,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3763/cpol.2003.0329,9964145031625308308,/scholar?cites=9964145031625308308,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44499411/Najam_20-_20Climate_20Negotiations_20Beyond_20Kyoto_20Developing.pdf,0,0,0

Although climate change seems marginal compared to the pressing issues of poverty alleviation and economic development. it is becoming clear that the realisation of development goals may be hampered by climate change. However. development can be shaped in such a way as to achieve its goals and at the same time reduce vulnerability to climate change. thereby facilitating sustainable development that realises economic. social. local and global environmental goals. This approach has been coined the ‘development first approach’. in which a future climate regime should focus on development strategies with ancillary climate benefits and increase the capability of developing countries to implement these. This is anticipated to offer a possible positive way out of the current deadlock between North and South in the …,True,xlEibT0AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,245,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.clipol.2003.10.007,15443951818856074791,/scholar?cites=15443951818856074791,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Verhagen/publication/40793486_The_development_and_climate_nexus_the_case_of_sub-Saharan_Africa/links/562e017a08ae518e34825825/The-development-and-climate-nexus-the-case-of-sub-Saharan-Africa.pdf,0,0,0
1113460,Mainstreaming adaptation in development,2004,Saleemul Huq and Hannah Reid,,,,,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,As described in more detail by Professor Rogers and by Agrawala (this Bulletin). historically. the climate change issuehas been seen primarily as one which is likely to occur in a gradual fashion in the medium-to long-term future (ie anything from 50 to 100 years’ time) and that the policy priority in the short term (ie the next 10 to 20 years) has been the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through mitigation actions. Hence. the first decade of the negotiations under theUnitedNations FrameworkConvention onClimateChange (UNFCCC) focused largely on the elaborating mitigation commitments and related institutional and financial mechanisms. to ensure that the main emitting countries took actions to reduce their emissions. This focus. which fitted well with early understandings of climate science and was fully in accordance with the precautionary principle set out in the Convention. tended however. to overshadow policy discussions about adaptation. Althoughboth theUNFCCC and theKyotoProtocol contain adaptation provisions. included largely at the insistence of vulnerable developing countries. the main emphasis of national and international climate policy has been on mitigation. This is reflected in the national communications (reports) submitted by developed and developing country Parties to the UNFCCC. which contain much less informationabout adaptation thanabout mitigation. The publication of theThirdAssessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 (IPCC 2001) highlighted that emissions continue to rise and that some impacts may already be discernible.

Given the close relationship between development and adaptation. it is tempting to use existing channels of development assistance to fill this gap.

Those likely to be worst affected are the world’s poorest countries. especially poor and marginalised communities within these countries. Ironically it is these poor countries and people who have contributed least to the problem of climate change. because of their very low greenhouse gas emissions. but who will suffer most from its consequences. Even if emissions are severely curbed. climate change will still occur. The industrialised countries have accepted they have a responsibility to help poor and vulnerable countries to adapt (UNFCCC).

Hyogo. 1 Kyoto 2 and Gleneagles 3 have given their names to major frameworks of action aimed at reducing climate-related vulnerabilities and poverty over the coming decade. International efforts to re-orientate policy and institutional structures towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 4 (MDGs) and to secure fairer trade as part of the Doha Development Agenda will also be strengthened in 2005. After the media headlines have faded. what impact will these frameworks have on the lives of the poor and others vulnerable to climate impacts? Will climate vulnerabilities be integrated in all these frameworks with lasting benefits? Will the interests and voices of those vulnerable to impacts be heard? Why are MDGs. climate change and trade processes running in parallel tracks? And what can be done to link these processes synergistically in favour of those vulnerable to climate change? These questions were central to the Linking Climate Adaptation (LCA) Project that aimed to ensure that poor people benefit from adaptation processes. rather than bearing greater burdens by. for example. having the risks caused by climate change shifted in their direction. The key research aim of the LCA Project was to determine what kind of procedural and institutional frameworks are needed to ensure that locally determined adaptation needs are linked “upwards” to national and international policy and institutional structures.

Until recently. mitigation and adaptation have been considered separately in both climate change science and policy. Mitigation has been treated as an issue for developed countries. which hold the greatest responsibility for climate change. while adaptation is seen as a priority for the South. where mitigative capacity is low and vulnerability is high. This conceptual divide has hindered progress against the achievement of the fundamental sustainable development challenges of climate change. Recent attention to exploring the synergies between mitigation and adaptation suggests that an integrated approach could go some way to bridging the gap between the development and adaptation priorities of the South and the need to achieve global engagement in mitigation.

Climate change is a challenge to the nonhuman world. to sustainability. and to governance and decision making. Some commentators argue that climate change poses a more serious threat than that of terrorism (King 2004. 176). Global collective action is needed to prevent potentially catastrophic impacts of our unprecedented experiment with the planetary climate system and to adapt to unavoidable climate change.Adaptation to climate change is increasingly the focus of policy action and concern in both industrialized and developing countries that feel under threat. Most literature on adaptation to climate change explores adaptation options (see Smithers and Smit 1997; Smit et al. 2000) and the costs and beneﬁts of adaptation (Fankhauser. Smith. and Tol 1999; Tol et al. 1998; Tol et al. 2004). But to date. relatively little attention has been paid to the social justice aspects of adaptation to climate change. This is somewhat surprising considering the intense research on equity issues in mitigation of climate change (see Arler 2001; Azar 2000; Jamieson 2001; Müller 2001; Ringius. Asjdorn. and Underdal 2002; Rose et al. 1998; Toth 1999). But research on equity in the environmental arena largely stems from the realms of political action over “environmental justice” dilemmas (see Light and de-Shalit 2003; Schlosberg 1999) and from discussions of citizenship and sustainability (Dobson 2003). and fails to address the …,True,xlEibT0AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,172,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=bIn5W04D3dIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:WFRMzHKBBlAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=HhAtDFTE-Y&sig=BkYwOqnvWqk_bB3rp3CriEcZh9w,5766438702948308056,/scholar?cites=5766438702948308056,,,0,0,0

In addition to high levels of resistance produced by receptor insensitivity (5. 16. 17). several cases of tolerance to low to medium levels of toxin have been reported in laboratory colonies of lepidopteran species (3. 18). Because the molecular basis of some of these cases of tolerance to the toxin are not known. we explored alternative mechanisms. Here. we present evidence that tolerance to a Bt formulation in a laboratory colony of the flour moth Ephestia kuehniella can be induced by preexposure to a low concentration of the Bt formulation and that the tolerance correlates with an elevated immune response.

Hyogo. 1 Kyoto 2 and Gleneagles 3 have given their names to major frameworks of action aimed at reducing climate-related vulnerabilities and poverty over the coming decade. International efforts to re-orientate policy and institutional structures towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 4 (MDGs) and to secure fairer trade as part of the Doha Development Agenda will also be strengthened in 2005. After the media headlines have faded. what impact will these frameworks have on the lives of the poor and others vulnerable to climate impacts? Will climate vulnerabilities be integrated in all these frameworks with lasting benefits? Will the interests and voices of those vulnerable to impacts be heard? Why are MDGs. climate change and trade processes running in parallel tracks? And what can be done to link these processes synergistically in favour of those vulnerable to climate change? These questions were central to the Linking Climate Adaptation (LCA) Project that aimed to ensure that poor people benefit from adaptation processes. rather than bearing greater burdens by. for example. having the risks caused by climate change shifted in their direction. The key research aim of the LCA Project was to determine what kind of procedural and institutional frameworks are needed to ensure that locally determined adaptation needs are linked “upwards” to national and international policy and institutional structures.

Deltamethrin was the most toxic to the spiders. with LC 50 at 0.033 to 1.1 ppm. followed by ethofenprox. The results indicate that the spiders are susceptible to synthetic pyrethroids. Insecticide susceptibilities of the spiders varied among species.

Many insecticides. particularly phenthoate. imidacloprid and deltamethrin. were toxic to C. lividipennis. All insecticides tested were toxic to H. apicalis. We also evaluated the effect of insecticides on the spiders and C. lividipennis in paddy fields. Deltamethrin had a destructive effect on the spider populations and may have induced a resurgence of the Nilaparvata lugens population.

However. when providing an overview for the ideal direction of the field. he argued against focusing scholarship on the normative dimensions of climate policy. In response to questions afterwards we understood him to argue that while equity is important generally. it is a potential distraction from addressing climate change. and could undermine collective action in the face of this urgent public goods crises. 3We believe it is important to respond to Keohane's comments because they seemed to fit within an established line of argument that we have heard from very influential players in UN negotiation halls. academic journals. and within think-tanks and government ministries. As Todd Stern. US Special Envoy for Climate Change purportedly declared during the Durban Platform negotiations.“if equity's in. we’re out”(Pickering et al.. 2012). Posner and Weisbach (2010) similarly argue that discussions of justice ought to be left out of both academic work and policy discussions because they are conceptually flawed. could “derail the negotiations.” and erode political will (2010). These sentiments are particularly problematic when combined with an emerging post-Paris discourse that suggests that we are in a post-equity era of a voluntary and universal climate agreement.

To date. only one gene for kinesin light chain has been characterized. while a second gene was identified in a genomic sequencing study but not analyzed biochemically. Here we describe new genes encoding kinesin light chains in mouse. One of these light chains is neuronally enriched. while another shows ubiquitous expression. The presence of multiple kinesin light chain genes in mice is especially interesting. since there are two kinesin heavy chain genes in humans (Niclas. J.. Navone. F.. Hom-Booher. N.. and Vale. R. D.

The matrix architecture facilitates addressing key questions related to current climate research and policy-making: identifying the effectiveness of different adaptation and mitigation strategies (in terms of their costs. risks and other consequences) and the possible trade-offs and synergies. The two main axes of the matrix are: 1) the level of radiative forcing of the climate system (as characterised by the representative concentration pathways) and 2) a set of alternative plausible trajectories of future global development (described as shared socio-economic pathways). The matrix can be used to guide scenario development at different scales. It can also be used as a heuristic tool for classifying new and existing scenarios for assessment.

Arlington. VA (United States),Greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries will likely surpass those from developed countries within the first half of this century. highlighting the need for developing country efforts to reduce the risk of climate change. While developing nations have been reluctant to accept binding emissions targets. asking that richer nations take action first. many are undertaking efforts that have significantly reduced the growth of their own greenhouse gas emissions. In most cases. climate mitigation is not the goal. but rather an outgrowth of efforts driven by economic. security. or local environmental concerns. This study attempts to document the climate mitigation resulting from such efforts in six key countries (Brazil. China. India. Mexico. South Africa. and Turkey) and to inform policy-making aimed at further mitigation in these and other developing nations. The six countries examined here reflect significant regional. economic. demographic. and energy resource diversity. They include the world's two most populous nations. a major oil exporter. Africa's largest greenhouse gas emitter. and the country with the largest expanse of tropical forest. While their circumstances vary widely. these countries share common concerns that have motivated actions resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions growth. Primary among these concerns are economic growth. energy security. and improved air quality.

This article explores what potential future greenhouse gas allocation schemes might mean for key developing countries. The need for development is widely acknowledged. but growth in non-Annex I country emissions means that such development may need to take a different path to business as usual. The national interests of developing countries in negotiating potential future commitments are shaped by basic characteristics. notably emissions (both annual and historical cumulative). economic growth and population. These factors in turn shape the acceptability of allocations based on ability to pay. emissions intensity. or emissions per capita.Results for six major developing countries (China. India. Brazil.

We propose a revised definition. where mitigative capacity is a country's ability to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or enhance natural sinks. By “ability” we mean skills. competencies. fitness. and proficiencies that a country has attained which can contribute to GHG emissions mitigation. A conceptual framework is proposed. linking mitigative capacity to a country's sustainable development path. and grouping the factors influencing mitigative capacity into three main sets: economic factors. institutional ones. and technology.

However. methodological issues and climate policy are also addressed in various individual CaPP-supported projects. CaPP was thus able to respond favourably to a request from the Energy Research Centre (South Africa) and the Wuppertal Institute for Climate. Environment and Energy (Germany) for support for a South-North dialogue project. The subject was a framework for future climate negotiations.

In 2009 a REFIT was published. which has resulted in a great interest by IPPs to develop renewable energy projects in South Africa. Nonetheless. under existing renewable energy policy few renewable energy projects for electricity generation have been deployed. SWHs have seen some market growth in 2008 and 2009 largely facilitated by a SWH subsidy and increased energy awareness due to nation-wide electricity blackouts in 2008.N this study renewable energy Roadmaps have been projected for electricity generation from wind. CSP and PV and for high and low SWH rollout programmes that reduce the demand for electricity. Six roadmaps were developed. Electricity targets of 15%(Roadmaps 5 & 6). 27%(Roadmaps 3 & 4) and unlimited (Roadmaps 1 & 2) by 2030 were assessed. as well as high (Roadmaps 1. 3 & 5) and low SWH (Roadmaps 2. 4 & 6) strategies.

A logistic regression model was performed to predict drop out at the beginning of the second academic year for the 823 freshmen of a three-year bachelor degree in psychology at an Italian university. The model uses both measures of students' educational subculture and incoming levels of knowledge and skills. The probability of dropping out was used as dependent variable. Results show that the probability of dropping out is significantly associated with students' educational subculture – but not with their incoming level of knowledge and skills.

This paper quantitatively analyses the implications of the proposal for countries’ emissions and costs. The analysis focuses on a “political willingness” scenario and four stabilisation scenarios. The analysis shows that stringent stabilisation targets imply that many developing countries would have to take on quantitative mitigation obligations by 2030. even when the Annex I countries take on ambitious mitigation commitments far beyond the Kyoto obligations.

This index has become an important alternative to the traditional unidimensional measure of development (i.e. the gross domestic product). Although the index still fails to include any ecological considerations. it has broadened the discussion surrounding the evaluation of development. Unfortunately. over the years. the HDRs seem to have become stagnant. repeating the same rhetoric without necessarily increasing the HDI's utility. This paper evaluates how well these reports have lived up to their own conceptual mandate and assesses the ability of the HDI to further the development debate.

Adopting a field perspective. this article shows how the rise of environmental NGOs has taken place in interactions with four institutional fields. They not only respond to political conditions. but also to opportunities offered by the media. the internet and international NGOs. In this process. organizational entrepreneurs play a crucial role in mobilizing resources while other individuals participate in search of self-fulfilment or social experience. These arguments underscore the multi-institutional dynamics of civil society development without underestimating state-centred and market-centred explanations.

For example. writing in Foreign Afluirs. Lester Salamon (1994: 109) proclaims that ‘a striking upsurge is underway around the globe in organized voluntary activity and the creation of private. nonprofit or nongovernmental organizations...

Several aspects link climate change with development issues. This report explores these links in detail. and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development. and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs. resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated. reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus. an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors. it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options. such as technology. cost. policies. etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25,True,l6nq2hkAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,479,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,15069716797967303289,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,0,0,0

Although they are still rather skeptical about the global environmental enterprise. they have come a long way from being the vigorous contestants that they were three decades ago. This fascinating evolution has not only changed the views of developing countries but has also transformed the shape of the global environmental discourse. most significantly by turning what used to be global environmental politics into what is now the global politics of sustainable development. This paper charts this evolution by using the twin conceptual lenses of effectiveness and legitimacy and the heuristic markers of the three key global conferences on the global environment (Stockholm 1972; Rio de Janeiro 1992; Johannesburg 2002).

While attention has been understandably focussed on the ratification process. it is time to begin thinking about the next steps for the global climate regime. particularly in terms of a deeper inclusion of developing countries' concerns and interests. This paper begins doing so from the perspective of the developing countries.

Dordrecht,This paper presents a framework for understanding energy issues in the context of sustainable development. It posits that there are three important ways in which energy is related to sustainable development: (a) energy as a source of environmental stress. (b) energy as a principal motor of macroeconomic growth and (c) energy as a prerequisite for meeting basic human needs. These three dimensions correspond to the three dimensions of the often-used triangle of sustainable development: environmental. economic. and social. Using this framework. the paper traces how successive environmental summits at Stockholm (1972). Rio de Janeiro (1992) and Johannesburg (2002) have dealt with energy issues.

Several aspects link climate change with development issues. This report explores these links in detail. and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development. and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs. resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated. reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus. an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors. it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options. such as technology. cost. policies. etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25,True,Hocb-jkAAAAJ:0CzhzZyukY4C,496,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,15069716797967303289,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,0,0,0

Developing countries have specific needs for adaptation due to high vulnerabilities. and they will in this way carry a great part of the global costs of climate change although the rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are mainly the responsibility of industrialized countries. This article provides a status of climate change adaptation in developing countries. An overview of observed and projected climate change is given. and recent literature on impacts. vulnerability. and adaptation are reviewed. including the emerging focus on mainstreaming of climate change and adaptation in development plans and programs.

It is important to integrate the anticipated changes into the design of urban drainage in response to the increased risk level in cities. This paper presents a pluvial flood risk assessment framework to identify and assess adaptation options in the urban context. An integrated approach is adopted by incorporating climate change impact assessment. flood inundation modeling. economic tool. and risk assessment. hereby developing a step-by-step process for cost-benefit assessment of climate change adaptation measures.

Although climate change seems marginal compared to the pressing issues of poverty alleviation and economic development. it is becoming clear that the realisation of development goals may be hampered by climate change. However. development can be shaped in such a way as to achieve its goals and at the same time reduce vulnerability to climate change. thereby facilitating sustainable development that realises economic. social. local and global environmental goals. This approach has been coined the ‘development first approach’. in which a future climate regime should focus on development strategies with ancillary climate benefits and increase the capability of developing countries to implement these.

1113577,CDM sustainable development impacts developed for the UNEP project'CD4CDM',2004,Anne Olhoff and Anil Markandya and Kirsten Halsnaes and Tim Taylor,,,,,,The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). an innovative cooperative mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. is designed with the dual aim of assisting developing countries in achieving sustainable development (SD) and of assisting industrialised countries in achieving compliance with their greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction commitments. The SD dimension is not merely a requirement of the CDM; it should be seen as a main driver for developing country interest in participating in CDM projects. This is so. since apart from GHG emission reductions CDM projects will have a number of impacts in the host countries. including impacts on economic and social development and on the local environment. Furthermore. the selecting of the SD criteria and the assessment of the SD impacts are sovereign matters of the host countries in the current operationalisation of the Kyoto Protocol. National authorities can thus use the SD dimension to evaluate key linkages between national development goals and CDM projects. with the aim of selecting and designing CDM projects so that they create and maximise synergies with local development goals.

1113578,Costing methodologies,2000,Anil Markandya and K Halsnaes,,Guidance Papers on the Cross Cutting Issues of the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC,,15-31,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Geneva. Switzerland,The costs of climate change policies are estimated and their implications discussed in many parts of the IPCC’s Assessment Report. The use of consistent cost concepts across the TAR is important. in order to facilitate comparability across different cost assessment approaches. In this guidance paper. we propose a set of definitions for the different concepts and present a relation between them. We suggest that. in every case where costs are referred to. authors make clear which cost concept or concepts they are using. The paper also identifies categories of costs and their relevance in the climate change area. We also suggest that authors use this as a checklist when estimating or referring to the costs of certain measures. Finally. the paper discusses the relationship between cost concepts and baselines. Again. authors are recommended to make clear what cost assumptions underlie the baselines they use. Further details of these concepts can be found in Christensen.

1113579,Sustainable development and climate change: lessons from country studies,2008,Kirsten Halsnæs and PR Shukla and Amit Garg,8,Climate Policy,2,202-219,Taylor & Francis Group,Sustainable development has been suggested as a framework for integrating development and climate change policies in developing countries. Mainstreaming climate change into sustainable development policies would allow these countries to achieve their development goals while addressing climate change. A number of research programmes have investigated how potential synergies could be achieved at national level and what kind of trade-offs between the various aspects of sustainable development have to be faced. An overview of these studies is provided. focusing on national case studies. The energy and transportation sectors are covered in many studies. but some attention is also given to the infrastructure sector and water supply. Most existing development policies will not lead to a sustainable development pattern. since they insufficiently address climate change.

National study results are discussed in relation to expected general international development trends in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries certainly will increase in the future due to economic development needs. There is however a large and relatively cheap potential for emission reductions connected to efficiency improvements in industrial production and general energy efficiency improvements in the countries. The implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation strategies is interrelated with general national economic development policies. The macroeconomic impact of implementing climate change mitigation strategies is assessed on the basis of two case studies for …,True,Hocb-jkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,45,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421596803570,9382866280308361893,/scholar?cites=9382866280308361893,,,0,0,0

Net global CO2 emissions. in particular. must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies. from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal. the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there?   The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including. for example. the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways. including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?   Two concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead. the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways.

Several aspects link climate change with development issues. This report explores these links in detail. and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development. and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs. resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated. reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus. an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors. it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options. such as technology. cost. policies. etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25,True,1c-xODUAAAAJ:MAUkC_7iAq8C,467,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,15069716797967303289,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,0,0,0

Although. national level emissions provide general guidelines for assessing mitigation alternatives. but significant regional and sectoral variability exist in Indian emissions.

Over the next decades the increase in rural population in many developing countries will be overshadowed by population flows to cities. Rural populations globally are expected to peak at a level of 3.5 billion people by around 2020 and decline thereafter. albeit with heterogeneous regional trends. This adds urgency in addressing rural energy access. but our common future will be predominantly urban. Most of urban growth will continue to occur in small-to medium-sized urban centers. Growth in these smaller cities poses serious policy challenges. especially in the developing world. In small cities. data and information to guide policy are largely absent. local resources to tackle development challenges are limited. and governance and institutional capacities are weak. requiring serious efforts in capacity building. novel applications of remote sensing. information. and decision support techniques. and new institutional partnerships.

Arlington. VA (United States),Greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries will likely surpass those from developed countries within the first half of this century. highlighting the need for developing country efforts to reduce the risk of climate change. While developing nations have been reluctant to accept binding emissions targets. asking that richer nations take action first. many are undertaking efforts that have significantly reduced the growth of their own greenhouse gas emissions. In most cases. climate mitigation is not the goal. but rather an outgrowth of efforts driven by economic. security. or local environmental concerns. This study attempts to document the climate mitigation resulting from such efforts in six key countries (Brazil. China. India. Mexico. South Africa. and Turkey) and to inform policy-making aimed at further mitigation in these and other developing nations. The six countries examined here reflect significant regional. economic. demographic. and energy resource diversity. They include the world's two most populous nations. a major oil exporter. Africa's largest greenhouse gas emitter. and the country with the largest expanse of tropical forest. While their circumstances vary widely. these countries share common concerns that have motivated actions resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions growth. Primary among these concerns are economic growth. energy security. and improved air quality. The analysis presented here demonstrates that actions taken by these countries to achieve these and other goals have reduced the growth of their combined annual greenhouse gas emissions over the past three decades by nearly 300 million tons a year.

Using domestic coal mitigates national energy security risks. However coal use exacerbates global climate change. Under a strict climate change regime. coal use is projected to decline in future. However this would increase imports of energy sources like natural gas (NG) and nuclear and consequent energy security risks for India. The paper shows that carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) can mitigate CO2 emissions from coal-based large point source (LPS) clusters and therefore would play a key role in mitigating both energy security risks for India and global climate change risks.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol represent important steps in that direction. Yet whether or not the Protocol enters into force. the same fundamental challenge remains: engaging all countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases in a common long-term effort. We need a durable strategy that can take us beyond Kyoto. This Pew Center report looks at core issues in crafting such a strategy. It represents the combined efforts of a dozen authors plus extensive input from policymakers. experts. and stakeholders who commented on drafts or participated in workshops in China. Germany. and Mexico. The six “think pieces” in this volume do not draw definitive conclusions about the best way forward; those can come only through further analysis and dialogue. Yet there do emerge from the papers. and from the discussions around them. some common themes and insights. First is the realization that while the climate challenge is ultimately one of mobilizing technology. it is in the first instance one of mustering political will. This depends in part on the resourcefulness of governments in fashioning common approaches. It also means not allowing scientific and economic uncertainties to obscure the urgent need for action. Indeed the analyses here conclude that. to the contrary. uncertainty is itself a reason to act now. Second. there is no getting around national interest.

Approaches based on satellite indices of absorbed solar radiation indicate marked heterogeneity in NPP for both land and oceans. reflecting the influence of physical and ecological processes. The spatial and temporal distributions of ocean NPP are consistent with primary limitation by light. nutrients. and temperature. On land. water limitation imposes additional constraints.

Energy balance closure was evaluated by statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat (LE)) against available energy (net radiation. less the energy stored) and by solving for the energy balance ratio. the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy. These methods indicate a general lack of closure at most sites. with a mean imbalance in the order of 20%.

Extreme weather and climate events. interacting with exposed and vulnerable human and natural systems. can lead to disasters. Changes in the frequency and severity of the physical events affect disaster risk. but so do the spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulnerability. Some types of extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency or magnitude. but populations and assets at risk have also increased. with consequences for disaster risk. Opportunities for managing risks of weather-and climate-related disasters exist or can be developed at any scale. local to international. Prepared following strict IPCC procedures.

In PNL. available soil N becomes increasingly limiting as C and N are sequestered in long-lived plant biomass and soil organic matter.

1113638,The physical science basis,2007,IPCC Climate Change,1009,,,,Cambridge Univ. Press,This chapter addresses the biogeochemical cycles of carbon dioxide (CO2). methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The three greenhouse gases (GHGs) have increased in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times. and this increase is the main driving cause of climate change (Chapter 10). CO2. CH4 and N2O altogether amount to 80% of the total radiative forcing from well-mixed GHGs (Chapter 8). The increase of CO2. CH4 and N2O is caused by anthropogenic emissions from the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy and from land use and land use changes. in particular agriculture. The observed change in the atmospheric concentration of CO2. CH4 and N2O results from the dynamic balance between anthropogenic emissions. and the perturbation of natural processes that leads to a partial removal of these gases from the atmosphere. Natural processes are linked to physical conditions. chemical reactions and biological transformations and they respond themselves to perturbed atmospheric composition and climate change. Therefore. the physical climate system and the biogeochemical cycles of CO2. CH4 and N2O are coupled. This chapter addresses the present human-caused perturbation of the biogeochemical cycles of CO2. CH4 and N2O. their variations in the past coupled to climate variations and their projected evolution during this century under future scenarios.,True,WtWYW0MAAAAJ:KIRwYnRZzWQC,6673,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abha_Chhabra2/publication/271702872_Carbon_and_Other_Biogeochemical_Cycles/links/54cf9ce80cf24601c094a45e/Carbon-and-Other-Biogeochemical-Cycles.pdf,5513888212833643680,/scholar?cites=5513888212833643680,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abha_Chhabra2/publication/271702872_Carbon_and_Other_Biogeochemical_Cycles/links/54cf9ce80cf24601c094a45e/Carbon-and-Other-Biogeochemical-Cycles.pdf,0,0,0

These models are forced with concentrations of greenhouse gases and other constituents derived from various emissions scenarios ranging from non-mitigation scenarios to idealised long-term scenarios. In general. we assess non-mitigated projections of future climate change at scales from global to hundreds of kilometres. Further assessments of regional and local climate changes are provided in Chapter 11. Due to an unprecedented. joint effort by many modelling groups worldwide. climate change projections are now based on multi-model means. differences between models can be assessed quantitatively and in some instances. estimates of the probability of change of important climate system parameters complement expert judgement. New results corroborate those given in the Third Assessment Report (TAR). Continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates will cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.,True,WtWYW0MAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,6566,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20962171,8224041299897774106,/scholar?cites=8224041299897774106,,,0,0,0

Extreme weather and climate events. interacting with exposed and vulnerable human and natural systems. can lead to disasters. Changes in the frequency and severity of the physical events affect disaster risk. but so do the spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulnerability. Some types of extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency or magnitude. but populations and assets at risk have also increased. with consequences for disaster risk. Opportunities for managing risks of weather-and climate-related disasters exist or can be developed at any scale. local to international. Prepared following strict IPCC procedures. SREX is an invaluable assessment for anyone interested in climate extremes. environmental disasters. and adaptation to climate change. including policymakers. the private sector. and academic researchers.

Chapter 10 presents results for regional models which operate on smaller spatial scales. Climate change simulations are assessed for the period 1990 to 2100 and are based on a range of scenarios for projected changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and sulphate aerosol loadings (direct effect). A few Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) simulations include the effects of ozone and/or indirect effects of aerosols (see Table 9.1 for details). Most integrations1 do not include the less dominant or less well understood forcings such as land-use changes. mineral dust. black carbon. etc.(see Chapter 6). No AOGCM simulations include estimates of future changes in solar forcing or in volcanic aerosol concentrations.There are many more AOGCM projections of future climate available than was the case for the IPCC Second Assessment Report (IPCC. 1996)(hereafter SAR). We concentrate on the IS92a and draft SRES A2 and B2 scenarios. Some indication of uncertainty in the projections can be obtained by comparing the responses among models. The range and ensemble standard deviation are used as a measure of uncertainty in modelled response. The simulations are a combination of a forced climate change component together with internally generated natural variability.

The cryosphere is thus a fundamental control on the physical. biological and social environment over a large part of the Earth’s surface. Given that all of its components are inherently sensitive to temperature change over a wide range of time scales. the cryosphere is a natural integrator of climate variability and provides some of the most visible signatures of climate change. Since AR4. observational technology has improved and key time series of measurements have been lengthened. such that our identification and measurement of changes and trends in all components of the cryosphere has been substantially improved. and our understanding of the specific processes governing their responses has been refined. Since the AR4. observations show that there has been a continued net loss of ice from the cryosphere. although there are significant differences in the rate of loss between cryospheric components and regions.

But it remains difficult to assess the likelihood of future changes in the thermohaline circulation. mainly owing to poorly constrained model parameterizations and uncertainties in the response of the climate system to greenhouse warming. Analyses of past abrupt climate changes help to solve these problems. Data and models both suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to small changes in the hydrological cycle. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then transmitted globally through a number of feedbacks.

Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time. but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover. it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C. Antarctica. that provides a climate record for the past 740.000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles. the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period. between 740.000 and 430.000 years ago. was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica. but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430.000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases. but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long—28.000 years compared to. for example. the 12.000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today. our results may imply that without human intervention. a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.The climate of the last 500.000 years (500 kyr) was characterized by extremely strong 100-kyr cyclicity. as seen particularly in ice-core1 and marine-sediment2. 3 records.

Here we present an undisturbed climate record from a North Greenland ice core. which extends back to 123.000 years before the present. within the last interglacial period. The oxygen isotopes in the ice imply that climate was stable during the last interglacial period. with temperatures 5 8C warmer than today. We find unexpectedly large temperature differences between our new record from northern Greenland and the undisturbed sections of the cores from central Greenland. suggesting that the extent of ice in the Northern Hemisphere modulated the latitudinal temperature gradients in Greenland. This record shows a slow decline in temperatures that marked the initiation of the last glacial period. Our record reveals a hitherto unrecognized warm period initiated by an abrupt climate warming about 115.000 years ago. before glacial conditions were fully developed. This event does not appear to have an immediate Antarctic counterpart. suggesting that the climate see-saw between the hemispheres (which dominated the last glacial period) was not operating at this time.The two deep ice cores drilled at the beginning of the 1990s in central Greenland (GRIP1–3 and GISP24. 5. respectively 3.027 m and 3.053 m long) have played a key role in documenting rapid climate changes during the last glacial period.

Use of classical multidimensional scaling produces a low‐dimensional representation of the data for which Euclidean distances approximate the original dissimilarities. The resulting scores are then analysed using discriminant analysis. giving tests based on the canonical correlations. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics under permutations of the observations are shown to be invariant to changes in the distributions of the original variables. unlike the distributions of the multi‐response permutation test statistics which have been considered by other workers for testing differences among groups.

The method of Freedman & Lane (1983) is found to have asymptotic correlation 1 with the exact test. and the other methods are found to have smaller correlations with this test.

1113677,Re-contextualizing the notion of comfort,2008,Raymond J Cole and John Robinson and Zosia Brown and Meg O'shea,36,Building Research & Information,4,323-336,Routledge,To what extent can the urgency of climate change and an evolving concept of agency (at the individual and social levels of building users) create a new context for rethinking the notion of comfort? A new. emerging notion of comfort is explored that embraces engagement with new conditions. new experiences. and new types of interactions between inhabitants and building systems and unfamiliar technologies. The emphasis is on communication and dialogue as two dynamic and adaptive processes necessary to achieve optimal building performance while valuing and responding to inhabitant knowledge and agency. and enhancing indoor environmental quality from the standpoint of the inhabitants. A primary conclusion is that the goal of shifting into a lower carbon society has created a new context for comfort. from its conventional emphasis as automated. uniform and predictable. to a broader notion that takes into …,True,c-KeIAcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,248,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613210802076328,3351685558094712002,/scholar?cites=3351685558094712002,,,0,0,0

It is argued that. in most cases. we are asking the wrong questions when we forecast. To the degree that the future is not already determined but remains to be created. then the search for the most likely future is not only misguided (since we are usually wrong) but actually counterproductive. What are needed are backcasting techniques that reveal the possibility. and test the feasibility and impacts. of alternative futures. The focus thus shifts from prediction and likelihood to feasibility and choice.

Evidence increasingly supports the finding that this transformation is not triggered by climate policy alone. but rather is shaped by a broad array of decisions and practices that are rooted in underlying patterns of development. Even so. these findings have rarely penetrated the domain of practice. which often remains squarely focused on a relatively narrow set of climate-specific policies.

Given these interconnections. the lack of close integration of the sustainable development and climate change literatures is puzzling; part of the reason for this lack of connectivity may be the very different research and policy traditions out of which each field developed. This paper argues that integrating climate change and sustainable development approaches. concepts and methods may have some important benefits. To demonstrate this point. we briefly discuss recent developments in both the climate change and sustainable development fields and then turn to the question of how to integrate them.

Inc.,The field of Participatory Integrated Assessment (PIA) is still very young. having evolved from the broader field of Integrated Assessment (IA) in the mid to late 1990s. Like IA. PIA is a problem‐based field. with a focus on interdisciplinary research. Fundamental to PIA. however. is the assertion that the quality of decisions is improved by the direct involvement of stakeholders in the assessment process—particularly when those decisions pertain to complex. intractable problems. Climate change presents just such a problem. and it is in the domains of climate change and related sustainability issues where PIA has seen its broadest application.

However. its application faces challenges given the projected scale of climate-induced displacement and the difficulties of resettlement. We evaluate the drivers. barriers and outcomes of 27 recent cases of managed retreat that have resettled approximately 1.3 million people. A conceptual model based on two key factors—who benefits from retreat and who initiates it—organizes the diverse set of cases into four quadrants. Different sociopolitical dimensions emerge as particularly influential in each quadrant. The model establishes a foundation for understanding and anticipating case-specific complexities.

Estimates of aggregated impacts necessarily make assumptions on the relative importance of sectors. countries and periods; we propose to make these assumption explicit. We introduce a Gini coefficient for climate change impacts. which shows the distribution of impacts is very skewed in the near future and will deteriorate for more than a century before becoming more egalitarian. Vulnerability to climate change depends on more than per capita income alone. so that the geographical pattern of vulnerability is complex. and the relationship between vulnerability and development non-linear and non-monotonous.,True,q8ikdkgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,303,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378004000421,3489407813900855230,/scholar?cites=3489407813900855230,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.175.5563&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

However. many countries are not in this position. and there is a growing group of humanity which is not benefiting from the apparent global adaptive trends. Worst case scenarios reinforce the impact of this uneven distribution of adaptive capacity. both between and within countries.

This paper investigates local adaptation strategies to climate variability. focusing on agricultural decision‐making in a communal irrigation scheme in Vhembe District. Limpopo Province. South Africa. Research done through interviews. surveys and participatory methods demonstrates that adaptation strategies within a community are socially differentiated and present differing objectives and priorities. These results highlight the need for intervention and policy that support a heterogeneous response to a wide range of stresses. Evidence for climate change is clear and the need for adaptation is urgent.

This has led to substantial efforts to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions and thereby mitigate the impacts of climate change on a global scale. Despite these efforts. we are committed to substantial further changes over at least the next few decades. Societies will therefore have to adapt to changes in climate. Both adaptation and mitigation require action on scales ranging from local to global. but adaptation could directly benefit from climate predictions on regional scales while mitigation could be driven solely by awareness of the global problem; regional projections being principally of motivational value. We discuss how recent developments of large ensembles of climate model simulations can be interpreted to provide information on these scales and to inform societal decisions.

Where this information is not presently used it is difficult to evaluate the impact it might have. In order to justify disseminating the information to marginal groups it is important that the potential impact of the forecast is explored so that the negative and positive effects are at least partially appreciated before use of the information is widely promoted. We use an agent-based social simulation model. based on empirical evidence from field work in Lesotho. to assess the impact of using seasonal forecasts among smallholder farmers.

With climate change high up on the political and corporate agenda. carbon footprint calculations are in demand. Numerous approaches have been proposed to provide estimates. ranging from basic online calculators to sophisticated life-cycle-analysis or input-output based methods and tools. Despite its ubiquitous use however. there is an apparent lack of academic definitions of what exactly a'carbon footprint'is meant to be. The scientific literature is surprisingly void of clarifications. despite the fact that countless studies in energy and ecological economics that could have claimed to measure a'carbon footprint'have been published over decades. This commentary explores the apparent discrepancy between public and academic use of the term'carbon footprint'and suggests a scientific definition based on commonly accepted accounting principles and modelling approaches.

From 1990 to 2008 CO2 emissions in developed countries (defined as countries with emission-reduction commitments in the Kyoto Protocol. Annex B) have stabilized. but emissions in developing countries (non-Annex B) have doubled. Some studies suggest that the stabilization of emissions in developed countries was partially because of growing imports from developing countries. To quantify the growth in emission transfers via international trade. we developed a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008.

More than 70% of this increase occurred between 2002 and 2007. While growing export demand contributed more than 50% to the CO2 emission growth between 2002 and 2005. capital investments have been responsible for 61% of emission growth in China between 2005 and 2007. We use structural decomposition analysis to identify the drivers for China’s emission growth between 1992 and 2007. with special focus on the period 2002 to 2007 when growth was most rapid. In contrast to previous analysis. we find that efficiency improvements have largely offset additional CO2 emissions from increased final consumption between 2002 and 2007.

Unlike many other developed countries. it has already met its Kyoto obligations and defined ambitious. legally binding targets for the future. Recently this achievement has been called into question as it ignores rapidly changing patterns of production and international trade. We use structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to investigate the drivers behind annual changes in CO2 emission from consumption in the UK between 1992 and 2004. In contrast with previous SDA-based studies. we apply the decomposition to a global. multiregional input−output model (MRIO). which accounts for UK imports from all regions and uses region-specific production structures and CO2 intensities.

1113764,Climate policies for road transport revisited (I): Evaluation of the current framework,2011,Felix Creutzig and Emily McGlynn and Jan Minx and Ottmar Edenhofer,39,Energy policy,5,2396-2406,Elsevier,The global rise of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and its potentially devastating consequences require a comprehensive regulatory framework for reducing emissions. including those from the transport sector. Alternative fuels and technologies have been promoted as a means for reducing the carbon intensity of the transport sector. However. the overall transport policy framework in major world economies is geared towards the use of conventional fossil fuels. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of current climate policies for road transport that (1) target fuel producers and/or car manufacturers. and (2) influence use of alternative fuels and technologies.

1113765,Distributional effects of climate change taxation: the case of the UK,2010,Kuishuang Feng and Klaus Hubacek and Dabo Guan and Monica Contestabile and Jan Minx and John Barrett,44,,10,3670-3676,American Chemical Society,Current economic instruments aimed at climate change mitigation focus mainly on CO2 emissions. but efficient climate mitigation needs to focus on other greenhouse gases as well as CO2. This study investigates the distributional effects of climate change taxes on households belonging to different income and lifestyle groups; and it compares the effects of a CO2 tax with a multiple GHG tax in the UK in terms of cost efficiency and distributional effects.Results show that a multi GHG tax is more efficient than a CO2 tax due to lower marginal abatement costs. and that both taxes are regressive. with lower income households paying a relatively larger share of their income for the taxes than higher income households. A shift from a CO2 tax to a GHG tax will reduce and shift the tax burden between consumption categories such as from energy-intensive products to food products.

1113770,Understanding policy change: Multiple streams and emissions trading in Germany,2008,Steffen Brunner,18,Global Environmental Change,3,501-507,Pergamon,This paper employs John Kingdon's [1984. Agendas. Alternatives and Public Policies. Little Brown. Boston] “multiple streams” framework to analyse the sudden move from overgenerous grandfathering to tight caps and auctioning within the German emissions trading regime in the first half of 2007. By bringing together empirical evidence from interviews and official documents the following question is addressed: how completely does Kingdon's framework explain this political turn? The opening of a “policy window” can be demonstrated and Kingdon's theory concisely captures important aspects of this process. At the same time. however. the findings imply that a number of relevant factors are not sufficiently considered by the theory. most notably the influence of multi-level governance structures. learning processes. and networks. This demonstrates that the multiple streams approach on its own is not sufficient to fully …,True,iQUjGKUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,149,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008000459,717071199575697077,/scholar?cites=717071199575697077,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.491.2710&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Investors favour long-term predictability of the policy. but without any external enforcement mechanisms a commitment made by a government can be withdrawn. leading to scepticism and lack of credibility. This results in increased market risks and investment hold-up. Regulatory uncertainty stems from (i) strategic interactions between government and firms. (ii) potential learning about climate damage and abatement cost and (iii) political volatility. Although commitment to future policy encourages private investment. it also imposes costs in the form of reduced flexibility to accommodate new information or preferences. The article reviews devices that may help policy makers raise the level of commitment while also leaving some room for flexible adjustments.

Market-based instruments such as cap-and-trade systems close this policy gap and complement traditional policies that are required where specific market failures arise. Even in presence of strong existing non-market policies. cap-and-trade delivers additional abatement and efficiency by incentivizing demand side abatement options. This paper analyzes generic design options and economic impacts of including the European road transport sector into the EU ETS. Suitable points of regulation are up- and midstream in the fuel chain to ensure effectiveness (cover all emissions and avoid double-counting). efficiency (incentivize all abatement options) and low transaction costs.

Taking uncertainty into account. it is shown within the framework of a sequential game between firms and a regulator that commitment to an emission abatement target fails to achieve the first best optimal outcome. Though commitment to a future policy reduces the risk of time-inconsistency. it imposes costs in the form of reduced flexibility to respond to new information. If. however. the regulator commits to an adjustment rule that sets the abatement level contingent on the realization of the uncertain parameter. the first best optimal outcome can be obtained.,True,iQUjGKUAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,23,http://www.mcc-berlin.net/uploads/media/Jakob_Optimal_Commitment_under_Uncertainty-Vol4-No3-SBE-0047.pdf,8163118305380460981,/scholar?cites=8163118305380460981,,http://www.mcc-berlin.net/uploads/media/Jakob_Optimal_Commitment_under_Uncertainty-Vol4-No3-SBE-0047.pdf,0,0,0

Donor governments usually try to minimize such risks by delegating the provision of climate finance to bilateral and multilateral organizations that implement and monitor projects in recipient countries. Such direct interventions generate an alternative set of transaction costs through the fragmentation of finance flows and proliferation of funding organizations that can put an additional burden on recipient institutions. Moreover. long delegation chains between initial donors and targeted beneficiaries trigger a cascade of principal-agent problems.

After having failed to introduce a union-wide carbon tax during the 1990s. the European Commission presented a green paper in 2000 that proposed the use of emissions trading. Launched in January 2005. the EU ETS established a uniform carbon price for specific heavy-industry activities in all EU member states. It covers CO2 emissions from over 10.000 installations. including power and heat generators. oil refineries and factories for ferrous metals. cement. lime. glass and ceramic materials. and pulp and paper. Together. the covered sources account for roughly 40 per cent of total EU GHG emissions.This chapter reviews the characteristics and experience of domestic emissions trading as an instrument of climate policy.

1113787,Climate policy. the state. and the problem of credible commitment,2013,Steffen Brunner,,,,,,This thesis explores the regulatory uncertainty that originates from the problem of credible commitment in climate policy. The state defines and transacts property rights in an environment where third-party enforcement. the possibility to have contracts enforced by an independent authority. is infeasible. In such a setting. the ability to credibly commit to the maintenance of established rights is essential if one wants to encourage other actors to cooperate. The thesis consists of four independent publications and an introductory and a concluding chapter to address these points. Chapter 1 presents research context and questions and the thesis’ conceptual framework. Chapter 2 reviews design elements for domestic cap-and-trade systems and finds that regulatory uncertainty is an important source of investment hold-up and risk in carbon markets. Chapter 3 explores three sources of regulatory uncertainty: strategic interaction between the state and regulated firms. uncertainty over the costs of climate change damages and emissions abatement. and changing political preferences. The social benefit of commitment to long-term climate policy varies depending on the source of regulatory uncertainty. The chapter also qualitatively compares different commitment devices the state could use to reduce regulatory uncertainty. Chapter 4 presents a formalisation of one commitment device. the adjustment rule. in a game theoretic context and assesses its social benefit in comparison to commitment to a fixed policy target. Chapter 5 explores the drivers and forms of transaction costs in international climate finance. It shows how transaction costs in state-to-state …,True,iQUjGKUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://www.depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/3987,,,,https://www.depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/3987/2/brunner_steffen.pdf,0,0,0

The potential of imaging spectroscopy for Earth remote sensing has been demonstrated since the 1980s. However. most of the developments and applications in imaging spectroscopy have largely relied on airborne spectrometers. as the amount and quality of space-based imaging spectroscopy data remain relatively low to date. The upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) German imaging spectroscopy mission is intended to fill this gap. An overview of the main characteristics and current status of the mission is provided in this contribution. The core payload of EnMAP consists of a dual-spectrometer instrument measuring in the optical spectral range between 420 and 2450 nm with a spectral sampling distance varying between 5 and 12 nm and a reference signal-to-noise ratio of 400: 1 in the visible and near-infrared and 180: 1 in the shortwave-infrared parts of the spectrum. EnMAP images will cover a 30 km-wide area in the across-track direction with a ground sampling distance of 30 m. An across-track tilted observation capability will enable a target revisit time of up to four days at the Equator and better at high latitudes. EnMAP will contribute to the development and exploitation of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy applications by making high-quality data freely available to scientific users worldwide.

1113811,Modeling and mapping of soil salinity with reflectance spectroscopy and landsat data using two quantitative methods (PLSR and MARS),2014,Said Nawar and Henning Buddenbaum and Joachim Hill and Jacek Kozak,6,Remote Sensing,11,10813-10834,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The monitoring of soil salinity levels is necessary for the prevention and mitigation of land degradation in arid environments. To assess the potential of remote sensing in estimating and mapping soil salinity in the El-Tina Plain. Sinai. Egypt. two predictive models were constructed based on the measured soil electrical conductivity (EC e) and laboratory soil reflectance spectra resampled to Landsat sensor’s resolution. The models used were partial least squares regression (PLSR) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The results indicated that a good prediction of the soil salinity can be made based on the MARS model (R 2= 0.73. RMSE= 6.53. and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD)= 1.96). which performed better than the PLSR model (R 2= 0.70. RMSE= 6.95. and RPD= 1.82). The models were subsequently applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis to the reflectance values derived from two Landsat images (2006 and 2012) to generate quantitative maps of the soil salinity. The resulting maps were validated successfully for 37 and 26 sampling points for 2006 and 2012. respectively. with R 2= 0.72 and 0.74 for 2006 and 2012. respectively. for the MARS model. and R 2= 0.71 and 0.73 for 2006 and 2012. respectively. for the PLSR model. The results indicated that MARS is a more suitable technique than PLSR for the estimation and mapping of soil salinity. especially in areas with high levels of salinity. The method developed in this paper can be used for other satellite data. like those provided by Landsat 8. and can be applied in other arid and semi-arid environments.

1113812,A local correlation approach for the fusion of remote sensing data with different spatial resolutions in forestry applications,1999,J Hill and C Diemer and O Stöver and Th Udelhoven,32,International Archives of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,Part 7,4-3,,Until now. satellite data are only of limited use to Mid-European forest management. A major limitation is the low spatial resolution of the commonly available satellite sensors. In this paper. we present a specific data fusion approach (local correlation modelling) which can be used to produce multispectral images with high spatial resolution based on panchromatic reference channels. Such data are provided by operational satellite systems (SPOT. IRS-1D. Landsat 7). and their availability may further increase with the advent of new commercial satellite systems. Airborne experimental data were used to assess the quality of the modelling approach discussed in this contribution. compared to traditionally used fusion algorithms (eg Brovey. IHS. PCA. filter techniques). Our validation results indicate that local correlation modelling (LCM) performs in all channels significantly better. because the introduced texture is locally adjusted to the conditions of each channel. Local contrast differences between a (degraded) panchromatic band and multispectral channels are adaptively modelled into the fusion result. even if the local relation between the datasets exhibits an inverse contrast polarity.,True,Lm4DoLQAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,93,https://www.academia.edu/download/10251721/10.1.1.27.5255.pdf,1786761696104572981,/scholar?cites=1786761696104572981,,https://www.academia.edu/download/10251721/10.1.1.27.5255.pdf,0,0,0

This new concept now dominates current discussions in agricultural development because of its capacity to unite the agendas of the agriculture. development and climate change communities under one brand. In this opinion piece authored by scientists from a variety of international agricultural and climate research communities. we argue that the concept needs to be evaluated critically because the relationship between the three dimensions is poorly understood. such that practically any improved agricultural practice can be considered climate-smart. This lack of clarity may have contributed to the broad appeal of the concept. From the understanding that we must hold ourselves accountable to demonstrably better meet human needs in the short and long term within foreseeable local and planetary limits. we develop a conceptualization of climate-smart agriculture as agriculture that can be shown to bring us closer to safe operating spaces for agricultural and food systems across spatial and temporal scales. Improvements in the management of agricultural systems that bring us significantly closer to safe operating spaces will require transformations in governance and use of our natural resources. underpinned by enabling political. social and economic conditions beyond incremental changes.

This paper presents the climate-smart village (CSV) approach as a means of performing agricultural research for development that robustly tests technological and institutional options for dealing with climatic variability and climate change in agriculture using participatory methods. It aims to scale up and scale out the appropriate options and draw out lessons for policy makers from local to global levels. The approach incorporates evaluation of climate-smart technologies. practices. services. and processes relevant to local climatic risk management and identifies opportunities for maximizing adaptation gains from synergies across different interventions and recognizing potential maladaptation and trade-offs. It ensures that these are aligned with local knowledge and link into development plans. This paper describes early results in Asia. Africa. and Latin America to illustrate different examples of the CSV approach in diverse agroecological settings. Results from initial studies indicate that the CSV approach has a high potential for scaling out promising climate-smart agricultural technologies. practices. and services.

This paper was synthesized from several scholarly literature and aimed at providing up-to-date information on climate change impacts. adaptation strategies. policies and institutional mechanisms that each agriculture subsector had put in place in dealing with climate change and its related issues in West Africa. For each subsector (crop. fishery and livestock). the current status. climate change impacts. mitigation and adaption strategies have been analyzed. In addition. we reviewed recent policy initiatives in the region that foster the development and adoption of climate-smart agricultural options to improve resilience of farming systems and livelihoods of smallholder farmers to climate change risks.

1113849,Competing claims: human rights and climate harms,2010,Stephen Humphreys,,Human rights and climate change,,37-68,Cambridge University Press,To speak of climate change and human rights in the same breath is not merely to draw a connection between the activities that generate global warming and the subsequent deterioration of many human rights-a connection that is self-evident even if relatively unexplored (see my Introduction to this volume). It is also to juxtapose two very different bodies of professional expertise and spheres of international law. which comprise two disciplines or discourses. or ways of thinking and speaking about society and government and the place of the individual. about public and private obligations. responsibilities and solutions-and. indeed. about international cooperation and obligation. In the following overview of the relation between human rights and climate change. I begin by taking a wide-angle view of the justice questions that climate change raises. and then look at some of the ways in which the existing human rights regime and nascent climate regime treat them. in order to identify common themes and compatibilities between two regimes whose mutual disregard to date offers a good example of a phenomenon that has been called the ‘fragmentation of international law’. 1 That contact between these two disciplines has been largely absent to date is on its face surprising. Quite aside from the human rights implications of climate change. these are two areas of activity. whose recent evolution is contemporaneous. each accelerating around the end of the,True,oQXDGWMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,20,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=I8ZvBCmrEpwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA37&dq=info:TVu-Ntzd83MJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MlVZC7HoHR&sig=MhtTDu2-y4Q2cCSQ-Qs6HEs1MuY,8355265671583390541,/scholar?cites=8355265671583390541,,,0,0,0

1113851,Climate justice: the claim of the past,2014,Stephen Humphreys,5,Journal of Human Rights and the Environment,,134-148,Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd,This synthetic appraisal of the collection of papers in this issue argues that historical injustice saturates the problem of climate change. Those most vulnerable to climate change today are largely those who already lack resources–who have been on the wrong end of colonial history. or who have been globalization’s losers. or who have suffered neglect. exclusion or simple rapacity at the hands of their own governments. They are those who have benefitted little or not at all from a carbon-intensive global economy. but who have long suffered its side effects–resource stripping. food price spikes. impoverishment and now the ravages of climate change. Following the other authors in this issue–and examining human rights law. trade law and the overarching ideal of the rule of law–the paper notes that the particular form taken by law in international and transnational affairs. having largely followed the historical progress …,True,oQXDGWMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,16,https://www.elgaronline.com/downloadpdf/journals/jhre/5-0/jhre.2014.02.09.pdf,289097127117534679,/scholar?cites=289097127117534679,,https://www.lse.ac.uk/law/people/academic-staff/stephen-humphreys/Documents/humphreys1.pdf,0,0,0

Yet. despite many points of contiguity between past and present legal interventions. the charge is overbroad and rarely illuminating. This article attempts to move beyond polemic to track concrete historical and structural forerunners of today's rule of law work. Focusing mainly (though not exclusively) on late imperial British endeavours. it traces colonial legal interventions over time. the techniques adopted (and rejected). the shifting normative bases of legitimacy. and moments of strategic recalibration in the face of resistance. Three broad attitudes towards law across the period are (provisionally) characterised as ‘regulative’. ‘constitutive’ and ‘institutive’ moments.

1113856,Conceiving justice: articulating common causes in distinct regimes,2010,Stephen Humphreys,,Human Rights and Climate Change,,299-319,Cambridge University Press,It is often said that climate change confronts the present generation with a challenge greater than any previous. If so. the global nature of the challenge is perhaps timely. in that it comes at a time when the ‘present generation’might itself be thought of. really for the ﬁrst time. as ‘global’. But if several decades of the phenomenon still generally called ‘globalisation’have helped to create a global audience for this global challenge. it is far less clear that this same event has provided the ‘global’public policy tools with which the challenge can be managed. Certainly. the ‘promotion’of human rights and the rule of law around the world in recent decades has not aimed at. or led to. the empowerment of governments to address pressing social and economic rights; if anything the reverse has been the case. Insofar as development policy has concerned itself with law and rights. the emphasis has been ﬁrmly on economic freedomsproperty rights. contract. investors’ rights. banking and commercial law-and judicial enforcement. There has been some attention to civil and political rights. notably gender equality and press freedom. but relatively little to rights to food. water. health. shelter and so on. At the same time. there is an at least plausible case-perhaps best presented in the writing of Thomas Pogge-that the persistence and exacerbation of global poverty over recent decades is itself a human rights violation. largely sustained by international actors and systematised through international law. 1 In this chapter.

From the late 1980s to the present day business actors have mobilised themselves effectively to shape national. regional and international policy on climate change.

It also argues that the recent increase in states of emergency is complemented by an expansive legalism. First. the paper reviews Giorgio Agamben's description of legal expansion through states of emergency (or ‘exception’) dictated by a language of fear. Second. in a philological inquiry. it accompanies the ‘founding father’ of the rule of law. Aristotle. in his discussion of law's sovereignty. The core question posed by Aristotle— regarding the inquiry into the ideal relationship between law and its administration—remains unresolved in his Politics.

First. data as ‘thing’ must be distinguished from data as ‘medium’. Second. bits make everything countable. Third. with digitalisation. there is no avoiding manipulation—there is no ‘authentic’ original: the technology has no unmediated state. Bits turn out to be an extraordinarily versatile referential technology. whose very ease of creation. storage. and reproducibility encourages proliferation while blurring the distinction between things (‘objects’) and facts (‘knowledge’).

1113866,Das Theater des Rechtsstaates,2016,Stephen Humphreys,32,PERIPHERIE–Politik• Ökonomie• Kultur,125,,,The promotion of the rule of law has become a multi-billion dollar industry and a mainstay of contemporary development policy. A close examination of the now extensive body of literature that has been generated in and around this work reveals an elaborate worldview consistently embedded and insistently reproduced through project activities–for example. that aim to „modernise “judiciaries.„update “laws and eliminate corruption–as well as through the relations between host states. non-governmental organizations and global congeries of financing institutions and investment mechanisms. In this paper I characterise rule of law promotion as a form of theatre: the staging of a certain morality tale about the good life. Rule of law promoters do not attempt to demonstrate the rightness of their propositions through empirical evidence (there is little). nor through reasoned argument (it is not open for debate). nor through historical analogies (there are none). Rather. the field bases its appeal on the force of repeated narratives involving the reproduction of a set of immutable themes (eg governance. corruption. privatisation. transparency. accountability. impunity. and judicial independence) that incorporate a recurrent group of morally-tagged actors (eg civil society. the judiciary.„the poor “. public officials. and „reform-minded constituencies “).

The RCP8. 5 combines assumptions about high population and relatively slow income growth with modest rates of technological change and energy intensity improvements. leading in the long term to high energy demand and GHG emissions in absence of climate change policies. Compared to the total set of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCP8. 5 thus corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. Using the IIASA Integrated Assessment Framework and the MESSAGE model for the development of the RCP8. 5. we focus in this paper on two important extensions compared to earlier scenarios: 1) the development of spatially explicit air pollution projections. and 2) enhancements in the land-use and land-cover change projections.

To accomplish this. countries have submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their post-2020 climate action. Here we assess the effect of current INDCs on reducing aggregate greenhouse gas emissions. its implications for achieving the temperature objective of the Paris climate agreement. and potential options for overachievement. The INDCs collectively lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to where current policies stand. but still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound. for each region and sector. is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate. ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone. carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However. stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however. the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured.

Therefore. many countries advocate limiting warming to below 1.5 C. Here we analyse integrated energy–economy–environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5 C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios. energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2 C-consistent scenarios. but show a faster scale-up of mitigation action in most sectors. leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a 2 C-to a 1.5 C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO 2. This implies an earlier transition to net zero carbon emissions worldwide. to be achieved between 2045 and 2060.

In particular. we find that tropospheric ozone is projected to decrease (RCP2.6. RCP4.5 and RCP6) or increase (RCP8.5) between 2000 and 2100. with variations in methane a strong contributor to this spread.

The matrix architecture facilitates addressing key questions related to current climate research and policy-making: identifying the effectiveness of different adaptation and mitigation strategies (in terms of their costs. risks and other consequences) and the possible trade-offs and synergies.

Historically. the most common approach to integrated assessment has been the attempt by individual researchers or research teams to integrate the information available from the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished via informed qualitative linkages. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of component models based on mathematical representations of information from the various contributing disciplines. This approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the assumptions input to the various components of the models. but may tend to constrain the type of information that can be used to what is explicitly represented in the model. IAMs can be divided into two broad classes: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. Policy optimization models optimize key policy control variables such as carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes. given formulated policy goals (eg. maximizing welfare or minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concentration target).

Several parameters such as the wall thickness. Young’s modulus. nanotubes’ volume fraction and chiral vectors of the nanotubes were considered in the study. According to the analytical results. it was found that the maximum shear stress. at the bond interface between the nanotubes and matrix. increases with increasing the nanotubes’ wall thickness of nanotube/polymer composites.

The accuracy of the strain measured by using the FBG sensor is highly dependent on the bonding characteristics among the bare optical fibre. protective coating. adhesive layer and host material. In general. the signal extracted from the embedded FBG sensor should reflect the straining condition of the host structure. However. due to the existence of an adhesive layer and protective coating. part of the energy would convert into shear deformation. Therefore. the mechanical properties of these materials would affect the resultant strain measured by embedding a FBG sensor into the structure.

Most research has been recently conducted to study the properties of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Special attention has been paid to the measurement and modeling of tensile modulus. tensile strength. and torsional stiffness. Theoretical approaches such as molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. finite element analysis. and classical elastic shell theory were frequently used to analyze and interpret the mechanical features of carbon nanotubes. Due to the use of different fundamental assumptions and boundary conditions. inconsistent results were reported.

OPV devices were then fabricated with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT-GO/Al structure. Devices containing GO exhibited an increase in short-circuit current (Isc) and conductivity but a decrease in open circuit potential (Voc).

1114136,Enhancement of adsorbed dye monolayer fluorescence by a silver nanoparticle overlayer,2006,Shanlin Pan and Zhenjia Wang and Lewis J Rothberg,110,The Journal of Physical Chemistry B,35,17383-17387,American Chemical Society,Deposition of silver nanoparticles directly onto a Rhodamine Red monolayer covalently bound to glass is found to increase the photoluminescence by as much as 20 times depending on excitation wavelength and nanoparticle density. At the same time. the excited state lifetime is reduced by more than a factor of 2. the fluorescence spectrum is blue-shifted. and greater polarization anisotropy in the emission is observed. We attribute these effects to local enhancement of the optical fields near the molecules by interactions with silver plasmons. We approximately separate the relative contributions of increased absorption and increased emissive rate to the observed enhancement of fluorescence. A study of the spatial inhomogeneity of the effect using scanning confocal microscopy demonstrates that average enhancements at least twice as large are possible. ,True,II85Jd8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,75,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp063191m,15717720323861288659,/scholar?cites=15717720323861288659,,,0,0,0

1114178,The corrosion behaviour of commercial purity titanium processed by high-pressure torsion,2014,Mengyan Nie and Chuan Ting Wang and Minghong Qu and Nong Gao and Julian A Wharton and Terence G Langdon,49,Journal of Materials Science,7,2824-2831,Springer US,Commercial purity (CP) titanium was processed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) under an applied pressure of 6.0 GPa for different numbers of torsional revolutions and then exposed to a 3.5 % NaCl solution for open-circuit potential measurements followed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization tests. The electrochemical results exhibit a complicated relationship between the corrosion resistance and grain refinement. Thus. microhardness measurements reveal an improvement in hardness for CP titanium after processing by HPT but the corrosion resistance is lower in the NaCl solution than for the annealed coarse-grained Ti. It is shown that the corrosion susceptibility of the HPT-processed samples decreases with increasing torsional strain. The effect of grain size and microstructure on the corrosion properties of ultrafine-grained CP Ti is also examined.,True,kM_Zl6cAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,74,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-013-7988-z,10936859293629795451,/scholar?cites=10936859293629795451,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mengyan-Nie/publication/259635126_The_corrosion_behaviour_of_commercial_purity_titanium_processed_by_high-pressure_torsion/links/561bc63008aea80367242e57/The-corrosion-behaviour-of-commercial-purity-titanium-processed-by-high-pressure-torsion.pdf,0,0,0

Significantly. the resulting depth of the vacuum cavity of the sensor is determined by the thickness of the silicon substrate at which Si is removed by the anisotropic wet etching process. Compared with the sensor based on a sacrificial layer technique. the proposed MEMS thermal shear-stress sensor exhibits dramatically improved sensitivity due to the much larger vacuum cavity depth. The fabricated MEMS thermal shear-stress sensor with a vacuum cavity depth as large as 525 μm and a vacuum of 5 × 10−2 Pa exhibits a sensitivity of 184.5 mV/Pa and a response time of 180 μs.

The resulting In2O3-sensitizing ZnO nanorod arrays not only exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical activity for water splitting under visible-light irradiation. but also possessed anti-photocorrosion property. The photo-induced charge-transfer property of In2O3 could be improved greatly by coupling with ZnO. This observation demonstrated that the heterojunction at the interface between In2O3 and ZnO could efficiently reduce the recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs and increase the lifetime of charge carriers and therefore enhance the photo-to-current efficiency of the In2O3–ZnO nanocrystalline arrays.

Mobility in a well-defined porous medium was evaluated for eight particulate products of nanochemistry to assess their potential for migration in porous media such as groundwater aquifers and water treatment plant filters.

In the first technique. used to produce colloidal materials in several recent toxicity and transport studies. an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) is used to dissolve the C60 before mixing with water. The second technique is more indicative of conditions that might occur in natural aquatic systems. Both types of n-C60 were observed to be negatively charged under a variety of solution chemistries; however. the n-C60 formed using THF was more strongly charged.

The morphology of the silica varies between semi-ordered uniform spheres to low porosity agglomerates. with the choice and concentration of the surfactants. The agglomerate structures depend on the charge of the surfactant (and hence the retention of micelles under acidic LPD conditions and/or the ionic character of the surfactant solution). the critical micelle concentration (as compared to the concentration of the silica precursor). and the ionic strength of the solution. The application of surfactant micelles as templates for LPD silica is counter to a previous proposal that suggested the ionic strength of the silicate solution would cause the collapse of the ionic vesicles.

Unlike the coating of single walled carbon nanotubes. the addition of a surfactant to “solubilize” the VGCFs results in an extremely non-uniform coating consisting of spherical silica aggregated around the tubes. As was observed for fullerenes. hydroxylation of the surface of the VGCF appears to be key to the formation of a uniform silica coating. Irrespective of the type of VGCF. heating a suspension of VGCFs in nitric acid to dryness (Type II) gave us the best results in terms of silica growth around the VGCF and there is a correlation between the percent of hydroxyls present on the VGCF surface and on the type of growth that occurs on the VGCF.

1114272,Liquid phase deposition of silica: Thin films. colloids and fullerenes,2004,Elizabeth A Whitsitt,,,,,,"Little research has been done to explore liquid phase deposition (LPD) of silica on non-planar substrates. This thesis proves that the seeded growth of silica colloids from fullerene and surfactant micelles is possible via LPD. as is the coating of individual single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and carbon fibers. Working on the premise that a molecular growth mechanism (versus colloidal/gel deposition) is valid for LPD. nanostructured substrates and specific chemical functional groups should act as ""seeds."" or templates. for silica growth. Seeded growth is confirmed by reactions of the growth solution with a range of surfactants and with materials with distinctive surface moieties. LPD promises lower production costs and environmental impact as compared to present methods of coating technology. because it is an inherently simple process. using low temperatures and inexpensive air-stable reactants. Silica is ubiquitous in materials science. Its applications range from thixotropic additives for paint to gate dielectrics in the semiconductor industry. Nano-structured coatings and thin films are integral in today's electronics industry and will become more vital as the size of electronics shrinks. With the incorporation of nanoparticles in future devices. the ability to deposit quality coatings with finely tuned properties becomes paramount. The methods developed herein have applications in fabricating insulators for use in the future molecular scale electronics industry.

As prepared FeMoC is contaminated with the Keplerate cage without the Keggin template however. extraction of pure FeMoC may be accomplished by Soxhlet extraction with EtOH. The resulting EtOH solvate is consistent with the replacement of the water ligands coordinated to Fe being substituted by EtOH. FeMoC-EtOH has been characterized by IR. UV-vis spectroscopy. MS. XPS and 31P NMR. The solid state 31P NMR spectrum for FeMoC-EtOH suggests little effect of the paramagnetic Fe3 centers in the Keplerate cage on the Keggin ions phosphorous. The high chemical shift anisotropy. and calculated T1 and T2 values are consistent with a weak magnetic interaction between the Keggin ions phosphorus symmetrically located within the Keplerate cage. Increasing the FeCl2 concentration and decreasing the pH of the reaction mixture optimizes the yield of FeMoC. The solubility and stability of FeMoC in H2O and MeOHH20 is investigated.Descriptors:,True,phfVz-YAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA461489,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA461489.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we show that uniform deposition of nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions can be attained easily by drying the droplet in an ethanol vapor atmosphere. This technique allows the particle-laden water droplets to spread on a variety of surfaces such as glass. silicon. mica. PDMS. and even Teflon. Visualization of droplet shape and internal flow shows initial droplet spreading and strong recirculating flow during spreading and shrinkage. The initial spreading is due to a diminishing contact angle from the absorption of ethanol from the vapor at the contact line. During the drying phase. the vapor is saturated in ethanol. leading to preferential evaporation of water at the contact line.

Plata,,Carbon,,,,Despite extensive academic and commercial development. a comprehensive understanding of the principles necessary for high-yield production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is lacking. whether in oriented films. bulk powders. or other forms. In chemical vapor deposition growth of CNT films on substrates. trace contaminants of carbon. such as deposits on the reactor tube walls. are known to cause inconsistency in key production metrics. including CNT density and alignment. In this study. we show that trace exposure of the catalyst to carbon during initial heating of the catalyst film is a critical determinant of CNT yield. and this carbon exposure accelerates catalyst nanoparticle formation via film dewetting and increases the probability of CNT nucleation and the resultant density of the CNT population. By controlled exposure of the catalyst to a trace amount of carbon. we show up to a 4-fold increase in bulk mass …,True,SWnpJ5gAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622319306591,1641519674950464291,/scholar?cites=1641519674950464291,,https://www.osti.gov/pages/servlets/purl/1581239,0,0,0

Black plastic is one of the greatest contributors to landfill waste. because it cannot be sorted using industrial practices based on optical reflection. However. it can be readily upcycled into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a novel liquid injection reactor (LIR) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. In this work. CNTs were formed using black and white polystyrene plastics to demonstrate that off-the-shelf materials can be used as feedstock for growth of CNTs. Scanning electron microscopy analysis suggests the CNTs from plastic sources improve diameter distribution homogeneity. with slightly increased diameters compared with control samples. Slight improvements in quality. as determined by Raman spectroscopy of the D and G peaks. suggest that plastics could lead to increased quality of CNTs. A small device was constructed as a demonstrator model to increase impact and public engagement.

Modification of electrodeposited copper foam with poly(acrylamide) leads to a significant enhancement in faradaic efficiency for ethylene from 13% (unmodified foam) to 26% at −0.96 V vs RHE. whereas methane yield is unaffected. Effects from crystalline phase distribution and copper oxide phases are ruled out as the source of enhancement through XPS and in situ XRD analysis. DFT calculations reveal that poly(acrylamide) adsorbs on the copper surface via the oxygen atom on the carbonyl groups and enhances ethylene formation by (i) charge donation to the copper surface that activates CO for dimerization.

A limiting factor to this rate is proposed to be the surface area available for the rapid contact between amine functional groups of PEI and CO2. Increasing the surface area by spray-drying a solution of reagents is proposed as a route to larger surface area products. In this work we investigate process changes to control absorption chemistry. Reagent solutions were spray-dried in different experimental conditions of concentration. drying temperature. and feed pressure. The results indicate that the rate of CO2 absorption at room temperature can be improved by a factor of 2.5 times by spray drying the product when compared to the product obtained using sonication.

Many new and improved CO 2 conversion catalysts have been developed in recent years. progressively achieving better performance. However. within this flourishing field. a disconnect in catalyst performance evaluation has emerged as the Achilles heel of CO 2 electrolysis. Too often. catalysts are assessed in electrochemical settings that are far removed from industrially relevant operational conditions. where CO 2 mass transport limitations should be minimised. To overcome this issue. gas diffusion electrodes and gas-fed electrolysers need to be developed and applied. presenting new challenges and opportunities to the CO 2 electrolysis community. In this review. we introduce the reader to the fundamentals of gas diffusion electrodes and gas-fed electrolysers. highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. We discuss in detail the design of gas diffusion electrodes and their operation within gas-fed electrolysers in both flow-through and flow-by configurations. Then. we correlate the structure and composition of gas diffusion electrodes to the operational performance of electrolysers. indicating options and prospects for improvement.

These salts Ni(MEEA)2·0.5H2O and Fe3O(MEEA)7·5.5(H2O) bear the polyether carboxylate anion 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetate (MEEA = CH3OCH2CH2OCH2CH2OCH2CO2-). They may be utilized for the low-temperature preparation of nickel ferrite by using Ni(MEEA)2·0.5H2O to coat Fe2O3 powders with a continuous film of NiO. Upon heating this material to 800 °C. a remarkable solid-state reaction occurs to puff the precursor particles into broccoli floret-like collections of very small particles. A homogeneous precursor solution for nickel ferrite may be prepared via dissolution of Ni(NO3)2 in Fe3O(MEEA)7·5.5(H2O).

To overcome the high cost of hydrogen consumption in conventional bio-oil upgrading processes. this paper reports a novel process that converts three major biomass constituents (cellulose. hemicellulose and lignin) directly into liquid fuels via pyrolysis in the presence of methane over molybdenum impregnated HZSM-5 catalysts. The carbon yield of total aromatics from lignin increased from 12.80 to 15.13% when pyrolysis atmosphere switched from helium to methane in the presence of HZSM-5 support. However. methane was not effective in improving the aromatics yield from cellulose and hemicellulose in the presence of Mo-modified HZSM-5 catalysts.

Conventionally. the starting polymer is produced by chloromethylation of a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer that utilizes chloromethyl methyl ether. a known carcinogen. An alterative approach is to copolymerize vinylbenzyl chloride with divinylbenzene to generate the necessary VBC-DVB. This method provides precise control over the density of the ion-exchange groups. The regiochemistry of the vinylbenzyl chloride methods was realized using solvent-ion exchange groups. In this investigation. an improved solvent system was found for the preparation of anion exchange resins by the vinylbenzyl chloride route. The effectiveness of amination of the intermediate VBC-DVB polymers with a variety of trimethylamine reagents was investigated. and ethanolic trimethylamine produced the highest degree of amination. These resulting ion-exchange polymers were characterized by a variety of techniques such as analytical titrations. nitrogen analysis.

This work uses micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) to image the presence of silane coatings in field samples and the changes made to the paste chemistry. There are many advantages that μXRF has over other imaging techniques due to the large spot size and the high energy levels. Because of this. μXRF can rapidly investigate large areas and requires minimal sample preparation. Quantitative measurements are made to show that there is a reduction in the amount of sulfur and an increase in potassium in the hydrophobic regions formed by silane coatings.

Classical ion trajectory simulations were used to relate the experimental scattering and recoiling data to the surface structure. The scattered and recoiled atoms originate from the outermost five–six atomic layers. and azimuthal anisotropy was observed in the measurements.

1114435,Water purification and monitoring,2014,Samuel J Maguire-Boyle,,,,,,The purification of water for the next century is paramount. As global demand for energy increases new ways of generating energy have been discovered and exploited. However. with the diversification of energy sources one thing remains constant. the water energy nexus. The water energy nexus is the intimate connection of water generation to energy generation and visa-versa. In other words. to have energy clean water is needed and to have clean water energy is needed. Because of this. new methods of water purification and monitoring have been investigated and developed.Herein the author describes new water purification methods using zwitterionic surfaces which have been used to purify various types of water including to date the most difficult waters such as ‘oilfield brines’. The author also describes techniques developed to monitor the chemical content of the oilfield brine which may be adapted for use at on-site wells as well as techniques which may be utilized to monitor for aquifer contamination by oilfield operations via nanoparticle sensors.,True,ZJhTm50AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/77230,,,,https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/77230/Samuel%20Maguire-Boyle%20PhD%20Thesis%20corrected.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Processes & impacts,2,220,,Quantifying nanoparticle (NP) transport within porous geological media is imperative in the design of tracers and sensors to monitor the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing that has seen increasing concern over recent years. in particular the potential pollution and contamination of aquifers. The surface chemistry of a NP defining many of its solubility and transport properties means that there is a wide range of functionality that it is desirable to screen for optimum transport. Most prior transport methods are limited in determining if significant adsorption occurs of a NP over a limited column distance. however. translating this to effects over large distances is difficult. Herein we report an automated method that allows for the simulation of adsorption effects of a dilute nanoparticle solution over large distances under a range of solution parameters.

Evaluation of reaction kinetics,2002,Andrew R Tadd and Anne Marteel and Mark R Mason and Julian A Davies and Martin A Abraham,41,Industrial & engineering chemistry research,18,4514-4522,American Chemical Society,Environmental needs associated with green chemistry require a reduction in the use of reaction solvents and separation materials. Heterogenization of homogeneous catalysts can be used to simplify the recovery steps in a reaction process. The use of a supercritical fluid for reaction and separation can further reduce the need for organic solvents throughout the process. The current paper describes the development of a tethered homogeneous catalyst for the hydroformylation of 1-hexene in supercritical carbon dioxide that is shown to be active. stable. and selective for the reaction. A reaction rate model that shows similarities to both the homogeneous and heterogeneous models is developed based on the assumption of a tethered catalyst and provides rate constants that are consistent with previous estimates. ,True,TPwTFrkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,25,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie010791t,558166144523132178,/scholar?cites=558166144523132178,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julian_Davies4/publication/231370178_Hydroformylation_of_1-Hexene_in_Supercritical_Carbon_Dioxide_Using_a_Heterogeneous_Rhodium_Catalyst_2_Evaluation_of_Reaction_Kinetics/links/5a2e81e645851552ae7f33aa/Hydroformylation-of-1-Hexene-in-Supercritical-Carbon-Dioxide-Using-a-Heterogeneous-Rhodium-Catalyst-2-Evaluation-of-Reaction-Kinetics.pdf,0,0,0

CO2 reduction under these experimental conditions was typically found to proceed at=-1.7 V vs. SHE. If the initial step in the CO2 reduction mechanism involves direct chemical reaction between electrochemically generated chemisorbed hydrogen and adsorbed CQ at the copper electrode (6). then one might in principle require less cathodic overpotentials to promote CO2 reduction using more acid electrolytes. Of course in conventional aqueous electrolyte cells what one would observe under such conditions would be a progressive dominance by hydrogen evolution over CO2 reduction. One strategy to overcome this limitation is the use of solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) cells.,True,S08VlkMAAAAJ:Ug5p-4gJ2f0C,80,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.2096030/meta,8299582938671701564,/scholar?cites=8299582938671701564,,,0,0,0

1114503,Efficient high rate carbon dioxide reduction to methane and ethylene at in situ electrodeposited copper electrode,1987,Ronald L Cook and Robert C MacDuff and Anthony F Sammells,,COMMUNICATIONS,,,,We have recently reported I the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 using cold-rolled B370 Cu cathodes (99.9%) in CO 2 saturated 0. SM KHCO 3. at high current densities (up to 38 mA/cm 2) where Faradaic efficiencies of 33% were observed. Other workers 2 using higher purity Cu (99.999%) cathodes. at lower current densities (up to 10mA/cm 2) found Faradaic efficiencies up to 65% for CH 4 formation (at 0~ with 1-2% ethylene being simultaneously produced. Furthermore. the yield for ethyl~ ne was found to deteriorate by zl/3 when 99.99% pure Cu was substituted for the cathode. These closely related observations imply that Cu purity and morphology will be crucial for promoting high rate and efficient CO 2 reduction. Under such electrolytic cell conditions one might anticipate some deterioration in Cu activity with time due in part to the codeposition of trace impurities from the electrolyte and/or accumulation of insoluble CO 2 reduction byproducts. The question that arises under such circumstances is how to form. or more importantly maintain. the desired Cu activity leading to CO 2 reduction. It has recently been shown 3 that the simultaneous in situ deposition of electrocatalysts (in this case Ni) can prove effective for the electrochemical hydrogeneration of organic molecules. Such an approach can result in both metal deposition under equilibrium electrolytic conditions and provide for continuously renewed electrocatalytic sites.

The radiative limit represents the lowest permissible level of recombination in a solar cell and. therefore. places an upper limit on the voltage that can be attained. Introducing additional nonradiative recombination results in a loss in voltage that can only be compensated for by moving to higher bandgaps. Consequently. the optimal bandgap for solar energy conversion will rise with increasing nonradiative recombination rate. This balance was recognized by Shockley and Queisser for single-junction solar cells and is here extended to multijunction solar cells.

We review the size-dependent properties of a variety of inorganic nanoparticles and find that particles larger than about 30 nm do not in general show properties that would require regulatory scrutiny beyond that required for their bulk counterparts.,True,Em6JpxYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1629,https://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v4/n10/abs/nnano.2009.242.html,10694935948203025648,/scholar?cites=10694935948203025648,,https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/lowry/files/2014/06/Auffan09_NatureNano.pdf,0,0,0

P K-edge EXAFS study,1997,Jérôme Rose and Anne-Marie Flank and Armand Masion and Jean-Yves Bottero and Pierre Elmerich,13,Langmuir,6,1827-1834,American Chemical Society,P K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy has been used to determine the local environment of phosphorus during the hydrolysis of FeCl3 in the presence of phosphate. Measurements were performed on liquid samples and in the fluorescence mode. With the detection geometry adopted during experiments. the self absorption of fluorescence has been quantified and does not appear to be an important phenomenon. Thus no correction was made. In order to clearly identify the neighboring atoms around P. a multiple scattering approach has been used. Multiple scattering seems to be an important phenomenon in PO4/FeCl3 clusters. P K-edge EXAFS data show that even for very acidic solutions. pH < 1. all the phosphate ions are complexed to Fe.

The International Life Sciences Institute Research Foundation/Risk Science Institute convened an expert working group to develop a screening strategy for the hazard identification of engineered nanomaterials. The working group report presents the elements of a screening strategy rather than a detailed testing protocol. Based on an evaluation of the limited data currently available. the report presents a broad data gathering strategy applicable to this early stage in the development of a risk assessment process for nanomaterials. Oral. dermal. inhalation. and injection routes of exposure are included recognizing that. depending on use patterns. exposure to nanomaterials may occur by any of these routes. The three key elements of the toxicity screening strategy are: Physicochemical Characteristics. In Vitro Assays (cellular and non-cellular). and In Vivo Assays. There is a strong likelihood that biological activity of nanoparticles will depend on physicochemical parameters not routinely considered in toxicity screening studies. Physicochemical properties that may be important in understanding the toxic effects of test materials include particle size and size distribution. agglomeration state. shape. crystal structure. chemical composition. surface area. surface chemistry. surface charge. and porosity.

A number of different systems have to date been investigated with an aim of photocatalytic applications. A general synthetic regime consists of utilising simple sol-gel chemistry to deposit sequential layers of photocatalytic material on top of a soluble substrate. The substrate can subsequently be removed yielding extremely fragile disks that fracture into bi-phasic powders of Janus like particles. These particles have two unique sets of properties contained in different faces of the same particle. aimed at the simultaneous reduction and oxidation of toxic species in water. This new synthetic technique is investigated for photocatalyic applications with an eye to efficient water purification. utilising the synergistic effect of the two materials to create highly effective photocatalysts. The photocatalytic activity of anatase/rutile (TiO2) bi-phasic nanoparticle composites enhanced with platinum and deposited on the surface of polycarbonate filters has been successfully demonstrated.

1114754,From production-based to consumption-based national emission inventories,2008,Glen P Peters,65,Ecological economics,1,13-23,Elsevier,Under the United National Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC) countries are required to submit National Emission Inventories (NEI) to benchmark reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Depending on the definition and system boundary of the NEI. the mitigation options and priorities may vary. The territorial system boundary used by the UNFCCC has been critiqued for not including international transportation and potentially causing carbon leakage. To address these issues. past literature has argued in favour of using consumption-based NEI in climate policy. This article discusses several issues in moving from the standard production-based NEI to consumption-based NEI.

China's CO2 emissions have nearly doubled. and China may already be the world's largest emitter of CO2. Evidence suggests that exports could be a main cause for the rise in Chinese CO2 emissions; however. no systematic study has analyzed this issue. especially over time. We find that in 2005. around one-third of Chinese emissions (1700 Mt CO2) were due to production of exports. and this proportion has risen from 12% (230 Mt) in 1987 and only 21% (760 Mt) as recently as 2002.

This relevance. due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide. is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH 4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH 4 are continuing to increase. making CH 4 the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH 4 sources that overlap geographically. and from the destruction of CH 4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH).

In our reference scenario. production-related CO2 emissions will increase another three times by 2030. Household consumption. capital investment and growth in exports will largely drive the increase in CO2 emissions.

In this carbon cycle-climate model intercomparison project. which spans the full model hierarchy. we quantify responses to emission pulses of different magnitudes injected under different conditions. The CO2 response shows the known rapid decline in the first few decades followed by a millennium-scale tail. For a 100 Gt-C emission pulse added to a constant CO2 concentration of 389 ppm. 25 ± 9% is still found in the atmosphere after 1000 yr; the ocean has absorbed 59 ± 12% and the land the remainder (16 ± 14%). The response in global mean surface air temperature is an increase by 0.20 ± 0.12 °C within the first twenty years; thereafter and until year 1000. temperature decreases only slightly. whereas ocean heat content and sea level continue to rise. Our best estimate for the Absolute Global Warming Potential. given by the time-integrated response in CO2 at year 100 multiplied by its radiative efficiency. is 92.5 × 10−15 yr W m−2 per kg-CO2.

To this end. we compile cradle-to-grave inventories for EVs in four size segments to determine their climate change potential. A second objective is to compare the lifecycle emissions of EVs to those of conventional vehicles. For this purpose. we collect lifecycle emissions for conventional vehicles reported by automobile manufacturers. The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are calculated per vehicle and over a total driving range of 180 000 km using the average European electricity mix. Process-based attributional LCA and the ReCiPe characterisation method are used to estimate the climate change potential from the hierarchical perspective. The differently sized EVs are compared to one another to find the effect of increasing the size and range of EVs.

The combination of input–output and physical inventory data on coefficient level is a convenient way of constructing a hybrid LCI that has both good detail and completeness. The proposed approach formalizes how to deal with partially overlapping data in inventory compilation. This particular approach requires that the issue of double counting is resolved in a consistent manner. Algorithms for identifying and adjusting for double counting are developed.

This convention is a plausible assumption for fast growing biomass species. but is inappropriate for slower growing biomass. like forests. In this case. the climate impact from biomass combustion can be potentially underestimated if CO2 emissions are ignored. or overestimated. if biogenic CO2 is considered equal to anthropogenic CO2.

We attempt to capture all possible variations of underlying data and calculation procedures in a global MRIO model constructed with particular focus on the UK. We consider these variations to be random. and determine the stochastic variation of the whole MRIO system using Monte Carlo techniques. 5000 simulation runs were carried out to determine the standard deviations of multipliers. From these. the standard deviations of components of the UK's carbon footprint were estimated using error propagation.

Energy use can be decomposed into eight factors that explain changes in overall energy use over the entire time period. and within five sub-periods. The growth of energy use between 1970 and 1996 was mainly influenced by changes in affluence. population and intersectoral dependencies. while changes in direct energy intensity and per capita residential energy use had a retarding impact on energy use.

Whilst the LMDI method provides perfect decomposition. and is time-reversal invariant. its strategy to handle zero-values is not necessarily robust. In order to overcome this problem. it has been recommended to substitute a small value δ= 1 0-10–1 0-20 for any zero values in the underlying data set. and allow the calculation to proceed as usual. The decomposition results are said to converge as δ approaches zero. However. we show that under this recommended procedure the LMDI can produce significant errors if applied in the decomposition of a data set containing a large number of zeroes and/or small values.
