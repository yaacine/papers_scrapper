Ltd.,In matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) the analyte signal produced depends strongly on the analyte and on the sample preparation procedure. Comparing the results obtained with the dried‐drop method with the results obtained with a homogeneous sample preparation procedure. discrimination effects. as well as sensitivity variations. are shown to be dependent on the molecular weight of the analysed compounds. The signal obtained in MALDI is shown to be dependent on the hydrophobicity and basicity of the analyte. With the dried‐drop method. in particular. evidence of peripheral sample deposition of hydrophilic compounds is shown. These last effects are due to mass transfer caused by differences in surface activities during solvent evaporation. and are known as Marangoni effects. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons.

Ltd.,Dental caries is a complex disease. characterized by demineralization of tooth structure. With a protective role. several salivary phosphopeptides appear to be involved in remineralization processes. delaying the loss of tooth structure. In this work we have correlated peptide saliva composition with dental caries susceptibility through the analysis of saliva and hydroxyapatite-adsorbed salivary peptides samples. Saliva samples were obtained from two groups. a caries-free and a cariessusceptible group. and were analysed using HPLC-MS and a sequential extraction with 6 m of guanidine followed by trifluoroacetate.

By analogy with other members of this family. it is assumed that peroxisomal ABC transporters must dimerize to become functional units. However. not much is known regarding the type of dimers (i.e.. homodimers and/or heterodimers) that are formed in vivo under normal expression conditions. In this work. we have characterized the quaternary structure of mouse liver PMP70 and ALDP. The PMP70 protein complex was purified to apparent homogeneity using a two-step purification protocol. The ALDP-containing protein complex was characterized by preparative immunoprecipitation experiments. In both cases. no evidence for the existence of heteromeric interactions or for the presence of accessory proteins in these ABC transporter protein complexes could be obtained.

Cells maintain this pool by two pathways. both involving deubiquitinases (DUBs): recycling of ubiquitin from ubiquitin conjugates and processing of ubiquitin precursors synthesized de novo. Although many advances have been made in recent years regarding ubiquitin recycling. our knowledge on ubiquitin precursor processing is still limited and questions such as when are these precursors processed and which DUBs are involved remain largely unanswered. Here we provide data suggesting that two of the four mammalian ubiquitin precursors. UBA52 and UBA80. are processed mostly post-translationally whereas the other two. UBB and UBC. probably undergo a combination of co-and post-translational processing. Using an unbiased biochemical approach we found that UCHL3.

Under basal conditions. protein lipoxidation can contribute to normal cell homeostasis and participate in signaling or adaptive mechanisms. as exemplified by lipoxidation of Ras proteins or of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin. both of which behave as sensors of electrophilic species. Nevertheless. increased lipoxidation under pathological conditions may lead to deleterious effects on protein structure or aggregation. This can result in impaired degradation and accumulation of abnormally folded proteins contributing to pathophysiology. as may occur in neurodegenerative diseases.

1219634,ER stress-inducible factor CHOP affects the expression of hepcidin by modulating C/EBPalpha activity,2009,Susana J Oliveira and Jorge P Pinto and Gonçalo Picarote and Vera M Costa and Félix Carvalho and Maria Rangel and Maria de Sousa and Sérgio F de Almeida,4,PLoS One,8,e6618,Public Library of Science,Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces a complex network of pathways collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). The clarification of these pathways has linked the UPR to the regulation of several physiological processes. However. its crosstalk with cellular iron metabolism remains unclear. which prompted us to examine whether an UPR affects the expression of relevant iron-related genes. For that purpose. the HepG2 cell line was used as model and the UPR was activated by dithiothreitol (DTT) and homocysteine (Hcys). Here. we report that hepcidin. a liver secreted hormone that shepherds iron homeostasis. exhibits a biphasic pattern of expression following UPR activation: its levels decreased in an early stage and increased with the maintenance of the stress response. Furthermore. we show that immediately after stressing the ER. the stress-inducible transcription factor CHOP depletes C/EBPα protein pool. which may in turn impact on the activation of hepcidin transcription. In the later period of the UPR. CHOP levels decreased progressively. enhancing C/EBPα-binding to the hepcidin promoter. In addition. analysis of ferroportin and ferritin H revealed that the transcript levels of these iron-genes are increased by the UPR signaling pathways. Taken together. our findings suggest that the UPR can have a broad impact on the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis.,True,0gZf9pYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,106,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006618,13250637217084933318,/scholar?cites=13250637217084933318,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006618,0,0,0

This species contains three main groups of toxins: amatoxins. phallotoxins. and virotoxins. From these. amatoxins. especially α-amanitin. are the main responsible for the toxic effects in humans. It is recognized that α-amanitin inhibits RNA polymerase II. causing protein deficit and ultimately cell death. although other mechanisms are thought to be involved. The liver is the main target organ of toxicity. but other organs are also affected. especially the kidneys.

It became one of the most popular stimulants present in weight-loss products after the US Food and Drug Administration had interdicted the use of ephedrine-containing dietary supplements. Synephrine is also a trace amine that can be found in vertebrates and invertebrates. Synephrine acts on several adrenergic and serotonergic receptors and its activity on trace-amine-associated receptors has long been discussed. Synephrine exists in three different positional isomers; however. only p- and m-synephrine have been described in weight-loss products. The alleged effectiveness of synephrine-containing supplements is attributed to the thermogenic effects arising from synephrine’s adrenergic stimulation.

Guidelines recommend individuals undertake exercise training to improve VO2max for chronic disease reduction. However. there are large inter-individual differences between exercise training responses. This systematic review is aimed at identifying genetic variants that are associated with VO2max trainability. Peer-reviewed research papers published up until October 2016 from four databases were examined. Articles were included if they examined genetic variants. incorporated a supervised aerobic exercise intervention; and measured VO2max/VO2peak pre and post-intervention. Thirty-five articles describing 15 cohorts met the criteria for inclusion. The majority of studies used a cross-sectional retrospective design. Thirty-two studies researched candidate genes. two used Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). and one examined mRNA gene expression data. in addition to a GWAS. Across these studies. 97 genes to predict VO2max trainability were identified. Studies found phenotype to be dependent on several of these genotypes/variants. with higher responders to exercise training having more positive response alleles than lower responders (greater gene predictor score). Only 13 genetic variants were reproduced by more than two authors. Several other limitations were noted throughout these studies. including the robustness of significance for identified variants. small sample sizes. limited cohorts focused primarily on Caucasian populations. and minimal baseline data.

1219711,Exercise training-induced alterations in skeletal muscle antioxidant capacity: a brief review.,1999,Scott K Powers and Li Li Ji and CHRISTIAAN Leeuwenburgh,31,,7,987-997,,Cellular oxidants include a variety of reactive oxygen. nitrogen. and chlorinating species. It is well established that the increase in metabolic rate in skeletal muscle during contractile activity results in an increased production of oxidants. Failure to remove these oxidants during exercise can result in significant oxidative damage of cellular biomolecules. Fortunately. regular endurance exercise results in adaptations in the skeletal muscle antioxidant capacity. which protects myocytes against the deleterious effects of oxidants and prevents extensive cellular damage. This review discusses the effects of chronic exercise on the up-regulation of both antioxidant enzymes and the glutathione antioxidant defense system. Primary antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase. glutathione peroxidase. and catalase will be discussed as well as glutathione. which is an important nonenzymatic antioxidant. Growing evidence indicates that exercise training results in an elevation in the activities of both superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase along with increased cellular concentrations of glutathione in skeletal muscles. It seems plausible that increased cellular concentrations of these antioxidants will reduce the risk of cellular injury. improve performance. and delay muscle fatigue.,True,-roCpMoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,651,https://europepmc.org/article/med/10416560,18393635882219648234,/scholar?cites=18393635882219648234,,,0,0,0

This disuse-induced muscle atrophy results from both increased proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis. Investigations of the cell signaling pathways that regulate disuse muscle atrophy have increased our understanding of this complex process. Emerging evidence implicates oxidative stress as a key regulator of cell signaling pathways. leading to increased proteolysis and muscle atrophy during periods of prolonged disuse.

1219714,Exercise-induced oxidative stress in humans: cause and consequences,2011,Scott K Powers and W Bradley Nelson and Matthew B Hudson,51,,5,942-950,Pergamon,The observation that muscular exercise is associated with oxidative stress in humans was first reported over 30 years ago. Since this initial report. numerous studies have confirmed that prolonged or high-intensity exercise results in oxidative damage to macromolecules in both blood and skeletal muscle. Although the primary tissue(s) responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during exercise remains a topic of debate. compelling evidence indicates that muscular activity promotes oxidant production in contracting skeletal muscle fibers. Mitochondria. NADPH oxidase. PLA2-dependent processes. and xanthine oxidase have all been postulated to contribute to contraction-induced ROS production in muscle but the primary site of contraction-induced ROS production in muscle fibers remains unclear.

Recent evidence suggests that radicals and other ROS are an underlying aetiology in exercise-induced disturbances in muscle redox status. These exercise-induced redox disturbances in skeletal muscle are postulated to contribute to both muscle fatigue and/or exercise-induced muscle injury. To defend against ROS. muscle cells contain complex cellular defence mechanisms to reduce the risk of oxidative injury. Two major classes (enzymic and non-enzymic) of endogenous protective mechanisms work together to reduce the harmful effects of oxidants in the cell. Primary antioxidant enzymes include superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1; SOD).

Growing evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species are responsible for exercise-induced protein oxidation and contribute to muscle fatigue. To protect against exercise-induced oxidative injury. muscle cells contain complex endogenous cellular defence mechanisms (enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants) to eliminate reactive oxygen species. Furthermore. exogenous dietary antioxidants interact with endogenous antioxidants to form a cooperative network of cellular antioxidants.

Although the sources of oxidant production during exercise continue to be debated. growing evidence suggests that mitochondria are not the dominant source. Regardless of the sources of oxidants in contracting muscles. intense and prolonged exercise can result in oxidative damage to both proteins and lipids in the contracting myocytes.

Given that radicals are known to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of several diseases. the 1980s–90s dogma was that contraction‐induced radical production was detrimental to muscle because of oxidative damage to macromolecules within the fibre.

Pesticides. for instance. enable foodstuffs to be produced in sufficient quantities to satisfy the needs of millions of people. a condition that has led to an increase in levels of life expectancy. Yet. at times. these benefits are offset by certain disadvantages. notably the toxic side effects of the chemical compounds used. Exposure to these compounds can have varying effects. ranging from instant death to a gradual process of chemical carcinogenesis. There are three stages involved in chemical carcinogenesis. These are defined as initiation. promotion and progression. Each of these stages is characterised by morphological and biochemical modifications and result from genetic and/or epigenetic alterations. These genetic modifications include: mutations in genes that control cell proliferation. cell death and DNA repair - i.e. mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressing genes. The epigenetic factors. also considered as being non-genetic in character. can also contribute to carcinogenesis via epigenetic mechanisms which silence gene expression. The control of responses to carcinogenesis through the application of several chemical. biochemical and biological techniques facilitates the identification of those basic mechanisms involved in neoplasic development. Experimental assays with laboratory animals. epidemiological studies and quick tests enable the identification of carcinogenic compounds. the dissection of many aspects of carcinogenesis. and the establishment of effective strategies to prevent the cancer which results from exposure to chemicals.,True,bnazOkAAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC,221,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0001-37652007000400004&script=sci_arttext,18440969171552994300,/scholar?cites=18440969171552994300,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0001-37652007000400004&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Due to high molecular heterogeneity significant variations in the natural history and disease outcome have been observed. This has also delayed the introduction of personalized therapeutics. making advanced stage bladder cancer almost an orphan disease in terms of treatment. Altered protein glycosylation translated by the expression of the sialyl-Tn antigen (STn) and its precursor Tn as well as the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are cancer-associated events that may hold potential for patient stratification and guided therapy. Therefore. a retrospective design. 96 bladder tumours of different stages (Ta. T1-T4) was screened for STn and phosphorylated forms of Akt (pAkt). mTOR (pmTOR).

The present study was performed to investigate sirolimus's ability to inhibit growth in T24 bladder cancer cells. T24 bladder cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of sirolimus. MTT assay was used to evaluate the proliferation inhibitory effect on T24 cell line. The viability of T24 cell line was determined by Trypan blue exclusion analysis. Sirolimus inhibits the growth of bladder carcinoma cells and decreases their viability. Significant correlations were found between cell proliferation and sirolimus concentration (r = 0.830; p < 0.01) as well as between cell viability and sirolimus concentration (r = -0.896; p < 0.01).

The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NFκB) plays a pivotal role in HPV-infected cells. and its expression and activity are modulated by several viral oncoproteins. NFκB modulation seems to first facilitate viral persistence and immune evasion. and later to drive tumour progression. but the many conflicting results and the complexity of its signaling networks require great prudence while interpreting the role of NFκB in papillomaviral lesions. Accordingly. the pharmacological targeting of the NFκB pathway in HPV-induced lesions is a complex and currently unmet challenge.

1219754,A role for microRNA-155 expression in microenvironment associated to HPV-induced carcinogenesis in K14-HPV16 transgenic mice,2015,Isabel Paiva and Rui M Gil da Costa and Joana Ribeiro and Hugo Sousa and Margarida Bastos and Ana Faustino Carlos Rocha and Paula A Oliveira and Rui Medeiros,10,PLoS One,1,e0116868,Public Library of Science,Human Papillomavirus cause a number of diseases most notably cervical cancer. K14-HPV16 transgenic mice expressing the HPV16 early genes in squamous epithelial cells provide a suitable experimental model for studying these diseases. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in regulating gene expression and have been suggested to play an important role in cancer development. The role of miR-155 in cancer remains controversial and there is limited evidence linking this miRNA to HPV- associated diseases. We hypothesized that miR-155 expression modulates each tissue’s susceptibility to develop HPV-associated carcinogenesis. In this study. we analyzed miR-155 expression in ear and chest skin samples from 22-26 weeks old. female K14-HPV16 transgenic (HPV16+/-) and wild-type (HPV-/-) mice. Among wild-type mice the expression of miR-155 was lower in ear skin compared with chest skin (p = 0.028). In transgenic animals. in situ carcinoma was present in all ear samples whereas chest tissues only showed epidermal hyperplasia. Furthermore. in hyperplastic chest skin samples. miR-155 expression was lower than in normal chest skin (p = 0.026). These results suggest that miR-155 expression may modulate the microenvironmental susceptibility to cancer development and that high miR155 levels may be protective against the carcinogenesis induced by HPV16.,True,bnazOkAAAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC,33,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116868,6954540265923385974,/scholar?cites=6954540265923385974,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116868,0,0,0

Numerical simulations play a crucial role in understanding transient phenomena occurring within the magnet. and can. therefore. help to prevent disruptive consequences. We present a 2-D FEM model for the simulation of electrothermal transients occurring in superconducting accelerator magnets. The magnetoquasistatic problem is solved with a modified magnetic vector potential formulation. where the cable eddy currents are resolved in terms of their equivalent magnetization. The heat balance equation is then investigated. and the relevant heat sources are discussed. The model implements a two-port component interface and is resolved. as part of an electrical circuit. in a cooperative simulation scheme with a lumped-parameter network.,True,_ZA40JsAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,23,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8024019/,5650718291558780671,/scholar?cites=5650718291558780671,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01187,0,0,0

DHF is also referred to as heart failure with normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFNEF) to indicate that HFNEF could be a precursor of heart failure with reduced LVEF. Because of improved cardiac imaging and because of widespread clinical use of plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. diagnostic criteria for HFNEF needed to be updated. The diagnosis of HFNEF requires the following conditions to be satisfied: (i) signs or symptoms of heart failure; (ii) normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function; (iii) evidence of diastolic LV dysfunction. Normal or mildly abnormal systolic LV function implies both an LVEF > 50% and an LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) <97 mL/m2.

Several molecular mechanisms underlying this association have been implied. among which the intestinal barrier has gained a growing interest. In experimental models of obesity. significant alterations in the intestinal barrier lead to increased intestinal permeability. favoring translocation of microbiome-derived lipopolysaccharide to the bloodstream. This has been shown to result in a two-to threefold increase in its serum concentrations. a threshold named ‘metabolic endotoxemia’(ME). ME may trigger toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammatory activation. eliciting a chronic low-grade proinflammatory and pro-oxidative stress status. which may result in high CV risk and target-organ damage.

Given the similarities between 7DHC and cholesterol. 7DHC can be incorporated into cell membranes in lieu of cholesterol. Nevertheless. due to their structural differences and distinct affinity to other membrane components. this substitution alters membrane properties and one can expect to find abnormalities in membrane protein composition.

Despite extensive research in the field. the molecular mechanism responsible for the development of this slow progressing disease remains unclear. In the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. mitochondria are damaged and inflammatory mediators are elevated before the histopathology associated with the disease can be observed. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulate a variety of cellular functions including apoptosis and angiogenesis. Diabetic environment stimulates the secretion of several MMPs that are considered to participate in complications. including retinopathy. nephropathy and cardiomyopathy.

Many metabolic pathways have been implicated in its development. and genes associated with these pathways are altered. Diabetic environment also facilitates epigenetics modifications. which can alter the gene expression without permanent changes in DNA sequence. The role of epigenetics in diabetic retinopathy is now an emerging area. and recent work has shown that genes encoding mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are epigenetically modified. activates of epigenetic modification enzymes. histone lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1). and DNA methyltransferase are increased. and the micro RNAs responsible for regulating nuclear transcriptional factor and VEGF are upregulated. With the growing evidence of epigenetic modifications in diabetic retinopathy. better understanding of these modifications has potential to identify novel targets to inhibit this devastating disease. Fortunately. the inhibitors and mimics targeted towards histone modification.

Diabetes is a growing pandemic of the 21st century that has reached 1 in every 11 people worldwide [1]. Changes in lifestyle such as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are strongly associated with the growing prevalence of this disease [2. 3]. Chronic hyperglycemia. the common outcome of all diabetes types. may negatively influence the structure and function of many organ systems. particularly the cardiovascular. nervous. and renal systems [4. 5]. These diabetic complications are associated with increased rate of morbidity and mortality [1. 5]. The role of oxidative stress has been an important piece of the puzzle for the understanding of the complex mechanism by which diabetes and its complications are developed. In this context. numerous research groups have focused on the characterization of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) source. its triggered pathway. scavenging and antioxidant substances in diabetes [6–9]. The multifaceted effects of oxidative damage in diabetes have been well addressed in the current issue and it provides a bigger picture of complication in a single platform. Therefore. this special issue includes 8 research articles focusing on the role of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense on the development of diabetes and its associated diseases.

Some substances. such as AMPK and calcium activated proteins. have been suggested as potential mediators but the exact mechanisms of their involvement remain to be elucidated. A hypothetical convergence point between the insulin cascade and the potential pathways triggered by muscle contraction has been suggested. Therefore. the earliest concept that two different routes exist in skeletal muscle has been progressively modified to the notion that glucose uptake is induced …,True,z6FzMUYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,107,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2008-1038404,6764590877891518131,/scholar?cites=6764590877891518131,,,0,0,0

Regular exercise modulates many intracellular pathways improving insulin resistance and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. both early abnormalities of T2D.

A reduction in the expression of skeletal muscle glucose transporters (GLUTs). glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). has been associated to such phenomena. but unlike the case of insulin. only few studies have addressed the effect of age on muscle‐contraction‐induced glucose uptake.

Indeed. the standard signals for vigilance and hypo-satisfaction. eg cortisol. seem to affect the individual feeding behavior. increasing the preference for high-caloric food. However. this preference can surpass the stressful period itself and become a habit. leading to several negative metabolic implications such as the enhanced risk to develop metabolic syndrome. Therefore. it is important to find effective ways to offset the harmful consequences of allostatic load on feeding. In particular. physical exercise has proven to be capable of counteracting the negative effects of psychosocial stress on feeding behavior. Consequently. physical exercise may be used to prevent the development of metabolic-related diseases. thus reiterating its recommendation as a way of protecting the organism against the stress side effects.

1219876,In vitro glucose uptake induced by electrical stimulation in soleus muscle. Does the stimulation frequency matter?,2010,Julia Matzenbacher Santos and Sandra Aparecida Benite-Ribeiro and Glória Queiróz and Hans Joachim Appell and José Alberto Duarte,1,Archives of Exercise in Health and Disease,2,34-42,,Objective: Glucose uptake of skeletal muscle has been studied widely in vitro using electrical stimulation. High frequency stimulation resulted in higher glucose uptake. Since the physiological stimulation pattern for slow-twitch muscles is at low frequencies. this study aims to analyse the effects of low vs. high frequency stimulation on glucose uptake in vitro and on muscle structure in the slow-twitch rat soleus muscle. Design: Eighteen Wistar rats were assigned to two groups: stimulation at 10Hz and at 100Hz of isolated soleus muscles in an oxygenated Krebs buffer. Glucose uptake and the intrafiber localization of GLUT4 were determined. As an estimate for potential damage. the release of taurine into the buffer. cleaved caspase-3 occurrence and expression. and morphological signs of fiber damage were quantified. Results: Stimulation at 100Hz resulted in a more pronounced glucose uptake than at 10Hz. However. the muscles stimulated at 100Hz showed signs of cellular and membrane damage more frequently than the 10Hz-muscles. Therefore. cellular damage might account for an artificial glucose influx from the buffer by muscles stimulated at 100Hz. Conclusion: It does not seem meaningful to study glucose uptake in slow-twitch muscles with non-physiologically high stimulation frequencies.,True,z6FzMUYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,2,https://ciafel.fade.up.pt/aehd_archives/files/journals/1/articles/85/public/85-112-1-PB.pdf,16671068434544676665,/scholar?cites=16671068434544676665,,https://ciafel.fade.up.pt/aehd_archives/files/journals/1/articles/85/public/85-112-1-PB.pdf,0,0,0

The encountered alterations at the structural level speaking in favor of muscle damage are accompanied by a variety of clinical symptoms composing the syndrome of delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS)[2. 8. 11. 21]. The most evident functional symptoms are a reduction in muscle strength. muscle swelling. and a reduced range of motion at the involved joints. the latter being due to an increase in muscle tension at rest [7. 15. 17].Muscle stretching is frequently used to facilitate the recovery after intense exercise. although this issue has been controversially discussed with regard to efficacy [7. 22].

The objectives of the study were: 1) to establish the BMI prevalence in 12-year olds residing in Puerto Rico. and 2) to determine BMI differences by sex. public-private school type. and geographic regions. Data was obtained from an island-wide probabilistic stratified sample of 1.582 twelve-year-olds (53% girls and 47% boys). The BMI was determined using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey procedures. Children were categorized as underweight. healthy weight. overweight or obese using the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s age and gender specific growth charts. A logistic regression model was used to estimate BMI category prevalence. Odds ratios were calculated using a multinomial regression. In this study. 18.8% of the children were overweight and 24.3% were obese. A higher prevalence of obesity was observed in boys as compared to girls. 28.2% vs. 20.2%. respectively. The estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity in children from public schools was lower than for those from private schools.

Thirty young. healthy      men (age : 22.1 ± 2.7 years) were randomly divided into two groups. The Stretching Group (n=15) underwent      stretching of the dominant quadriceps muscle. which comprised ten passive stretches lasting 30 seconds each. while the      Control Group (n=15) remained seated for the same length of time. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used      to establish intragroup differences over time. and an independent sample t-test was used to compare the dependent      variables between groups at each moment. None of the measurements revealed any significant change between both      groups in each assessment moment or between moments within groups (p>0.05). This study demonstrated that static      quadriceps muscle stretching has no effect on the sense of knee joint position. threshold to detect passive movement. and      force sense. suggesting that stretching does not have appreciable effect on the spindle firing characteristics and tendon      organs activation.     ,True,PDbWsAUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,31,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/hukin/34/1/article-p33.xml,15049083389366792702,/scholar?cites=15049083389366792702,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/hukin/34/1/article-p33.xml,0,0,0

However. which features make a protein conformation on the folding pathway become committed to rapidly descending to the native state has been a mystery. Using two small. well characterized proteins. CI2 and C-Src SH3. we show how topological properties of protein conformations determine their kinetic ability to fold. We use a macroscopic measure of the protein contact network topology. the average graph connectivity. by constructing graphs that are based on the geometry of protein conformations.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The aggregation of α‐helix‐rich proteins into β‐sheet‐rich amyloid fibrils is associated with fatal diseases. such as Alzheimer's disease and prion disease. During an aggregation process. protein secondary structure elements—α‐helices—undergo conformational changes to β‐sheets. The fact that proteins with different sequences and structures undergo a similar transition on aggregation suggests that the sequence nonspecific hydrogen bond interaction among protein backbones is an important factor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a polyalanine model. which is an α‐helix in its native state and observe a metastable β‐hairpin intermediate. Although a β‐hairpin has larger potential energy than an α‐helix. the entropy of a β‐hairpin is larger because of fewer constraints imposed by the hydrogen bonds.

It was suggested that protein homologs and analogs originate from a common ancestor and diverge in their distinct evolutionary time scales. emerging as a consequence of the physical properties of the protein sequence space. Although a number of studies have determined key signatures of protein family organization. the sequence-structure factors that differentiate the two evolution-related protein families remain unknown. Here. we stipulate that subtle structural changes. which appear due to accumulating mutations in the homologous families. lead to distinct packing of the protein core and. thus. novel compositions of core residues. The latter process leads to the formation of distinct families of homologs. We propose that such differentiation results in the formation of analogous families. To test our postulate. we developed a molecular modeling and design toolkit. Medusa. to computationally design protein sequences that correspond to the same fold family. We find that analogous proteins emerge when a backbone structure deviates only 1–2 Å root-mean-square deviation from the original structure. For close homologs. core residues are highly conserved.

For the case of two proteins. we observe two possible aggregation conformations: the closed form dimer and the open aggregation state. The closed dimer is formed by “domain swapping”—the two proteins exchange their RT-loops. All the hydrophobic residues are buried inside the dimer so proteins cannot further aggregate into elongated amyloid fibrils. We find that the open structure—stabilized by backbone hydrogen bond interactions—packs the RT-loops together by swapping the two strands of the RT-loop. The packed RT-loops form a β-sheet structure and expose the backbone to promote further aggregation.

Disease age of onset is correlated with the polyQ insert length above a critical value of 35–40 glutamines. The aggregation kinetics of isolated polyQ peptides in vitro also shows a similar critical-length dependence. While recent experimental work has provided considerable insights into polyQ aggregation. the molecular mechanism of aggregation is not well understood. Here. using computer simulations of isolated polyQ peptides. we show that a mechanism of aggregation is the conformational transition in a single polyQ peptide chain from random coil to a parallel β-helix. This transition occurs selectively in peptides longer than 37 glutamines. In the β-helices observed in simulations. all residues adopt β-strand backbone dihedral angles. and the polypeptide chain coils around a central helical axis with 18.5 ± 2 residues per turn. We also find that mutant polyQ peptides with proline-glycine inserts show formation of antiparallel β-hairpins in their ground state. in agreement with experiments. The lower stability of mutant β-helices explains their lower aggregation rates compared to wild type.

We address the question of whether such correlations may be a trivial consequence of the known mosaic structure (‘‘patchiness’’) of DNA. We analyze two classes of controls consisting of patchy nucleotide sequences generated by different algorithms—one without and one with long-range power-law correlations. Although both types of sequences are highly heterogeneous. they are quantitatively distinguishable by new fluctuation analysis method that differentiates local patchiness from long-range correlations.

For example. the density maximum at 4 C and the minimum in the isothermal compressibility at 46 C are thought to reflect the presence of singularities in the behaviour of thermodynamic quantities occurring in the supercooled region 1 2. The'stability–limit conjecture'3–5 suggests that these thermodynamic anomalies arise from a single limit of mechanical stability (spinodal line). originating at the liquid–gas critical point. which determines the limit of both superheating at high temperatures and supercooling at low temperatures.

Joseph Ford quoting Tolstoy (Gleick. 1987) We are used to thinking that natural objects have a certain form and that this form is determined by a characteristic scale. If we magnify the object beyond this scale. no new features are revealed. To correctly measure the properties of the object. such as length. area. or volume. we measure it at a resolution finer than the characteristic scale of the object. We expect that the value we measure has a unique value for the object. This simple idea is the basis of the calculus. Euclidean geometry. and the theory of measurement. However. Mandelbrot (1977. 1983) brought to the world's attention that many natural objects simply do not have this preconceived form. Many of the structures in space and processes in time of living things have a very different form. Living things have structures in space and fluctuations in time that cannot be characterized by one spatial or temporal scale.

Many noisy signals in real systems display trends. so that the scaling results obtained from the DFA method become difficult to analyze. We systematically study the effects of three types of trends—linear. periodic. and power-law trends. and offer examples where these trends are likely to occur in real data. We compare the difference between the scaling results for artificially generated correlated noise and correlated noise with a trend. and study how trends lead to the appearance of crossovers in the scaling behavior.

Nevertheless. protein sequences do fold into unique native states in seconds (the Levinthal paradox). To determine how the Levinthal paradox is resolved. we use a lattice Monte Carlo model in which the global minimum (native state) is known. The necessary and sufficient condition for folding in this model is that the native state be a pronounced global minimum on the potential surface. This guarantees thermodynamic stability of the native state at a temperature where the chain does not get trapped in local minima. Folding starts by a rapid collapse from a random-coil state to a random semi-compact globule.

1219971,Formation of unique structure in polypeptide chains: theoretical investigation with the aid of a replica approach,1989,EI Shakhnovich and AM Gutin,34,Biophysical chemistry,3,187-199,Elsevier,A replica approach analogous to that used in spin glass systems is implemented to study the configurational space of a heteropolymeric model of protein with a quenched. disordered sequence of links in the limit of a large number of link types. It is shown that there exists a threshold value of chain heterogeneity which separates two qualitatively different types of behavior. For a low degree of heterogeneity the protein globule is like a homopolymer in a collapsed state without definite chain folds: an exponentially large number of folds make a significant contribution to the partition function in this regime. After the threshold heterogeneity has been overcome. the chain freezes drastically but without latent heat; few (approx. 1) frozen states with definite chain folds are thermodynamically dominant in this state.

Initially. protein folding was viewed as a strictly experimental field belonging to the realm of biochemistry. where each protein is viewed as a unique system that requires its own detailed characterizationsakin to any mechanism in biology. The theoretical thinking at this stage of development of the field was dominated by the quest to solve the so-called “Levinthal paradox” that posits that a protein could not find its native conformation by an exhaustive random search.

It is based on a simple model for ligand-protein interactions and a scoring that is directly related to the free energy through a knowledge-based potential. A large number of structures are examined by an efficient metropolis Monte Carlo molecular growth algorithm that generates molecules through the adjoining of functional groups directly in the binding region. Thus SMoG is a method that is able to rank a large number of potential compounds according to binding free energy in a short time. In this sense.

However. the discrimination of the native structure from decoys is still not strong enough to make the potential useful forab initiofolding.

However. despite accumulation of anecdotal evidence. an exact and conclusive relationship between the former and the latter has been elusive. We present an exhaustive study of the relationship between amino acid composition of proteomes. nucleotide composition of DNA. and optimal growth temperature (OGT) of prokaryotes. Based on 204 complete proteomes of archaea and bacteria spanning the temperature range from −10 °C to 110 °C. we performed an exhaustive enumeration of all possible sets of amino acids and found a set of amino acids whose total fraction in a proteome is correlated. to a remarkable extent. with the OGT. The universal set is Ile. Val. Tyr. Trp. Arg. Glu. Leu (IVYWREL). and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.93. We also found that the G + C content in 204 complete genomes does not exhibit a significant correlation with OGT (R = −0.10). On the other hand. the fraction of A + G in coding DNA is correlated with temperature. to a considerable extent. due to codon patterns of IVYWREL amino acids. Further. we found strong and independent correlation between OGT and the frequency with which pairs of A and G nucleotides appear as nearest neighbors in genome sequences.

DMD employs discrete step function potentials in place of the continuous potential used in traditional MD. As a result. the simulation engine solves the ballistic equations of motion for only those particles participating in a collision. instead of solving Newton's equations of motion for every particle in the system. Because fewer calculations are performed per time step. the DMD technique allows for longer time and length scales to become accessible in the simulation of large biomolecules.

Glutathionylation and phosphorylation of SOD1 is omnipresent in the human body. even in healthy individuals. and has been shown to increase SOD1 dimer dissociation. which is the first step on the pathway toward SOD1 aggregation. We found that post-translational modification of SOD1. especially glutathionylation. promotes dimer dissociation. We discovered an intermediate state in the pathway to dissociation. a conformational change that involves a “loosening” of the β-barrels and a loss or shift of dimer interface interactions. In modified SOD1. this intermediate state is stabilized as compared to unmodified SOD1.

Resolving their role is crucial. because residues in these networks are not viable design targets if their role is to maintain the fold of the protein.

In normoxic condition. PHD2 triggers the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) that induces the expression of hypoxia response genes. Therefore the correct function of PHD2 would inhibit angiogenesis and consequent metastasis of tumor cells in normoxic condition. PHD2 mutations were reported in some common cancers. However. high levels of HIF-1α protein were observed even in normoxic metastatic tumors with normal expression of wild type PHD2. PHD2 malfunctions due to protein misfolding may be the underlying reason of metastasis and invasion in such cases. In this study. we scrutinize the unfolding pathways of the PHD2 catalytic domain’s possible species and demonstrate the properties of their unfolding states by computational approaches. Our study introduces the possibility of aggregation disaster for the prominent species of PHD2 during its partial unfolding.

Here we performed inter-species replacement of the chromosomal folA gene. encoding an essential metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). with orthologs from 35 other mesophilic bacteria. The orthologous inter-species replacements caused a marked drop (in the range 10–90%) in bacterial growth rate despite the fact that most orthologous DHFRs are as stable as E.coli DHFR at 37°C and are more catalytically active than E. coli DHFR. Although phylogenetic distance between E. coli and orthologous DHFRs as well as their individual molecular properties correlate poorly with growth rates. the product of the intracellular DHFR abundance and catalytic activity (kcat/KM). correlates strongly with growth rates. indicating that the drop in DHFR abundance constitutes the major fitness barrier to HGT. Serial propagation of the orthologous strains for ~600 generations dramatically improved growth rates by largely alleviating the fitness barriers. Whole genome sequencing and global proteome quantification revealed that the evolved strains with the largest fitness improvements have accumulated mutations that inactivated the ATP-dependent Lon protease. causing an increase in the intracellular DHFR abundance. In one case DHFR abundance increased further due to mutations accumulated in folA promoter. but only after the lon inactivating mutations were fixed in the population.

Over 90% of CF patients carry at least one mutant allele with deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 located in the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD1). Biochemical and cell biological studies show that the ΔF508 mutant exhibits inefficient biosynthetic maturation and susceptibility to degradation probably due to misfolding of NBD1 and the resultant misassembly of other domains. However. little is known about the direct effect of the Phe508 deletion on the NBD1 folding. which is essential for rational design strategies of cystic fibrosis treatment. Here we show that the deletion of Phe508 alters the folding dynamics and kinetics of NBD1. thus possibly affecting the assembly of the complete CFTR. Using molecular dynamics simulations. we find that meta-stable intermediate states appearing on wild type and mutant folding pathways are populated differently and that their kinetic accessibilities are distinct. The structural basis of the increased misfolding propensity of the ΔF508 NBD1 mutant is the perturbation of interactions in residue pairs Q493/P574 and F575/F578 found in loop S7-H6. As a proof-of-principle that the S7-H6 loop conformation can modulate the folding kinetics of NBD1. we virtually design rescue mutations in the identified critical interactions to force the S7-H6 loop into the wild type conformation.

Whereas the O2-binding affinity of Mbs is not significantly different among mammals (with typical oxygenation constants of ∼0.8–1.2 µM−1). folding stabilities of cetacean Mbs are ∼2–4 kcal/mol higher than for terrestrial Mbs. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction. maximum likelihood and Bayesian tests to describe the evolution of cetacean Mbs. and experimentally calibrated computation of stability effects of mutations. we observe accelerated evolution in cetaceans and identify seven positively selected sites in Mb. Overall. these sites contribute to Mb stabilization with a conditional probability of 0.8. We observe a correlation between Mb folding stability and protein abundance. suggesting that a selection pressure for stability acts proportionally to higher expression. We also identify a major divergence event leading to the common ancestor of whales. during which major stabilization occurred. Most of the positively selected sites that occur later act against other destabilizing mutations to maintain stability across the clade. except for the shallow divers. where late stability relaxation occurs. probably due to the shorter aerobic dive limits of these species.

We examined changes in the nucleotide coding regions and the amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA). neuraminidase (NA). and nucleoprotein (NP) segments of the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain using publicly available data. We calculated the nucleotide and amino acid hamming distance from the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 for each sequence. We also estimated Pepitope–a measure of antigenic diversity based on changes in the epitope regions–for each isolate. Finally. we compared our results to A(H3N2) strains collected over the same period. Our analysis found that the mean hamming distance for the HA protein of the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain increased from 3.6 (standard deviation [SD]: 1.3) in 2009 to 11.7 (SD: 1.0) in 2013. while the mean hamming distance in the coding region increased from 7.4 (SD: 2.2) in 2009 to 28.3 (SD: 2.1) in 2013. These trends are broadly similar to the rate of mutation in H3N2 over the same time period. However. in contrast to H3N2 strains. the rate of mutation accumulation has slowed in recent years. Our results are notable because. over the course of the study. mutation rates in H3N2 similar to that seen with A(H1N1)pdm09 led to the emergence of two antigenic drift variants.

Numerous experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to establishing how this chemomechanical coupling occurs. However. most processive motors function as dimers. Therefore a full understanding of the motor’s performance also requires knowledge of the coordination between the chemomechanical cycles of the two heads. We consider a general two-headed model for cytoplasmic dynein that is built from experimental measurements on the chemomechanical states of monomeric dynein. We explore different possible scenarios of coordination that simultaneously satisfy two main requirements of the dimeric protein: high processivity (long run length) and high motor velocity (fast ATP turnover).

Because of the size and complexity of the protein. a detailed understanding of the mechanochemistry that drives dynein's processive motion is lacking. To overcome this deficiency. we developed the first (to our knowledge) computational model for two-headed dynein that couples conformational changes of the motor's subunits to the biochemical steps involved in ATP hydrolysis. Analysis of the model provides what we believe are several novel insights into how the protein functions: 1). structural constraints limit the motion of the free microtubule binding domain to one dimension. increasing the efficiency with which this domain finds a binding site; 2). in addition to the power stroke of the bound head. recovery of the free head to a pre-power-stroke …,True,e1lvJhcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,16,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349511006138,2496290110945891505,/scholar?cites=2496290110945891505,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349511006138,0,0,0

Dynein is a complex motor whose processive motion is driven by ATP-hydrolysis. Dynein’s run length has been measured to be several millimetres with typical velocities in the order of a few nanometres per second. Therefore. the average time between steps is a fraction of a second. When this time scale is compared with typical time scales for protein side chain and backbone movements (∼10−9 s and ∼10−5 s. respectively). it becomes clear that a multi-timescale modelling approach is required to understand energy transduction in this protein.

Even without structural optimization. our minimalistic model demonstrates a predictive power comparable to more complex methods. making the proposed approach the basis for high throughput applications.

Because of the coupling between the networks. when nodes in one network fail they cause dependent nodes in the other network to also fail. This invokes an iterative cascade of failures in both networks. When a critical fraction of nodes fail. the iterative process results in a percolation phase transition that completely fragments both networks. We show both analytically and numerically that reducing the coupling between the networks leads to a change from a first order percolation phase transition to a second order percolation transition at a critical point.

Here we describe a simple and general strategy to comprehensively map the positions of elongating and arrested RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at nucleotide resolution. We find that the entry site of the first (+1) nucleosome is a barrier to RNAPII for essentially all genes. including those undergoing regulated pausing farther upstream. In contrast to the +1 nucleosome. gene body nucleosomes are low barriers and cause RNAPII stalling both at the entry site and near the dyad axis. The extent of the +1 nucleosome barrier correlates with nucleosome occupancy but anticorrelates with enrichment of histone variant H2A.Z.

Steric clash is one of the artifacts prevalent in low-resolution structures and homology models. Steric clashes arise due to the unnatural overlap of any two nonbonding atoms in a protein structure. Usually. removal of severe steric clashes in some structures is challenging since many existing refinement programs do not accept structures with severe steric clashes.

Centromere cleavage patterns are compatible with a precisely positioned core structure. one in which each of the 16 yeast centromeres is occupied by oppositely oriented Cse4/H4/H2A/H2B hemisomes in two rotational phases within the population. Centromere-specific hemisomes are also inferred from distances observed between closely-spaced H4 cleavages. as predicted from structural modeling. Our results indicate that the orientation and rotational position of the stable hemisome at each yeast centromere is not specified by the functional centromere sequence.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01861.001,True,AXCYi5AAAAAJ:LK8CI43ZvvMC,82,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01861,8538407721061981509,/scholar?cites=8538407721061981509,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01861.pdf,0,0,0

To identify nucleosomes with alternative structures genome-wide. we used H4S47C-anchored cleavage mapping. which revealed that 5% of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) nucleosome positions have asymmetric histone-DNA interactions. These asymmetric interactions are enriched at nucleosome positions that flank promoters. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sequence-based profiles of asymmetric nucleosome positions revealed a corresponding asymmetry in MNase protection near the dyad axis. suggesting that the loss of DNA contacts around H4S47 is accompanied by protection of the DNA from MNase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation mapping of selected nucleosome remodelers indicated that asymmetric nucleosomes are bound by the RSC chromatin remodeling complex. which is …,True,AXCYi5AAAAAJ:_AeoHAGD03cC,70,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/3/381.short,14377568479127611824,/scholar?cites=14377568479127611824,,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/3/381.full.pdf,0,0,0

In order to modulate the function of ABC transporters. detailed knowledge regarding their structure and dynamics is necessary.

A frequent consequence is the oxidation of DNA nucleobases. especially guanine to 8-oxoguanosine. This highly mutagenic lesion can form base pairs with other nucleobases. does not significantly distort the DNA structure. and remains unnoticed by DNA polymerases. Detection and biophysical studies of modified nucleobases is challenging because they are not fluorescent and have broad electronic spectra that overlap with those of normal bases. The structure of 8-oxoguanosine and its anion in solution has been contentious in the literature. Using ultraviolet excitation in resonance with the nucleobase. we have obtained the Raman spectra of 8-oxoguanosine. The stable tautomer in solution is unequivocally identified as the diketone form.

To identify intermediates. we mapped subnucleosomal protections in Drosophila cells using Micrococcal Nuclease followed by sequencing. At the first nucleosome position downstream of the transcription start site. we identified unwrapped intermediates. including hexasomes that lack either proximal or distal contacts. Inhibiting topoisomerases or depleting histone chaperones increased unwrapping. whereas inhibiting release of paused RNAPII or reducing RNAPII elongation decreased unwrapping.

Evolutionary conservation is driven by either a protein's function or its thermodynamic stability. Highly conserved histone proteins offer a platform to evaluate these driving forces. While the conservation of histone H3 and H4 “tail” domains and surface residues are driven by functional importance. the driving force behind the conservation of buried histone residues has not been examined. Using a computational approach. we determined the thermodynamically preferred amino acids at each buried position in H3 and H4. In agreement with what is normally observed in proteins. we find a significant correlation between thermodynamic stability and evolutionary conservation in the buried residues in H4. In striking contrast. we find that thermodynamic stability of buried H3 residues does not correlate with evolutionary conservation. Given that these H3 residues are not post-translationally modified and only regulate H3-H3 and H3-H4 stabilizing interactions. our data imply an unknown function responsible for driving conservation of these buried H3 residues.,True,AXCYi5AAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,13,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001042,1409694944555334208,/scholar?cites=1409694944555334208,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001042,0,0,0

Disease age of onset is correlated with the polyQ insert length above a critical value of 35–40 glutamines. The aggregation kinetics of isolated polyQ peptides in vitro also shows a similar critical-length dependence. While recent experimental work has provided considerable insights into polyQ aggregation. the molecular mechanism of aggregation is not well understood. Here. using computer simulations of isolated polyQ peptides. we show that a mechanism of aggregation is the conformational transition in a single polyQ peptide chain from random coil to a parallel β-helix. This transition occurs selectively in peptides longer than 37 glutamines. In the β-helices observed in simulations. all residues adopt β-strand backbone dihedral angles. and the polypeptide chain coils around a central helical axis with 18.5 ± 2 residues per turn. We also find that mutant polyQ peptides with proline-glycine inserts show formation of antiparallel β-hairpins in their ground state. in agreement with experiments.

Based on an extensive thermodynamic analysis of the stability of apo-dimer and apo-monomer forms of these mutants. we classify the mutations into the following groups: 70 out of 75 mutations in SOD1 lead to (i) decreased dimer stability. and/or (ii) increased dimer dissociation. compared to wild type. and four mutations lead to (iii) decreased monomer stability …,True,4Y_374oAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,58,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13506120600960486,16738271058941273507,/scholar?cites=16738271058941273507,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.375.167&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The phosphorylation of its ∼ 200 amino acid R domain by protein kinase A is obligatory for channel gating under normal conditions. The R domain contains more than ten PKA phosphorylation sites. No individual site is essential but phosphorylation of increasing numbers of sites enables progressively greater channel activity. In spite of numerous studies of the role of the R domain in CFTR regulation. its mechanism of action remains largely unknown. This is because neither its structure nor its interactions with other parts of CFTR have been completely elucidated.

Over 90% of CF patients carry at least one mutant allele with deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 located in the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD1). Biochemical and cell biological studies show that the ΔF508 mutant exhibits inefficient biosynthetic maturation and susceptibility to degradation probably due to misfolding of NBD1 and the resultant misassembly of other domains. However. little is known about the direct effect of the Phe508 deletion on the NBD1 folding. which is essential for rational design strategies of cystic fibrosis treatment. Here we show that the deletion of Phe508 alters the folding dynamics and kinetics of NBD1. thus possibly affecting the assembly of the complete CFTR. Using molecular dynamics simulations. we find that meta-stable intermediate states appearing on wild type and mutant folding pathways are populated differently and that their kinetic accessibilities are distinct. The structural basis of the increased misfolding propensity of the ΔF508 NBD1 mutant is the perturbation of interactions in residue pairs Q493/P574 and F575/F578 found in loop S7-H6. As a proof-of-principle that the S7-H6 loop conformation can modulate the folding kinetics of NBD1. we virtually design rescue mutations in the identified critical interactions to force the S7-H6 loop into the wild type conformation.

A highly conserved portion of the kinase catalytic domain is modified with a small protein insert that inactivates catalytic activity but does not affect other protein functions (Fig. 1a). Catalytic activity is restored by addition of rapamycin or non-immunosuppresive rapamycin analogs.

E3. E4. differing only by two amino acids at positions 112 and 158. ApoE4 is known to be the strongest risk factor for AD onset. while ApoE3 and ApoE2 are considered to be the AD-neutral and AD-protective isoforms. respectively. It has been hypothesized that the ApoE isoforms may contribute to the development of AD by modifying the homeostasis of ApoE physiological partners and AD-related proteins in an isoform-specific fashion. Here we find that. despite the high sequence similarity among the three ApoE variants. only ApoE4 exhibits a misfolded intermediate state characterized by isoform-specific domain-domain interactions in molecular dynamics simulations. The existence of an ApoE4-specific intermediate state can contribute to the onset of AD by altering multiple cellular pathways involved in ApoE-dependent lipid transport efficiency or in AD-related protein aggregation and clearance. We present what we believe to be the first structural model of an ApoE4 misfolded intermediate state. which may serve to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the role of ApoE4 in AD pathogenesis.

Recently. an alternative six trans-membrane helix isoform of mOR. (6TM-mOR) has been identified. but its function and signaling are still largely unknown. Here. we present the structural and functional mechanisms of 6TM-mOR signaling activity upon binding to morphine. Our data suggest that despite the similarity of binding modes of the alternative 6TM-mOR and the dominant seven trans-membrane helix variant (7TM-mOR). the interaction with morphine generates different dynamic responses in the two receptors. thus. promoting the activation of different mOR-specific signaling pathways. We characterize a series of 6TM-mOR-specific cellular responses. and observed that they are significantly different from those for 7TM-mOR. Morphine stimulation of 6TM-mOR does not promote a cellular cAMP response. while it increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and reduces the cellular K+ conductance. Our findings indicate that 6TM-mOR has a unique contribution to the cellular opioid responses.

A number of algorithms have been proposed to obtain such classifications. These algorithms usually require parameter optimization to obtain accurate results depending on the type of data. Additionally. it is highly critical to find an optimal set of markers among those up or down regulated genes that can be clinically utilized to build assays for the diagnosis or to follow progression of specific cancer types. In this paper. we employ a mixed integer programming based classification algorithm named hyper-box enclosure method (HBE) for the classification of some cancer types with a minimal set of predictor genes. This optimization based method which is a user friendly and efficient classifier may allow the clinicians to diagnose and follow progression of certain cancer types.

Here. we describe the generation of a biosensor based on the DARPin binding scaffold suited for intracellular applications. Combining library selection and knowledge-based design. we created an ERK activity biosensor by derivatizing a DARPin specific for phosphorylated ERK with a solvatochromatic merocyanine dye. whose fluorescence increases upon pERK binding. The biosensor specifically responded to pERK2. recognized by its conformation. but not to ERK2 or other closely related mitogen-activated kinases tested.

Therefore. the use of therapeutic agents that regulate the activity of IDE would be a viable approach towards generating pharmaceutical treatments for these diseases. Crystal structure of IDE revealed that N-terminal has an exosite which is ∼30 Å away from the catalytic region and serves as a regulation site by orientation of the substrates of IDE to the catalytic site. It is possible to find small molecules that bind to the exosite of IDE and enhance its proteolytic activity towards different substrates.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. we applied structure based drug design method combined with experimental methods to discover four novel molecules that enhance the activity of human IDE. The novel compounds. designated as D3. D4.

Here we implement a framework to profile cellular morphodynamics based on an adaptive decomposition of local cell boundary motion into instantaneous frequency spectra defined by the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). Our approach revealed that spontaneously migrating cells with approximately homogeneous molecular makeup show remarkably consistent instantaneous frequency distributions. though they have markedly heterogeneous mobility. Distinctions in cell edge motion between these cells are captured predominantly by differences in the magnitude of the frequencies. We found that acute photo-inhibition of Vav2 guanine exchange factor. an activator of the Rho family of signaling proteins coordinating cell motility. produces significant shifts in the frequency distribution. but does not affect frequency magnitude. We therefore concluded that the frequency spectrum encodes the wiring of the molecular circuitry that regulates cell boundary movements. whereas the magnitude captures the activation level of the circuitry. We also used HHT spectra as multi-scale spatiotemporal features in statistical region merging to identify subcellular regions of distinct motion behavior. In line with our conclusion that different HHT spectra relate to different signaling regimes. we found that subcellular regions with different morphodynamics indeed exhibit distinct Rac1 activities.

As with all GTPases. their activity is determined by their guanine nucleotide-bound state. Understanding how Rho proteins are activated and inactivated has largely focused on regulatory proteins such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). However. recent in vitro studies have indicated that GTPases may also be directly regulated by redox agents. We hypothesized that this redox-based mechanism occurs in cells and affects cytoskeletal dynamics. and in this report we conclude this is indeed a novel mechanism of regulating the GTPase RhoA.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this report. we show that RhoA can be directly activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. and that this requires two critical cysteine residues located in a unique redox-sensitive motif within the phosphoryl binding loop. First. we show that ROS can reversibly activate RhoA and induce stress fiber formation. a well characterized readout of RhoA activity. To determine the role of cysteine residues in this mechanism of regulation. we generated cysteine to alanine RhoA mutants. Mutation of these cysteines abolishes ROS-mediated activation and stress fiber formation. indicating that these residues are critical for redox-regulation of RhoA. Importantly. these mutants maintain the ability to be activated by GEFs.

Therefore. our identification of a second Ras-binding site in the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (residues 139-184) was unexpected and suggested a more complex role for Ras in Raf-1 activation. Both Ras recognition domains preferentially associate with Ras-GTP. Therefore. mutations that impair Ras activity by perturbing regions that distinguish Ras-GDP from Ras-GTP (switch I and II) may disrupt interactions with either Raf-1-binding domain.

We recently reported that Ras interaction with the Raf-1 cysteine-rich domain (Raf-CRD. residues 139–184) may be required for Raf-1 activation. The Raf-CRD is located in the NH2-terminal negative regulatory domain of Raf-1 and is highly homologous to cysteine-rich domains found in protein kinase C family members. Recent studies indicate that the structural integrity of the Raf-CRD is also critical for Raf-1 interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However. whether 14-3-3 proteins interact directly with the Raf-CRD and how this interaction may mediate Raf-1 function has not been determined. In the present study. we demonstrate that 14-3-3 ζ binds directly to the isolated Raf-CRD.

1220238,Molecular basis for Rho GTPase signaling specificity,2004,Antoine E Karnoub and Marc Symons and Sharon L Campbell and Channing J Der,84,,1,61-71,Kluwer Academic Publishers,There is now considerable evidence for the involvement of aberrant Rho GTPase activation in breast cancer development. Like Ras. Rho GTPases function as signaling nodes regulated by diverse extracellular stimuli. Rho GTPase activation is facilitated by multiple regulatory proteins. in particular guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as Dbl family proteins. Activated Rho GTPases in turn interact with and regulate a spectrum of functionally diverse downstream effectors. initiating a network of cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling cascades. Thus. Rho GTPases represent points of signaling convergence as well as relay switches that disseminate signaling divergence. In this review. we highlight issues relating to the structural basis by which Dbl family GEFs facilitate signaling convergence and Rho GTPase activation. and how Rho GTPases promote signal dissemination through downstream effectors.,True,um2p1ecAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,138,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:BREA.0000018427.84929.5c,3676339352197291200,/scholar?cites=3676339352197291200,,,0,0,0

We find that COMT binds SAM via an induced-fit mechanism. where SAM adopts a different docking pose in the absence of metal and substrate in comparison to the holoenzyme. Flexible modeling of the active site side-chains is essential for observing the lowest energy state in the apoenzyme; rigid docking tools are unable to recapitulate the pose unless the appropriate side-chain conformations are given a priori. From our docking results. we hypothesize that the metal reorients SAM in a conformation suitable for donating its methyl substituent to the recipient ligand.

While analytical treatments of crowding may consider the effect as a potential of average force acting to compress a polypeptide chain into a compact state. the use of simulations enables the presence of crowding reagents to be treated explicitly. Using an analytically solvable toy model for protein folding. an approximate statistical thermodynamic method is directly compared to simulation in order to gauge the effectiveness of current analytical crowding descriptions.

Different subtypes of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors are suggested to be associated with different types of pain responses. Here we show that serotonin also inhibits catechol Omethyltransferase (COMT). an enzyme that contributes to modultion the perception of pain. via non-competitive binding to the site bound by catechol substrates with a binding affinity comparable to the binding affinity of catechol itself (Ki=44 μM). Using computational modeling. biochemical tests and cellular assays we show that serotonin actively competes with the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) within the catalytic site.

Loss-of-function diseases arise as a consequence of protein misfolding and degradation. which lead to system failures. The ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) results in the absence of the cell surface chloride channel and a loss of airway hydration. leading to the premature lung failure and reduced lifespan responsible for cystic fibrosis. We now show that the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) restores surface channel activity in human primary airway epithelia to levels that are 28% of those of wild-type CFTR.

Precise regulation of ASL volume is essential for efficient mucus clearance and too great a reduction in ASL volume causes mucus dehydration and mucus stasis which contributes to chronic airway infection. The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is the rate-limiting step that governs Na+ absorption in the airways. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that ENaC is a critical determinant of ASL volume and hence mucus clearance.

The mutant protein escapes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control at low temperature. but is rapidly cleared from the distal secretory pathway and degraded in lysosomes. CF cells accumulate free cholesterol similar to Niemann-Pick disease type C cells. We show that this lipid alteration is caused by the presence of misassembled mutant CFTR proteins. including ΔF508. in the distal secretory pathway rather than the absence of functional CFTR. By contrast. cholesterol distribution is not changed by either D572N CFTR. which does not mature even at low temperature. or G551D. which is processed normally but is inactive.

CFTR functions as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent anion channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial surfaces. and disruption of these ion transport processes plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CF. These findings provided the rationale for pharmacologic modulation of ion transport. either by targeting mutant CFTR or alternative ion channels that can compensate for CFTR dysfunction. as a promising therapeutic approach.

Deletion of a single residue (Phe508) in the first nucleotide‐binding domain (NBD1). which occurs in most patients with cystic fibrosis. impairs both maturation and function of the protein. However. substitution of the Phe508 with small uncharged amino acids. including cysteine. is permissive for maturation. To explore the possible role of the phenylalanine aromatic side chain in channel gating we introduced a cysteine at this position in cysless CFTR. enabling its selective chemical modification by sulfhydryl reagents.

The permeability distributions to be averaged over are based on samples taken from cores and from logs using correlations between permeabilities and porosities and from other sources. It is necessary to use a suitable ‘effective’ value determined from this sample. The effective value is a single value for an equivalent homogeneous block. Conventionally. this effective value has been determined from a simple estimate such as the geometric mean or a detailed numerical solution of the single phase flow equation.If the permeability fluctuations are small then perturbation theory or effective medium theory (EMT) give reliable estimates of the effective permeability.

An interface between the fluids is unstable against small perturbations and gives rise to a fingered configuration. In the oil industry viscous fingering can be a serious problem when displacing viscous oil by a more mobile fluid because it leads to poor recovery of the hydrocarbon. Recent work suggests an analogy between viscous fingering at an infinite viscosity ratio and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) and hence that the fingers may be fractal with a fractal dimension of around 1.7 (in two dimensions).

1220317,A renormalisation-based upscaling technique for WAG floods in heterogeneous reservoirs,1995,MA Christie and Mark Mansfield and PR King and JW Barker and ID Culverwell,,,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,A novel and rapid upscaling procedure is described in which: 1) pseudofunctions are generated for each block in a coarse grid; 2) a renormalisation method is used to calculate the pseudofunctions; 3) an empirical viscous fingering model is used to allow for fluid instabilities in unfavourable mobility ratio displacements. Oil recovery predictions are shown to agree well with conventional simulations made on the fine (geological model) grid for unstable. first-contact miscible WAG floods with a range of permeability distributions. In all cases. the result is an improvement (usually a substantial one) over a conventional coarse grid model in which only the absolute permeability of each block is upscaled.,True,XbLMcPkAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,56,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-29127-MS,4561142436281911041,/scholar?cites=4561142436281911041,,,0,0,0

Because we only have a stochastic view of the distribution of rock properties we need to predict the uncertainty in the breakthrough time and post-breakthrough behaviour in order to calculate the economic risk. In this paper we use percolation theory to predict (i) the distribution of the chemical path (shortest path) between two points (representing well pairs) at a given Euclidean separation and present a scaling hypothesis for this distribution which is confirmed by numerical simulation.

1220319,Generation of correlated properties in heterogeneous porous media,1988,PR King and PJ Smith,20,Mathematical geology,7,863-877,Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers,The spatial distribution of rock properties in porous media. such as permeability and porosity. often is strongly variable. Therefore. these properties usefully may be considered as a random field. However. this variability is correlated frequently on length scales comparable to geological lengths (for example. scales of sand bodies or facies). To solve various engineering problems (for example. in the oil recovery process) numerical models of a porous medium often are used. A need exists then to understand correlated random fields and to generate them over discretized numerical grids.

The connectivity of fractures. embedded in low-permeability zones. can control fluid movement and influence field performance. This can be analyzed using percolation theory. This approach uses the hypothesis that the permeability map can be split into either permeable (ie. fracture) or impermeable (ie. matrix) portions and assumes that the connectivity of fractures controls the flow. The analysis of the connectivity based on finite-size scaling assumes that fractures all have the same sizes.

1220356,RNA recognition by Tat-derived peptides: interaction in the major groove?,1991,Kevin M Weeks and Donald M Crothers,66,Cell,3,577-588,Cell Press,Replication of human immunodeficiency virus requires binding of the viral Tat protein to its RNA target sequence TAR; peptides derived from Tat bind to a TAR “contact site” spanning 5 bp and a trinucleotide pyrimidine bulge. We find that high affinity binding requires a U residue in the bulge loop and 2 specific adjacent base pairs. Other bulged RNAs bind in a lower affinity nonspecific manner; sequence-specific binding requires a bulge loop of more than 1 nucleotide. Reaction with diethyl pyrocarbonate indicates that one effect of the bulge is to make the otherwise deep and narrow RNA major groove accessible. A model consistent with these data involves local distortion of A-form geometry at the bulge. which bends the helix and permits protein binding and interactive access in the RNA major groove.,True,hP84XhAAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,392,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867481900209,14932295389716032320,/scholar?cites=14932295389716032320,,,0,0,0

SHAPE chemistry exploits structure-based gating of the nucleophilic reactivity of the ribose 2‘-hydroxyl group by the extent to which a nucleotide is constrained or flexible.

The mechanism of nitric oxide action on the cardiac calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) (CRC) in canines was explored. This tetrameric channel contains ∼84 free thiols and is S-nitrosylated in vivo. S-Nitrosylation of up to 12 sites (3 per CRC subunit) led to progressive channel activation that was reversed by denitrosylation. In contrast. oxidation of 20 to 24 thiols per CRC (5 or 6 per subunit) had no effect on channel function.

The skeletal muscle calcium release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is one prominent example. Here we report that pO2 dynamically controls the redox state of 6–8 out of 50 thiols in each RyR1 subunit and thereby tunes the response to NO. At physiological pO2. nanomolar NO activates the channel by S-nitrosylating a single cysteine residue. Among sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins. S-nitrosylation is specific to RyR1 and its effect on the channel is calmodulin dependent. Neither activation nor S-nitrosylation of the channel occurs at ambient pO2.

A classical φ 4 model in the presence of a constant electric field is used as a conceptual basis.

As polymers of subunit proteins (“tubulin”). which are each dipoles. microtubules are thus lattices of oriented dipoles. In general. three types of arrangements of dipoles in lattices may occur: (i) random. (ii) ferroelectric (parallel-aligned) and (iii) an intermediate weakly ferroelectric phase. which is length-dependent. Because of involvement in dynamical cell activities (movement. growth. mitosis. differentiation. etc.). models of microtubule signaling and information processing have been proposed. In these. tubulin units are assumed to represent informational “bit states” and to be coupled to intra-tubulin dipoles.

Here. we investigate their polyelectrolyte character that plays a very important role in ionic transport throughout the intra-cellular environment. The model we propose demonstrates an essentially nonlinear behavior of ionic currents which are guided by microtubules. These features are primarily due to the dynamics of tubulin C-terminal tails which are extended out of the surface of the microtubule cylinder. We also demonstrate that the origin of nonlinearity stems from the nonlinear capacitance of each tubulin dimer.

Second. the orientational pattern of striped microtubule domains is consistent with predictions from a phenomenological Landau-Ginzburg free energy expansion in terms of an orientational order parameter.,True,mcTL6KsAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,38,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.68.021903,3165915963890500184,/scholar?cites=3165915963890500184,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephanie_Portet/publication/9067047_Models_of_spatial_and_orientational_self-organization_of_microtubules_under_the_influence_of_gravitational_fields/links/0912f512652bace47c000000/Models-of-spatial-and-orientational-self-organization-of-microtubules-under-the-influence-of-gravitational-fields.pdf,0,0,0

We rely on the ferroelectric model of MTs published earlier by Satarić et al. [1] where the motion of MT subunits is reduced to a single longitudinal degree of freedom per dimer. It is shown that such nonlinear model can lead to existence of kink solitons moving along the MTs. An analytical solution of the basic equation. describing MT dynamics. was compared with the numerical one and a perfect agreement was demonstrated. It is now clearer how the values of the basic parameters of the model. proportional to viscosity and internal electric field. impact MT dynamics.

1220420,Nonlinear dynamics of microtubules: biophysical implications,2005,MV Sataric and JA Tuszynski,31,Journal of biological physics,3,487-500,Kluwer Academic Publishers,A recently developed model of nonlinear dynamics for microtubules is further expanded based on the biophysical arguments involving the secondary structure of the constitutive protein tubulin and on the ferroelectric properties of microtubules. It is demonstrated that kink excitations arise due to GTP hydrolysis that causes a dynamical transition in the structure of tubulin. The presence of an intrinsic electric field associated with the structure of a microtubule leads to unidirectional propagation of the kink excitation along the microtubule axis. This mechanism offers an explanation of the dynamic instability phenomenon in terms of the electric field effects.

Shift maps for docetaxel and laulimalide are otherwise identical. indicating a common state of microtubule stability induced by occupancy of the distinct sites. The preferred binding mode highlights the penetration of the laulimalide side chain into a deep. narrow cavity through a unique conformation not strongly populated in solution. akin to a “striking cobra.” This mode supports the development of a pharmacophore model and reveals the importance of the C1–C15 axis in the macrocycle.,True,j-f21_sAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,127,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552110002103,3934940050737408695,/scholar?cites=3934940050737408695,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074552110002103,0,0,0

As the neuronal cytoskeleton is extremely complex. it is no wonder that a startling number of neurodegenerative disorders (including but not limited to Alzheimer’s disease.

Recently. concern has been raised about a possible link between anesthesia. post-operative cognitive dysfunction. and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental investigations suggest that anesthetics bind to and affect cytoskeletal microtubules. and that anesthesia-related cognitive dysfunction involves microtubule instability. hyper-phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. and tau separation from microtubules. However. exact mechanisms are yet to be identified. In this paper the interaction of anesthetics with the microtubule subunit protein tubulin is investigated using computer-modeling methods. Homology modeling. molecular dynamics simulations and surface geometry techniques were used to determine putative binding sites for volatile anesthetics on tubulin. This was followed by free energy based docking calculations for halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1.1.1-trifluoroethane) on the tubulin body. and C-terminal regions for specific tubulin isotypes.

Resistance to platinum-based therapy correlates with high expression of ERCC1. a major element of the NER machinery. The interaction between ERCC1 and XPA is essential for a successful NER function. Therefore. one way to regulate NER is by inhibiting the activity of ERCC1 and XPA.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here we continued our earlier efforts aimed at the identification and characterization of novel inhibitors of the ERCC1-XPA interaction. We used a refined virtual screening approach combined with a biochemical and biological evaluation of the compounds for their ability to interact with ERCC1 and to sensitize cells to UV radiation. Our findings reveal a new validated ERCC1-XPA inhibitor that significantly sensitized colon cancer cells to UV radiation indicating a strong inhibition of the ERCC1-XPA interaction.   Conclusions NER is a major factor in acquiring resistance to platinum-based therapy. Regulating the NER pathway has the potential of improving the efficacy of platinum treatments. One approach that we followed is to inhibit the essential interaction between the two NER elements. ERCC1 and XPA. Here. we performed virtual screening against the ERCC1-XPA interaction and identified novel inhibitors that block the XPA-ERCC1 binding.

T cells are exposed to persistent antigen stimulation. This results in expression of multiple inhibitory receptors also called “immune checkpoints” by T cells. Although these inhibitory receptors under normal conditions maintain self-tolerance and prevent immunopathology. their sustained expression deteriorates T cell function: a phenomenon called exhaustion. Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy involve blockade of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Cell Death 1 (PD-1) in order to reverse T cell exhaustion and reinvigorate immunity. which has translated to dramatic clinical remission in many cases of metastatic melanoma and lung cancer. With the paucity of therapeutic vaccines against chronic infections such as HIV. HPV. HBV and HCV. such adjunct checkpoint blockade strategies are required including the blockade of other inhibitory receptors such as TIGIT. TIM-3. LAG-3 and VISTA. The nature of different chronic viral infections and cancers is likely to influence the level. composition and pattern of inhibitory receptors expressed by responding T cells. This will have implications for checkpoint antibody blockade strategies employed for treating tumors and chronic viral infections. Here we review recent advances that provide a clearer insight into the role of co-inhibitory receptor expression in T cell exhaustion and reveal novel antibody-blockade therapeutic targets for chronic viral infections and cancer. Understanding the mechanism of T cell exhaustion in response to chronic virus infections and cancer as well as the nature of restored T cell responses will contribute to …,True,j-f21_sAAAAJ:FkBsMxS_Bp0C,49,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01215/full,4958813141622475756,/scholar?cites=4958813141622475756,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01215/full,0,0,0

In about half of human cancers. the protein is inactivated by mutations located primarily in its DNA-binding domain. Interestingly. a number of these mutations possess temperature-induced DNA-binding characteristics. A striking example is the mutation of Arg248 into glutamine or tryptophan. These mutants are defective for binding to DNA at 310 K although they have been shown to bind specifically to several p53 response elements at sub-physiological temperatures (298–306 K).   Methodology/Principal Findings This important experimental finding motivated us to examine the effects of temperature on the structure and configuration of R248Q mutant and compare it to the wild type protein. Our aim is to determine how and where structural changes of mutant variants take place due to temperature changes. To answer these questions. we compared the mutant to the wild-type proteins from two different aspects. First. we investigated the systems at the atomistic level through their DNA-binding affinity. hydrogen bond networks and spatial distribution of water molecules. Next. we assessed changes in their long-lived conformational motions at the coarse-grained level through the collective dynamics of their side-chain and backbone atoms separately.   Conclusions The experimentally observed effect of temperature on the DNA-binding properties of p53 is reproduced. Analysis of atomistic and coarse-grained data reveal that changes in binding are determined by a few key residues and provide a rationale for the mutant-loss of binding at physiological temperatures.

Attributable morbidity and mortality remains exceptionally high. Vaccines offer the potential to prime a pathogen-specific immune response and subsequently reduce disease burden. Routine vaccination has fundamentally altered the natural history of many frequently observed and serious infections. Vaccination is also recommended for persons at increased risk of severe vaccine-preventable disease. Many current nonadjuvanted vaccines are poorly effective in the elderly and immunocompromised populations. resulting in nonprotective postvaccine antibody titres. which serve as surrogate markers for protection. The vaccine-induced immune response is influenced by:(i.) vaccine factors ie. type and composition of the antigen (s).(ii.) host factors ie. genetic differences in immune-signalling or senescence. and (iii.) external factors such as immunosuppressive drugs or diseases.

The particular characteristics of microtubules suitable for quantum effects include their crystal-like lattice structure. hollow inner core. organization of cell function and capacity for information processing.

Some philosophers have contended that ‘qualia’. or an experiential medium from which consciousness is derived. exists as a fundamental component of reality. Whitehead. for example. described the universe as being comprised of ‘occasions of experience’. To examine this possibility scientifically. the very nature of physical reality must be re-examined. We must come to terms with the physics of space-time -- as is described by Einstein's general theory of relativity -- and its relation to the fundamental theory of matter -- as described by quantum theory. This leads us to employ a new physics of objective reduction: OR which appeals to a form of ‘quantum gravity’ to provide a useful description of fundamental processes at the quantum/classical borderline (Penrose. 1994; 1996).

This suggests synaptic information is encoded and ‘hard-wired’ elsewhere. e.g. at molecular levels within the post-synaptic neuron. In long-term potentiation (LTP). a cellular and molecular model for memory. post-synaptic calcium ion (Ca2+) flux activates the hexagonal Ca2+-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII). a dodacameric holoenzyme containing 2 hexagonal sets of 6 kinase domains. Each kinase domain can either phosphorylate substrate proteins. or not (i.e. encoding one bit). Thus each set of extended CaMKII kinases can potentially encode synaptic Ca2+ information via phosphorylation as ordered arrays of binary ‘bits’. Candidate sites for CaMKII phosphorylation-encoded molecular memory include microtubules (MTs). cylindrical organelles whose surfaces represent a regular lattice with a pattern of hexagonal polymers of the protein tubulin. Using molecular mechanics modeling and electrostatic profiling. we find that spatial dimensions and geometry of the extended CaMKII kinase domains precisely match those of MT hexagonal lattices. This suggests sets of six CaMKII kinase domains phosphorylate hexagonal MT lattice neighborhoods collectively. e.g. conveying synaptic information as ordered arrays of six “bits”. and thus “bytes”. with 64 to 5.281 possible bit states per CaMKII-MT byte.

1220471,The entwined mysteries of anesthesia and consciousness: is there a common underlying mechanism?,2006,Stuart R Hameroff,105,,2,400-412,The American Society of Anesthesiologists,THE mechanism by which general anesthetics prevent consciousness remains unknown largely because the mechanism by which brain physiology produces consciousness is unexplained. But the two mysteries seem to share a critical feature—both consciousness and actions of anesthetic gases are mediated through extremely weak London forces (a type of van der Waals force) acting in hydrophobic pockets within dendritic proteins arrayed in synchronized brain systems. Unraveling this common thread may reveal not only how anesthetics act. but also why we are conscious in the first place. What is anesthesia? Anesthesia provides immobility. amnesia. and loss of conscious awareness. although the latter—loss of consciousness—is often omitted from operational definitions. 1 In recent years. putative sites of anesthetic action for immobility (spinal cord2). amnesia (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 3 amygdala4). and loss of consciousness (networks involving thalamocortical and intracortical—corticocortical—loops. prefrontal cortex. and other areas5. 6) have been discriminated both anatomically and in terms of sensitivity to anesthetics. Immobility is least sensitive to anesthetics. followed by loss of consciousness and then amnesia. which is most anesthetic sensitive. 7 (Implicit memory may occur without consciousness or movement. but at light levels of anesthetic. 8) Therefore. lack of movement—even though mediated by spinal cord rather than brain—in the absence of muscle relaxants is a good indicator of both loss of consciousness and amnesia.

1220472,Consciousness. neurobiology and quantum mechanics: The case for a connection,2006,Stuart Hameroff,,,,193-253,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Consciousness is generally considered to emerge from synaptic computation among brain neurons. but this approach cannot account for its critical features. The Penrose-Hameroff “Orch OR” model suggests that consciousness is a sequence of quantum computations in microtubules within brain neurons. shielded from decoherence to reach threshold for objective reduction (OR). the Penrose quantum gravity solution to the measurement problem.

And if such states could survive within neuronal cell interiors. how could quantum states grow to encompass the whole brain?

The Penrose-Hameroff theory of ‘orchestrated objective reduction’ (‘Orch OR’) identifies discrete conscious moments with quantum computations in microtubules inside brain neurons. e.g. 40 per second in concert with gamma synchrony EEG. Microtubules organize neuronal interiors and regulate synapses. In Orch OR. microtubule quantum computations occur in integration phases in dendrites and cell bodies of integrate-and-fire brain neurons connected and synchronized by gap junctions. allowing entanglement of microtubules among many neurons. Quantum computations in entangled microtubules terminate by Penrose ‘objective reduction’ (‘OR’). a proposal for quantum state reduction and conscious moments linked to fundamental spacetime geometry. Each OR reduction selects microtubule states which can trigger axonal firings. and control behavior. The quantum computations are ‘orchestrated’ by synaptic inputs and memory (thus ‘Orch OR’).

This suggests synaptic information is encoded and ‘hard-wired’ elsewhere. e.g. at molecular levels within the post-synaptic neuron. In long-term potentiation (LTP). a cellular and molecular model for memory. post-synaptic calcium ion (Ca2+) flux activates the hexagonal Ca2+-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII). a dodacameric holoenzyme containing 2 hexagonal sets of 6 kinase domains. Each kinase domain can either phosphorylate substrate proteins. or not (i.e. encoding one bit). Thus each set of extended CaMKII kinases can potentially encode synaptic Ca2+ information via phosphorylation as ordered arrays of binary ‘bits’. Candidate sites for CaMKII phosphorylation-encoded molecular memory include microtubules (MTs). cylindrical organelles whose surfaces represent a regular lattice with a pattern of hexagonal polymers of the protein tubulin. Using molecular mechanics modeling and electrostatic profiling. we find that spatial dimensions and geometry of the extended CaMKII kinase domains precisely match those of MT hexagonal lattices. This suggests sets of six CaMKII kinase domains phosphorylate hexagonal MT lattice neighborhoods collectively. e.g. conveying synaptic information as ordered arrays of six “bits”. and thus “bytes”. with 64 to 5.281 possible bit states per CaMKII-MT byte.

As the neuronal cytoskeleton is extremely complex. it is no wonder that a startling number of neurodegenerative disorders (including but not limited to Alzheimer’s disease. Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease) share the common feature of a dysfunctional neuronal cytoskeleton. Recently. concern has been raised about a possible link between anesthesia. post-operative cognitive dysfunction. and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental investigations suggest that anesthetics bind to and affect cytoskeletal microtubules. and that anesthesia-related cognitive dysfunction involves microtubule instability. hyper-phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. and tau separation from microtubules. However. exact mechanisms are yet to be identified. In this paper the interaction of anesthetics with the microtubule subunit protein tubulin is investigated using computer-modeling methods. Homology modeling. molecular dynamics simulations and surface geometry techniques were used to determine putative binding sites for volatile anesthetics on tubulin.

Here. we measured the extent to which overnight total sleep deprivation (SD) in young adult humans can influence systemic (plasma-derived) redox-metabolism including the major antioxidant. glutathione as well as DNA methylation levels. Nineteen participants (n = 19. μ age = 21. SD = 3.09) underwent morning testing before and after overnight total SD. Biochemical measures before and after SD revealed that glutathione.

Biochemical and physiological components do not exist in isolation but instead are part of a tightly integrated network of interacting elements that ensure robustness and support the emergence of complex behavior. This integration permeates all levels of biology from gene regulation. to immune cell signaling. to coordinated patterns of neuronal activity and the resulting psychosocial interaction. Systems biology is an emerging branch of science that sits as a translational catalyst at the interface of the life and computational sciences.

We describe the dynamic origin of the high efficiency and precise targeting of Taq activity in PCR. The spatiotemporal distribution of interaction couplings. frequencies. amplitudes. and phase modulations comprise a pattern of fields which constitutes the electromagnetic image of DNA in the surrounding water. which is what the polymerase enzyme actually recognizes in the DNA water environment. The experimental realization of PCR amplification. achieved through replacement of the DNA template by the treatment of pure water with electromagnetic signals recorded from viral and bacterial DNA solutions. is found consistent with the gauge theory paradigm of quantum fields.

Discovering novel treatment strategies for such a complex chronic illness is extremely expensive. carries a high probability of failure and a lengthy cycle time. Repurposing Food and Drug Administration approved drugs offers a cost-effective solution with a significantly abbreviated timeline. Here. we explore drug re-purposing opportunities in GWI by combining systems biology and bioinformatics techniques with pharmacogenomic information to find overlapping elements in gene expression linking GWI to successfully treated diseases. Gene modules were defined based on cellular function and their activation estimated from the differential expression of each module’s constituent genes. These gene modules were then cross-referenced with drug atlas and pharmacogenomic databases to identify agents currently used successfully for treatment in other diseases. To explore the clinical use of these drugs in illnesses similar to GWI we compared gene expression patterns in modules that were significantly expressed in GWI with expression patterns in those same modules in other illnesses.

GWI symptoms span several of the body’s principal regulatory systems and include debilitating fatigue. severe musculoskeletal pain. cognitive and neurological problems. Using computational models. our group reported previously that GWI might be perpetuated at least in part by natural homeostatic regulation of the neuroendocrine-immune network. In this work. we attempt to harness these regulatory dynamics to identify treatment courses that might produce lasting remission. Towards this we apply a combinatorial optimization scheme to the Monte Carlo simulation of a discrete ternary logic model that represents combined hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA). gonadal (HPG). and immune system regulation in males. In this work we found that no single intervention target allowed a robust return to normal homeostatic control. All combined interventions leading to a predicted remission involved an initial inhibition of Th1 inflammatory cytokines (Th1Cyt) followed by a subsequent inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor function (GR). These first two intervention events alone ended in stable and lasting return to the normal regulatory control in 40% of the simulated cases. Applying a second cycle of this combined treatment improved this predicted remission rate to 2 out of 3 simulated subjects (63%).

Consciousness correlates strongly with coherent neural oscillations. however the mechanisms by which neurons synchronize are not fully elucidated. Recent experimental evidence of quantum beats in light-harvesting complexes of plants (LHCII) and bacteria provided a stimulus for seeking similar effects in important structures found in animal cells. especially in neurons.

Experimental evidence suggests that both microtubules and actin filaments act as biological electrical wires that can transmit and amplify electric signals via the flow of condensed ion clouds. The potential transmission of electrical signals via the cytoskeleton is of extreme importance to the electrical activity of neurons in general. In this regard. the unique structure. geometry and electrostatics of microtubules are discussed with the expected impact on their specific functions within the neuron. Electric circuit models of ionic flow along microtubules are discussed in the context of experimental data. and the specific importance of both the tubulin C-terminal tail regions. and the nano-pore openings lining the microtubule wall is elucidated.

Based on the results of Brownian dynamics simulations. the nanopores were found to have asymmetric inner and outer conductances. manifested as nonlinear I V curves.

T cell based immune response is involved with practically every part of human physiology. and high-throughput biology needed to follow the T-cell repertoire has made great leaps with the advent of massive parallel sequencing \citep{pmid_22043864}. Nevertheless. tools to handle and observe the dynamics of this complexity have only recently started to emerge e.g. \citep{pmid_26589402. pmid_27153709. pmid_27297497} in parallel with sequencing technologies. Here. we present a network-based view of the dynamics of the T cell repertoire. during the course of mammary tumors development in a mouse model. The transition from the T cell receptor as a feature. to network-based clustering. followed by network-based temporal analyses. provides novel insights to the workings of the system and provides novel tools to observe cancer progression via the perspective of the immune system. The crux of the approach here is at the network-motivated clustering. The purpose of the clustering step is not merely data reduction and exposing structures. but rather to detect hubs. or attractors. within the T cell receptor repertoire that might shed light on the behavior of the immune system as a dynamic network. The {\bf Clone-Attractor} is in fact an extension of the clone concept. i.e.. instead of looking at particular clones we observe the extended clonal network by assigning clusters to graph nodes and edges to adjacent clusters (editing distance metric).

1220531,Analytical study of the interplay between architecture and predictability,1998,Avner Priel and Ido Kanter and David A Kessler,,Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems,,315-321,MORGAN KAUFMANN PUBLISHERS,We study model feed forward networks as time series predictors in the stationary limit. The focus is on complex. yet non-chaotic. behavior. The main question we address is whether the asymptotic behavior is governed by the architecture. regardless the details of the weights. We find hierarchies among classes of architectures with respect to the attractor dimension of the long term sequence they are capable of generating; larger number of hidden units can generate higher dimensional attractors. In the case of a perceptron. we develop the stationary solution for general weights. and show that the flow is typically one dimensional. The relaxation time from an arbitrary initial condition to the stationary solution is found to scale linearly with the size of the network. In multilayer networks. the number of hidden units gives bounds on the number and dimension of the possible attractors. We conclude that long term prediction (in the non-chaotic regime) with such models is governed by attractor dynamics related to the architecture.Neural networks provide an important tool as model free estimators for the solution of problems when the real model is unknown. or weakly known. In the last decade there has been a growing interest in the application of such tools in the area of time series prediction (see Weigand and Gershenfeld. 1994).

We show that the Reissner-Nördstrom metric is an exact solution of the effective Einstein equations on the brane. re-interpreted as a black hole without electric charge. but with instead a tidal `charge' arising via gravitational effects from the fifth dimension. The tidal correction to the Schwarzschild potential is negative. which is impossible in general relativity. and in this case only one horizon is admitted. located outside the Schwarzschild horizon. The solution satisfies a closed system of equations on the brane. and describes the strong-gravity regime.

Based on the results of Brownian dynamics simulations. the nanopores were found to have asymmetric inner and outer conductances. manifested as nonlinear I V curves.

In this paper. we use Trichotomous Markov Noise (TMN) as a framework for studying MTs dynamics in its three transition states. We then apply Compressed Sensing (CS) to the experimental data of MT length and apply peak detection in the wavelet domain to efficiently detect the three transition states of MTs. One of the novelties of our method is in detecting the peaks and encoding them simultaneously in the wavelet domain without having the need to do further processing after decoding stage. Experimental results show that using CS in conjunction with wavelets provides better compression and reconstruction performance comparing to the traditional sampling schemes.

As an example of the latter. we both experimentally and theoretically study the perturbation of microtubule dynamic instability by S-methyl-D-DM1. a synthetic derivative of the microtubule-targeted agent maytansine and a potential anticancer agent. Our model predicts that among the drugs that act locally at the microtubule tip. primary inhibition of the loss of GDP tubulin results in stronger damping of microtubule dynamics than inhibition of GTP tubulin addition.

Microtubules are frequently modelled as one-dimensional bionanowires that act as ion transporters in the cell. In this work. we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure the hydrodynamic diameter of tubulin in the presence of a polar aprotic co-solvent. We found that the hydrodynamic diameter increased with increasing DMSO volume fraction. almost doubling at 20% DMSO. To evaluate if this was due to an enlarged solvation shell. we performed reference interaction site model (RISM) simulations and found that the extent of solvation was unchanged. Using fluorescence microscopy. we then showed that tubulin was polymerization competent in the presence of colchicine. and thus inferred the presence of oligomers in the presence of DMSO. which points to its mechanism …,True,b99dCOEAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,4,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2019/na/c9na00035f,5272869389904342827,/scholar?cites=5272869389904342827,,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2019/na/c9na00035f,0,0,0

1220573,Taxol allosterically alters the dynamics of the tubulin dimer and increases the flexibility of microtubules,2008,Arpita Mitra and David Sept,95,Biophysical journal,7,3252-3258,Cell Press,Taxol is a commonly used antitumor agent that hyperstabilizes microtubules and prevents cell division. The interaction of Taxol with tubulin and the microtubule has been studied through a wide array of experimental techniques; however. the exact molecular mechanism by which Taxol stabilizes microtubules has remained elusive. In this study. through the use of large-scale molecular simulations. we show that Taxol affects the interactions between the M and H1-S2 loops of adjacent tubulin dimers leading to more stable interprotofilament interactions. More importantly. we demonstrate that Taxol binding leads to a significant increase in the dynamics and flexibility of the portion of β-tubulin that surrounds the bound nucleotide and makes contact with the α-monomer of the next dimer in the protofilament. We conclude that this increase in flexibility allows the microtubule to counteract the conformational changes …,True,pxp6lUEAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,118,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349508784674,2073664322883667645,/scholar?cites=2073664322883667645,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349508784674,0,0,0

Long filaments were fragmented by shearing and allowed to recover. Stabilizing filaments with phalloidin in most experiments eliminated any contribution of subunit dissociation and association to the redistribution of lengths but did not affect the results. Two different assays. fluorescence microscopy to measure filament lengths and polymerization to measure concentration of barbed filament ends. gave the same time-course of annealing. The rate of annealing declines with time as the average filament length increases. Longer filaments also anneal slower than short filaments. The second-order annealing rate constant is inversely proportional to mean polymer length with a value of 1.1 mM−1 s−1/length in subunits. Capping protein slows but does not prevent annealing.

By studying an Asp-to-Gly mutation (D434G) associated with human syndrome of generalized epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesia (GEPD). we show that a cytosolic motif immediately following the activation gate S6 helix. known as the AC region. mediates the allosteric coupling between Ca2+ binding and channel opening. The GEPD mutation inside the AC region increases BK channel activity by enhancing this allosteric coupling.

However. parasite actins are divergent both in sequence and function and only form short. unstable filaments in contrast to the stability of conventional actin filaments. The molecular basis for parasite actin filament instability and its relationship to gliding motility remain unresolved. We demonstrate that recombinant Toxoplasma (TgACTI) and Plasmodium (PfACTI and PfACTII) actins polymerized into very short filaments in vitro but were induced to form long. stable filaments by addition of equimolar levels of phalloidin. Parasite actins contain a conserved phalloidin-binding site as determined by molecular modeling and computational docking. yet vary in several residues that are predicted to impact filament stability. In particular. two residues were identified that form intermolecular contacts between different protomers in conventional actin filaments and these residues showed non-conservative differences in apicomplexan parasites. Substitution of divergent residues found in TgACTI with those from mammalian actin resulted in formation of longer. more stable filaments in vitro. Expression of these stabilized actins in T. gondii increased sensitivity to the actin-stabilizing compound jasplakinolide and disrupted normal gliding motility in the absence of treatment. These results identify the molecular basis for short. dynamic filaments in apicomplexan parasites and demonstrate that inherent instability of parasite actin filaments is a critical adaptation for gliding motility.,True,pxp6lUEAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,88,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002280,15711856764986290554,/scholar?cites=15711856764986290554,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002280,0,0,0

Exactly which oligomeric species underlie these cytotoxic effects remains unclear. The work presented here established well-controlled aggregation conditions of Aβ 1–40 or Aβ1–42 peptides over a 20-day period and characterized these preparations with regard to their β-sheet content. degree of fibril formation. relative abundance of various oligomer sizes. and propensity to induce membrane pore formation and cytotoxicity. Using this multivariate data set. a systematic and inherently unbiased partial least squares (PLS) approach showed that for both peptides the abundance of oligomers in the tetramer to 13-mer range contributed positively to both pore formation and cytotoxicity. while monomers. dimers. trimers. and the largest oligomers (>210 kDa) were negatively correlated to both phenomena. Multivariate PLS analysis is ideally suited to handle complex data sets and interdependent variables such as relative oligomer concentrations. making it possible to elucidate structure function relationships in complex mixtures.

The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment which uses iterative screening of nucleic acid libraries is a popular experimental technique.

They bind to various targets like lipids. nucleic acids. proteins. small organic compounds. and even entire organisms. Aptamers may also serve as drug-carriers or nanoparticles helping drugs to get released in specific target regions.

It is thus possible to obtain quantitative information about the energetics of the reaction transition state and its position on a …,True,Xj9czOkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,26,https://www.pnas.org/content/108/31/12717.short,7970891040497149339,/scholar?cites=7970891040497149339,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/31/12717.full.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,The phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is an early marker exploited for detecting apoptosis (PS externalization in the cell membrane bilayer) and one factor that is associated with increased amyloid plaque deposition in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). PS can therefore be considered as a promising target for diagnosis or treatment of diseases. Aptamers (short nucleic acid sequences) are a particularly attractive class of materials among those currently considered for targeting PS. Here we applied an entropy based seed-and-grow strategy to design a DNA aptamer template to bind specifically to PS. The binding properties of designed aptamers were investigated computationally and experimentally.

They establish plant-microbe or microbe-microbe associations. forming a unique microbiota with each plant species and under different environmental conditions. These microbial communities have to adapt to diverse environmental conditions. such as geographical location. climate conditions and soil types. and are subjected to changes in their surrounding environment. Elevated ozone concentration is one of the most important aspects of global change. but its effect on microbial communities living on plant surfaces has barely been investigated. In the current study. we aimed at elucidating the potential effect of elevated ozone concentrations on the phyllosphere (aerial part of the plant) and rhizoplane (surface of the root) microbiota by adopting next-generation 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. A standard japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare and an ozone-tolerant breeding line L81 (Nipponbare background) were pre-grown in a greenhouse for 10 weeks and then exposed to ozone at 85 ppb for 7 h daily for 30 days in open top chambers. Microbial cells were collected from the phyllosphere and rhizoplane separately. The treatment or different genotypes did not affect various diversity indices. On the other hand. the relative abundance of some bacterial taxa were significantly affected in the rhizoplane community of ozone-treated plants. A significant effect of ozone was detected by homogeneity of molecular variance analysis in the phyllosphere. meaning that the community from ozone-treated phyllosphere samples was more variable than those from control plants.

Inc.,The phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is an early marker exploited for detecting apoptosis (PS externalization in the cell membrane bilayer) and one factor that is associated with increased amyloid plaque deposition in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). PS can therefore be considered as a promising target for diagnosis or treatment of diseases. Aptamers (short nucleic acid sequences) are a particularly attractive class of materials among those currently considered for targeting PS. Here we applied an entropy based seed-and-grow strategy to design a DNA aptamer template to bind specifically to PS. The binding properties of designed aptamers were investigated computationally and experimentally.

The HHT first applies the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose data into intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The Hilbert transform then is applied to the IMFs to reveal its instantaneous frequency spectrum. However. because the EMD lacks analytical interpretation. the meaning of IMFs is unclear. This work proposes an entropic analysis strategy to provide an information-based interpretation.

Several authors have recognized that the paradox is resolved once it is realized that there is no such thing as the entropy of a system. that there are many entropies. and that the choice between treating particles as being distinguishable or not depends on the resolution of the experiment. The purpose of this note is essentially pedagogical; we add to their analysis by examining the paradox from the point of view of information theory.

This study considered earthquakes that occurred near Taiwan between 1973 and 2008. Because earthquake data are nonlinear and non-stationary. we applied the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to analyze the temporal variations in the number of daily earthquakes to investigate the effect of tidal triggering. We compared the results obtained from the non-declustered catalog with those from two kinds of declustered catalogs and discuss the aftershock effect on the EMD-based analysis. We also investigated stacking the data based on in-phase phenomena of theoretical Earth tides with statistical significance tests. Our results show that the effects of tidal triggering. particularly the lunar tidal effect. can be extracted from the raw seismicity data using the approach proposed here.

The proposed method first determines the preferred value of the hard-sphere diameter. and then obtains an optimal hard-sphere approximation by a suitably weighed average over different hard-sphere diameters.

A combination of models allows the construction of a mixed model that represents well the complete assembly dynamics: it is found that the rate constants decrease with respect to filament size when the aggregation involves at least one short filament. whereas for longer filaments they are almost independent of size.

Functions of the keratin network in cells are shaped by their dynamical organization. Using a collection of experimentally-driven mathematical models. different hypotheses for the turnover and transport of the keratin material in epithelial cells are tested. The interplay between turnover and transport and their effects on the keratin organization in cells are hence investigated by combining mathematical modeling and experimental data. Amongst the collection of mathematical models considered. a best model strongly supported by experimental data is identified. Fundamental to this approach is the fact that optimal parameter values associated with the best fit for each model are established.

An analysis is conducted. showing that the system has a unique. globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. By means of sensitivity analysis. the influence of parameters on the system is studied. It is shown that. in agreement with biological observations. posttranslational modifications of intermediate filament proteins resulting in filament solubilization are the main regulators of the intermediate filament organization.

The cytoskeleton is a complex arrangement of structural proteins organized in three different networks: microfilaments. intermediate filaments. and microtubules. Each network has specific physical properties and spatial organization. and plays particular roles in the cell. Here. the focus is on the intermediate filament network. which is involved in the stabilization and mechanical resilience of the cell. cell migration. and signal transduction [6. 8]. Intermediate filaments are cell-type and differentiation-stage dependent. They are classified in five different types: Types I-IV are cytoplasmic filaments; Type V. lamins. are nuclear filaments.

The model. which assumes that vector reproduction can lead to the transmission or loss of resistance (reversion). is analyzed in a particular case with specified forms for the birth and force of infection functions. The vector component can have. in the absence of disease. a coexistence equilibrium where both strains survive. In the case where reversion is possible. this coexistence equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. This equilibrium is still present in the full vector–host system. leading to a reduction of the associated reproduction number. thereby making elimination of the disease more feasible. When reversion is not possible. there can exist an additional equilibrium with only resistant vectors.,True,R1UKZuQAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,7,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17513750701605614,10688940015642707947,/scholar?cites=10688940015642707947,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17513750701605614,0,0,0

Their transport along microtubules plays an essential role in the control of the shape and structural organization of cells. To identify the key parameters responsible for the control of intermediate filament transport. we generated a model of elastic filament transport by microtubule-associated dynein and kinesin.

We investigate the effect of filament properties such as number of motor binding sites. length. and elasticity on motion of filaments. Additionally. we consider the effect of motor properties. i.e. off rates. on filament transport.

Following the stimulation of cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). the IκB kinase (IKK) complex rapidly phosphorylates NF-κB1 p105 on serine 927 in the PEST region. This phosphorylation is essential for TNF-α to trigger p105 degradation. which releases the associated Rel/NF-κB subunits to translocate into the nucleus and regulate target gene transcription. Serine 927 resides in a conserved motif (Asp-Ser927-Gly-Val-Glu-Thr-Ser932) homologous to the IKK target sequence in IκBα. In this study. TNF-α-induced p105 proteolysis was revealed to additionally require the phosphorylation of serine 932.

This function has been widely attributed to its role as the central activator of the NF-κB family of transcription factors.

A minimally supplemented serum-free medium conditioned by lymphoblastoid cells in their log phase of growth (LCL-CM) was found to contain autostimulatory activity allowing us to explore the mechanism of autocrine growth for these cell-types in defined conditions. Below cell densities capable of supporting autonomous growth. continued proliferation in serum-free medium was dependent on both added LCL-CM and transferrin. Neither activity alone was capable of sustaining growth. At higher cell densities. transferrin by itself was sufficient to maintain the autocrine loop.

This mutation also weakens the interaction of TPL-2 with NF-κB1 p105 in vitro. although it is unclear whether this is important for the activation of TPL-2 oncogenicity. It is demonstrated here that TPL-2 stability in vivo relies on its high-affinity. stoichiometric association with NF-κB1 p105. Formation of this complex occurs as a result of two distinct interactions. The TPL-2 C terminus binds to a region encompassing residues 497 to 534 of p105. whereas the TPL-2 kinase domain interacts with the p105 death domain. Binding to the p105 death domain inhibits TPL-2 MEK kinase activity in vitro. and this inhibition is significantly augmented by concomitant interaction of the TPL-2 C terminus with p105.

In order to identify inhibitors of protozoan NMTs. we chose to screen a diverse subset of the Pfizer corporate collection against Plasmodium falciparum and Leishmania donovani NMTs. Primary screening hits against either enzyme were tested for selectivity over both human NMT isoforms (Hs1 and Hs2) and for broad-spectrum anti-protozoan activity against the NMT from Trypanosoma brucei. Analysis of the screening results has shown that structure-activity relationships (SAR) for Leishmania NMT are divergent from all other NMTs tested. a finding not predicted by sequence similarity calculations. resulting in the identification of four novel series of Leishmania-selective NMT inhibitors. We found a strong overlap between the SARs for Plasmodium NMT and both human NMTs. suggesting that achieving an appropriate selectivity profile will be more challenging. However. we did discover two novel series with selectivity for Plasmodium NMT over the other NMT orthologues in this study. and an additional two structurally distinct series with selectivity over Leishmania NMT.

In quiescent T cells. Lat is segregated into clusters on the cell surface. which raises the question of how TCR triggering initiates signaling. Using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. we found that pre-existing Lat domains were neither phosphorylated nor laterally transported to TCR activation sites. which suggested that these clusters do not participate in TCR signaling. Instead. TCR activation resulted in the recruitment and phosphorylation of Lat from subsynaptic vesicles. Studies of Lat mutants confirmed that recruitment preceded and was essential for phosphorylation and that both processes were independent of surface clustering of Lat.

In order to understand the regulation and formation of fenestrations. the relationship between membrane rafts and fenestrations was investigated in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells where fenestrations are grouped into sieve plates. Three dimensional structured illumination microscopy. scanning electron microscopy. internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy and two-photon fluorescence microscopy were used to study liver sinusoidal endothelial cells isolated from mice. There was an inverse distribution between sieve plates and membrane rafts visualized by structured illumination microscopy and the fluorescent raft stain. Bodipy FL C5 ganglioside GM1. 7-ketocholesterol and/or cytochalasin D increased both fenestrations and lipid-disordered membrane. while Triton X-100 decreased both fenestrations and lipid-disordered membrane. The effects of cytochalasin D on fenestrations were abrogated by co-administration of Triton X-100. suggesting that actin disruption increases fenestrations by its effects on membrane rafts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) depleted lipid-ordered membrane and increased fenestrations.

They can arise de novo from the endoplasmic reticulum by a still poorly characterized process. yet possess a unique machinery for the import of their matrix proteins. As peroxisomes lack DNA. their function. which is highly variable and dependent on developmental and/or environmental conditions. is determined by the post‐translational import of specific metabolic enzymes in folded or oligomeric states. The two classes of matrix targeting signals for peroxisomal proteins [PTS1 (peroxisomal targeting signal 1) and PTS2] are recognized by cytosolic receptors [PEX5 (peroxin 5) and PEX7 respectively] which escort their cargo proteins to. or possibly across. the peroxisome membrane.

The latter implies that task-related negative Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI signals in the cerebral cortex under normal physiological conditions may be mainly driven by the NPY-positive inhibitory neurons.

We used two-dimensional (2D) micro-ECoG grids to record intra-operatively in humans and during acute implantations in mouse with separation distance between neighboring electrodes (i.e.. pitch) of 0.4 mm and 0.2/0.25 mm respectively. To assess the spatial properties of the signals. we used the average correlation between electrodes as a function of the pitch. In agreement with prior studies. we find a strong frequency dependence in the spatial scale of correlation. By applying independent component analysis (ICA). we find that the spatial pattern of correlation is largely due to contributions from multiple spatially extended. time-locked sources present at any given time.

Changes in the integrin surface repertoire provide a means of altering the strength and ligand preferences of cell adhesion. Recent research has examined the affinity modulation of integrins. a rapid and versatile mechanism of cell adhesion regulation.

Here. we present a novel finding that the stable TXA2 analogue. U46619. induces two waves of platelet secretion. each of which precedes a distinct wave of platelet aggregation. ADP released from platelets during the first wave of secretion played a major role in augmenting the first wave of platelet aggregation. The second wave of platelet secretion and aggregation required the first wave of both ADP secretion and aggregation and were blocked by either the integrin inhibitor RGDS or a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. indicating a requirement for both the integrin outside-in signal and ADP-activated Gi pathway.

The focus of this review is on integrins. adhesion receptors that play a pivotal role in platelet function. Conversely. the study of platelets has provided critical links in our understanding of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The existence of this family was first suggested by the identification of functional (1). gross structural (2) and iinlnuilologic (3.4) similarities among adhesion receptors. The cloning and sequencing of the members of this family (5) confirmed the relationship amongst these receptors.

We have investigated whether the increase in puncta involves retrograde signaling through the NO-cGMP-cGK pathway and also examined the possible roles of two classes of molecules that regulate the actin cytoskeleton: Ena/VASP proteins and Rho GTPases. Our results suggest that NO. cGMP. cGK. actin. and Rho GTPases including RhoA play important roles in the potentiation and act directly in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. where they contribute to the increase in puncta of synaptic proteins. cGK phosphorylates synaptic VASP during the potentiation. whereas Rho GTPases act both in parallel and upstream of cGMP. in …,True,RXdAMrQAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,198,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730500022X,4574456592005973848,/scholar?cites=4574456592005973848,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730500022X,0,0,0

However. the regulation of cGMP levels by a variety of agents was not always consistent with their effects on contractility. It is now clear that at least two major cell types in whole heart. cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. differ markedly in their mechanisms of cGMP regulation and response to cGMP. Furthermore. experiments on isolated cardiac myocytes indicate that the mechanism of cGMP action even in this single cell type can be multifaceted.

We provide an overview of the classical chemical fluorescent calcium indicators and of the protein-based genetically encoded calcium indicators. Using application examples. we introduce new developments in the field. such as calcium imaging in awake. behaving animals and the use of calcium imaging for mapping single spine sensory inputs in cortical neurons in vivo.

To test the hypothesis that LTP is involved in activity-dependent synapse formation. we combined whole-cell recordings and confocal microscopy to investigate hippocampal glutamatergic synapses at their earliest stages of development. Here we report that. during the first postnatal week. the hippocampal glutamatergic network becomes gradually functional owing to the transformation of precursor. pure NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor-based synaptic contacts into conducting AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionate)/NMDA-receptor-type synapses. This functional synapse induction is caused by an associative form of LTP. so it is input-specific and easily triggered experimentally by pairing presynaptic stimulation with post-synaptic depolarization.

We tested this hypothesis in vivo by using two-photon Ca2+ imaging in a mouse model of Alzheimer9s disease. Although a decrease in neuronal activity was seen in 29% of layer 2/3 cortical neurons. 21% of neurons displayed an unexpected increase in the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients. These “hyperactive” neurons were found exclusively near the plaques of amyloid β–depositing mice. The hyperactivity appeared to be due to a relative decrease in synaptic inhibition.

Synaptically connected neurones were identified in the granule cell layer of slices of 17‐ to 21‐day‐old rat hippocampus. Whole‐cell current recording using the patch‐clamp technique revealed synaptic currents ranging from less than 10 to 200 pA in symmetrical Cl‐ conditions. at a holding potential of ‐50 mV.

Previous reports point to a presynaptic site of neurotrophin action. By imaging dentate granule cells in mouse hippocampal slices. we identified BDNF-evoked Ca2+ transients in dendrites and spines. but not at presynaptic sites. Pairing a weak burst of synaptic stimulation with a brief dendritic BDNF application caused an immediate and robust induction of LTP. LTP induction required activation of postsynaptic Ca2+ channels andN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and was prevented by the blockage of postsynaptic Ca2+ transients. Thus. our results suggest that BDNF-mediated LTP is induced postsynaptically.

The activity consisted of bursts of intracellular Ca2+ transients recurring synchronously at a slow rate of 0.4–2 min− 1 in the entire population of pyramidal neurones and interneurones. 2 These early network oscillations (ENOs) were present during a restricted period of postnatal development. Thus. they were not detected at the day of birth (P0). at P1–P4 they consisted of bursts of large (up to 1.5 μm) Ca2+ transients. gradually transforming into regularly occurring. smaller Ca2+ transients during the subsequent week. Beyond P15–P16 no ENOs were detected. 3 The ENOs were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and by a reduction in temperature from 33–35° C to 20–22° C.

Facilitation and inactivation offer two opposing. activity-dependent means of altering Ca2+ influx via cardiac Cav1.2 calcium channels. Voltage- and frequency-dependent facilitation of Cav1.2 has been reported to depend on Calmodulin (CaM) and/or the activity of Calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII).

Therefore. conditional mouse models are powerful tools to analyze the relationship between transgene expression and progression of the disease. To explore whether α-syn solely originates and further incites these alterations. we generated conditional mouse models by using the tet-regulatable system.

Alight pulse can evoke a change in the onset of wheel-running activity in mice by shifting the onset of activity to earlier times (phase advance) or later times (phase delays) thereby advancing or delaying the clock (clock resetting). To assess the role of mouse Per (mPer) genes in circadian clock resetting. mice carrying mutant mPer1 or mPer2 genes were tested for responses to a light pulse at ZT 14 and ZT 22. respectively. The authors found that mPer1 mutants did not advance and mPer2 mutants did not delay the clock.

To obtain robust rhythms with a periodicity of about a day. these clocks use molecular oscillators consisting of two interlocked feedback loops. The core loop generates rhythms by transcriptional repression via the Period (PER) and Cryptochrome (CRY) proteins. whereas the stabilizing loop establishes roughly antiphasic rhythms via nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors also govern many pathways that affect metabolism and physiology. Here we show that the core loop component PER2 can coordinate circadian output with the circadian oscillator. PER2 interacts with nuclear receptors including PPARα and REV-ERBα and serves as a coregulator of nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. Consequently.

Measurement of this period length. normally accomplished by prolonged subject observation. is difficult and costly in humans. Because a circadian clock similar to that of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is present in most cell types. we were able to engineer a lentiviral circadian reporter that permits characterization of circadian rhythms in single skin biopsies. Using it. we have determined the period lengths of 19 human individuals. The average value from all subjects. 24.5 h. closely matches average values for human circadian physiology obtained in studies in which circadian period was assessed in the absence of the confounding effects of light input and sleep–wake cycle feedback. Nevertheless. the distribution of period lengths measured from biopsies from different individuals was wider than those reported for circadian physiology. A similar trend was observed when comparing wheel-running behavior with fibroblast period length in mouse strains containing circadian gene disruptions. In mice. inter-individual differences in fibroblast period length correlated with the period of running-wheel activity; in humans. fibroblasts from different individuals showed widely variant circadian periods.

Heidelberg,Cyclic 3'. 5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was discovered in 1963 as one of the major nucleotides in urine (Ashman et al. 1963) 6 years after the first description of cyclic 3'. 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a second messenger (Sutherland and Rail 1957). Initially the research on cellular regulation and function of cGMP was heavily influenced by the progress made in understanding the physiological roles of cAMP. This led to the discovery and initial characterization of enzymes which synthesize and degrade cGMP. and enzymes which are activated by cGMP (see Table 1). It was subsequently recognized that the cellular level of cGMP is regulated by a wide variety of hormones. drugs. and cellular conditions (Goldberg and Haddox 1977). Important findings were that cGMP is regulated by acetylcholine in the heart. by light in the retina. by various vasodilators in smooth muscle. and by the diarrhea …,True,UcID_1cAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,269,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0032675,8481185501939787534,/scholar?cites=8481185501939787534,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/38704/1/113%20Physiology%20biochemistry%20and%20pharmacology.pdf#page=44,0,0,0
1221078,Many cuts to ruin: a comprehensive update of caspase substrates,2003,U Fischer and RU Jänicke and K Schulze-Osthoff,10,,1,76-100,Nature Publishing Group,Apoptotic cell death is executed by the caspase-mediated cleavage of various vital proteins. Elucidating the consequences of this endoproteolytic cleavage is crucial for our understanding of cell death and other biological processes. Many caspase substrates are just cleaved as bystanders. because they happen to contain a caspase cleavage site in their sequence. Several targets. however. have a discrete function in propagation of the cell death process. Many structural and regulatory proteins are inactivated by caspases. while other substrates can be activated. In most cases. the consequences of this gain-of-function are poorly understood. Caspase substrates can regulate the key morphological changes in apoptosis. Several caspase substrates also act as transducers and amplifiers that determine the apoptotic threshold and cell fate.

Currently. five different such death receptors are known including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor‐1. CD95 (Fas/APO‐1).

This prompted us to investigate the role of NF-kappaB in this process. We report that NF-kappaB is potently activated upon serum starvation. a condition leading to apoptosis in 293 cells. Similar to Bcl-2. a transdominant-negative mutant of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit partially inhibited apoptosis. indicating a direct involvement of the transcription factor in induction of cell death. As expected. the p65 mutant suppresses kappaB-dependent gene expression. Surprisingly. transiently or stably overexpressed Bcl-2 had the same effect.

In humans more than 200 proteins are involved in apoptosis. many of which are dysregulated or defective in human diseases including cancer. A large number of apoptotic factors are regulated via alternative splicing. a process that allows for the production of discrete protein isoforms with often distinct functions from a common mRNA precursor. The abundance of apoptosis genes that are alternatively spliced and the often antagonistic roles of the generated protein isoforms strongly imply that alternative splicing is a crucial mechanism for regulating life and death decisions.

1221103,Death by a thousand cuts: an ever increasing list of caspase substrates,1998,Christopher Stroh and Klaus Schulze-Osthoff,5,,12,997-1000,Nature Publishing Group,At present. mammalian caspases comprise a group of at least 13 protease members which either generate mature pro-inflammatory cytokines or promote apoptosis (Cohen. 1997; Nicholson and Thornberry. 1997; Van de Craen et al. 1997; Humke et al. 1998; Schulze-Osthoff et al. 1998). Based on phylogenetic analysis and positional scanning studies of their peptide substrates. caspases can be divided into three subfamilies: The ICE-like protease family includes caspase-1.-4.-5 and-13 as well as murine caspase-11 and-12. for which no human equivalents have yet been identified. The Ced-3 subfamily includes caspase-3.-6.-7.-8.-9 and-10. whereas the third subfamily consists of only one member. caspase-2. Within each subfamily. the peptide sequence preferences in the substrates are remarkably similar or even identical. This demonstrates that. at least in some cases. different caspases can cleave the same substrates. suggesting some degree of functional redundancy within the caspase family. Central to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of cell death is the identification of caspase targets and the elucidation of the consequences of proteolytic cleavage. Thus far. more than 60 proteins have been found to be cleaved by caspases. and new substrates are continuously being identified (Table 1). Given the great number of different caspases. the list of substrates is still relatively small. For most proteins. the consequences of cleavage are poorly understood.

Recent studies have established clear correlations between the survival requirements for different neurotrophins of functionally distinct subsets of sensory neurons.

Neonatal NGF treatment (postnatal day 0–14) resulted in a profound mechanical hyperalgesia that  persisted until the animals had reached maturity (6 weeks of age).

The importance of having an inbuilt “detect and protect” system is illustrated by the fact that most animals have dedicated sensory afferents which respond to noxious stimuli called nociceptors. Should injury occur there is often sensitization. whereby increased nociceptor sensitivity and/or plasticity of nociceptor-related neural circuits acts as a protection mechanism for the afflicted body part. Studying nociception and nociceptors in different model organisms has demonstrated that there are similarities from invertebrates right through to humans.

Naked mole-rats show a unique and remarkable lack of pain-related behaviors to two potent algogens. acid and capsaicin. Furthermore. when exposed to inflammatory insults or known mediators. naked mole-rats do not display thermal hyperalgesia. In contrast. naked mole-rats do display nocifensive behaviors in the formalin test and show mechanical hyperalgesia after inflammation. Using electrophysiology. we showed that primary afferent nociceptors in naked mole-rats are insensitive to acid stimuli. consistent with the animal's lack of acid-induced behavior. Acid transduction by sensory neurons is observed in birds. amphibians. and fish. which suggests that this tranduction mechanism has been selectively disabled in the naked mole-rat in the course of its evolution.

Inc.,Summary: The murine gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) is expressed in blood vessels. with vastly different contribution by endothelial and smooth muscle cells. We have used the Cre recombinase under control of TIE2 transcriptional elements to inactivate a floxed Cx43 gene specifically in endothelial cells. Cre‐mediated deletion led to replacement of the Cx43 coding region by a lacZ reporter gene. This allowed us to monitor the extent of deletion and to visualize the endothelial expression pattern of Cx43. We found widespread endothelial expression of the Cx43 gene during embryonic development. which became restricted largely to capillaries and small vessels in all adult organs examined. Mice lacking Cx43 in endothelium did not exhibit altered blood pressure. in contrast to mice deficient in Cx40.

A key to sleep function is to determine how and when sleep is induced. The aim of this review is to merge the classical concepts of central sleep regulation by the brainstem and hypothalamus with the recent findings on decentral sleep regulation in local neuronal assemblies and sleep regulatory substances that create a scenario in which sleep is both local and use dependent. The interface between these concepts is provided by thalamic cellular and network mechanisms that support rhythmogenesis of sleep-related activity. The brainstem and the hypothalamus centrally set the pace for sleep-related activity throughout the brain. Decentral regulation of the sleep–wake cycle was shown in the cortex. and the homeostat of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep is made …,True,xSYK_pwAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,73,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-011-1014-6,3402164355776400679,/scholar?cites=3402164355776400679,,,0,0,0

The function of Ca2+ during the tonic relay mode of these neurons during wakefulness is less clear. Here. we report that tonic activity in thalamocortical cells results in an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and subsequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores mediated via ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Blockade of Ca2+ release shifted the regular firing of single action potentials toward the generation of spike clusters. Regular spike firing and intracellular Ca2+ release thus appear to be functionally coupled in a positive feedback manner. thereby supporting the relay mode of thalamocortical cells during wakefulness.

We deleted the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB 1) specifically in nociceptive neurons localized in the peripheral nervous system of mice. preserving its expression in the CNS. and analyzed these genetically modified mice in preclinical models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain.

Because opioid addicts are susceptible to certain infections. opioids have been suspected to suppress the immune response. This was supported by the finding that various immune-competent cells express opioid receptors and undergo apoptosis when treated with opioid alkaloids. Recent evidence suggests that opioids may also effect neuronal survival and proliferation or migrating properties of tumor cells. A multitude of signaling pathways has been suggested to be involved in these extra-analgesic effects of opioids. Growth-promoting effects were found to be mediated through Akt and Erk signaling cascades. Death-promoting effects have been ascribed to inhibition of nuclear factor-κB. increase of Fas expression. p53 stabilization. cytokine and chemokine release. and activation of nitric oxide synthase. p38. and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase.

Many animal studies have unanimously shown that inhibition of NO or cGMP synthesis can considerably reduce both inflammatory and neuropathic pain.

A cause for the variable success of pharmacologic pain therapy is the different genetic disposition of patients to develop pain or to respond to analgesics. The patient's phenotype may be regarded as the result of synergistic or antagonistic effects of several genetic variants concomitantly present in an individual.

However. previous studies have revealed that it has antinociceptive and antitum or effects not due to epimerization to the cyclooxygenase-inhibiting S-isomer. Here. we show that R-flurbiprofen has additional anti-inflammatory activity comparable with that of dexamethasone in the zymosan-induced paw inflammation model in rats. Different criteria suggest that the observed effects are mediated at least in part through inhibition of NF-kB activation: R-flurbiprofen inhibited i) LPS-induced NF-kB DNA binding activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages. ii) translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kB into the nucleus of these cells. and iii) zymosan-induced NF-kB-dependent gene transcription in the inflamed paw and spinal cord of rats. S-flurbiprofen produced similar effects but was less potent. In addition. R-flurbiprofen inhibited DNA binding activity of AP-1. another key regulatory transcription factor in inflammatory processes.

Ca2+ sparks result from the opening of a single. or the coordinated opening of many. tightly clustered ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In arterial smooth muscle. Ca2+ sparks appear to be involved in opposing the tonic contraction of the blood vessel. Intravascular pressure causes a graded membrane potential depolarization to approximately A40 mV. an elevation of arterial wall [Ca2+] i and contraction (myogenic tone') of arteries. Ca2+ sparks activate calcium-sensitive K+(KCa) channels in the sarcolemmal membrane to cause membrane hyperpolarization. which opposes the pressure induced depolarization. Thus. inhibition of Ca2+ sparks by ryanodine. or of KCa channels by iberiotoxin. leads to membrane depolarization. activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. and vasoconstriction. Conversely. activation of Ca2+ sparks can lead to vasodilation through activation of KCa channels. Our recent work is aimed at studying the properties and roles of Ca2+ sparks in the regulation of arterial smooth muscle function.

Recent studies propose a paracrine role for periadventitial adipose tissue in the control of arterial vascular tone.

In echinoderm. ascidian. and vertebrate eggs. the Ca2+ rise occurs as a result of inositol trisphosphate-mediated release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. The release of Ca2+ at fertilization in echinoderm and ascidian eggs requires SH2 domain-mediated activation of a Src family kinase (SFK) and phospholipase C (PLC)γ. Though some evidence indicates that a SFK and PLC may also function at fertilization in vertebrate eggs. SH2 domain-mediated activation of PLCγ appears not to be required. Much work has focused on identifying factors from sperm that initiate egg activation at fertilization. either as a result of sperm–egg contact or sperm–egg fusion.

It is arguably the most frequently used tool for examining the interactions of proteins and peptides with vesicular unilamellar model membranes. However. high light scattering associated with vesicular membrane systems presents special challenges. Because of their reduced light scattering compared to large unilamellar vesicles (LUV). small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) produced by sonication are widely used membrane models. Unfortunately.

Neutrophil defensins are known to permeabilize cell membranes of susceptible microorganisms. but the mechanism of permeabilization is uncertain. We report here the results of an investigation of the mechanism by which HNP‐2. one of 4 human neutrophil defensins. permeabilizes large unilamellar vesicles formed from the anionic lipid palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG). As observed by others. we find that HNP‐2 (net charge = +3) cannot bind to vesicles formed from neutral lipids. The binding of HNP‐2 to vesicles containing varying amounts of POPG and neutral (zwitterionic) palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) demonstrates that binding is initiated through electrostatic interactions.

This process is of fundamental importance for understanding the mechanism of action of toxins and antimicrobial peptides and the stability of membrane proteins.

The fgf2-bound dimer structure ensures the smallest separation between the transmembrane (TM) domains and the highest possible phosphorylation. a conclusion that is supported by a strong correlation between TM helix separation in the dimer and kinase phosphorylation.

A ligand-dependent conformational change is thought to regulate IGF1R activity. but the nature of this change is unclear. We point out an underappreciated dimer in the crystal structure of the related Insulin Receptor (IR) with Insulin bound that allows direct comparison with unliganded IR and suggests a mechanism by which ligand regulates IR/IGF1R activity. We test this mechanism in a series of biochemical and biophysical assays and find the IGF1R ectodomain maintains an autoinhibited state in which the TMs are held apart. Ligand binding releases this constraint. allowing TM association and unleashing an intrinsic propensity of the intracellular regions to autophosphorylate. Enzymatic studies of full-length and kinase-containing fragments show phosphorylated IGF1R is fully active independent of ligand and the extracellular-TM regions.

Class I viral fusion proteins. such as those encoded by influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). contain two prominent alpha helices. Peptides that mimic portions of these alpha helices inhibit structural rearrangements of the fusion proteins and prevent viral infection. The envelope glycoprotein (E) of flaviviruses. such as West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV). are class II viral fusion proteins comprised predominantly of beta sheets. We used a physio-chemical algorithm. the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) [1] in combination with known structural data to identify potential peptide inhibitors of WNV and DENV infectivity that target the viral E protein. Viral inhibition assays confirm that several of these peptides specifically interfere with target virus entry with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the 10 μM range. Inhibitory peptides similar in sequence to domains with a significant WWIHS scores. including domain II (IIb). and the stem domain. were detected.

When the violent civil conflict in Sierra Leone (1991 to 2002) ended. an international consortium assisted in restoration of the LF program at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in an area with the world's highest incidence of the disease.  Methodology/Principal Findings Clinical and laboratory records of patients presenting to the KGH Lassa Ward in the post-conflict period were organized electronically. Recombinant antigen-based LF immunoassays were used to assess LASV antigenemia and LASV-specific antibodies in patients who met criteria for suspected LF. KGH has been reestablished as a center for LF treatment and research. with over 500 suspected cases now presenting yearly. Higher case fatality rates (CFRs) in LF patients were observed compared to studies conducted prior to the civil conflict. Different criteria for defining LF stages and differences in sensitivity of assays likely account for these differences. The highest incidence of LF in Sierra Leone was observed during the dry season. LF cases were observed in ten of Sierra Leone's thirteen districts. with numerous cases from outside the traditional endemic zone. Deaths in patients presenting with LASV antigenemia were skewed towards individuals less than 29 years of age. Women self-reporting as pregnant were significantly overrepresented among LASV antigenemic patients. The CFR of ribavirin-treated patients presenting early in acute infection was lower than in untreated subjects.

Here we employed site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology to investigate the mechanism of inhibition of ASIC1a by diminazene. This compound inhibits mouse ASIC1a with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.4 μM. At first. we examined whether neutralizing mutations of Glu79 and Glu416 alter diminazene block. These residues form a hexagonal array in the lower palm domain that was previously shown to contribute to pore opening in response to extracellular acidification. Significantly. single Gln substitutions at positions 79 and 416 in ASIC1a reduced diminazene apparent affinity by 6–7 fold. This result suggests that diminazene inhibits ASIC1a in part by limiting conformational rearrangement in the lower palm domain. Because diminazene is charged at physiological pHs. we assessed whether it inhibits ASIC1a by blocking the ion channel pore. Consistent with the notion that diminazene binds to a site within the membrane electric field. diminazene block showed a strong dependence with the membrane potential. Moreover. a Gly to Ala mutation at position 438. in the ion conduction pathway of ASIC1a. increased diminazene IC50 by one order of magnitude and eliminated the voltage dependence of block. Taken together. our results indicate that the inhibition of ASIC1a by diminazene involves both allosteric modulation and blocking of ion flow through the conduction pathway.

Disturbances in splicing due to mutation or aberrant splicing regulatory networks lead to dysregulated protein expression and contribute to a substantial fraction of human disease. Several classes of active and selective splicing modulator compounds have been recently identified. thus proving that pre-mRNA splicing is a viable target for therapy. We describe herein the identification of BPN-15477. a novel splicing modulator compound. that restores correct splicing of exon 20 in the Elongator complex protein 1 (ELP1) gene carrying the major IVS20+6T>C mutation responsible for familial dysautonomia. We then developed a machine learning approach to evaluate the therapeutic potential of BPN-15477 to correct splicing in other human genetic diseases. Using transcriptome sequencing from compound-treated fibroblast cells. we identified treatment responsive sequence signatures. the majority of which center at the 5-prime splice site of exons whose inclusion or exclusion is modulated by SMC treatment. We then leveraged this model to identify 155 human disease genes that harbor ClinVar mutations predicted to alter pre-mRNA splicing as potential targets for BPN-15477 treatment. Using in vitro splicing assays. we validated representative predictions by demonstrating successful correction of splicing defects caused by mutations in genes responsible for cystic fibrosis (CFTR). cholesterol ester storage disease (LIPA).

February 11. 2015 497a well as synthetically evolved gain-of-function variants of melittin. which have recently been developed by William Wimley at Tulane University. Using spectroscopic techniques we show that gain-of-function variants are able to leak larger dyes from unilamellar vesicles than melittin. Like melittin gainof-function variants result in virtually complete leakage of the dye from vesicles. However. the concentration of peptide required to achieve leakage is significantly lower for gain-of-function variants than for melittin. This suggests that these peptides form larger pores than melittin and that these pores are much more stable. remaining functional over the lifetime of the leakage experiment. Simulations of both melittin and gain-of-function variants reveal a wealth of atomic detail information about transient processes such as peptide absorption. folding. and oligomeric assembly. as well as …,True,Qj3jgywAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,1,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(14)03934-4.pdf,776211273945320721,/scholar?cites=776211273945320721,,https://www.cell.com/biophysj/pdf/S0006-3495(14)03934-4.pdf,0,0,0

Invention Summary: To safely and effectively treat patients with anti-fungal drugs. physicians must understand the pharmacokinetics (PK) of those drugs In patients. However. the PK of azole antifungal drugs are patient dependent. If physicians can monitor levels of drug in real time. then they can better optimize dosages for an individual patient. Researchers at Rutgers have developed an aptamer-based graphene field effect transistor for sensitive. real-time monitoring of azole drugs. The aptamer probes bind specifically to azole drugs and are stable in many conditions. The graphene field effect transistor provides a sensitive biosensor that is easy to use without complicated equipment. This biosensor would enable physicians to monitor levels of azole drugs in real time and allow them to optimize dosage for individual patients. Market Applications: Therapeutic drug monitoring Monitoring of azole anti-fungal drugs Individually optimized dosing of azole drugs Advantages: Real-time monitoring of drug levels in patient at bedside Simple sensor for resource-poor settings Improved sensitivity Improved specificity for hydrophobic drug Stable aptamer probes Intellectual Property & Development Status: Patent pending.

Our understanding of TM helix dimerization has been dominated by the idea that sequence motifs. simple recognizable amino acid sequences that drive lateral interaction. can be used to explain and predict the lateral interactions between TM helices in membrane proteins. But as more and more unique interacting helices are characterized. it is becoming clear that the sequence motif paradigm is incomplete. Experimental evidence suggests that the search for sequence motifs. as mediators of TM helix dimerization. cannot solve the membrane protein folding problem alone.

FGFR3 has three distinct domains: the ligand binding extracellular domain. the cytosolic kinase domain and the transmembrane domain (TMD). Previous work with the isolated FGFR3 TMD has shown that it has the ability to dimerize. Clinical and genetic studies have also correlated mutations in the TMD with a variety of skeletal and cranial dysplasias and cancer. Although the structures of the extracellular and cytosolic domains of FGFR3 have been solved. the structure of the TMD dimer is still unknown. Furthermore. very little is known regarding the effects of pathogenic mutations on the TMD dimer structure.

A conserved sequence motif was identified that contains several cationic residues in conserved positions in an otherwise hydrophobic sequence. This 9-residue motif rapidly translocates across synthetic multibilayer vesicles and into cells while carrying a large polar dye as a “cargo” moiety. The extraordinary ability of this family of peptides to spontaneously translocate across bilayers without an energy source of any kind is distinctly different from the behavior of the well-known. highly cationic cell-penetrating peptides. such as the HIV tat peptide. which do not translocate across synthetic bilayers. and enter cells mostly by active endocytosis.

Here we show that a tumor spheroid embedded in a 3D collagen matrix exerts large contractile forces on the matrix before invasion. Cell invasion is accompanied by complex spatially and temporally dependent patterns of cell migration within and at the surface of the spheroids that are fundamentally different from migratory patterns of individual fibrosarcoma cells homogeneously distributed in the same type of matrix. Cells display a continuous transition from a round morphology at the spheroid core. to highly aligned elongated morphology at the spheroid periphery. which depends on both β 1-integrin-based cell-matrix adhesion and myosin II/ROCK-based cell contractility.

Yet. a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of EGFR signaling is lacking. despite very active research in the field. In this paper. we investigate the role of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain in EGFR signaling by replacing it with a (GGS) 10 unstructured sequence. We probe the effect of this replacement on (i) EGFR phosphorylation.(ii) EGFR dimerization and (iii) ligand (EGF) binding. We show that the replacement of EGFR JM domain with a (GGS) 10 unstructured linker completely abolishes the phosphorylation of all tyrosine residues. without measurable effects on receptor dimerization or ligand binding. Our results suggest that the JM domain does not stabilize the inactive EGFR dimer in the absence of ligand and is likely critical only for the last step of EGFR activation. the ligand-induced transition from the inactive to active dimer.,True,3IcFklcAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,25,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00854,8602911558251738398,/scholar?cites=8602911558251738398,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00854,0,0,0

The long axis of elongated mitotic cells accurately predicts the division axis. independently of matrix density and cell-matrix interactions.

G380R and G375C are known to cause achondroplasia. the most common form of human dwarfism. The G380R mutation accounts for 98% of the achondroplasia cases. and thus has been studied extensively. Here we study the effect of the G375C mutation on the phosphorylation and the cross-linking propensity of full-length FGFR3 in HEK 293 cells. and we compare the results to previously published results for the G380R mutant. We observe identical behavior of the two achondroplasia mutants in these experiments. a finding which supports a direct link between the severity of dwarfism phenotypes and the level and mechanism of FGFR3 over-activation. The mutations do not increase the cross-linking propensity of FGFR3. contrary to previous expectations that the achondroplasia mutations stabilize the FGFR3 dimers. Instead. the phosphorylation efficiency within un-liganded FGFR3 dimers is increased. and this increase is likely the underlying cause for pathogenesis in achondroplasia. We further investigate the G346E mutation. which has been reported to cause achondroplasia in one case.

We find that hydrodynamic flows in the cytoplasm and the relative drag between the cytoskeleton network phase and the water phase also play a role in determining the cell shape during cytokinesis.

However. the mechanisms of membrane targeting. pore formation and function remain elusive. Here we report an experimentally guided unbiased simulation methodology that yields the mechanism of spontaneous pore assembly for the AMP maculatin at atomic resolution. Rather than a single pore. maculatin forms an ensemble of structurally diverse temporarily functional low-oligomeric pores. which mimic integral membrane protein channels in structure. These pores continuously form and dissociate in the membrane. Membrane permeabilization is dominated by hexa-. hepta-and octamers. which conduct water. ions and small dyes.

1221541,Development and Challenges of Antimicrobial Peptides for Therapeutic Applications,2020,Charles H. Chen and Timothy K. Lu,9,Antibiotics,1,24,MDPI,More than 3000 antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been discovered. seven of which have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Now commercialized. these seven peptides have mostly been utilized for topical medications. though some have been injected into the body to treat severe bacterial infections. To understand the translational potential for AMPs. we analyzed FDA-approved drugs in the FDA drug database. We examined their physicochemical properties. secondary structures. and mechanisms of action. and compared them with the peptides in the AMP database. All FDA-approved AMPs were discovered in Gram-positive soil bacteria. and 98% of known AMPs also come from natural sources (skin secretions of frogs and toxins from different species). However. AMPs can have undesirable properties as drugs. including instability and toxicity. Thus. the design and construction of effective AMPs require an understanding of the mechanisms of known peptides and their effects on the human body. This review provides an overview to guide the development of AMPs that can potentially be used as antimicrobial drugs.

In the present work. cell wall morphological and lignin structural changes were characterized for this pretreatment approach to gain insights into pretreatment outcomes and. specifically. to identify the extent and nature of lignin modification. Through TEM imaging. this catalytic oxidation process was shown to disrupt cell wall layers in hybrid poplar. Cu-containing nanoparticles. primarily in the Cu(I) oxidation state. co-localized with the disrupted regions. providing indirect evidence of catalytic activity whereby soluble Cu(II) complexes are reduced and precipitated during pretreatment. The concentration of alkali-soluble polymeric and oligomeric lignin was substantially higher for the Cu-catalyzed oxidative pretreatment. This alkali-soluble lignin content increased with time during the catalytic oxidation process. although the molecular weight distributions were unaltered. Yields of aromatic monomers (including phenolic acids and aldehydes) were found to be less than 0.2 % (wt/wt) on lignin. Oxidation of the benzylic alcohol in the lignin side-chain was evident in NMR spectra of the solubilized lignin. whereas minimal changes were observed for the pretreatment-insoluble lignin.

Ulmschneider,22,Chemistry–A European Journal,29,9958–9961,WILEY,Using unbiased atomic-detailed molecular dynamics simulations. the C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 are observed to aggregate and form disordered-toroidal pores in a lipid bilayer. Cytotoxicity of TDP-43 may be inferred from the observation that the membrane pores catalyze lipid flip-flop between bilayer leaflets and conduct water at high rates.Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a 414-residue protein that locates in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neuronal cells. The prion-like C-terminal domain of TDP-43 (residues 258-414) is believed to be a major component of neuronal inclusion bodies in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).[1. 2] Recent studies report that both full-length and N-terminally truncated TDP-43 form oligomeric aggregates with amyloidβ peptides associated with Alzheimer’s disease.[3. 4] These results suggest TDP-43 has amyloid-like properties.[5. 6] Woerner et al. reported that cytoplasmic aggregation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged C-terminal fragment of TDP-43 can interfere with nucleocytoplasmic protein and RNA transport leading to a substantial nuclear accumulation of mRNA.[7] Amyloid plaques are formed by misfolded protein fragments. which are closely correlated to increased cell death in the brain. In nature. the fragmentation of full-length TDP-43 is initiated by caspase-4 cleavage and subsequent segmentation by caspase-3/7. This generates C-terminal fragments that can seed cytotoxic oligomer formation.[8] Previous studies have shown that the glycine-rich D1 domain. a fragment of C-terminal domain of TDP-43. is sufficient to induce …,True,lGt5BMAAAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Chen10/publication/303520732_Mechanisms_of_Membrane_Pore_Formation_by_Amyloidogenic_Peptides_in_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis/links/578236ad08ae01f736e8e31c.pdf,7835449123392188133,/scholar?cites=7835449123392188133,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Chen10/publication/303520732_Mechanisms_of_Membrane_Pore_Formation_by_Amyloidogenic_Peptides_in_Amyotrophic_Lateral_Sclerosis/links/578236ad08ae01f736e8e31c.pdf,0,0,0

It was difficult to predict the secondary structure and function from an unstructured peptide sequence due to the limited simulation timescale by the computing power. Recent developments have significantly improved the computer performance and the accuracy of the force field to make it possible for de novo protein design. Here. I explore how polypeptides fold and assemble in aqueous buffer and how membrane-active peptides (MAPs) interact and assemble in membrane of different compositions. using a combination of MD simulations and experimental techniques. First. the MD simulations were challenged with several known protein fragments and peptides to confirm its accuracy. The experimentally validated MD simulations was utilized to develop a proline-rich attachment domain (PRAD) to facilitate the tetramer formation of the butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) C-terminal fragment in the aqueous condition by using hydrophobic effect. However. protein folding in a two-phase lipid-water system is more challenging because the peptide can fold differently in water and lipid and between the interface. Several MAPs were studied using experimentally validated MD simulations to understand how they interact with the cell membranes: melittin. hylaseptin P1 (HSP1). maculatin. and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) C-terminal fragment. The results showed that the MD simulations can be compared …,True,lGt5BMAAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC,0,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.815345,,,,,0,0,0

1221577,PGE2 suppression of innate immunity during mucosal bacterial infection,2013,Mallory Agard and Saja Asakrah and Lisa A Morici,3,,,45,Frontiers,Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an important lipid mediator in inflammatory and immune responses during acute and chronic infections. Upon stimulation by various proinflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). interleukin (IL)-1β. and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. PGE2 synthesis is upregulated by the expression of cyclooxygenases. Biologically active PGE2 is then able to signal through four primary receptors to elicit a response. PGE2 is a critical molecule that regulates the activation. maturation. migration. and cytokine secretion of several immune cells. particularly those involved in innate immunity such as macrophages. neutrophils. natural killer cells. and dendritic cells. Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria can induce PGE2 synthesis to regulate immune responses during bacterial pathogenesis. This review will focus on PGE2 in innate immunity and how bacterial pathogens influence PGE2 production during enteric and pulmonary infections. The conserved ability of many bacterial pathogens to promote PGE2 responses during infection suggests a common signaling mechanism to deter protective pro-inflammatory immune responses. Inhibition of PGE2 production and signaling during infection may represent a therapeutic alternative to treat bacterial infections. Further study of the immunosuppressive effects of PGE2 on innate immunity will lead to a better understanding of potential therapeutic targets within the PGE2 pathway.,True,EkhwSrUAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,90,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2013.00045/full,8272528114856576717,/scholar?cites=8272528114856576717,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2013.00045/full,0,0,0

Inflammation induced by C. trachomatis contributes greatly to the pathogenesis of disease. Here we evaluated the anti-inflammatory capacity of naringenin. a polyphenolic compound. to modulate inflammatory mediators produced by mouse J774 macrophages infected with live C. trachomatis. Infected macrophages produced a broad spectrum of inflammatory cytokines (GM-CSF. TNF. IL-1β. IL-1α. IL-6. IL-12p70. and IL-10) and chemokines (CCL4. CCL5. CXCL1. CXCL5. and CXCL10) which were downregulated by naringenin in a dose-dependent manner. Enhanced protein and mRNA gene transcript expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 in addition to the CD86 costimulatory molecule on infected macrophages were modulated by naringenin. Pathway-specific inhibition studies disclosed that p38 mitogen-activated-protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in the production of inflammatory mediators by infected macrophages. Notably. naringenin inhibited the ability of C. trachomatis to phosphorylate p38 in macrophages. suggesting a potential mechanism of its attenuation of concomitantly produced inflammatory mediators. Our data demonstrates that naringenin is an immunomodulator of inflammation triggered by C. trachomatis. which possibly may be mediated upstream by modulation of TLR2.

Mtb:Δ-sigH and a strain where the mutation had been genetically complemented (Mtb: Δ-sigH:CO) with primary rhesus macaque bone marrow derived macrophages (Rh-BMDMs). The expression of numerous inducible and homeostatic (CCL) β-chemokines and several apoptotic markers was induced to higher levels in the cells infected with Mtb:Δ-sigH. relative to Mtb or the complemented strain. The differential expression of these genes manifested into functional differences in chemotaxis and apoptosis in cells infected with these two strains.

Bps is inherently resistant to multiple antibiotics and is considered a potential biological warfare agent by the U.S. DHHS.

Numerous studies indicate that pHLIP exists in three states: unfolded and soluble in water at neutral pH (State I). unfolded and bound to the surface of a phosphatidylcholine membrane at neutral pH (State II). and inserted across the membrane as an α-helix at low pH (State III). Here we report how changes in lipid composition modulate this insertion scheme. First. the presence of either anionic lipids. cholesterol. or phosphoethanolamine eliminates membrane binding at neutral pH (State II). Second. the apparent pKa for the insertion transition (State I → State III) is increased with increasing content of anionic lipids. suggesting that electrostatic interactions in the interfacial region modulate protonation of acidic residues of pHLIP …,True,S4JqP7AAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349515000612,13951511130455996122,/scholar?cites=13951511130455996122,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349515000612,0,0,0

Using a rapid molecular-dynamics insertion protocol in combination with microsecond-scale simulation. we have characterized the structure of both states in detail. As expected. the amphiphilic peptide resides horizontally on the membrane surface in a monomeric form at a low P/L. whereas the T-state is seen in the simulations to be a symmetric antiparallel dimer. with close contacts between small glycine and alanine residues at the interface.

Urea uptake is greatly enhanced and regulated by HpUreI. a proton-gated inner membrane channel protein essential for gastric survival of H. pylori. The crystal structure of HpUreI describes a static snapshot of the channel with two constriction sites near the center of the bilayer that are too narrow to allow passage of urea or even water. Here we describe the urea transport mechanism at atomic resolution. revealed by unrestrained microsecond equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of the hexameric channel assembly. Two consecutive constrictions open to allow conduction of urea. which is guided through the channel by interplay between conserved residues that determine proton rejection and solute selectivity.

For example. lipid peroxidation results in the production of a wide variety of highly reactive aldehyde species which can drive a range of disease-relevant responses in cells and tissues. Such lipid aldehydes react with nucleophilic groups on macromolecules including phospholipids. nucleic acids. and proteins which. in turn. leads to the formation of reversible or irreversible adducts known as advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs). In the setting of diabetes. lipid peroxidation and ALE formation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of macro and microvascular complications. As the most common diabetic complication. retinopathy is one of the leading causes of vision loss and blindness worldwide. Herein. we discuss diabetic retinopathy (DR) as a disease entity and review the current knowledge and experimental data supporting a role for lipid peroxidation and ALE formation in the onset and development of this condition. Potential therapeutic approaches to prevent lipid peroxidation and lipoxidation reactions in the diabetic retina are also considered. including the use of antioxidants. lipid aldehyde scavenging agents and pharmacological and gene therapy approaches for boosting endogenous aldehyde detoxification systems.

The association of helper T-cell epitopes with the mobile loop in Hsp10s from mycobacteria and bacteriophage T4 suggests that the mobile loop facilitates proteolytic processing and presentation of adjacent sequences. Sites of initial proteolytic cleavage were mapped in divergent Hsp10s after treatment with a variety of proteases including cathepsin S. Each protease preferentially cleaved the Hsp10s in the mobile loop. Flexibility in the 22-residue mobile loop most probably allows it to conform to protease active sites. Three variants of the bacteriophage T4 Hsp10 were constructed with deletions in the mobile loop to test the hypothesis that shorter loops would be less sensitive to proteolysis. The two largest deletions effectively inhibited proteolysis by several proteases.

How Wnt activates LRP5/6/Arrow to initiate signal transduction is not well defined.

The hyper-phosphorylation of STAT3 was attributed to either up-regulated phosphorylation by several tyrosine-kinases or down-regulated activity of phosphatases. Although several factors have been identified to phosphorylate STAT3. it remains unclear how STAT3 is dephosphorylated by PTPMeg2. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PTPMeg2 as a phosphatase in regulation of the activity of STAT3 in breast cancers. Immunoprecipitation assays were used to study the interaction of STAT3 with PTPMeg2. A series of biochemistry experiments were performed to evaluate the role of PTPMeg2 in the dephosphorylation of STAT3. Two breast cancer cell lines MCF7 (PTPMeg2 was depleted as it was endogenously high) and MDA-MB-231 (PTPMeg2 was overexpressed as it was endogenously low) were used to compare the level of phosphorylated STAT3 and the tumor growth ability in vitro and in vivo. Samples from breast carcinoma (n = 73) were subjected to a pair-wise Pearson correlation analysis for the correlation of levels of PTPMeg2 and phosphorylated STAT3. PTPMeg2 directly interacts with STAT3 and mediates its dephosphorylation in the cytoplasm. Over-expression of PTPMeg2 decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 while depletion of PTPMeg2 increased its phosphorylation. The decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is coupled with suppression of STAT3 transcriptional activity and reduced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Levels of PTPMeg2 and phosphorylated STAT3 were inversely correlated …,True,tOCrGOMAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,66,https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr3134,17228631766868911320,/scholar?cites=17228631766868911320,,https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr3134,0,0,0

The possibility that the amounts detected were caused by contamination with blood or maternal tissue was ruled out.

METHODS: Rat retinal ganglion cells were purified from dissociated retinal cells by a modified two-step panning method and were cultured in serum-free medium containing neurotrophic factors and forskolin. Survival of RGCs after exposure to glutamate. with or without glutamate receptor antagonists. was measured by calcein-acetoxymethyl ester staining after 3 days in culture. To visualize calcium signals. RGCs were loaded with the calcium indicator dye. fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester. and fluorescence was measured by laser scanning confocal microscope. Electrophysiological properties of RGCs were examined by using the whole-cell. patch-clamp technique. RESULTS: The application of increasing concentrations (5-500 microM) of glutamate caused a dose-dependent increase in RGC death after 3 days in culture.

STAT5 became immediately and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine 694 in response to TCR stimulation. Expression of the protein tyrosine kinase Lck. a key signaling protein in the TCR complex. activated DNA binding of transfected STAT5A and STAT5B to specific STAT inducible elements. The role of Lck in STAT5 activation was confirmed in a Lck-deficient T cell line in which the activation of STAT5 by TCR stimulation was abolished. Expression of Lck induced specific interaction of STAT5 with the subunits of the TCR. indicating that STAT5 may be directly involved in TCR signaling.

It provides cells with the opportunity to create protein isoforms of differing. even opposing. functions from a single gene. Cancer cells often take advantage of this flexibility to produce proteins that promote growth and survival. Many of the isoforms produced in this manner are developmentally regulated and are preferentially re-expressed in tumors.

1221796,A negative element in SMN2 exon 7 inhibits splicing in spinal muscular atrophy,2003,Tsuyoshi Kashima and James L Manley,34,Nature genetics,4,460-463,Nature Publishing Group,Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a relatively common neurodegenerative disease caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene 1. Humans possess a linked. nearly identical gene. SMN2. which produces a functional SMN protein but at levels insufficient to compensate for loss of SMN1 (refs. 1. 2). AC/T transition at position+ 6 in exon 7 is all that differentiates the two genes. but this is sufficient to prevent efficient exon 7 splicing in SMN2 (refs. 2. 3). Here we show that the C/T transition functions not to disrupt an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) in SMN1 (ref. 4). as previously suggested. but rather to create an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) in SMN2.

Using an in vitro complementation assay. we have characterized and extensively purified a factor from 293 extracts that brings about striking increases in small t splicing with concomitant decreases in large T splicing.

Ligands activating these G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) include the phytocannabinoid Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. numerous synthetic compounds. and endogenous compounds known as endocannabinoids. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists have also been developed. Some of these ligands activate or block one type of cannabinoid receptor more potently than the other type. This review summarizes current data indicating the extent to which cannabinoid receptor ligands undergo orthosteric or allosteric interactions with non-CB1. non-CB2 established GPCRs. deorphanized receptors such as GPR55. ligand-gated ion channels. transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. and other ion channels or peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors.

Endocannabinoids are thought to mediate the suppression of GABA release that follows depolarization of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron—termed “depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition” (DSI). Here. we report that DSI is absent in mice which lack cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1). Pharmacological and kinetic evidence suggests that CB1 activation inhibits presynaptic Ca2+ channels through direct G protein inhibition. Paired recordings show that endocannabinoids selectively inhibit a subclass of synapses distinguished by their fast kinetics and large unitary conductance. Furthermore. cannabinoid-sensitive inputs are unusual among central nervous system synapses in that they use N- but not P/Q-type Ca2+ channels for neurotransmitter release.

In this study. we investigated the antiproliferative activity of manuka honey on three different cancer cell lines. murine melanoma (B16.F1) and colorectal carcinoma (CT26) as well as human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells in vitro. The data demonstrate that manuka honey has potent anti-proliferative effect on all three cancer cell lines in a time- and dose-dependent manner. being effective at concentrations as low as 0.6% (w/v). This effect is mediated via the activation of a caspase 9-dependent apoptotic pathway. leading to the induction of caspase 3. reduced Bcl-2 expression. DNA fragmentation and cell death.

Studies show that macrophage nitric oxide mediates the immunosuppression and presumably also the early-onset protective capacity of the vaccine. A model of ≪bystander lymphocyte autotoxicity≫ is presented to explain the mechanism of immunosuppression. The model proposes that Salmonella-activated macrophages generate nitric oxide which inactivates lymphocytes in the vicinity. so they become dysfunctional. Inhibition of nitric oxide by NG-monomethyl-Larginine reverses immunosuppression.

The best line (T3) produced 411 mg/liter scopolamine. which was over nine times more than that in the wild type (43 mg/liter) and more than twice the amount in the highest scopolamine-producing h6h single-gene transgenic line H11 (184 mg/liter). To our knowledge. this is the highest …,True,XYT3KvEAAAAJ:Ui_nyea79ooC,307,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/17/6786/,12669265967039813304,/scholar?cites=12669265967039813304,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/17/6786.full.pdf,0,0,0

The results showed that 35 strains grew well at acid condition (pH 3.0). Eleven strains were further screened out from 35 strains with high tolerance to the simulated gastric juice (pH 2.5. 3 h of incubation). While in simulated gastric juice (pH 2.0). only F6 (isolated from traditional dairy products in Inner Mongolia) could survive to a rate of 53.7%. Moreover. among 11 Lactobacillus strains. L. fermentum F6 showed good tolerance to bile salt. while L. fermentum IMAU60151. IMAU60083. IMAU20080 and IMAU60120 were poorly presented.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an essential mediator during the process of angiogenesis. Based on an extensive literature search. which was carried out using the PubMed database and the keywords of osteogenesis. VEGF. endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification. this manuscript reviews the role of VEGF in ossification. with emphasis on its effect in endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are closely correlated processes. VEGF acts as an essential mediator during these processes. It not only functions in bone angiogenesis but also in various aspects of bone development.,True,XYT3KvEAAAAJ:X-Dm1JipzzIC,248,https://www.nature.com/articles/ijos201233,16547667292282446667,/scholar?cites=16547667292282446667,,https://www.nature.com/articles/ijos201233,0,0,0
