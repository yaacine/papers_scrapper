1229674,Degradation of organic water pollutants through sonophotocatalysis in the presence of TiO2,2003,Marta Mrowetz and Carlo Pirola and Elena Selli,10,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,4-5,247-254,Elsevier,The degradation of 2-chlorophenol and of the two azo dyes acid orange 8 and acid red 1 in aqueous solution was investigated kinetically under sonolysis at 20 kHz and under photocatalysis in the presence of titanium dioxide particles. as well as under simultaneous sonolysis and photocatalysis. i.e. sonophotocatalysis. The influence on the degradation and mineralisation rates of the initial substrate concentration and of the photocatalyst amount was systematically investigated to ascertain the origin of the synergistic effect observed between the two degradation techniques. The evolution of hydrogen peroxide during kinetic runs was also monitored. Small amounts of Fe(III) were found to affect both the adsorption equilibria on the semiconductor and the degradation paths. Ultrasound may modify the rate of photocatalytic degradation by promoting the deaggregation of the photocatalyst. by inducing the desorption of …,True,vvxSCI0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,241,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417703000907,4269965248233201062,/scholar?cites=4269965248233201062,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417703000907,0,0,0

The Optimal Particle Features for Liquid- and Gas-Phase Photocatalytic Reactions,2007,Silvia Ardizzone and Claudia L Bianchi and Giuseppe Cappelletti and Stefano Gialanella and Carlo Pirola and Vittorio Ragaini,111,The Journal of Physical Chemistry C,35,13222-13231,American Chemical Society,Anatase−brookite composite nanocrystals were synthesized successfully by a controlled sol−gel reaction followed by a prolonged hydrothermal aging or by mild calcinations (300 and 450 °C). The physicochemical and photocatalytic properties of the synthesized TiO2 composites were studied along with several commercially available nanocrystalline TiO2 samples showing different features. Rietveld refinements of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern were used to track the brookite content systematically and to generally assess the phase composition of the different samples and their crystallite sizes. SEM. TEM. and HRTEM were used to characterize the particle morphology. size. and surface faceting. BET/BJH analyses combined with mercury porosimetry determinations were employed to characterize the surface area. porosity. and pore size distribution. The surface state of the TiO2 samples was analyzed by XPS …,True,vvxSCI0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,169,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp0741096,4593833323037503656,/scholar?cites=4593833323037503656,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44926699/Tailored_AnataseBrookite_Nanocrystalline20160420-17364-1cw4y4u.pdf,0,0,0

Given the number of parameters to be taken into account in the spread of smoke. there is a high chance of introducing calculation errors if only conventional methods are used. In this study. CFD simulations were used to compare the various stages of operation of the ventilation system. as well as their effectiveness in the proposed scenarios. In the case of the ventilation scenario. the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) reached maximum values of 360 PPM. exceeding the maximum allowed value of 100 PPM. this endangering the users of the underground car park. In the second phase. we analysed the operation of the ventilation system simultaneously with that of the impulse fans for the two targeted functions and in this case the maximum concentration reached was 60 PPM. which indicates that this system configuration fulfils the function for which it was designed. The results showed. in the case of the scenarios. that the addition of impulse fans as complementary elements to the ventilation system substantially improved the reduction in the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) and increased fire visibility in the parking lot.,True,OOSmAjsAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16772041531401753151&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

We also evaluated the energy consumption of the existing system and of those proposed in order to choose the best heating system. Methods: We analyzed the current existing heating system. a mixed system (static heaters and hot air heating) in a Romanian heritage church. build in the 16th century. and we compared it with an underfloor heating system that has been mentioned in the literature as an alternative for church heating. We used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the indoor climate with two turbulence models (k-ε and k-ω). Results: Comparing the two heating systems through boxplot graphs. we could highlight pertinent conclusions regarding the temperatures and velocities of the measured air currents. Thus. of all the heating systems. the underfloor heating had the lowest temperatures. but the highest air velocities. in the churchgoers area. especially under the towers zone. Conclusions: We observed that the underfloor heating system was more efficient than the existing heating system (static heaters and hot air heating). ensuring heritage conservation and high thermal comfort to the churchgoers.

In urban configurations. wide open spaces used for parking areas close to malls. stadiums and industrial areas become justified challenges in revaluating them by placing solar panels on their wide roofs.The paper is a first attempt that reflects the scientific interest in the particularities of wind action upon the solar panels sustained by structural framed elements and which cover the parking areas. These complex studies consist in experiments on physical scale models in wind tunnel in parallel with numerical simulations of wind flow over the solar panels. highlighting the variations of the wind pressure along the rows of solar panels for the situations that may occur. of either a completely free parking area or. fully occupied with vehicles.

On the other side. the results obtained by monitoring the emissions generated by the waste dump sites from Botosani County revealed there is a major impact an air quality. The overall impact. quantified by two conventional methods shows that at regional level. heavy metals are the most contributing pollutants to environmental impact. thus it is necessary to implement measures to remediate and protect soil and ground water quality.

The high level of thermal protection provided by the envelope elements made from natural materials such as straw bale insulation. hemp insulation or sheep wool. and their lack of thermal massiveness require a more complex analysis on their ability to keep interior comfort without accentuated variations. This paper proposes a comparative analysis between different solutions for a residential building located near a Romanian city. Cluj-Napoca. The elements of the building envelope are designed in three alternative solutions. using as substitute to classical solutions (concrete and polystyrene. masonry and polystyrene). straw bales and rammed earth for enclosing elements. For this purpose there are conducted numerical simulations of heat and mass transfer. using a mathematical model that allows the analysis of indoor comfort. by comparing both objective factors (air temperature. operative temperature and relative humidity) and subjective factors. which are needed to define interior thermal comfort indices PPD and PMV.

1230190,Thermal conductivity modeling of building façade materials,2010,Monica Chereches and Nelu-Cristian Chereches and Catalin Popovici,,,,41-46,,An experimental research has been conducted to assess the thermo-physical properties of three building materials in both dry and moist state: beech wood. autoclaved aerated concrete and brick. The objectives of the paper envisage the measurement of the thermal conductivity of these materials through an unsteady state method. The experimental method used in determining the thermal conductivity is based on the principle of temperatures at the interface of two homogeneous semi-infinite bodies of previously altogether different temperatures. The advantage that this method provides lies mainly in the simplicity of findings and the quickness of test runnings. The experimental tests have been accomplished by numerical modeling by means of a computational program based on the finite element method (FEM). The latter have been conducted bidimensionally. under transient state conditions for different lengths of the three materials in dry state. The numerical and experimental results have shown a good agreement for the temperature of the contact area.,True,93XA300AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nelu-Cristian_Chereches/publication/262172466_Thermal_conductivity_modeling_of_building_facade_materials/links/54bcfcc60cf27c8f2812eb3a.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nelu-Cristian_Chereches/publication/262172466_Thermal_conductivity_modeling_of_building_facade_materials/links/54bcfcc60cf27c8f2812eb3a.pdf,0,0,0

The measurement techniques develop continuously. important improvements being the goal in order to provide solutions to various difficulties encountered in the acquisition or processing of wind data. In the case of experimental studies in boundary layer wind tunnel on scaled models. the pressure taps placed on the model surfaces is the most common method of measuring the normal local wind pressures. The solar panels immersed in aerodynamic field are subjected to the fluctuations of wind loads. The assessment of these wind loads on both faces of the solar collectors is necessary for safety in operation. no matter the support and the arrangement of the solar panels. Punctual measurements of the fluctuating pressure on both sides of a solar panel model are quite difficult to achieve due to the presence of a large numbers of tubes on tributary small areas.

Cham,In Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs). the pump systems are one of the most energy intensive processes. An efficient energy management of pumps should produce environmental and economic benefits. In this paper. we propose a daily data-driven approach for a detailed pump efficiency analysis that reduces the time gap between an inefficiency and its detection. provides detailed information for decision making by using new Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). and detects inefficient pump set-ups and designs. The proposed approach based on signal decomposition relies on sensors generally available in WWTPs. e.g. daily pump inflow and energy consumption. Moreover. it allows decomposing the data signal in an automatic way into a long-term trend and short-term fluctuations. This information can then be used to support plant managers more effectively.,True,9N0EFVwAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,6,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-62407-5_56,15172205934629941954,/scholar?cites=15172205934629941954,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dario_Torregrossa/publication/318435711_Pump_Efficiency_Analysis_of_Waste_Water_Treatment_Plants_A_Data_Mining_Approach_Using_Signal_Decomposition_for_Decision_Making/links/5a8bf925a6fdcc6b1a4430f8/Pump-Efficiency-Analysis-of-Waste-Water-Treatment-Plants-A-Data-Mining-Approach-Using-Signal-Decomposition-for-Decision-Making.pdf,0,0,0

Currently. energy cost models are generally generated using logarithmic. exponential or linear functions that could produce not accurate results when the relationship between variables is highly complex and non-linear. In order to overcome this issue. this paper proposes a new methodology based on machine-learning algorithms that perform better with complex datasets. In this paper. machine learning was used to generate high-performing energy cost models for wastewater treatment plants. using a database of 317 wastewater treatment plants located in north-west Europe.

In previous works. the cantilever is used as a switch but in our design. it is applied as a variable capacitor. For increasing the maximum achievable capacitance of the cantilever. the suspended capacitive plate should be moved as parallel with fixed plate.

1230269,Modelling Spatial Uncertainties associated with Emission Disaggregation in an integrated Energy Air Quality Assessment Model,2012,Ulrich Leopold and Gerard BM Heuvelink and Laurent Drouet and Daniel S Zachary,,,,,,This paper presents a methodology to model spatial uncertainties associated to the disaggregation of sectoral emission allocation in Luxembourg. We apply it to the integrated Luxembourg Energy Air Quality assessment model for the urban and regional scale. National aggregated sectoral emissions of primary air pollutants are computed by an energy model which minimises the cost of the reference energy system. The model describes five sectors. ie agriculture. transport. industry. residential and commercial at five-year periods. The sectoral emissions are spatially allocated to obtain hourly to daily emission maps. The air quality model simulates the dispersion of the emitted pollutants and their chemical reactions to produce ozone for typical episodes for each five-year period. Both models are coupled by an Oracle Based Optimisation Engine (OBOE) to find the optimal energy system with a constraint on ozone concentrations. When disaggregating emissions from the national to the urban scale. small scale variation and its associated uncertainty within and across land-use boundaries have to be modelled to obtain realistic emission maps. We propose to decompose the emission value for each sector into its mean. standard deviation and spatially correlated Gaussian distributed error with zero mean and unit variance. The spatial error is modelled by spatial stochastic simulation assuming a semivariogram with local and regional scale variability to account for within-boundary and across-boundary variation. A Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate the spatially correlated error and its distribution at each grid cell of the emission map.

The lack of data on the range and volume of prescribed pharmaceuticals. and on their behaviour in the environment. presented a considerable challenge to the initial selection process. The final selection of pharmaceutical substances to be included in the monitoring campaigns was based on literature data. existing priority lists. national consumption patterns and expert input from within the regions (Northwest Europe). Fifteen micropollutant compounds were identified from the diverse range of reported and prescribed pharmaceuticals in the healthcare sector: atenolol. carbamazepine. diclofenac. naproxen. lidocaine. ifosphamide. cyclophosphamide. ciprofloxacin. erythromycin. clarithromycin. sulfamethoxazole. iopromide. iopamidol. diatrizoate. and bezafibrate. Eight hospital locations in six countries were monitored for periods ranging from several weeks to one year. Samples were taken from hospital effluent (sewers) flow-proportionally and analysed by LC-MS-MS.

Optimistically. plant managers assess their plant efficiency once or twice per year. Consequently. the time gap between an inefficiency and its detection produces avoidable operational costs. Although the installation of multiple on-line sensors can provide detailed energy information. for a human operator it is unrealistic to analyse the produced data in a satisfactory time-scale. This paper proposes a cooperative tool for energy saving that remotely accesses and evaluates WWTP databases to produce daily energy assessment reports. The novelty of this decision support tool lies in the original combination of: key performance indicators. daily benchmarking. expert knowledge. scenario analysis. fuzzy logic and shared knowledge.

Hospital effluent is considered as a point source of typical wastewater nutrients but also of micro-pollutants such as pharmaceutical residues in a municipal sewer system. The results showed the capacity of the MBR technology to remove COD and nitrogen compounds up to 90% and 70% respectively. Pharmaceutical emission levels of the hospital and the capability of MBR to eliminate these substances were observed over several weeks. Due to their persistency in wastewater. only a few compounds showed a removal rate higher than 60%(Acetyl-Sulfamethoxazole. Clarithromycin. Atorvastatin and Paracetamol). An increase in concentration was observed for Sulfamethoxazole. a sulfonamide antibiotic which is excreted in an acetylated form (Acetyl-Sulfamethoxazole) and reverts to its mother compound during treatment.

Clemency. Pippach. Bertrange: the “Clemency Branch”). In the SES. the overall supply system is strongly hierarchical with at its centre. one. very large storage tank (Rebierg). This system is characterised by highly fluctuating flows. which can rapidly vary from almost zero to 1000 m3/hour in some pipe sections. There is therefore an expectation that the stresses these pipes are encountering can be relatively high. However. at present there are no (pressure) measurements available to confirm or quantify this assumption. The expectation is that the installation of the RTC4water’s.

In this paper. we use exploratory and case study research methods to assess the contribution of external influences to innovation and stagnation in Suame Magazine. The study revealed that the most significant innovations among the technical artisans are a result of new knowledge. which is acquired through institutional linkages and the entry of qualified artisans who were trained outside the cluster. Given that the present decline in productivity is a result of external rather than endemic influences. our analysis suggests that a sustained increase in knowledge-based linkages with public and nongovernmental institutions is necessary for the cluster's survival. Improved collaboration would contribute significantly to employment and growth across the vehicle repair and manufacturing sector. Yet without rapid. substantial advancement in the knowledge of Suame's artisans. the cluster will continue to stagnate.

No prelo,,,,The global “Maker Movement” is a trend toward the democratization of technology by means of do-it-yourself culture. open-source sharing. and small scale manufacturing. Related initiatives include community workshops such as makerspaces and Fab Labs. giant Maker Faire festivals worldwide. and support for new inventions (and their inventors) through entrepreneurial competitions and activities. This movement has attracted significant media attention and interest from educators. multinational corporations. and national governments.Although informal sector activities often overlap with do-it-yourself culture. our research indicates that many “Maker” initiatives in developing countries have ignored existing grassroots innovators–often in favour of topdown policies that supplant existing initiatives while attempting to target similar users. This paper discusses how the present lack of integration between Maker initiatives and the informal sector can be a form of neo-colonialism; in addition. the popularity of creating new community workshops detracts from the support available for existing grassroots facilities and industrial clusters. Due to the lack of cross-sector collaboration. contributions from grassroot artisans to the global Maker discussion remain limited and underappreciated.,True,uXMmC_kAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Waldman-Brown/publication/292983566_DEMOCRATISING_TECHNOLOGY_THE_CONFLUENCE_OF_MAKERS_AND_GRASSROOT_INNOVATORS/links/56b3b65c08ae636a540d1c27.pdf,2963600438745243447,/scholar?cites=2963600438745243447,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Waldman-Brown/publication/292983566_DEMOCRATISING_TECHNOLOGY_THE_CONFLUENCE_OF_MAKERS_AND_GRASSROOT_INNOVATORS/links/56b3b65c08ae636a540d1c27.pdf,0,0,0

1230299,Strengthening Manufacturing Innovation Ecosystems Before. During. and After COVID: Lessons from Massachusetts,2021,Elisabeth Reynolds and Dan Traficonte and Anna Waldman-Brown,,,,,,Concerns about structural weaknesses in the US manufacturing sector have been voiced for decades. particularly since the dramatic decline in manufacturing establishments and jobs following the 2000 recession. A common thread in these analyses was the hollowing out of the shared institutional infrastructure––alternatively. the manufacturing ecosystem––that firms could turn to for support. Work by MIT researchers and others pointed to the loss of critical capabilities in the American manufacturing base and had long highlighted the problem that manufacturers. particularly small and medium-size. were “home alone” when it came to finding the institutional support they needed to increase productivity and innovate (Bonvillian and Singer 2018; Berger 2013; Glasmeier 2000; Cohen and Zysman 1987). As larger firms became more vertically disintegrated. outsourcing and offshoring many of their activities. the positive spillovers and public goods that they once provided both to their suppliers as well as the communities within which they operated. disappeared. Without increased attention and investments. experts warned that the US was jeopardizing its national security. capacity to innovate. and economic growth opportunities more broadly. while other countries continued to make massive investments in manufacturing capabilities across a range of technologies and industries (Shih and Pisano 2012).In part. these warnings were heeded.

For some cities and regions. these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However. they are still expensive to build and maintain. a significant challenge. especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively.

The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France. Italy. the Netherlands. and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m). without having access to training data from Germany.

In this paper. we propose a new direction toward this goal by introducing a differentiable (smoothed) maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT) solver that can be integrated into the loop of larger deep learning systems. Our (approximate) solver is based upon a fast coordinate descent approach to solving the semidefinite program (SDP) associated with the MAXSAT problem. We show how to analytically differentiate through the solution to this SDP and efficiently solve the associated backward pass. We demonstrate that by integrating this solver into end-to-end learning systems. we can learn the logical structure of challenging problems in a minimally supervised fashion.

However. traditional state estimation techniques have difficulty coping with the  low-observability  conditions often present on the distribution system due to the paucity of sensors and heterogeneity of measurements. To address these limitations. we propose a distribution system state estimation algorithm that employs matrix completion (a tool for estimating missing values in low-rank matrices) augmented with noise-resilient power flow constraints. This method operates under low-observability conditions where standard least-squares-based methods cannot operate. and flexibly incorporates any network quantities measured in the field. We empirically evaluate our method on the IEEE 33- and 123-bus test systems. and find …,True,PfRSkfEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,20,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8930601/,788890183932688565,/scholar?cites=788890183932688565,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.09799,0,0,0
1230316,Enforcing robust control guarantees within neural network policies,2020,Priya L Donti and Melrose Roderick and Mahyar Fazlyab and J Zico Kolter,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.08105,,,,When designing controllers for safety-critical systems. practitioners often face a challenging tradeoff between robustness and performance. While robust control methods provide rigorous guarantees on system stability under certain worst-case disturbances. they often result in simple controllers that perform poorly in the average (non-worst) case. In contrast. nonlinear control methods trained using deep learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many control tasks. but often lack robustness guarantees. We propose a technique that combines the strengths of these two approaches: a generic nonlinear control policy class. parameterized by neural networks. that nonetheless enforces the same provable robustness criteria as robust control. Specifically. we show that by integrating custom convex-optimization-based projection layers into a nonlinear policy. we can construct a provably robust neural network policy class that outperforms robust control methods in the average (non-adversarial) setting. We demonstrate the power of this approach on several domains. improving in performance over existing robust control methods and in stability over (non-robust) RL methods.,True,PfRSkfEAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,5,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08105,18128961654135874405,/scholar?cites=18128961654135874405,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08105,0,0,0

1230342,STI-DICO: A Web-Based ITS for Fostering Dictionary Skills and Knowledge,2016,Alexandra Luccioni and Jacqueline Bourdeau and Jean Massardi and Roger Nkambou,,,,416-421,Springer. Cham, A major issue in introducing new technological tools in the classroom is that the teachers who are meant to use them often do not receive the necessary training. This is the case of electronic dictionaries. which are seldom used by both students and teachers. despite their benefits for improving vocabulary development and academic achievement [14]. We propose to address this issue with STI-DICO. an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) to help French teachers-in-training acquire both the linguistic knowledge and the practical skills needed to successfully use electronic dictionaries [7]. ITS are advanced intelligent learning environments aiming at providing learners with adaptive tutoring services. relying on a cognitive diagnostic to adapt to learners’ knowledge states at each step of the learning process. based on a formal modeling of the knowledge domain [11].

An experiment on L2 lexical acquisition,2012,Alexandra Vorobyova and Luciana Benotti and Frédéric Landragin,,,,185-186,,We describe an experimental study designed to evaluate the effect of overspecification on L2 language acquisition.

One reason for this disagreement is that it is difficult to mentally simulate the effects of a process as complex as climate change and to have a concrete representation of the impact that our individual actions will have on our own future. especially if the consequences are long term and abstract. To overcome these challenges. we propose to use cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to develop an interactive personalized visualization tool. the AI climate impact visualizer.

1230378,Investigating Australian dust aerosol spatiotemporal effects on direct normal irradiance forecasts,2018,Surya Karthik Mukkavilli,,,,,,Direct normal irradiance (DNI) is the main input for concentrating solar power (CSP). DNI simulation accuracy is sensitive to radiative transfer schemes (RTSs) and microphysics in numerical weather prediction models. DNI has large uncertainties mainly due to clouds but can additionally be attenuated by aerosols in some regions. with marked consequences for CSP operation. To date. the capability of different physical parameterisation schemes for simulating hourly DNI under varying aerosol conditions over Australia has not been compared. This thesis addresses this gap by providing an analysis of the Weather Research and Forecasting model which considers DNI simulations with aerosols for CSP. To study the role of aerosols and dust in more detail. Part I intercompares total aerosol optical depth (AOD) and dust AOD from two global reanalysis datasets: ECMWF Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) and the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications-2 (MERRA-2).

1230385,Ice and the apparent variation of GPS station positions for Alaska,2015,Kelly Anne Kochanski,,,,,,Most GPS stations in Alaska show apparent seasonal variations on the order of one centimeter. The majority of these stations move downwards throughout the winter. a motion which is in phase with regional snowfall and has been attributed to hydrological loading (Fu et. al.. 2012). The range of phases across the state. however. spans half the year and does not correlate with snow patterns. Six stations show discontinuous seasonal variations on the order of 1-10cm. After examining the geography and windspeed at these sites. we conclude that at least three of them will accumulate rime ice during the winter. and that this ice can cause apparent upwards motions of the stations. This hypothesis is supported by seasonal variations in the stations' multipath values. which indicate increased signal scattering during the winter.,True,_2RdM5sAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/114125,16268973177472169976,/scholar?cites=16268973177472169976,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/114125/1027723156-MIT.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Current sea ice models. however. predict more ice than is observed in the Arctic. and less in the Antarctic. Improving the fit of these physics-based models to observations is challenging because the models are expensive to run. and therefore expensive to optimize. Here. we construct a machine learning surrogate that emulates the effect of changing model physics on forecasts of sea ice area from the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE). We use the surrogate model to investigate the sensitivity of CICE to changes in the parameters governing: ice's ridging and albedo; snow's albedo. aging. and thermal conductivity; the effect of meltwater on albedo; and the effect of ponds on albedo. We find that CICE's sensitivity to these model parameters differs between hemispheres. We propose that future sea ice modelers separate the snow conductivity and snow grain size distributions on a seasonal and inter-hemispheric basis. and we recommend optimal values of these parameters. This will make it possible to make models that fit observations of both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice more closely. These results demonstrate that important aspects of the behavior of a leading sea ice model can be captured by a relatively simple support vector regression surrogate model. and that this surrogate dramatically increases the ease of tuning the full simulation.,True,_2RdM5sAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12977,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12977,0,0,0

The International Young Physicists' Tournament (IYPT) teaches these skills by inviting high school students to investigate simple unsolved systems instead of reproducing familiar results. Students work in teams to form hypotheses. gather data. and present their results orally in a tournament format. The IYPT has published 17 questions yearly since 1988. and its archives are an efficient source of experimental problems for outreach programs and have also been used for first-year undergraduate project classes (Planisic. 2009).

This motion is usually in phase with regional snowfall and has been attributed to hydrological loading (Fu et al. 2012). We studied the phase of vertical seasonal motion for fifty stations in the PBO network across Alaska and Washington State and found six stations which move two to four months out of phase with snowfall with amplitudes greater than 4mm. The mean date at which stations' seasonal movement reached peak height was October 21 with a standard deviation of 49.7 days. 59% of this variation is created by the six stations with phases furthest from the mean. These stations are also distinguished by discontinuous winter movements. including jumps of more than 10mm/day. and they have the six most asymmetric time-series in the study.

These bedforms affect local and global energy fluxes but have not been incorporated into Earth system models because the conditions governing their development are not well understood. To address this difficulty. we created statistical classifiers. drawn from 736 hr of time‐lapse footage in the Colorado Front Range. that predict bedform presence as a function of wind speed and time since snowfall. These classifiers provide the first quantitative predictions of bedform and sastrugi presence in varying weather conditions. We find that the likelihood that a snow surface is covered by bedforms increases with time since snowfall and with wind speed and that the likelihood that a surface is covered by sastrugi increases with time and with the highest wind speeds.

Our investigation focused on a deformed sequence of Paleoizoic sediments within this complex. These sediments have a distinctive stratigraphy which reveals a series of distinct deformations. We found four distinct generations of ductile events. as well as recent extensional faulting. The timing of deformation events are constrained by two igneous units: the intrusive Lazy Daisy pluton (74Ma±3) and the late Tertiary Peach Springs Tuff (18.5 Ma).

We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry. locality. compositionality. and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine learning. a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one.

However. well-annotated datasets can be time-consuming and expensive to collect. lending increased interest to larger but noisy datasets that are more easily obtained. In this paper. we show that deep neural networks are capable of generalizing from training data for which true labels are massively outnumbered by incorrect labels. We demonstrate remarkably high test performance after training on corrupted data from MNIST. CIFAR. and ImageNet. For example. on MNIST we obtain test accuracy above 90 percent even after each clean training example has been diluted with 100 randomly-labeled examples. Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise. even when erroneous labels are biased towards confusing classes. We show that training in this regime requires a significant but manageable increase in dataset size that is related to the factor by which correct labels have been diluted. Finally. we provide an analysis of our results that shows how increasing noise decreases the effective batch size.,True,P_luG3cAAAAJ:8AbLer7MMksC,255,https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694,5647581376755512521,/scholar?cites=5647581376755512521,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10694,0,0,0

We shed light on this by proving that the total number of neurons  required to approximate natural classes of multivariate polynomials of  variables grows only linearly with  for deep neural networks. but grows exponentially when merely a single hidden layer is allowed.

1230409,How to start training: The effect of initialization and architecture,2018,Boris Hanin and David Rolnick,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1803.01719,,,,We identify and study two common failure modes for early training in deep ReLU nets. For each we give a rigorous proof of when it occurs and how to avoid it. for fully connected and residual architectures. The first failure mode. exploding/vanishing mean activation length. can be avoided by initializing weights from a symmetric distribution with variance 2/fan-in and. for ResNets. by correctly weighting the residual modules. We prove that the second failure mode. exponentially large variance of activation length. never occurs in residual nets once the first failure mode is avoided. In contrast. for fully connected nets. we prove that this failure mode can happen and is avoided by keeping constant the sum of the reciprocals of layer widths. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our theoretical results in predicting when networks are able to start training. In particular. we note that many popular initializations fail our criteria. whereas correct initialization and architecture allows much deeper networks to be trained.,True,P_luG3cAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,95,https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01719,9627141893890263732,/scholar?cites=9627141893890263732,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01719,0,0,0
1230410,Experience replay for continual learning,2018,David Rolnick and Arun Ahuja and Jonathan Schwarz and Timothy P Lillicrap and Greg Wayne,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.11682,,,,Continual learning is the problem of learning new tasks or knowledge while protecting old knowledge and ideally generalizing from old experience to learn new tasks faster. Neural networks trained by stochastic gradient descent often degrade on old tasks when trained successively on new tasks with different data distributions. This phenomenon. referred to as catastrophic forgetting. is considered a major hurdle to learning with non-stationary data or sequences of new tasks. and prevents networks from continually accumulating knowledge and skills. We examine this issue in the context of reinforcement learning. in a setting where an agent is exposed to tasks in a sequence. Unlike most other work. we do not provide an explicit indication to the model of task boundaries. which is the most general circumstance for a learning agent exposed to continuous experience. While various methods to counteract catastrophic forgetting have recently been proposed. we explore a straightforward. general. and seemingly overlooked solution-that of using experience replay buffers for all past events-with a mixture of on-and off-policy learning. leveraging behavioral cloning. We show that this strategy can still learn new tasks quickly yet can substantially reduce catastrophic forgetting in both Atari and DMLab domains. even matching the performance of methods that require task identities. When buffer storage is constrained. we confirm that a simple mechanism for randomly discarding data allows a limited size buffer to perform almost as well as an unbounded one.,True,P_luG3cAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC,92,https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11682,12328944785368708294,/scholar?cites=12328944785368708294,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11682,0,0,0
1230411,Complexity of linear regions in deep networks,2019,Boris Hanin and David Rolnick,,,,2596-2604,PMLR,It is well-known that the expressivity of a neural network depends on its architecture. with deeper networks expressing more complex functions. In the case of networks that compute piecewise linear functions. such as those with ReLU activation. the number of distinct linear regions is a natural measure of expressivity. It is possible to construct networks with merely a single region. or for which the number of linear regions grows exponentially with depth; it is not clear where within this range most networks fall in practice. either before or after training. In this paper. we provide a mathematical framework to count the number of linear regions of a piecewise linear network and measure the volume of the boundaries between these regions. In particular. we prove that for networks at initialization. the average number of regions along any one-dimensional subspace grows linearly in the total number of neurons. far below the exponential upper bound. We also find that the average distance to the nearest region boundary at initialization scales like the inverse of the number of neurons. Our theory suggests that. even after training. the number of linear regions is far below exponential. an intuition that matches our empirical observations. We conclude that the practical expressivity of neural networks is likely far below that of the theoretical maximum. and that this gap can be quantified.,True,P_luG3cAAAAJ:J-pR_7NvFogC,62,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/hanin19a.html,6572900177737298614,/scholar?cites=6572900177737298614,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/hanin19a/hanin19a.pdf,0,0,0
1230412,Deep ReLU networks have surprisingly few activation patterns,2019,Boris Hanin and David Rolnick,,,,361-370,,The success of deep networks has been attributed in part to their expressivity: per parameter. deep networks can approximate a richer class of functions than shallow networks. In ReLU networks. the number of activation patterns is one measure of expressivity; and the maximum number of patterns grows exponentially with the depth. However. recent work has showed that the practical expressivity of deep networks-the functions they can learn rather than express-is often far from the theoretical maximum. In this paper. we show that the average number of activation patterns for ReLU networks at initialization is bounded by the total number of neurons raised to the input dimension. We show empirically that this bound. which is independent of the depth. is tight both at initialization and during training. even on memorization tasks that should maximize the number of activation patterns. Our work suggests that realizing the full expressivity of deep networks may not be possible in practice. at least with current methods.,True,P_luG3cAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,51,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00904,3390781605351160042,/scholar?cites=3390781605351160042,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00904,0,0,0

1230419,Measuring and regularizing networks in function space,2018,Ari S Benjamin and David Rolnick and Konrad Kording,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.08289,,,,To optimize a neural network one often thinks of optimizing its parameters. but it is ultimately a matter of optimizing the function that maps inputs to outputs. Since a change in the parameters might serve as a poor proxy for the change in the function. it is of some concern that primacy is given to parameters but that the correspondence has not been tested. Here. we show that it is simple and computationally feasible to calculate distances between functions in a  Hilbert space. We examine how typical networks behave in this space. and compare how parameter  distances compare to function  distances between various points of an optimization trajectory. We find that the two distances are nontrivially related. In particular. the  ratio decreases throughout optimization. reaching a steady value around when test error plateaus. We then investigate how the  distance could be applied directly to optimization. We first propose that in multitask learning. one can avoid catastrophic forgetting by directly limiting how much the input/output function changes between tasks. Secondly. we propose a new learning rule that constrains the distance a network can travel through -space in any one update. This allows new examples to be learned in a way that minimally interferes with what has previously been learned. These applications demonstrate how one can measure and regularize function distances directly. without relying on parameters or local approximations like loss curvature.,True,P_luG3cAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,11,https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08289,15363433308760579134,/scholar?cites=15363433308760579134,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08289,0,0,0

Here we introduce cross-classification clustering (3C). a technique that simultaneously tracks complex. interrelated objects in an image stack. The key idea in cross-classification is to efficiently turn a clustering problem into a classification problem by running a logarithmic number of independent classifications per image. letting the cross-labeling of these classifications uniquely classify each pixel to the object labels. We apply the 3C mechanism to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in connectomics--the nanoscale mapping of neural tissue from electron microscopy volumes. Our reconstruction system increases scalability by an order of magnitude over existing single-object tracking methods (such as flood-filling networks). This scalability is important for the deployment of connectomics pipelines. since currently the best performing techniques require computing infrastructures that are beyond the reach of most laboratories. Our algorithm may offer benefits in other domains that require pixel-accurate tracking of multiple objects. such as segmentation of videos and medical imagery.,True,P_luG3cAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC,10,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Meirovitch_Cross-Classification_Clustering_An_Efficient_Multi-Object_Tracking_Technique_for_3-D_Instance_CVPR_2019_paper.html,968735486106655081,/scholar?cites=968735486106655081,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Meirovitch_Cross-Classification_Clustering_An_Efficient_Multi-Object_Tracking_Technique_for_3-D_Instance_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf,0,0,0

In this work. we identify that metric scaling and metric task conditioning are important to improve the performance of few-shot algorithms. Our analysis reveals that simple metric scaling completely changes the nature of few-shot algorithm parameter updates. Metric scaling provides improvements up to 14% in accuracy for certain metrics on the mini-Imagenet 5-way 5-shot classification task. We further propose a simple and effective way of conditioning a learner on the task sample set. resulting in learning a task-dependent metric space. Moreover. we propose and empirically test a practical end-to-end optimization procedure based on auxiliary task co-training to learn a task-dependent metric space.

1230443,Sequential model-based ensemble optimization,2014,Alexandre Lacoste and Hugo Larochelle and François Laviolette and Mario Marchand,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1402.0796,,,,One of the most tedious tasks in the application of machine learning is model selection. ie hyperparameter selection. Fortunately. recent progress has been made in the automation of this process. through the use of sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) methods. This can be used to optimize a cross-validation performance of a learning algorithm over the value of its hyperparameters. However. it is well known that ensembles of learned models almost consistently outperform a single model. even if properly selected. In this paper. we thus propose an extension of SMBO methods that automatically constructs such ensembles. This method builds on a recently proposed ensemble construction paradigm known as agnostic Bayesian learning. In experiments on 22 regression and 39 classification data sets. we confirm the success of this proposed approach. which is able to outperform model selection with SMBO.,True,71a2-WMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,28,https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0796,6835358873481068472,/scholar?cites=6835358873481068472,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.0796,0,0,0
1230444,Agnostic Bayesian learning of ensembles,2014,Alexandre Lacoste and Mario Marchand and François Laviolette and Hugo Larochelle,,,,611-619,PMLR,We propose a method for producing ensembles of predictors based on holdout estimations of their generalization performances. This approach uses a prior directly on the performance of predictors taken from a finite set of candidates and attempts to infer which one is best. Using Bayesian inference. we can thus obtain a posterior that represents our uncertainty about that choice and construct a weighted ensemble of predictors accordingly. This approach has the advantage of not requiring that the predictors be probabilistic themselves. can deal with arbitrary measures of performance and does not assume that the data was actually generated from any of the predictors in the ensemble. Since the problem of finding the best (as opposed to the true) predictor among a class is known as agnostic PAC-learning. we refer to our method as agnostic Bayesian learning. We also propose a method to address the case where the performance estimate is obtained from k-fold cross validation. While being efficient and easily adjustable to any loss function. our experiments confirm that the agnostic Bayes approach is state of the art compared to common baselines such as model selection based on k-fold cross-validation or a linear combination of predictor outputs.,True,71a2-WMAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,28,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/lacoste14.html,3120586296812741468,/scholar?cites=3120586296812741468,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/lacoste14.pdf,0,0,0

The model divides the document into small. overlapping windows and encodes all windows in parallel with an RNN. It then attends over these window encodings. reducing them to a single encoding. which is decoded into an answer using a sequence decoder. This hierarchical approach allows the model to scale to longer documents without increasing the number of sequential steps. In a supervised setting. our model achieves state of the art accuracy of 76.8 on the WikiReading dataset. We also evaluate the model in a semi-supervised setting by downsampling the WikiReading training set to create increasingly smaller amounts of supervision. while leaving the full unlabeled document corpus to train a sequence autoencoder on document windows.

Continual learning addresses this problem in scenarios where the learning agent faces a stream of changing tasks. In these scenarios. the agent is expected to retain its highest performance on previous tasks without revisiting them while adapting well to the new tasks. Two new recent continual-learning scenarios have been proposed. In meta-continual learning. the model is pre-trained to minimize catastrophic forgetting when trained on a sequence of tasks. In continual-meta learning. the goal is faster remembering. ie. focusing on how quickly the agent recovers performance rather than measuring the agent's performance without any adaptation. Both scenarios have the potential to propel the field forward. Yet in their original formulations. they each have limitations. As a remedy. we propose a more general scenario where an agent must quickly solve (new) out-of-distribution tasks. while also requiring fast remembering. We show that current continual learning. meta learning. meta-continual learning. and continual-meta learning techniques fail in this new scenario. Accordingly. we propose a strong baseline: Continual-MAML. an online extension of the popular MAML algorithm.

Cham,Few-shot classification is challenging because the data distribution of the training set can be widely different to the test set as their classes are disjoint. This distribution shift often results in poor generalization. Manifold smoothing has been shown to address the distribution shift problem by extending the decision boundaries and reducing the noise of the class representations. Moreover. manifold smoothness is a key factor for semi-supervised learning and transductive learning algorithms. In this work. we propose to use embedding propagation as an unsupervised non-parametric regularizer for manifold smoothing in few-shot classification. Embedding propagation leverages interpolations between the extracted features of a neural network based on a similarity graph. We empirically show that embedding propagation yields a smoother embedding manifold.

Theoretically. we analyze the condition under which convergence of the estimator variance can be connected to convergence of the lower bound.

1230456,Agnostic Bayes,2015,Alexandre Lacoste,,,,,,Machine learning is the science of learning from examples. Algorithms based on this approach are now ubiquitous. While there has been significant progress. this field presents important challenges. Namely. simply selecting the function that best fits the observed data was shown to have no statistical guarantee on the examples that have not yet been observed. There are a few learning theories that suggest how to address this problem. Among these. we present the Bayesian modeling of machine learning and the PAC-Bayesian approach to machine learning in a unified view to highlight important similarities. The outcome of this analysis suggests that model averaging is one of the key elements to obtain a good generalization performance. Specifically. one should perform predictions based on the outcome of every model instead of simply the one that best fits the observed data. Unfortunately. this approach comes with a high computational cost problem. and finding good approximations is the subject of active research. In this thesis. we present an innovative approach that can be applied with a low computational cost on a wide range of machine learning setups. In order to achieve this. we apply the Bayes’ theory in a different way than what is conventionally done for machine learning. Specifically. instead of searching for the true model at the origin of the observed data. we search for the best model according to a given metric. While the difference seems subtle. in this approach. we do not assume that the true model belongs to the set of explored model. Hence. we say that we are agnostic.

Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms.Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors. and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity.Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants. 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period. participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data.Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity. including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-. 63.

In machine learning. however. artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes. dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function. often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First. structured architectures are used. including dedicated systems for attention. recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second. cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions. (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development. and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses. we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry. and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system. enabled by a series of interacting cost functions. serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism.

Fast-timescale disturbances occur when muscles fatigue. Slow-timescale disturbances occur when muscles are damaged or when limb dynamics change as a result of development. To maintain performance. motor commands need to adapt. Computing the best adaptation in response to any performance error results in a credit assignment problem: which timescale is responsible for this disturbance?

1230464,Relevance of error: what drives motor adaptation?,2009,Kunlin Wei and Konrad Kording,101,Journal of neurophysiology,2,655-664,American Physiological Society,During motor adaptation the nervous system constantly uses error information to improve future movements. Today's mainstream models simply assume that the nervous system adapts linearly and proportionally to errors. However. not all movement errors are relevant to our own action. The environment may transiently disturb the movement production—for example. a gust of wind blows the tennis ball away from its intended trajectory. Apparently the nervous system should not adapt its motor plan in the subsequent tennis strokes based on this irrelevant movement error. We hypothesize that the nervous system estimates the relevance of each observed error and adapts strongly only to relevant errors. Here we present a Bayesian treatment of this problem. The model calculates how likely an error is relevant to the motor plant and derives an ideal adaptation strategy that leads to the most precise movements.

1230466,Estimating the sources of motor errors for adaptation and generalization,2008,Max Berniker and Konrad Kording,11,Nature neuroscience,12,1454-1461,Nature Publishing Group,Motor adaptation is usually defined as the process by which our nervous system produces accurate movements while the properties of our bodies and our environment continuously change. Many experimental and theoretical studies have characterized this process by assuming that the nervous system uses internal models to compensate for motor errors. Here we extend these approaches and construct a probabilistic model that not only compensates for motor errors but estimates the sources of these errors. These estimates dictate how the nervous system should generalize. For example. estimated changes of limb properties will affect movements across the workspace but not movements with the other limb. We provide evidence that many movement-generalization phenomena emerge from a strategy by which the nervous system estimates the sources of our motor errors.,True,MiFqJGcAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,302,https://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v11/n12/full/nn.2229.html,5112922538351843326,/scholar?cites=5112922538351843326,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2707921/,0,0,0

The perception of our own body and more particularly our sense of body ownership is taken for granted. Nevertheless experimental findings from body ownership illusions (BOIs). show that under specific multisensory conditions. we can experience artificial body parts or fake bodies as our own body parts or body respectively. The aim of the present paper is to discuss how and why BOIs are induced. We review several experimental findings concerning the spatial. temporal and semantic principles of crossmodal stimuli that have been applied to induce BOIs. On the basis of these principles. we discuss theoretical approaches concerning the underlying mechanism of BOIs. We propose a conceptualization based on Bayesian causal inference for addressing how our nervous system could infer whether an object belongs to our own body. using multisensory. sensorimotor and semantic information. and we discuss how this can account for several experimental findings.

Automatically detecting falls can allow rapid response to potential emergencies; in addition. knowing the cause or manner of a fall can be beneficial for prevention studies or a more tailored emergency response. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate techniques to not only reliably detect a fall but also to automatically classify the type. We asked 15 subjects to simulate four different types of falls–left and right lateral. forward trips. and backward slips–while wearing mobile phones and previously validated. dedicated accelerometers. Nine subjects also wore the devices for ten days. to provide data for comparison with the simulated falls. We applied five machine learning classifiers to a large time-series feature set to detect falls. Support vector machines and regularized logistic regression were able to identify a fall with 98% accuracy and classify the type of fall with 99% accuracy.

Models of pointing in sensorimotor control and learning usually assume a quadratic loss function in which the mean squared error is minimized. Here we develop a technique for measuring the loss associated with errors. Subjects were required to perform a task while we experimentally controlled the skewness of the distribution of errors they experienced.

These datasets do not yet exist. and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this. here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism. and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels. from the overall logical flow. via logical gates. to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems. regardless of the amount of data.

To achieve this. the nervous system needs to estimate central variables for our movement based on past knowledge and new feedback. both of which are uncertain. In the Bayesian framework. rates of adaptation characterize how noisy feedback is in comparison to the uncertainty of the state estimate. The predictions of Bayesian models are intuitive: the nervous system should adapt slower when sensory feedback is more noisy and faster when its state estimate is more uncertain. Here we want to quantitatively understand how uncertainty in these two factors affects motor adaptation. In a hand reaching experiment we measured trial-by-trial adaptation to a randomly changing visual perturbation to characterize the way the nervous system handles uncertainty in state estimation and feedback.

We determine the distribution over time of the most extreme projection errors (unpredictability) from 1985 to 2014. and the largest year-over-year changes (volatility) in the quantities themselves from 1949 to 2014. Our results show that both volatility and unpredictability have increased in the past decade. compared to the three and two decades before it.

In the United States (US). recent synthesis studies of field measurements of CH4 emissions at different spatial scales are ~1.5x-2x greater compared to official Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) greenhouse gas inventory (GHGI) estimates. Site-level field studies have isolated the production-segment as the dominant contributor to this divergence. Based on an updated synthesis of measurements from component-level field studies. we develop a new inventory-based model for CH4 emissions using bootstrap resampling that agrees within error with recent syntheses of site-level field studies and allows for isolation of differences between our inventory and the GHGI at the equipment-level. We find that venting and malfunction-related emissions from tanks and other equipment leaks are the largest contributors to divergence with the GHGI. To further understand this divergence. we decompose GHGI equipment-level emission factors into their underlying component-level data. This decomposition shows that GHGI inventory methods are based on measurements of emission rates that are systematically lower compared with our updated synthesis of more recent measurements. If our proposed method were adopted in the US and other jurisdictions. inventory estimates could become more accurate. helping to guide methane mitigation policy priorities.,True,LPDyDHYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,1,https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1793/,1730111608662877326,/scholar?cites=1730111608662877326,,https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/1793/download/3784/,0,0,0

This need not be the case.  Methanotrophic (methane-oxidizing) bacteria can transform methane into useful protein-rich biomass (e.g.. to replace fishmeal in animal feeds). Here. we analyze the economic potential of producing methanotrophic microbial protein from methane emitted and flared from wastewater treatment plants. landfills. and oil and gas facilities. Our results show that current technology can enable production equivalent to 15% of the global fishmeal market at prices at or below the current cost of fishmeal of roughly $1.600 per metric ton. We find that methanotroph production is most sensitive to electricity costs. which can be reduced through lower prices or reducing electricity demand.

1230491,brief,2020,Evan Sherwin and Adam Brandt,,,,,,STANFORD UNIVERSITY| NATURAL GAS INITIATIVE not odorized before reaching municipal customers. making leaks more difficult to detect in production. processing. and transmission than in cities. Current leak detection and repair methods generally require ground crews operating specialized handheld equipment. limiting the number of facilities that can reasonably be surveyed in a given year. That said. the results of such field surveys suggest that an outsized fraction of natural gas emissions from oil and gas infrastructure come from a small number of “super-emitters.” While the precise numbers vary across regions. as a rule of thumb about5% of sources account for about 50% of total emissions. Because these leaks are large. they are likely quite profitable to fix. Thus. a rapid screening system capable of finding only these super-emitting sources could allow oil and gas operators to identify and fix the sources responsible for about half of their emissions. Remote sensing from aircraft or satellites has the potential to do just that. Thankfully methane. the main component of natural gas. has a distinct radiation signature. for the same reason it is a powerful greenhouse gas. making it well-suited for these applications. Remote systems from the air generally have lower sensitivity than ground-based methods but can survey large areas much more quickly. A small airplane can cover hundreds of square miles and well over a thousand wells in a day. Ground crews typically visit less than ten sites per day. A satellite can cover the entire globe in less than two weeks.,True,LPDyDHYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://ngi.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj14406/f/NGI_Brief_2020-06_R3.pdf,,,,https://ngi.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj14406/f/NGI_Brief_2020-06_R3.pdf,0,0,0

Smart meter data. with hourly resolution or better. allow improved characterization of the effects of various programs and other interventions on residential and system load shape. We characterize the load shape impacts of the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program. which provides 3.2 million households an average electric bill subsidy of 33%[1]. We use hourly electricity consumption data from roughly 30.000 randomly selected households from Pacific Gas and Electric service territory to estimate the hourly effect of enrollment in the CARE program on household electricity consumption using a fixedeffects regression model. We find that the CARE program is associated with an average increase in electricity consumption of 13%[11%. 16%]. The increase is relatively constant throughout the day. with no two hours statistically distinguishable from each other. We find suggestive evidence that the largest increase in electricity consumption in all three regions occurs between 7pm and 10pm. generally after summer peak demand. The overall increase is smallest in the cooler Coast. largest in the warmer Inland Hills. and in the middle in the hot Central Valley. These estimates of regional differences in the effect of the CARE program can help policy makers and utilities understand the energy effects of changes to low-income electricity subsidies.,True,LPDyDHYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/146996747.pdf#page=377,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/146996747.pdf#page=377,0,0,0

This analysis characterizes the economic viability of electrofuels. synthesized from CO 2 from direct air capture (DAC) and hydrogen from electrolysis of water. powered primarily by solar or wind electricity. This optimization-based techno-economic analysis suggests that using today’s technology. hydrocarbon electrofuels would cost upwards of $14/gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE). far more costly than using petroleum fuels offset with DAC with sequestration (DACS). Even if cost targets for the next decade are met. electrofuels powered by the world’s best solar resources are likely still not competitive with DACS at roughly $200/t (CO 2). By 2050. electrofuel costs could approach $3/GGE. potentially competing with petroleum fuels. Electrofuel cost is most sensitive to the capital cost of the DAC. electrolyzer. and renewable electricity. However. without operational flexibility afforded by storage or supplementary natural gas or grid electricity interconnections. costs can nearly double.,True,LPDyDHYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3646570,,,,,0,0,0
1230497,Identifying air conditioners using monthly household electricity consumption,,Evan D Sherwin,,,,,,Background. Residential electricity consumption data contain a wealth of information about both household-level. and electric power system-level characteristics. A growing literature attempts to use such data to understand changes in household electricity consumption behavior. However. such data often lack important household characteristics. such as the presence of air conditioning (AC). a major driver of summer electricity consumption. Aim. We aim to identify the presence of AC in households on the basis of monthly electricity consumption data. which is available from the billing records of most US electric utilities. Data. We use aggregate and appliance-level measurements of electricity consumption. in kWh. from 482 households in and around Austin. Texas. of which 449 have AC. We couple this with local temperature data. Electricity consumption readings are available at one-minute resolution. which we aggregate to monthly electricity consumption to emulate widely available monthly data. Methods. We identify the presence of AC using three methods. First. we fit a line to electricity consumption and monthly average temperature for warmer months of the year and classify households based on the slope of that line. Second. we apply random forest classification. using mean-normalized electricity consumption in each of the twelve months of one year as features. Third. we apply k-means clustering to the above dataset and create a classifier from these clusters. Results.

1230508,Multitable methods for microbiome data integration,2019,Kris Sankaran and Susan P Holmes,10,,,627,Frontiers,The simultaneous study of multiple measurement types is a frequently encountered problem in practical data analysis. It is especially common in microbiome research. where several sources of data -- for example. 16s-rRNA. metagenomic. metabolomic. or transcriptomic data -- can be collected on the same physical samples \citep{Franzosa2015. McHardy2013}. There has been a proliferation of proposals for analyzing such multitable microbiome data. as is often the case when new data sources become more readily available. facilitating inquiry into new types of scientific questions \citep{Fukuyama2017. Rahnavard2017. Chaudhary2017. Chalise2017. perez2014genome}. However. stepping back from the rush for new methods for multitable analysis in the microbiome literature. it is worthwhile to recognize the broader landscape of multitable methods. as they have been relevant in problem domains ranging across economics \citep{hannan1967canonical}. robotics \citep{vlassis2000supervised}. genomics \citep{gomez2014data}. chemometrics \cite{pages2001multiple}. and neuroscience \cite{ashish2010neuroscience}. In different contexts. these techniques are called data integration. multi-omic. and multitask methods. for example. Of course. there is no unique optimal algorithm to use across domains -- different instances of the multitable problem possess specific structure or variation that are worth incorporating in methodology. Our purpose here is not to develop new algorithms. but rather to (1) distill relevant themes across different analysis approaches and (2) provide concrete workflows for approaching analysis. as a function of ultimate …,True,qx_e_9wAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,9,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00627/full,15681661234679645151,/scholar?cites=15681661234679645151,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.00627/full,0,0,0

We believe a joint proposal has the potential of reducing the number of redundant samples. and introduce a hierarchical structure to induce correlation. The hope is that the proposals would coordinate to make up for the error made by one another to reduce the variance of the importance estimator. Theoretically. we analyze the condition under which convergence of the estimator variance can be connected to convergence of the lower bound. Empirically. we confirm that maximization of the lower bound does implicitly minimize variance.

Recent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available. However. many different types of spatially localized climate patterns are of interest including hurricanes. extra-tropical cyclones. weather fronts. and blocking events among others.

In support of this view. we establish that there are qualitative differences when learning noise vs. natural datasets. showing that:(1) more capacity is needed to fit noise.(2) time to convergence is longer for random labels. but shorter for random inputs. and (3) DNNs trained on real data examples learn simpler functions than when trained with noise data. as measured by the sharpness of the loss function at convergence.

Recent work has shown that fully supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield acceptable accuracy for classifying well-known types of extreme weather events when large amounts of labeled data are available. However. there are many different types of spatially localized climate patterns of interest (including hurricanes. extra-tropical cyclones. weather fronts. blocking events. etc.) found in simulation data for which labeled data is not available at large scale for all simulations of interest. We present a multichannel spatiotemporal encoder-decoder CNN architecture for semi-supervised bounding box prediction and exploratory data analysis. This architecture is designed to fully model multichannel simulation data. temporal dynamics and unlabelled data within a reconstruction and prediction framework so as to improve the detection of a wide range of extreme weather events. Our architecture can be viewed as a 3D convolutional autoencoder with an additional modified one-pass bounding box regression loss. We demonstrate that our approach is able to leverage temporal information and unlabelled data to improve localization of extreme weather events.

Contact tracing is an essential tool to change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Manual contact tracing of Covid-19 cases has significant challenges that limit the ability of public health authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact tracing through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm. Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems. but more privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk can provide early risk awareness. personalized recommendations and relevant information to the user. Finally. non-identifying risk data can inform epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor. These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor. evaluate and optimize health policy and (de) confinement scenarios according to medical and economic productivity indicators.

Large-scale digital contact tracing (DCT) has emerged as a potential solution to resume economic and social activity while minimizing spread of the virus. Various DCT methods have been proposed. each making trade-offs between privacy. mobility restrictions. and public health. The most common approach. binary contact tracing (BCT). models infection as a binary event. informed only by an individual's test results. with corresponding binary recommendations that either all or none of the individual's contacts quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent uncertainty in contacts and the infection process. which could be used to tailor messaging to high-risk individuals. and prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings.

Prior work on optimizing models for interpretability has relied on easy-to-quantify proxies for interpretability. such as sparsity or the number of operations required. In this work. we optimize for interpretability by directly including humans in the optimization loop. We develop an algorithm that minimizes the number of user studies to find models that are both predictive and interpretable and demonstrate our approach on several data sets. Our human subjects results show trends towards different proxy notions of interpretability on different datasets. which suggests that different proxies are preferred on different tasks.,True,Lf-StbQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,57,https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11571,6925363852455924380,/scholar?cites=6925363852455924380,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.11571,0,0,0

It is challenging to manage because individual patients respond differently to treatment. Thus. tailoring treatment to the individual patient is essential for the best outcomes. In this paper. we take steps toward this goal by applying a mixture-of-experts framework to personalize sepsis treatment. The mixture model selectively alternates between neighbor-based (kernel) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) experts depending on patient’s current history. On a large retrospective cohort. this mixture-based approach outperforms physician. kernel only. and DRL-only experts.,True,Lf-StbQAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,27,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371300/,3048790530901914801,/scholar?cites=3048790530901914801,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371300/,0,0,0

A design continuum unifies major distinct data structure designs under the same model. The critical insight and potential long-term impact is that such unifying models 1) render what we consider up to now as fundamentally different data structures to be seen as “views” of the very same overall design space. and 2) allow “seeing” new data structure designs with performance properties that are not feasible by existing designs. The core intuition behind the construction of design continuums is that all data structures arise from the very same set of fundamental design principles. ie. a small set of data layout design concepts out of which we can synthesize any design that exists in the literature as well as new ones. We show how to construct. evaluate. and expand. design continuums and we also present the first continuum that unifies major data structure designs. ie. B+tree. Bϵtree. LSM-tree. and LSH-table. The practical benefit of a design continuum is that it creates a fast inference engine for the design of data structures. For example. we can near instantly predict how a specific design change in the underlying storage of a data system would affect performance. or reversely what would be the optimal data structure (from a given set of designs) given workload characteristics and a memory budget.

We consider a more general situation with nonuniform strain (eg. oscillatory channel flow). which is observed to exhibit markedly different dynamics. The onset of irreversibility is delayed. and occurs simultaneously across the entire channel. This behavior is only partially explained by self-organization and shear-induced migration. The onset is accompanied by long-range correlated particle motion even at the channel center. where the strain is negligible; this motion prevents the system from evolving into a reversible state.,True,Lf-StbQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,21,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.81.061401,16828462529331653037,/scholar?cites=16828462529331653037,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.1121,0,0,0

This makes it challenging to trust their predictions in safety critical domains. Recent work has focused on explaining their predictions using local linear approximations [1. 10]. but these explanations can be complex when they depend on many features and it is unclear if they can be used to understand global trends in model behavior. In this work. we train neural networks to have sparse local explanations by applying L1 penalties to their input gradients. We show explanations of these networks depend on fewer inputs while their performance remains comparable across datasets and architectures. We illustrate how our approach encourages a different kind of sparsity than L1 weight decay. In a case study with ICU data. we observe that gradients vary smoothly over the input space. which suggests they can be used to gain insight into the global behavior of the model.,True,Lf-StbQAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,7,https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/files/finale/files/2017the_neural_lasso_local_linear_sparsity_for_interpretable_explanations.pdf,15073022973103931668,/scholar?cites=15073022973103931668,,https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/files/finale/files/2017the_neural_lasso_local_linear_sparsity_for_interpretable_explanations.pdf,0,0,0

However. their opacity makes them difficult to trust in critical applications. especially when conditions in training may differ from those in practice. Recent efforts to develop explanations for neural networks and machine learning models more generally have produced tools to shed light on the implicit rules behind predictions. These tools can help us identify when models are right for the wrong reasons. However. they do not always scale to explaining predictions for entire datasets. are not always at the right level of abstraction. and most importantly cannot correct the problems they reveal. In this thesis. we explore the possibility of training machine learning models (with a particular focus on neural networks) using explanations themselves. We consider approaches where models are penalized not only for making incorrect predictions but also for providing explanations that are either inconsistent with domain knowledge or overly complex. These methods let us train models which can not only provide more interpretable rationales for their predictions but also generalize better when training data is confounded or meaningfully different from test data (even adversarially so).,True,Lf-StbQAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00869,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00869,0,0,0

An RNN is first pre-trained on data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). and the probability distribution over the next token in the sequence learned by this model is treated as a prior policy. Another RNN is then trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the MLE RNN. To formalize this objective. we derive novel off-policy RL methods for RNNs from KL-control.

1230572,Social influence as intrinsic motivation for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning,2019,Natasha Jaques and Angeliki Lazaridou and Edward Hughes and Caglar Gulcehre and Pedro A Ortega and DJ Strouse and Joel Z Leibo and Nando De Freitas,,,,,,We propose a unified mechanism for achieving coordination and communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). through rewarding agents for having causal influence over other agents’ actions. Causal influence is assessed using counterfactual reasoning. At each timestep. an agent simulates alternate actions that it could have taken. and computes their effect on the behavior of other agents. Actions that lead to bigger changes in other agents’ behavior are considered influential and are rewarded. We show that this is equivalent to rewarding agents for having high mutual information between their actions. Empirical results demonstrate that influence leads to enhanced coordination and communication in challenging social dilemma environments. dramatically increasing the learning curves of the deep RL agents. and leading to more meaningful learned communication protocols.

1230574,Multimodal autoencoder: A deep learning approach to filling in missing sensor data and enabling better mood prediction,2017,Natasha Jaques and Sara Taylor and Akane Sano and Rosalind Picard,,,,202-208,IEEE,To accomplish forecasting of mood in real-world situations. affective computing systems need to collect and learn from multimodal data collected over weeks or months of daily use. Such systems are likely to encounter frequent data loss. e.g. when a phone loses location access. or when a sensor is recharging. Lost data can handicap classifiers trained with all modalities present in the data. This paper describes a new technique for handling missing multimodal data using a specialized denoising autoencoder: the Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE). Empirical results from over 200 participants and 5500 days of data demonstrate that the MMAE is able to predict the feature values from multiple missing modalities more accurately than reconstruction methods such as principal components analysis (PCA). We discuss several practical benefits of the MMAE's encoding and show that it can provide robust mood prediction …,True,8iCb2TwAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,66,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8273601/,5531619909556101643,/scholar?cites=5531619909556101643,,https://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/17.Jaques_autoencoder_ACII.pdf,0,0,0

We start by hosting models online. and gather human feedback from real-time. open-ended conversations. which we then use to train and improve the models using offline reinforcement learning (RL). We identify implicit conversational cues including language similarity. elicitation of laughter. sentiment. and more. which indicate positive human feedback. and embed these in multiple reward functions. A well-known challenge is that learning an RL policy in an offline setting usually fails due to the lack of ability to explore and the tendency to make over-optimistic estimates of future reward. These problems become even harder when using RL for language models. which can easily have a 20.000 action vocabulary and many possible reward functions. We solve the challenge by developing a novel class of offline RL algorithms. These algorithms use KL-control to penalize divergence from a pre-trained prior language model. and use a new strategy to make the algorithm pessimistic. instead of optimistic. in the face of uncertainty. We test the resulting dialog model with ratings from 80 users in an open-domain setting and find it achieves significant improvements over existing deep offline RL approaches. The novel offline RL method is viable for improving any existing generative dialog model using a static dataset of human feedback.,True,8iCb2TwAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,64,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05848,14028275340772877956,/scholar?cites=14028275340772877956,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05848,0,0,0

Current evaluation methods. mostly post-hoc judgments of static conversation. do not capture conversation quality in a realistic interactive context. In this paper. we investigate interactive human evaluation and provide evidence for its necessity; we then introduce a novel. model-agnostic. and dataset-agnostic method to approximate it. In particular. we propose a self-play scenario where the dialog system talks to itself and we calculate a combination of proxies such as sentiment and semantic coherence on the conversation trajectory. We show that this metric is capable of capturing the human-rated quality of a dialog model better than any automated metric known to-date. achieving a significant Pearson correlation (r>. 7. p<. 05).

This paper argues that such research has overlooked an important and useful intrinsic motivator: social interaction. We posit that making an AI agent aware of implicit social feedback from humans can allow for faster learning of more generalizable and useful representations. and could potentially impact AI safety. We collect social feedback in the form of facial expression reactions to samples from Sketch RNN. an LSTM-based variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to produce sketch drawings. We use a Latent Constraints GAN (LC-GAN) to learn from the facial feedback of a small group of viewers. and then show in an independent evaluation with 76 users that this model produced sketches that lead to significantly more positive facial expressions.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework that could potentially address these issues. for example by allowing a dialog model to optimize for reducing toxicity and repetitiveness. However. previous approaches which apply RL to open-domain dialog generation do so at the word level. making it difficult for the model to learn proper credit assignment for long-term conversational rewards. In this paper. we propose a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). VHRL. which uses policy gradients to tune the utterance-level embedding of a variational sequence model. This hierarchical approach provides greater flexibility for learning long-term. conversational rewards. We use self-play and RL to optimize for a set of human-centered conversation metrics. and show that our approach provides significant improvements–in terms of both human evaluation and automatic metrics–over state-of-the-art dialog models. including Transformers.,True,8iCb2TwAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,14,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6400,10990574453056609647,/scholar?cites=10990574453056609647,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/6400/6256,0,0,0

Forestry. and Other Land Use (AFOLU) plays a central role for food security and sustainable development. Plants take up carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and nitrogen (N) from the soil when they grow. re-distributing it among different pools. including above and below-ground living biomass. dead residues. and soil organic matter. The CO2 and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG). largely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). are in turn released to the atmosphere by plant respiration. by decomposition of dead plant biomass and soil organic matter. and by combustion. Anthropogenic land-use activities (e.g.. management of croplands. forests. grasslands. wetlands). and changes in land use / cover (e.g.. conversion of forest lands and grasslands to cropland and pasture. afforestation) cause changes superimposed on these natural fluxes.

1230617,Carbon lock-out: advancing renewable energy policy in Europe,2012,Paul Lehmann and Felix Creutzig and Melf-Hinrich Ehlers and Nele Friedrichsen and Clemens Heuson and Lion Hirth and Robert Pietzcker,5,,2,323-354,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,As part of its climate strategy. the EU aims at increasing the share of electricity from renewable energy sources (RES-E) in overall electricity generation. Attaining this target poses a considerable challenge as the electricity sector is “locked” into a carbon-intensive system. which hampers the adoption of RES-E technologies. Electricity generation. transmission and distribution grids as well as storage and demand response are subject to important path dependences. which put existing. non-renewable energy sources at an advantage. This paper examines how an EU framework for RES-E support policies should be designed to facilitate a carbon lock-out. For this purpose. we specify the major technological. economic and institutional barriers to RES-E. For each of the barriers. a policy review is carried out which assesses the performance of existing policy instruments and identifies needs for reform. The review reveals several shortcomings: while policies targeting generation are widely in place. measures to address barriers associated with electricity grids. storage and demand are still in their infancy and have to be extended. Moreover. the implementation of policies has been fragmented across EU Member States. In this respect. national policies should be embedded into an integrated EU-wide planning of the RES-E system with overarching energy scenarios and partially harmonized policy rules.

Alternative fuels and technologies have been promoted as a means for reducing the carbon intensity of the transport sector. However. the overall transport policy framework in major world economies is geared towards the use of conventional fossil fuels. This paper evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of current climate policies for road transport that (1) target fuel producers and/or car manufacturers. and (2) influence use of alternative fuels and technologies. With diversifying fuel supply chains. carbon intensity of fuels and energy efficiency of vehicles cannot be regulated by a single instrument.

Mental models,1994,Ann Bostrom and M Granger Morgan and Baruch Fischhoff and Daniel Read,14,Risk Analysis,6,959-970,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,A set of exploratory studies and mental model interviews was conducted in order to characterize public understanding of climate change. In general. respondents regarded global warming as both bad and highly likely. Many believed that warming has already occurred. They tended to confuse stratospheric omne depletion with the greenhouse effect and weather with climate. Automobile use. heat and emissions from industrial processes. aerosol spray cans. and pollution in general were frequently perceived as primary causes of global warming. Additionally. the “greenhouse effect” was often interpreted literally as the cause of a hot and steamy climate. The effects attributed to climate change often included increased skin cancer and changed agricultural yields. The mitigation and control strategies proposed by interviewees typically focused on general pollution control. with few specific links to carbon dioxide and energy use. Respondents appeared to be relatively unfamiliar with such regulatory developments as the ban on CFCS for nonessential uses.

The root problem is greenhouse gas emissions. and the fundamental solution is curbing those emissions. Climate geoengineering has often been considered to be a"" last-ditch"" response to climate change. to be used only if climate change damage should produce extreme hardship. Although the likelihood of eventually needing to resort to these efforts grows with every year of inaction on emissions control. there is a lack of information on these ways of potentially intervening in the climate system. As one of a two-book report. this volume of Climate Intervention discusses albedo modification-changing the fraction of incoming solar radiation that reaches the surface. This approach would deliberately modify the energy budget of Earth to produce a cooling designed to compensate for some of the effects of warming associated with greenhouse gas increases. The prospect of large-scale albedo modification raises political and governance issues at national and global levels. as well as ethical concerns. Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth discusses some of the social. political. and legal issues surrounding these proposed techniques. It is far easier to modify Earth's albedo than to determine whether it should be done or what the consequences might be of such an action.

This paper summarizes insights gained from five years of integrated assessment activity at Carnegie Mellon. After an introduction. in Section 2 we ask: who are the climate decision makers? We conclude that they are a diffuse and often divergent group spread all over the world whose decisions are primarily driven by local non-climate considerations. Insights are illustrated with results from the ICAM-2 model. In Section 3 we ask: what is the climate problem? In addition to the conventional answer. we note that in a democracy the problem is whatever voters and their elected representatives think it is.

1230648,Sequential minimal optimization: A fast algorithm for training support vector machines,1998,John Platt,,,,,,This paper proposes a new algorithm for training support vector machines: Sequential Minimal Optimization. or SMO. Training a support vector machine requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically. which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size. which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided. SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems. while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO’s computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation. hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. On realworld sparse data sets.

However. there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is getting a training set as large as possible: we expand the training set by adding a new form of distorted data. The next most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple “do-it-yourself” implementation of convolution with a flexible architecture is suitable for many visual document problems. This simple convolutional neural network does not require complex methods. such as momentum. weight decay. structuredependent learning rates. averaging layers. tangent prop. or even finely-tuning the architecture.

We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions. including many different parts of speech such as nouns. verbs. and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400.000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model.

RCs allow the fast computation of collisions of flexible models with polygonal models. In addition. RCs allow flexible models to be pushed and pulled under the control of an animator.

The truthful mechanisms of such an auction are characterized. in the sense that. under standard assumptions. we prove that it is impossible to design a non-trivial truthful auction which allocates all units. while we provide the design of an asymptotically revenue-maximizing truthful mechanism which may allocate only some of the units. Our asymptotic parameter is a budget dominance parameter which measures the size of the budget of a single agent relative to the maximum revenue.

We show that existing auction mechanisms combined with this heuristic can experience cycling (as has been observed in many current systems). and therefore propose a modified class of mechanisms with small random perturbations. This perturbation is reminiscent of the small time-dependent perturbations employed in the dynamical systems literature to convert many types of chaos into attracting motions. We show that the perturbed mechanism provably converges in the case of first-price auctions and experimentally converges in the case of second-price auctions.

Inc.,We consider the random 2‐satisfiability (2‐SAT) problem. in which each instance is a formula that is the conjunction of m clauses of the form x∨y. chosen uniformly at random from among all 2‐clauses on n Boolean variables and their negations. As m and n tend to infinity in the ratio m/n→α. the problem is known to have a phase transition at αc=1. below which the probability that the formula is satisfiable tends to one and above which it tends to zero. We determine the finite‐size scaling about this transition. namely the scaling of the maximal window W(n. δ)=(α−(n.δ). α+(n.δ)) such that the probability of satisfiability is greater than 1−δ for α<α− and is less than δ for α>α+. We show that W(n.δ)=(1−Θ(n−1/3). 1+Θ(n−1/3)). where the constants implicit in Θ depend on δ.

The transition is manifested by a change in the asymptotic behavior of the probability of the formation of a surface. spanning a prescribed loop. As such. this transition offers a generalization of the bond percolation phenomenon. At low plaquette densities. the probability for large loops is shown to decay exponentially with the loops' area. whereas for high densities the decay is by a perimeter law. Furthermore. we show that the two phases of the three dimensional plaquette system are in a precise correspondence with the two phases of the dual system of random bonds. Thus. if a natural conjecture about the phase structure of the bond percolation model is true. then there is a sharp transition in the asymptotic behavior of the surface events.

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D. a unique solution exists. with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere.

1230701,Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate,2014,Dzmitry Bahdanau and Kyunghyun Cho and Yoshua Bengio,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473,,,,Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation. the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper. we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture. and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-) search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word. without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach. we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore. qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-) alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.,True,kukA0LcAAAAJ:__bU50VfleQC,17195,https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473,9430221802571417838,/scholar?cites=9430221802571417838,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf?utm_source=ColumnsChannel,0,0,0

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation. and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively. we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.,True,kukA0LcAAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC,13293,https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078,9119975171114587835,/scholar?cites=9119975171114587835,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------,0,0,0

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks. to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value. which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly. we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves. albeit slowly. and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally. we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training. with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations. we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.,True,kukA0LcAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC,12051,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a,17889055433985220047,/scholar?cites=17889055433985220047,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf,0,0,0
1230704,Learning deep architectures for AI,2009,Yoshua Bengio,,,,,Now Publishers Inc,Can machine learning deliver AI? Theoretical results. inspiration from the brain and cognition. as well as machine learning experiments suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (eg in vision. language. and other AI-level tasks). one would need deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations. such as in neural nets with many hidden layers. graphical models with many levels of latent variables. or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Each level of the architecture represents features at a different level of abstraction. defined as a composition of lower-level features. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task. but new algorithms have been discovered and a new sub-area has emerged in the machine learning community since 2006. following these discoveries. Learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks and other related unsupervised learning algorithms have recently been proposed to train deep architectures. yielding exciting results and beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas.

1230706,A Neural probabilistic language model,2003,Yoshua Bengio and Rejean Ducharme and Pascal Vincent,3,Journal of Machine Learning Research,,1137-1155,,A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences. expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function. showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models. and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.,True,kukA0LcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,7259,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/tmp/bengio03a.pdf,11929840984668291800,/scholar?cites=11929840984668291800,,https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/tmp/bengio03a.pdf,0,0,0

Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data. deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets.

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error. thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN). and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that. contrary to ordinary autoencoders. denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images.

1230712,How transferable are features in deep neural networks?,2014,Jason Yosinski and Jeff Clune and Yoshua Bengio and Hod Lipson,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.1792,,,,Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task. but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network. but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues:(1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task. which was expected. and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons. which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet. we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate. depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom. middle. or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases. but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.,True,kukA0LcAAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC,5529,https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792,8833146761103838326,/scholar?cites=8833146761103838326,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1792,0,0,0
1230713,Random search for hyper-parameter optimization.,2012,James Bergstra and Yoshua Bengio,13,Journal of machine learning research,2,,,Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search. we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget. random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger. less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search. purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets. and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter. but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much.

Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However. until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks. since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN). a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem. we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to betterunderstand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task.

In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical. a geometric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution.

1230718,On the properties of neural machine translation: Encoder-decoder approaches,2014,Kyunghyun Cho and Bart Van Merriënboer and Dzmitry Bahdanau and Yoshua Bengio,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1259,,,,Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence. and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper. we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words. but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase.

The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks often involve an unsupervised learning component. usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. The main question investigated here is the following: why does unsupervised pre-training work so well? Through extensive experimentation. we explore several possible explanations discussed in the literature including its action as a regularizer (Erhan et al. 2009) and as an aid to optimization (Bengio et al. 2007). Our results build on the work of Erhan et al. 2009. showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised training.

Traditionally. hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently. computer clusters and GPU processors make it pos- sible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neu- ral networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the ex- pected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets. but we show it is unreli- able for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported.

For instance. data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways. and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one that is meaningful to a user. the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics. it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar.” For instance. we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper. we present an algorithm that. given examples of similar (and. if desired. dissimilar) pairs of points in ŹŅ. learns a distance metric over ŹŅ that respects these relationships.

We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1.000 machines (16.000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition. our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation.

IRL may be useful for apprenticeship learning to acquire skilled behavior. and for ascertaining the reward function being optimized by a natural system. We first characterize the set of all reward functions for which a given policy is optimal. We then derive three algorithms for IRL. The first two deal with the case where the entire policy is known; we handle tabulated reward functions on a finite state space and linear functional approximation of the reward function over a potentially infinite state space. The third algorithm deals with the more realistic case in which the policy is known only through a finite set of observed trajectories.

We explore the use of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk system. a significantly cheaper and faster method for collecting annotations from a broad base of paid non-expert contributors over the Web. We investigate five tasks: affect recognition. word similarity. recognizing textual entailment. event temporal ordering. and word sense disambiguation. For all five. we show high agreement between Mechanical Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert labelers. For the task of affect recognition. we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effective as using gold standard annotations from experts.

Ni is often used as catalyst for the reaction. Long term stability of steam reforming catalysts is governed by their ability to selectively oxidize C atoms while preventing C−C bond formation. In this communication we demonstrate that C atom chemistry over Ni surfaces can be controlled by surface alloying. We show that bimetallic Sn/Ni catalyst is much more carbon-tolerant that monometallic Ni. The main reason for this is that Sn alloying results in dramatically lower rates of C−C bond formation as compared to C-oxidation.

Recent theoretical contributions have led to the development of d-band theory. which relates the calculated electronic structure of a metal to its chemical and catalytic activity. While there are many contributions where quantum-chemical calculations have been utilized to validate the d-band theory. experimental examples relating the electronic structures of commercially relevant nonmodel catalysts to their performance are lacking. We show that even small changes in the near-Fermi-level electronic structures of nonmodel supported catalysts. induced by the formation of surface alloys. can be measured and related to the chemical and catalytic performance of these materials.

The Sn/Ni electrocatalysts were tested in the direct electrochemical oxidation of methane and isooctane. It was observed that the electrochemical activity and electronic conductivity of Ni were not compromised significantly by introduction of Sn. We postulate that the improved carbon tolerance of Sn/Ni compared to monometallic Ni electrocatalysts is due to the formation of Sn/Ni surface alloys. which. unlike monometallic Ni. preferentially oxidize carbon atoms and fragments. removing these from the surface of the electrocatalyst rather than forming carbon–carbon bonds.,True,ILXkkQ8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,87,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.3208060/meta,4873239393300241049,/scholar?cites=4873239393300241049,,"https://www.swissconsortium.ch/sc/openurl?sid=google&auinit=E&aulast=Nikolla&atitle=Direct+electrochemical+oxidation+of+hydrocarbon+fuels+on+SOFCs:+improved+carbon+tolerance+of+Ni+alloy+anodes&id=doi:10.1149/1.3208060&title=Journal+of+the+Electrochemical+Society+(JES)+(formerly:+Transactions+of+the+Electrochemical+Society,+Transactions+of+the+American+Electrochemical+Society)&volume=156&issue=11&date=2009&spage=B1312&issn=1945-7111",0,0,0

Based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. we have identified critical electronic structure descriptors that govern local chemical reactivity of different sites in metal alloys. These descriptors were used to develop a model that allows us to predict variations in the adsorption energy of various adsorbates on alloy surfaces based on easily accessible physical characteristics of the constituent elements in alloys. mainly their electronegativity. atomic radius. and the spatial extent of valence orbitals.

Cycloalkanes are high-octane-rating molecules and are a major component of jet fuels. We observed that palladium supported on HZSM-5 catalyzed hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions that converted phenolic compounds into aromatic hydrocarbons and cycloalkanes. This in situ study analyzed the effect of the catalyst-to-lignin ratio. H2 partial pressure. and temperature on the yields of hydrocarbons with HZSM-5 and 1 wt % Pd/HZSM-5.

In this contribution we present experimental analysis supported with quantum chemical DFT calculations which allowed us to propose a simple. physically transparent model to predict the impact of alloying on the local electronic structure of different sites in alloys and on the local chemical reactivity. The model was developed through studies of a number of Pt alloys. The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy. and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site. which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters. is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site.,True,ILXkkQ8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,57,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11244-010-9448-1.pdf,16457820408785884117,/scholar?cites=16457820408785884117,,https://www.swissconsortium.ch/sc/openurl?sid=google&auinit=N&aulast=Schweitzer&atitle=Establishing+relationships+between+the+geometric+structure+and+chemical+reactivity+of+alloy+catalysts+based+on+their+measured+electronic+structure&id=doi:10.1007/s11244-010-9448-1&title=Topics+in+Catalysis&volume=53&issue=5-6&date=2010&spage=348&issn=1572-9028,0,0,0

B-site-terminated R-P oxides are predicted to exhibit the highest activity …,True,ILXkkQ8AAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,22,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acscatal.7b01483,6431736539507330238,/scholar?cites=6431736539507330238,,https://www.swissconsortium.ch/sc/openurl?sid=google&auinit=XK&aulast=Gu&atitle=Design+of+Ruddlesden%E2%80%93popper+oxides+with+optimal+surface+oxygen+exchange+properties+for+oxygen+reduction+and+evolution&id=doi:10.1021/acscatal.7b01483&title=ACS+Catalysis&volume=7&issue=9&date=2017&spage=5912&issn=2155-5435,0,0,0
