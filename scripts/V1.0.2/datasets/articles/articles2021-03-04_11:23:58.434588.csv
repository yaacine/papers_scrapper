1127245,Least‐cost control of agricultural nutrient contributions to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone,2010,Sergey Rabotyagov and Todd Campbell and Manoj Jha and Philip W Gassman and Jeffrey Arnold and Lyubov Kurkalova and Silvia Secchi and Hongli Feng and Catherine L Kling,20,Ecological Applications,6,1542-1555,Ecological Society of America,In 2008. the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. measuring 20 720 km2. was one of the two largest reported since measurement of the zone began in 1985. The extent of the hypoxic zone is related to nitrogen and phosphorous loadings originating on agricultural fields in the upper Midwest. This study combines the tools of evolutionary computation with a water quality model and cost data to develop a trade‐off frontier for the Upper Mississippi River Basin specifying the least cost of achieving nutrient reductions and the location of the agricultural conservation practices needed. The frontier allows policymakers and stakeholders to explicitly see the trade‐offs between cost and nutrient reductions. For example. the cost of reducing annual nitrate‐N loadings by 30% is estimated to be US$1.4 billion/year. with a concomitant 36% reduction in P and the cost of reducing annual P loadings by 30% is estimated to be US …,True,bu4IZ6oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,133,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/08-0680.1,2593783036470642229,/scholar?cites=2593783036470642229,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/44746/PDF,0,0,0

We begin by describing the extent and causes of hypoxic zones worldwide. followed by a review of the evidence concerning ecological effects of hypoxic zones and their impacts on ecosystem services. We describe what is known about abatement options and cost-effective policy design. and then focus on the large seasonally recurring hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. We offer a simple econometric model to estimate the relationship between pollutants (nutrients) and the size of the hypoxic zone. This “production function” relationship suggests that both instantaneous and historical nutrient contributions affect the size of the zone.

However. visitation data is often costly and burdensome to obtain. and provides a limited depth of information. In this paper. we assess the validity of using crowd-sourced. online photographs to infer information about the habits and preferences of recreational visitors by comparing empirical data from the National Park Service to photograph data from the online platform Flickr for 38 National Parks in the western United States. Using multiple regression analysis. we find that the number of photos posted monthly in a park can reliably indicate the number of visitors to a park in a given month.

Reductions in nutrients from agricultural cropland in its watershed are needed to reduce the hypoxic zone size to the national policy goal of 5.000 km2 (as a 5-y running average) set by the national Gulf of Mexico Task Force’s Action Plan. We develop an integrated assessment model linking the water quality effects of cropland conservation investment decisions on the more than 550 agricultural subwatersheds that deliver nutrients into the Gulf with a hypoxic zone model. We use this integrated assessment model to identify the most cost-effective subwatersheds to target for cropland conservation investments.

Evolutionary algorithms are developed for each of the appropriate water quality targets. Our approach allows for the derivation of a watershed‐level total and marginal nitrogen abatement cost curve. Controlling for the probability of meeting water quality targets (looking for weather‐resilient solutions) is found to be significantly more costly than controlling the average nitrogen loadings.

Lin,,Journal of Forest Economics,,,,In Washington State. small forest landowners (SFLO) play an important role in maintaining forest cover on the landscape as well as associated ecosystem services. This paper examines landowner preferences for the attributes of working forest conservation contracts (WFCC) using a choice experiment. The attributes examined are contract duration (from 10 years to perpetuity). forest management requirements. and the extent of forestland covered under the contract. We find that contract attributes are valued very differently depending on landowner objectives and harvesting behavior. Landowner characteristics and forestland spatial characteristics including distances to development and large public forestlands were found to significantly influence the likelihood of contract acceptance.

Practices. and Targets,2010,Sergey Rabotyagov and Manoj Jha and Todd Campbell,1,Journal of Natural and Environmental Sciences,2,75-90,Academy Publications Inc.,Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from agriculture remains a major source of water degradation in the US despite the devotion of substantial resources to its control over the past two decades. By definition. NPS pollution comes from many sources whose contributions to water pollution are hard to measure. Numerous economic studies have investigated the efficiency of different policy instruments in this context; Shortle and Horan (2001) provided an excellent survey of the literature.However. some attributes of NPS pollution that can be critical in the design of policies have received little attention. The first is that there are multiple NPS pollutants which may interact with each other. including nitrogen. phosphorous. sediment. pathogens. and pesticides. Conservation practices that are effective at controlling one pollutant are not necessarily equally good at controlling other pollutants. A second understudied feature of NPS pollution control is the multiple spatial scales at which water quality standards may be set. For example. there may be distinct phosphorus standards at upstream and downstream subwatersheds based on the conditions of each subwatershed. Control measures taken to meet the upstream standard may be adequate to meet or exceed the downstream standards. or actions to meet those standards might actually exacerbate the downstream problems.

We sent mail surveys to 7.400 small forest landowners. Landowners were asked to rate the development pressure on their property. to state whether they expect a significant portion of their property will be developed in the future. and. if so. to estimate the time to development. Using a spatially explicit sample of responses. we model landowner perception of development risk and the expected time to development. We found that pecuniary forest ownership characteristics such as the soil expectation value and active harvesting practices are positively related to the likelihood of anticipating forestland development. Conversely. nonpecuniary values. such as aesthetic enjoyment. correspond to a lower likelihood of anticipated development.

I present four essays that deal with several diverse issues in environmental economics. ranging from soil carbon sequestration. to a design of a pollution permit trading program. to proposing watershed-scale solutions to water quality problems. both on state and regional scale.; The first essay is titled"" Environmental policy under benefit and cost uncertainty: application to soil carbon offsets"". I characterize an optimal spatial allocation of land parcels to specific environmental practices explicitly dealing with uncertainty in both the benefits and program costs. The results provide a magnitude of uncertainty discount for soil carbon offsets and the margin of safety necessary in the budget to ensure at the planning stage that the program's costs will not exceed the planned expenditures.; The second essay is titled"" Optimal design of permit markets with an ex ante pollution target"". In this essay. the design of permit trading programs when the objective is to minimize the cost of achieving an ex ante pollution target; that is. one that is defined in expectation rather than an ex post deterministic value. is examined. I demonstrate that to minimize expected abatement costs regulators must use information on the joint distribution of firms' abatement costs. as well as the pollution delivery coefficients. As a result. the optimal trading ratio is a function of the delivery coefficient. as well as the moments of abatement costs. and the total permit allocation deviates from the pollution goal. These findings differ from a typical permit market design. where no cost information is needed to achieve cost-efficiency. the trading ratio is set to the ratio of pollution delivery …",True,bu4IZ6oAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,6,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/rtd/15611/,15132665130711525618,/scholar?cites=15132665130711525618,,https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=16610&context=rtd,0,0,0

Traditional per-pixel classification methods have been used to map urban canopies. however. such techniques are not generally appropriate for assessing these highly variable landscapes. Landsat imagery has historically been used for per-pixel driven land use/land cover (LULC) classifications. but the spatial resolution limits our ability to map small urban features. In such cases. hyperspatial resolution imagery such as aerial or satellite imagery with a resolution of 1 meter or below is preferred. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) allows for use of additional variables such as texture. shape. context. and other cognitive information provided by the image analyst to segment and classify image features. and thus. improve classifications. As part of this research we created LULC classifications for a pilot study area in Seattle. WA. USA. using OBIA techniques and freely available public aerial photography. We analyzed the differences in accuracies which can be achieved with OBIA using multispectral and true-color imagery. We also compared our results to a satellite based OBIA LULC and discussed the implications of per-pixel driven vs. OBIA-driven field sampling campaigns. We demonstrated that the OBIA approach can generate good and repeatable LULC classifications suitable for tree cover assessment in urban areas. Another important finding is that spectral content appeared to be more important than spatial detail of hyperspatial data when it comes to an OBIA-driven …,True,c38T0OMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,99,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/3/10/2243,4372503770161968418,/scholar?cites=4372503770161968418,,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/3/10/2243/pdf,0,0,0

Montane wetland ecosystems are expected to be among the most sensitive to changing climate. as their persistence depends on factors directly influenced by climate (e.g. precipitation. snowpack. evaporation). Despite their importance and climate sensitivity. wetlands tend to be understudied due to a lack of tools and data relative to what is available for other ecosystem types. Here. we develop and demonstrate a new method for projecting climate-induced hydrologic changes in montane wetlands. Using observed wetland water levels and soil moisture simulated by the physically based Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. we developed site-specific regression models relating soil moisture to observed wetland water levels to simulate the hydrologic behavior of four types of montane wetlands (ephemeral. intermediate. perennial. permanent wetlands) in the U. S. Pacific Northwest. The hybrid models captured observed wetland dynamics in many cases. though were less robust in others. We then used these models to a) hindcast historical wetland behavior in response to observed climate variability (1916–2010 or later) and classify wetland types. and b) project the impacts of climate change on montane wetlands using global climate model scenarios for the 2040s and 2080s (A1B emissions scenario).

For some objects. which are spectrally similar to other landscape features. their temporal pattern may be their sole defining characteristic. When multiple images are used in object-based image analysis. it is often constrained to a specific number of images which are selected because they cover the perceived range of temporal variability of the features of interest. Here. we provide a method to identify wetlands using a time series of Landsat imagery by building a Random Forest model using each image observation as an explanatory variable. We tested our approach in Douglas County. Washington. USA. Our approach exploiting the temporal domain classified wetlands with a high level of accuracy and reduced the number of spectrally similar false positives. We explored how sampling design (ie. random. stratified. purposive) and temporal resolution (ie. number of image observations) affected classification accuracy. We found that sampling design introduced bias in different ways. but did not have a substantial impact on overall accuracy. We also found that a higher number of image observations up to a point improved classification accuracy dependent on the selection of images used in the model.

Social trails are not part of the official National Park trail network and are an indication of human disturbance. Inventorying social trails combined with spatial analysis is one way to detect and monitor the level of impact to natural areas within the park (Leung. 2008). This report closely follows the Visitor Experience and Resource Protection Data Analysis Protocol: Social Trails for Yosemite National Park (Leung. 2008).

The ecosystem services provided by a wetland are largely dependent on its hydrological dynamics. Constant monitoring of the spatial extent of water surfaces and the duration of flooding of a wetland is necessary to understand the impact of drought on the ecosystem services a wetland provides. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the potential to reveal wetland dynamics. Multitemporal SAR image analysis for wetland monitoring has been extensively studied based on the advances of modern SAR missions. Unfortunately. most previous studies utilized monopath SAR images. which result in limited success. Tracking changes in individual wetlands remains a challenging task because several environmental factors. such as wind-roughened water. degrade image quality. In general. the data acquisition frequency is an important factor in time series analysis. We propose a Gaussian process-based temporal interpolation (GPTI) method that enables the synergistic use of SAR images taken from multiple paths. The proposed model is applied to a series of Sentinel-1 images capturing wetlands in Okanogan County. Washington State. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the multiple path analysis based on the proposed method can extract seasonal changes more accurately than a single path analysis.,True,c38T0OMAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/11/1756/htm?luicode=10000011&lfid=231522type%3D1%26t%3D10%26q%3D%23%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E7%81%BE%E5%AE%B3%23&featurecode=newti&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F2072-4292%2F12%2F11%2F1756%2Fhtm,2950371935647109405,/scholar?cites=2950371935647109405,,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/11/1756/htm?luicode=10000011&lfid=231522type%3D1%26t%3D10%26q%3D%23%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E7%81%BE%E5%AE%B3%23&featurecode=newti&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F2072-4292%2F12%2F11%2F1756%2Fhtm,0,0,0

Monika Moskal School of Environmental and Forest Sciences Wetland ecosystems are widely considered to be highly sensitive to climate change. However. scientific capacity to model climate impacts to wetlands has been hampered by the lack of accurate maps showing the spatial distribution of wetlands and data on their historical hydrological dynamics. Though these data may exist for particular wetlands. there are no broad scale datasets of wetland location and long-term hydrological dynamics. Remote sensing has been an important vehicle for mapping change to wetlands. but generally at spatial or temporal scales that do not capture the variability necessary for linking climate to wetland hydrodynamics.  This data limitation and lack of methods have restricted research on how changes in climate will impact wetland hydrology to explorations of limited scope. The goal of this PhD was to characterize and model historic and future climate impacts to dynamics of wetland hydrology (i.e. inundation quantity. frequency. timing and duration) across the Columbia Plateau ecoregion. To achieve this goal. I developed new remote sensing methods to map and reconstruct wetland dynamics for thousands of individual wetlands at finer temporal and spatial resolutions than previously available (Chapter 1 and 2).

Digital version of the fact sheet can be downloaded at: http://dept. washington. edu/rsgal",,,,MethodsOne of the strengths of OBIA is that it allows the analyst to use multiple data input layers.(Figure 3a). However. we ran the segmentation only on the LiDAR data layers (Figure 3b). We chose from hundreds of classification features (ie color. shape. size) to develop our classification ruleset (Figure 3c). We mapped significantly more wetlands than had been previously detected in other wetland inventories (Figure 3d).Summary: The combination of LiDAR and Object based image analysis (OBIA) provides a cost-effective approach to map wetlands across large spatial extents.

1127288,Spatial Analysis of Recreational Impacts in Mount Rainier National Park,,Meghan Halabisky,,,,,,The National Park Service (NPS) has a dual mandate to both protect the natural resources within park boundaries as well as promote the recreational use of these natural resources. In order to monitor the balance of this dual mandate the NPS requires each National Park to report on the level of human impacts within the park. A previous study identified four landscape metrics based on social trail inventories that can be used to quantitatively describe the level of human impacts. For this research study I wanted to determine if management units could be categorized into levels of disturbance (ex. high. medium. low) for management purposes. In addition. I wanted to condense the four landscape metrics into one “disturbance” metric to allow for easier comparison between management units and for ranking levels of disturbance throughout the park. It is difficult to rank management units from high to low levels of impact when using multiple landscape metrics as the ranking is different depending on which landscape metric is chosen. In addition. I wanted to determine which explanatory variables; percent meadow. distance from visitor center. elevation. percent bare ground. and density of park trails could predict which management units had the greatest level of human impacts.To determine if the different management units can be grouped into understandable levels of disturbance I conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of the cluster analysis showed that the management units could be grouped into four levels of disturbance. I conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to simplify the landscape metrics into a “disturbance metric …,True,c38T0OMAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,http://depts.washington.edu/pnwcesu/reports/J8W07110026_P11AC91026_Final_Report.pdf,,,,http://depts.washington.edu/pnwcesu/reports/J8W07110026_P11AC91026_Final_Report.pdf,0,0,0

However. they can be stabilized by particles through the so-called Pickering effect. Recently. it was shown that its stabilization can be achieved also with nanoplates. Here. we show for the first time that even nanorods in the form of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) can efficiently stabilize W/W emulsions. Static light scattering and confocal microscopy techniques were used to determine the surface coverage by CNCs. In the presence of 50 mM NaCl very weak gels were formed by excess CNCs in the continuous phase. In this way creaming of the dispersed phase could be arrested. The nontoxicity. sustainability. and low cost of CNCs and the abundant availability of cellulose render these nanorods potentially highly suited for preparing W/W emulsions.,True,Fn86iFIAAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC,83,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsmacrolett.5b00953,7270365623599378923,/scholar?cites=7270365623599378923,,,0,0,0

1127307,Self-assembled fibres,2014,Oliver Graydon,8,Nature Photonics,2,84-84,Nature Publishing Group,A new class of liquid-crystal-based optical fibres have been fabricated by scientists in Germany and Slovenia. They grew the fibres by self-assembly in an immiscible waterbased mixture containing a surfactant. The fibres consist of a series of coaxial. rolled-up layers of the liquid crystal 8CB. and are highly birefringent. The size of the fibres varies with the exact growing conditions. but the researchers say that they typically have a diameter ranging from a few micrometres to about 100 μm. and can reach several centimetres in length. The fibres were observed to guide light. and. when doped with a suitable dye such as Nile Red and optically pumped. they can lase as a result of the creation of whispering gallery modes. The threshold for laser operation was estimated to be 75 μW cm− 2 with emission occurring at around 630 nm.

The absence of rate-dependent viscosity allows identification of purely elastic instabilities and comparison with Oldroyd-B model. which is a constitutive model that includes elasticity without allowing for shear thinning. In this study. we investigate the shear and extensional rheology response of Boger fluids to identify the role played by enhancement in solvent viscosity at a fixed polymer concentration.

In this manuscript. we now focus on comb-type polymers consisting of hydrophobic backbones and hydrophilic side chains. The distinct philicity of the backbone and side chains leads to a well-defined segregation into the oil and water domains respectively. as confirmed by contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering experiments. This polymer–microemulsion structure leads to well-described conformational entropies of the polymer fragments (backbone and side chains) that exert pressure on the membrane. which influences the thermodynamics of the overall microemulsion. In the context of the different polymer architectures that have been studied by our group with regards to their phase diagrams and small-angle neutron scattering. the microemulsion thermodynamics of comb polymers can be described in terms of a superposition of the backbone and side chain fragments. The denser or longer the side chain. the stronger the grafting and the more visible the brush effect of the side chains becomes. Possible applications of the comb polymers as switchable additives are discussed. Finally. a balanced philicity of polymers also motivates transmembrane migration in biological systems of the polymers themselves or of polymer–DNA complexes.,True,Fn86iFIAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/12/2410,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/10/12/2410/htm,0,0,0

1127320,Fabrication and Characterization of Metal Organic Framework (MOF) Based Membrane,2012,Rashmi Prava Mohanty,,,,,,Membrane-based separation is an increasingly viable. cost-effective complementary separation technology to traditional unit operation for a number of industrially important applications. MOFs as membrane materials are of particular interest for continuous membrane based separations. and other applications. Despite a great deal of research in MOFs as membranes. there still exist some challenges to fabricate continuous crack-free MOF membranes. In this paper low cost clay based support is fabricated using normal clay as the building material. It is found that the heterogeneous nucleation density of MOF crystal on ceramic supports is very low; as it is difficult to form direct chemical bonds between the surface support and the MOF material. Hence. our clay based support surface is modified by alumina coating on the surface by sol-gel technology. Boehmite sol is used for this purpose. Then Cu-BTC MOF was integrated on the alumina coated support by different techniques: in situ solvothermal and step by step seeded growth method. It has been found that with increasing the sintering temperature of the alumina coated support above 1073 K crystallinity can be increased. Increase of concentration in case of step by step seeded growth also ensures better layer of MOF impregnation over the support. Various characterizations are performed to study the nature of the MOF membrane. A detailed cost estimation of the membrane based on the cost of the raw materials is also done. and found out to be comparative with other reported ceramic membranes and far below than more popular commercially available ceramic membranes.,True,_SHVR_cAAAAJ:VLnqNzywnoUC,13,http://ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/3250/,1224524539363991471,/scholar?cites=1224524539363991471,,http://ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/3250/1/rashmi.pdf,0,0,0

1127328,Application of Liquid Membrane in Removal of Dyes,2016,B Litusha Patro,,,,,,Textile industries are major sources of residual dyes and organic pollutants that are released into natural water resources. Treatment of this waste water and its recycling is essential because of higher grades of impurities for example pigments. auxiliary chemicals and heavy metals.etc.). Dyeing process causes a loss of 10-25% of the textile dyes.out of which 2-20% are removed as aqueous effluents causing harm to environment. Removal of effluents constituting dyes inside water bodies are unwanted due to their color.& because many of them breakdown into products which are poisonous. To re-use the materials obtained from the waste products.Liquid membrane techniques evolved over other separation techniques due to its high selectivity.recovery.increased fluxes.and reduced investment and operating cost. It combines extraction and stripping in a single unit operation. Removal of dyes by liquid membranes using organic solvents was found to be toxic and costlier. So vegetables oils are used instead of organic solvents in liquid membranes for extraction of different types of dyes and different parameters are optimized based on the extraction percentage. This thesis focuses on the extraction of Methylene Blue using bulk liquid membrane from its aqueous phase. The feed phase was aqueous solution of Methylene Blue and the strip phase was sulfuric acid solution. Solvent was Sunflower Oil for the liquid membrane phase and phenol acted as carrier. 95% MB extraction was achieved from feed phase to organic phase whereas only 90% of MB was recovered from organic phase to the receiving phase.

1127329,Separation of Chromium (VI) By Bulk Liquid Membrane Technique,2015,Snehasis Biswas,,,,,,In this work an attempt has been made for faster extraction and separation of Cr (VI) from its model solution with minimal use of carrier. Studying the effects of various process parameters viz. source and stripping phase concentration and pH on the overall performance of this bulk liquid membrane technique have been a key objective along with the membrane reusability. Aqueous solution of potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) was used as the source phase or model contaminant for Cr (VI) ions. 1. 2-dichloroethane was the preferred solvent used as the liquid membrane phase in this work. Aqueous solution of NaOH was found to be the effective stripping phase. Performances of several carriers had been investigated and tri-n-octylamine (TOA) was found to be the most suitable in facilitating the transport mechanism. A comprehensive kinetic study was carried out and the effect of various parameters viz. carrier concentration. feed and stripping phase concentrations and pH were studied. A key objective of this work was to achieve maximum separation of Cr (VI) with minimal carrier concentration and this work successfully reports a removal percentage of ca. 98% of Cr (VI) ions with 0.25 vol. % of TOA within a span of 2 hrs. The transport mechanism was observed to be more effective in the acidic pH range w.r.t the feed phase (ca. pH 1) whereas the optimum stripping phase concentration of NaOH was 0.3 N.

1127331,Stability Study of Important Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and a Review on their Gas Adsorption Properties,2012,Vinay K Agarwal,,,,,,Metal Organic Frameworks (or. MOFs) have shown tremendous potential in adsorptive separation applications and gas storage owing to some of their extraordinary features in terms of specific surface area. pore volume. low to moderate heat of adsorption and fairly uniform pore size distribution. But. the success or failure of any adsorbent material largely depends on their stability in varying experimental conditions. In this work. we have highlighted the synthesis of 3 most versatile MOFs reported till date viz. Cu-BTC (or. HKUST-1). Cr-BDC (or. MIL-101) and Zn-BDC (or. MOF-5). Each of these MOFs after their successful synthesis and characterization were exposed to a regulated environmental conditionto study the effect of moisture sensitivity. Such a study is particularly important since any real time experiment with MOF is bound to come to terms with varying degree of moisture or water vapor. especially when exposed for longer duration. After detailed experimentation we concluded that a controlled exposure to ambient conditions didn’t have a severe effect on MOF’s thermal stability. Cr-BDC was found to be taking up more moisture during the course of time as compared to Cu-BTC and Zn-BDC. The degree of crystallinity appeared to be reduced over the time interval and surface morphology too gets affected.  Moreover. we have carried out a comprehensive review of 3 very important industrially and environmentally important gases viz. H2. CO and CO2 on these three MOF matrices. The reason behind choosing theses gases stems out from the fact that H2 is projected as a future fuel which may very well replace the conventional fossil fuels. both …,True,_SHVR_cAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC,1,http://ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/3167/,16764748941046140126,/scholar?cites=16764748941046140126,,http://ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/3167/1/eThesis_Vinay_Agarwal_108CH008.pdf,0,0,0

Substitutes for conventional bacterial inactivation methods should not produce harmful byproducts and must also be cost effective. Nanotechnology is an attractive option that is suited for surface reactions as nanostructures offer large surface to volume ratios. Technologies using chitosan-modified nanocomposites and carbon nanotubes have proven to offer promising alternatives for bacterial inactivation.

1127396,An introduction to modeling and analyzing complex product development processes using the design structure matrix (DSM) method,2004,Ali Yassine,51,Urbana,9,1-17,,The design and development of complex engineering products require the efforts and collaboration of hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds resulting in complex relationships among both people and tasks. Many of the traditional project management tools (PERT. Gantt and CPM methods) do not address problems stemming from this complexity. While these tools allow the modeling of sequential and parallel processes. they fail to address interdependency (feedback and iteration). which is common in complex product development (PD) projects. To address this issue. a matrix-based tool called the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) has evolved. This method differs from traditional project-management tools because it focuses on representing information flows rather than work flows. The DSM method is an information exchange model that allows the representation of complex task (or team) relationships in order to determine a sensible sequence (or grouping) for the tasks (or teams) being modeled.

When a local task is completed. its output is integrated through an iterative cycle of system-wide integration activities. Integration is often accompanied by inadvertent information hiding due to the asynchronous information exchanges. We show that information hiding leads to persistent recurrence of problems (termed the design churn effect) such that progress oscillates between being on schedule and falling behind. The oscillatory nature of the PD process confounds progress measurement and makes it difficult to judge whether the project is on schedule or slipping. We develop a dynamic model of work transformation to derive conditions under which churn is observed as an unintended consequence of information hiding due to local and system task …,True,vrwZUzYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,223,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00163-003-0036-2,1029674116717357271,/scholar?cites=1029674116717357271,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/703/Information+Hiding+in+Product+Development+4333-02.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The development of modular products requires the identification of highly interactive groups of elements and arranging (i.e.. clustering) them into modules. However. no rigorous clustering technique can be found in engineering design literature. This paper uses the design structure matrix (DSM) to visualize the product architecture and to develop the basic building blocks required for the identification of product modules. The DSM architectural representation and building blocks are then used for the development of a new clustering method based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and a simple genetic algorithm (GA).

In concurrent engineering. the information structure of a design process does not usually imply the execution patterns of the corresponding design tasks. On the contrary. this gap between the information structure and execution patterns is the essence of concurrent engineering and its basic advantage over traditional sequential design. In this paper. we relate the structure of information flow in a design process to three different execution strategies: sequential. partial overlapping. and concurrent. The risks of excessive task iterations or redesigns associated with each execution pattern are probabilistically modeled.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Consider a set of product variants that are differentiated by some secondary attributes such as flavor. color. or size. The retailer's problem is to jointly determine the set of variants to include in her product line (“assortment”). together with their prices and inventory levels. so as to maximize her expected profit. We model the consumer choice process using a multinomial logit choice model and consider a newsvendor type inventory setting. We derive the structure of the optimal assortment for some important special cases. including the case of horizontally differentiated items. and propose a dominance relationship for the general case that simplifies the search for an optimal assortment. We also discuss structural properties of the optimal prices. Finally. motivated by our analytical results. we propose a heuristic solution procedure. which is shown to be quite effective through a numerical study. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals …,True,0w1o0AcAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,126,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nav.20209,4955384925263294520,/scholar?cites=4955384925263294520,,,0,0,0

A new mathematical model is developed. which is an extension to that of Veinott and Wagner (Mngt Sci 1965; 11: 525) who applied renewal theory and stationary probabilistic analysis to determine the equivalent average cost per review period. The performance of the model is validated using a custom-built simulation programme.

Among the main differences is the presence of multiple capacity constraints in cruise ships. i.e.. the number of cabins in different categories and the number of lifeboat seats. versus a single constraint in airlines and hotels (i.e.. number of seats or rooms). We develop a discrete-time dynamic capacity control model for a cruise ship characterized by multiple constraints on cabin and lifeboat capacities. Customers (families) arrive sequentially according to a stochastic process and request one cabin of a certain category and one or more lifeboat seats. The cruise ship revenue manager decides which requests to accept based on the remaining cabin and lifeboat capacities at the time of an arrival as well as the type of the arrival.

The percentage of Type A (the yield rate) is assumed to be a random variable with known probability distribution. The electronics industry gives good examples of such situations.

Upon receiving an order. a screening process is conducted to identify imperfect items. These imperfect items are salvaged as a single batch at the end of the screening process. To prevent shortages during the screening process. an order is placed when the inventory level is just enough to cover the demand during the screening period. Then. the demand during the screening period of an order is met from the inventory of the “previous” order. This represents an improvement in customer service level over earlier literature. where demand is assumed to be met during the screening period from the order being screened leading to potential shortages. We show that this improvement in service level comes at a modest cost.

It was established in a previous study that additives such as clay-based minerals could control agglomeration and defluidization during combustion of a high-sulfur coal. Analysis of the data suggested that the agglomerating compounds were condensing on the fine additives. which were elutriated from the bed. The current work has tested this hypothesis in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed.

The application of biomass in DCFCs will be a major transition from the use of coal to generate energy. However. the relationship between biomass or biochar composition and the electrochemical performance of a DCFC is yet to be studied. The performance of a DCFC using fuel sources derived from woody and non-woody biomass were compared in this study. The effect of pyrolysis temperature ranges from 550 C to 850 C on the preparation of biochar from rubber wood (RW) and rice husk (RH) were evaluated for power generation from DCFCs. In addition. the effect of applying chemical pre-treatment and post-treatment on biochar were further investigated for DCFC performance. In general. the power density derived from rubber wood biochar is significantly higher (2.21 mW cm− 2) compared to rice husk biochar (0.07 mW cm− 2). This might be due to the presence of an oxygen functional group. higher fixed carbon content. and lower ash content in rubber wood biochar. The acid and alkaline pre-treatment and post-treatment have altered the composition with a lower ash content in rubber wood biochar. The structural and compositional alterations in alkaline pre-treatment bring a positive effect in enhancing the power density from DCFCs. This study concludes that woody biochar is more suitable for DCFC application. and alkaline pre-treatment in the preparation of biochar enhances the electrochemical activity of DCFC. Further investigation on the optimization of DCFC operating conditions could be performed.

The present cryogenic and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technologies are either energy intensive or are unable to produce very high purity oxygen. Mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) membrane is a promising alternative technology to produce high-purity oxygen above 700 °C. The main attraction of MIEC membranes lies in the fact that only oxygen can permeate through the membrane under the presence of oxygen partial pressure driving force that endows this technology 100% oxygen selectivity; giving 99.99% pure oxygen.

Most of the previous attempts to linearize this equation have been made by assuming constant suction and discharge pressure while taking the inlet flow rate as a variable. Such assumption may not be practical in real condition because the calculated power requirement for new compressor may not be compatible with the pressure ratio of the selected compressor.

The best configuration of DRIZO process is Case (iii). which is used as a representative case for subsequent comparison against other dehydration processes evaluated in our previous work. Our techno-economic analysis reveals that Case (iii) can regenerate tri-ethylene glycol (TEG) with the highest purity and the lowest TEG loss rate and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission.

The powder X-ray diffraction results showed that the BCBZ powder for spinning had to be calcined at around 950 °C to form a hexagonal phase structure. while the hollow fibre precursors were sintered at 1150–1200 °C to form the cubic perovskite structure for oxygen permeation. It displayed the highest oxygen flux of 7.3 cm3 (STP) cm−2 min−1at 950 °C under an air/He gradient. The theoretical correlation of the oxygen fluxes at different operating conditions showed that the oxygen permeation through BCBZ fibre was limited by surface exchange reactions.

Bi4V2 − x Me x O11 − δ  (BiMeVOx) is a well-known family of material with high ionic conductivity at low operating temperatures. However. it is often reported to possess three structurally related phase changes that affect the vacancy order/disorder over the oxygen atom positions. This might be overcome by a careful chemical design of an oxide ion conductor by introducing the stabilizing dopants. Here. it is found that niobium (Nb) doping on the V site can increase the stability (tetragonal structure) and ionic conductivity at a temperature range of 200–600 °C.

The LSCF was mixed with the SDC–carbonate (SDCC) composite electrolyte at different weight percentages (ie. 30. 40. and 50 wt%) to prepare the LSCF–SDCC composite cathode. The effect of SDCC composite electrolyte content on the diffraction pattern. microstructure. specific surface area. and electrochemical performances of the LSCF–SDCC composite cathode were evaluated.

Performance tests had been carried out to determine its removal efficiency. The primary component of the separator includes a series of inverted and upright frustums-shaped coalescence plates to form a multiple angle plate arrangement for enhance gravity separation and coalescence of oil droplets. The oil removal efficiency (E) of this separator was found to be inversely proportional to influent flowrate (Q) and directly proportional to retention time. t. The efficiency (E) of this separator can be expressed as a function of flowrate (Q). retention time (t). and influent oil concentration (Coil) by a series of power equations; E= 59.689 Q-0.107 for Coil= 100 mg/L.

By targeting the palm oil industry and the biorefineries as the consumers of these products. a sustainable circular economy can be created by recycling the biomass wastes to the said consumers. To evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of the sustainable circular economy. a mathematical model demonstrating the biomass network with consideration of recycling is developed in this work. Besides. Process Graph (P-graph) is incorporated to perform the combinatorial optimization of the biomass network. which targets three common resources: fertilizer. steam. and electricity for regeneration and recycling. Although the result shows that the linear economy model is preferred in terms of profitability. the circular economy model shows potential in reducing 39.292% of the imported steam and 13.469% of the imported electricity. while being 0.642% lower in terms of the gross profit.

In the synthesis of MCM-41. tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) solution in water was utilized as the silica source while hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution in ethyl alcohol was used as a surfactant template. The synthesized gel is formed thoroughly by mixing the two solutions under acid conditions with a pH value of 0.5 for 1 hour and kept for crystallization for 48 hours. The as-synthesized MCM-41 powder is recovered by filtration while the filtrate (mother liquor) was then reused for the second synthesis cycle. The synthesis procedure was repeated till no further solid product was formed. The synthesized gel was not produced in the unifying solution in the fifth cycle of MCM-41 synthesis.

1127681,Enhanced Surfactant Template Recycling for Continuous Production of Mesoporous Silica Materials,2017,Lai Jia Yen,,,,,,The recycling of surfactant template was enhanced to reuse for continuous synthesis of Mobil Crystalline Material 41 (MCM-41). The objectives were to investigate the template recycling in the mother liquor and the effects of template extraction parameters for instance ethanol volume fraction. ion exchange agent type and quantity used for MCM-41 yield. The current research examined a suitable template removal method for removing and recovering the template and the template recovery degree. The inspection on the MCM-41 product quality that synthesized utilizing the recycled template was explored in this research. The current research also investigated the number of synthesis cycles performed by MCM-41 synthesis using template extraction parameters and the statistical study of their interaction effects on the MCM-41 yield. Firstly. the recycling of surfactant template in the MCM-41 synthesis remain in the mother liquor (filtrate) and secondly recycling the mother liquor with solvent extraction of the template in the as-synthesized MCM-41. In the second approach. the recycling of surfactant template in continuous MCM-41 synthesis was investigated by changing the three template extraction parameters. The resulting data were analysed utilising statistical analysis approach. A 23 factorial design was conducted for MCM-41 synthesis production based on the three factors to study the MCM-41 yield in the respective 2nd. 3rd and 4th synthesis cycles. Scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD). N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed for samples characterization.

1127682,Influence of Ethanol Concentration and Template Ion Exchange Agent on Template Recycling in Mobil Crystalline Material 41 (MCM-41) Synthesis,,Jia Yen Lai and Lock Hei Ngu and Farouq Twaiq,19,ASEAN Journal of Chemical Engineering,2,130-146,,Recycling of surfactant template for several subsequent MCM-41 synthesis is necessary to reduce substantial synthesis solution disposal. In MCM-41 synthesis. ethanol concentration and template ion exchange agent are two significant factors that affect the silicate polymerization. solvating effect on micelles formation. and MCM-41 mesostructure formation. In view of that. this study investigates recycling of surfactant template ions in extract solution in Mobil Crystalline Material 41 (MCM-41) synthesis. Effect of the ethanol concentrations in the solution gel and the types of ion exchange agents on the yield of MCM-41 material and its surface morphology were studied. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide was used as template for MCM-41 synthesis using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as silica reagent with ethanol-water mixture as solvent at different ethanol concentrations. Template ions of synthesis gel was exchanged with an ion exchange agent (ie. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride or ammonium nitrate) before it is extracted using synthesis solution. After extraction. the extracting solution was added with TEOS. used for second synthesis cycle and the process continued in an extraction. The template ions in the extract solution were further recycled up to eight synthesis cycles. Yield of calcined materials significantly influenced by ethanol solvent concentrations and however did not vary with various ion exchange agents. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms showed that the calcined materials exhibit MCM-41 characteristics with surface areas ranging from 600–1000 m 2/g.

The multiplicity of definitions and measures explains. in part. the confusion about these relationships. A framework that sorts out the overlaps. contradictions. and gaps of the various definitions and measures IS needed.

The total effects of the health sector on employment. income. retail sales. and sales tax collection by health category (hospitals. doctors and dentists. nursing and residential facilities. other medical and health services. and pharmacies) is presented. The model's application in nine Oklahoma counties found that approximately 9 percent of the total employment for each county was directly working in the health sector. With multipliers ranging from 1.45 to 1.87 applied to measure the total effects. including secondary employment. the health sector accounted for approximately 14 percent of all employment.

During the twentieth century. technology eroded the employment base of most rural communities. depressed incomes. and made out-migration the only recourse for millions. The fortunes of rural communities are diverging. Some are continuing to face economic decline. Others are trying to cope with rapid growth in population. land use conflicts. and growing demand for public services. The twenty-first century could instead favor rural communities. Economic and demographic trends are reducing the cost of distance and increasing the value of space. Technology is reducing the need for proximate labor.

National leaders are discussing Medicare and Medicaid issues. State leaders are addressing Medicaid issues. Community leaders are striving to maintain and/or improve health services. Without a viable health sector. rural communities may not have the desired quality of life or economic growth potential. The purpose of this publication is to illustrate the importance of the health sector to the economy of a rural community and present a simple procedure to measure the impact of the health sector on the local economy. More specifically. the objectives are:1. demonstrate the importance of the health sector on the local economy; 2. summarize the relationship between health care and industrial growth; 3. summarize the relationship between health care and retirement growth; and4. develop a method that Extension workers can use to measure the impact of the health sector on the local economy.The economic importance of the health sector can be demonstrated by looking at the percent of total employment and gross national product (GNP) associated with health activities. Recent national data show that health care expenditures make up about 15% of the US GNP (US Bureau of the Census). The magnitude of health expenditures as well as the percent of GNP continues to increase. At the community level. generalized data are not available.

Key findings indicate that before the recession. individuals living in rural metro and nonmetro counties were more likely to engage in opportunity-driven entrepreneurial activities when compared to individuals living in more urban counties. Positive employment growth rates before the recession also increased the probability that individuals in rural areas would engage in opportunity entrepreneurship. The recession marked a shift in the motivation of individuals in rural America to become self-employed. There is a clear decline in opportunity entrepreneurship and an increase in necessity entrepreneurship.

Rarely. however. are efforts made to measure local preferences for economic development outcomes. While the political process should eventually sort out how well local governments are meeting the needs of their constituents. the irreversible nature of many development outcomes makes it preferable to incorporate local preferences directly into the decision making process.

Improvement in the efficiency in vegetable farming helps the farmers increase the per capita income. reduce poverty and eventually improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers. This paper evaluates economic efficiency of vegetable farms in Nepal using a non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. The results show evidence to suggest that vegetable farms in Nepal have a considerable potential for improving the vegetable production efficiency with a greater access to improved seed. agricultural credit. and training and extension services. Some policies options with regard to the vegetable production technology. and support services for farmers in general and women farmers in particular. are suggested to increase the farm efficiency. While some of these support services are currently available. we suggest that a more focus be given to creating the improved market access. to the women focused extension. and to training packages for the sustainable production.

1127711,The hidden burden of food waste: the double energy waste in Italy,2016,Matteo Vittuari and Fabio De Menna and Marco Pagani,9,Energies,8,660,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The energy intensity of modern food systems represents a major issue in a scenario of decreasing oil resources and increasing population. Beside the use of renewable energy. an increased efficiency in food systems could contribute to reduce fossil fuels dependence. In this sense. food losses and waste (FLW) have crucial consequences on the energy balance. Based on the concept of “embodied energy”. food wastage can be framed as a double waste of energy. both in terms of non-consumed food energy and the inputs used for production. Secondary data regarding direct and indirect energy inputs and FLW have been collected for the Italian food chain to estimate the embodied energy of food waste. Since in 2011 the production and distribution of food implied the use of 822 PJ and 18 Mt of food was discarded. 67 PJ of food energy and 100 PJ of embodied energy were wasted. These figures are equivalent to 12.2% of the total nutritional energy output and to 1.3% of the final energy use in Italy. respectively. The concept of double energy waste sheds new light on the intertwined relationship between energy and food security. suggesting that appropriate food waste reduction policies could result in a higher food production level and relevant energy savings.

However. the selection of alternative valorization scenarios can pose several queries in certain contexts. This paper evaluates four FW valorization scenarios based on anaerobic digestion and composting. in comparison to landfilling. by applying a consistent decision-making framework through a combination of linear programming. Life Cycle Thinking (LCT). and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The evaluation was built upon a case study of five universities in Costa Rica and portrayed the trade-offs between environmental impacts and cost categories from the scenarios and their side flows. Results indicate that the landfill scenario entails higher Global Warming Potential and Fresh Water Eutrophication impacts than the valorization scenarios; however. other impact categories and costs are affected. Centralized recovery facilities can increase the Global Warming Potential and the Land Use compared to semi-centralized ones. Experts provided insights. regarding the ease of adoption of composting. in contrast to the potential of energy sources substitution and economic savings from anaerobic digestion.

This inefficiency presents major consequences. in terms of GHG emissions. waste disposal. and natural resource depletion.  The research hypothesis is that residual biomass material  could contribute to the energetic needs of food systems. if recovered as an integrated renewable energy source (RES). leading to a sensitive reduction of the impacts of food systems. primarily in terms of fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions. In order to assess these effects. a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) has been conducted to compare two different food systems: a fossil fuel-based system and an integrated system with the use of residual as RES for self-consumption. The food product under analysis has been the peach nectar. from cultivation to end-of-life. The aim of this LCA is twofold. On one hand. it allows an evaluation of the energy inefficiencies related to agro-food waste. On the other hand. it illustrates how the integration of bioenergy into food systems could effectively contribute to reduce this inefficiency.  Data about inputs and waste generated has been collected mainly through literature review and databases. Energy balance. GHG emissions (Global Warming Potential) and waste generation have been analyzed in order to identify the relative requirements and contribution of the different segments.

It is found that some significant cost drivers in cross‐section estimation are insignificant when the model is estimated on panel data. highlighting the well‐known drawbacks of cross‐section estimation. Panel data estimation suggests that the main determinants of distribution operating costs are the number of customers in the area and simultaneous maximum demand. These results and the efficiency rankings of the companies are not sensitive to changes in error distribution assumptions and sample size. There is also significant evidence of economies of scale.

This results in a closer envelopment of the mean performance of the companies in the sample and diminishes the effect of extreme outliers. We use the Land. Lovell and Thore (1993) model incorporating information on the covariance structure of inputs and outputs to study efficiency across a panel of 17 European airlines in the 1990s during the early phase of liberalisation. After allowing for stochastic error in computing the relative efficiencies we conclude that the airlines that were efficient in 1995 resembled those that were efficient in 1993 but not those in 1991.

The ease of foreign banks’ entry set by the WTO from December 2007 raises our concern of the capability of domestic banks to compete against foreign Asian banks. This study attempts to address this issue by measuring the cost efficiency of ten major Asian banking industries from 1998 to 2005 using panel data stochastic frontier approaches. Based on our preferred consistent panel data estimating models. the higher cost efficiency score from including cross-country environmental variables suggests that differences between countries can explain part of the inefficiency.

1127756,Non-parametric analysis of efficiency gains from bank mergers in India,2006,Adrian Gourlay and Geetha Ravishankar and Tom Weyman-Jones,,,,,Loughborough University,This paper offers an insight into the effectiveness of economic policy reforms in the Indian Banking System by examining the efficiency benefits of mergers among Scheduled Commercial Banks in India over the post-reform period 1991-92 to 2004-05. It does this by using the methodology developed by Bogetoft and Wang (2005). We also provide a metric for judging the success or failure of a merger. Overall. we find that bank mergers in the post reform period possessed considerable potential efficiency gains stemming from harmony gains. Post merger efficiency analysis of the merged bank with a control group of non-merging banks reveals an initial merger related efficiency advantage for the former that. while persistent. did not show a sustained increase thus failing to provide the merging banks with a competitive advantage vis-à-vis their non-merging counterparts.

This paper applies a public good model of the police service to evaluate the potential efficiency gains from mergers of police services in England and Wales. It uses a non‐parametric method suggested by Bogetoft and Wang (2005). We construct a dataset that reflects the public good nature of police service and allows for the exogenous imposition by government on the level of police service budgets. Our main finding is that English and Welsh police service mergers could lead to increases in police staff resource efficiencies between 10 per cent and 70 per cent.

It is a known fact that economic development does not necessarily eliminate poverty. and countries with different development levels and welfare state policies experience different levels of poverty. Thus. poverty is a major problem for both developed and developing countries. and in Turkey. in particular. this issue has gained in importance since 1990. Various governments from 1990 to 2004 have recognized the fact that poverty is no longer a transitory problem and that it is on the increase. Since 1999. a process has begun to rethink and restructure existing welfare programmes. especially those focusing on poverty alleviation (Şenses 2001; TÜSIAD 1997; Buğra and Keyder 2003). This chapter discusses the reasons behind rising poverty in Turkey and elaborates on the changing roles of the family and social networks vis-à-vis the role of the state in alleviating poverty. For poverty alleviation programmes to gain importance two aspects should be emphasized. First. an awareness of poverty should begin to be disseminated among the public and within the state itself. Second. a consensus on the indicators of poverty. which may vary in time and space. should be reached by major political organizations and actors within society.

Or: Cynicism of EU’s Concept of Economic Freedom. Bremen: Europäischer Hochschulverlag,,49-67,,It is hard to ﬁnd explicit references to words such as social precarity. uncertainty and insecurity in European documents. The word “precarity” is virtually non-existent in the vocabulary of the Union. The words “uncertainty” and “insecurity” are rarely used; sometimes they appear in Eurobarometer polls or in certain social documents. in particular in places where they refer to the issue of future prospects. In this case. however. the most popular words employed are “concern” or “wony” and deal mainly with the psychological attitude of European citizens towards the risk of changes imposed by globalisation. the evolution of the economic and ﬁnancial crisis. migration ﬂows and climate change.The very real and complex phenomenon of the precarity. that is permanently experienced daily by large social groups in a very concrete way in present-day Europe. has in fact in the reading of the EUropean institutionsbeen overcome; or. according to a more positive reading. it can be traced back to and included within the broader phenomenon of the low efﬁciency of the system. In this way. social precarity is hidden within the framework of the various malfunctions of the system; therefore it is translated in the simplistic terms of social deterioration. To address it. sharp dichotomies are applied. such as: inclusion-exclusion. employment-unemployment and wealth-poverty.,True,vIchpYYAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,14,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SVDN4d30YWcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA49&dq=info:jxPZJzKeo8sJ:scholar.google.com&ots=I-7JFG9PZy&sig=iTj5hZM3K003Wg74kGetVu4rCnY,14673745949157299087,/scholar?cites=14673745949157299087,,,0,0,0

The meaning of trade union. the reasons for its existence and its benefits for the workers are discussed through the workers’ experiences and from the workers’ points of view. Structural reasons which have an effect on the workers’ perception trade union have also been integrated into the analysis. The study is based on a field research which was conducted in 2004-2005 in Ankara. Bursa and Istanbul. Research was undertaken in electronics and textile sectors. which developed before the 1980s and were of significance for industrial transformation in these regions. 40 workers who are still working and/or retired from both big and small scale enterprises were interviewed in depth. Equal numbers of men and women were included in the sample. and oral history technique was applied during the interviews. The first finding of the study is that there are many factors affecting workers’ experiences and perceptions related to work. such as economic sector. age. sex. marital status. position in the workplace. wage. the size of the sector and the enterprise. duration of work life. education and skill levels and the level of social/cultural capital. All these factors are also closely linked to and interact with the workers’ experiences and perceptions of trade unions. September 12th. 1980 was perceived as an important turning point by the workers for the unionization movement in Turkey. since the union rights were suspended after the military intervention; but also the level of unemployment. the size of informal sector …,True,vIchpYYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,9,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/607117,5668435622605712644,/scholar?cites=5668435622605712644,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/607117,0,0,0

The application area is Western Turkey. The methodology is mainly composed of two stages: the first stage is pre-elimination of infeasible sites. and the second stage is evaluation of the available ones. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to generate layers of data and to apply the elimination criteria and constraints. The alternative land areas are handled in terms of identical-sized grids. which are large enough to install one wind turbine each. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is then used to rank and sort the grids via the identified evaluation criteria. The problem is evaluated in 13 fields. which are a collection of several grids in order to evaluate larger scale areas to construct wind farms rather than for individual turbines.

Furthermore. we generate Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) for the MENA region countries where the data available include Turkey. The empirical section comprises the time span between 1987 and 2003. The reason for the application of MPI in such a study is that when there are many components. factor analysis–a technique that aggregates components with unknown weights–is a convenient and superior alternative. For the period of 1987-2003. we explore that the MENA region countries macroeconomic performances declined and Malmquist index values are highly volatile after the Gulf War.

The reason of this is that it is not need to perform complex matrix operations when these tables are used. On the other hand. when fuzzy logic group relationships tables are exploited. membership values of fuzzy sets are ignored.

Since real life time series can generally contain both linear and nonlinear components. hybrid approaches which can model both these two components have also been proposed in the literature. The hybrid approaches suggested in the literature generally have two phases. In the first phase. linear component of time series is modeled with a linear model. Then. nonlinear component is modeled by utilizing a nonlinear model in the second phase. In two-phase methods. it is assumed that time series has only a linear structure in the first phase. Also. it is assumed that time series has only a nonlinear structure in the second phase. Therefore. this causes model specification error.

Various approaches available in the literature have been proposed in order to select the best model for forecasting in ANN in recent years. One of these approaches is to use a model selection strategy based on the weighted information criterion (WIC). WIC is calculated by summing weighted different selection criteria which measure the forecasting accuracy of an ANN model in different ways. In the calculation of WIC. the weights of different selection criteria are determined heuristically. In this study. these weights are calculated by using optimization in order to obtain a more consistent criterion. Four real time series are analyzed in order to show the efficiency of the improved WIC.

Fuzzy time series forecasting models do not need strict assumptions. whereas conventional stochastic models need to satisfy some assumptions.

Fuzzy time series approaches comprise three basic steps: fuzzification of the crisp observations. identification of fuzzy relations. and defuzzification. In previous studies. many methods have been proposed that allow all of these stages to obtain more accurate forecasting results.

I address these questions and follow the change in Hayek’s works from skills and techniques of thought in the 1930s to the use of ‘tacit knowledge’in the1960s.

I offer some potential explanations for this preference.[I] t is entirely consistent. on the one hand. to deny that ‘wholes’ which are intuitively perceived by the scientist may legitimately figure in his explanations and. on the other. to insist that the perception of such wholes by the persons whose interactions are the object of investigation must form a datum for scientific analysis.(FA Hayek. 1967: 54),True,I2sJGcEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,37,https://www.academia.edu/download/51130945/Hayek_on_tacit_knowledge20161231-14998-1hzi13u.pdf,18087601148162645233,/scholar?cites=18087601148162645233,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51130945/Hayek_on_tacit_knowledge20161231-14998-1hzi13u.pdf,0,0,0

Mainly studied are the writings of Friedrich A. Hayek who was especially influential. The paper examines the Austrian understanding of knowledge before Hayek. the contributions made by Hayek. and then the work that was done by Austrians after Hayek. Hayek's writings indicate that practical or inarticulate knowledge enables people to do things in a skillful way despite their having no conscious awareness of this knowledge unlike their awareness of scientific and propositional knowledge. Due to this realm of the knowledge. experts use the right kind of information in their work and entrepreneurs make intuitive business decisions. The Austrians point out that market processes can take advantage of this type of knowledge while central planning cannot.

Thermophoresis and inertial impaction are considered. the latter being the predominant process for particles > 10 μm. A single drop-tube furnace and a horizontal p.f.-fired furnace have been modelled in this study. Predicted results show that the denser (iron-rich) particles are more inclined to deposit than less dense (silica-rich) particles. Boiler aerodynamics are also shown to be a controlling factor in the slagging process.

The flow is in the regime of relatively low Reynolds number of the order of 105 based on the chord length of the airfoil. Both the URANS and the more advanced DES approaches are employed. The URANS is coupled with two advanced turbulence models. namely the RNG k−ε model and the Transition SST model (γ−Reθ model) and the DES is coupled with the SST k−ω model. A comparison with experimental data shows that the SST k−ω based DES approach is superior to the URANS approach and presents generally good agreement with the experimental data. although the prediction of experimentally observed peek stall angle of attack may not be warranted.

Simulations are carried out using two different burners. namely. a triple-staged low-NOx wall fired burner and an IFRF Aerodynamically Air-Staged Burner (AASB).

Predictions using LES are compared with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) calculations using variants of the k-ε model for turbulence and against available experimental measurements.

The influence of operating parameters such as furnace temperature. residence time and physical properties (carbon content. moisture content. ash level and volatile matter) of coal on the fragmentation process is reported. The extent of fragmentation increases with furnace temperature and particle size. Fragment counts indicate extensive fragmentation for short residence times. Further. the number of fragments tends to reduce with time for smaller particles. while the number of fragments remains high for larger particles. The differing rates of fragmentation and extinction between the different sized particles are found responsible for this behavior.

Consequently. rate expressions for their oxidation are more accurately described in terms of the intrinsic reactivity. where differences in surface area and porosity can be taken into account.The oxidative reactivity of coal chars is complicated by a number of different factors. which are explored in this paper.

This paper develops a modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood expression linking the rate of thermal degradation of a biomass to its potassium or sodium content. Willow samples impregnated with different potassium or sodium concentrations were studied for their pyrolysis behaviour by thermogravimetric analysis. and apparent first order kinetics derived. The developed relation yields a maximum reaction rate constant and a metal saturation constant that can predict the rate of willow pyrolysis based on temperature and concentration of potassium or sodium. The apparent first-order reaction rate reaches a limit at ca. 3.5 wt.% (Na) and 4 wt.% (K); this is attributed to maximum active site availability.

Attention is still directed to the emission of NOx. which is subject to more stringent regulation. and to the amount of carbon in ash. The latter is increased when low NOx burners are employed. which is the norm now. It is also increased as a result of additional air staging when over-fire air is added in furnaces. especially tangential fired systems. Such a furnace is studied here. Two approaches can be employed for prediction of NOx and unburned carbon.

For a realistic range of transport properties being investigated. the fuel cell performance was found to be very sensitive to the electrical conductivity but almost insensitive to the gas permeability of the GDL. For the given operating conditions. the current density was found to be a maximum in the vicinity of the edge between the flow channel and the rib of the current collector. Since the most common GDL materials present a rather significant anisotropy in the in-plane directions. the effects of such anisotropy has been evaluated.

PartEmis was focussed on the characterisation and quantification of exhaust emissions from a gas turbine engine. The engine was composed of a combustor and a unit to simulate a 3-shaft turbine section (so-called Hot End Simulator; HES). A comprehensive suite of aerosol. gas and chemi-ion measurements were conducted under different. i) combustor and HES operating conditions. ii) fuel sulphur concentrations. Measured aerosol properties were mass and number concentration. size distribution. mixing state. thermal stability of internally mixed particles. hygroscopicity. cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation potential. and chemical composition. Furthermore. chemi-ions. non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and OH were monitored. The combustor operation conditions corresponded to modern and older engine gas path temperatures at cruise altitude. with fuel sulphur contents (FSC) of 0.05. 0.41. and 1.270 g kg−1. The combustor behaved like a typical aircraft engine combustor with respect to thermodynamic data and main emissions. which suggests that the PartEmis database may be applicable to contemporary aircraft engines.

The results are compared with those from a methane-air flame. Biogas is a sustainable and renewable fuel that is produced in digestion facilities. The composition of biogas discussed in this paper consists of 66.4% methane. 30.6% carbon dioxide and 3% nitrogen. Burning velocity was measured using a photographic technique in a high pressure fan-stirred bomb. the initial condition being at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Based on this experimental investigation. the laminar burning velocities of biogas-air mixtures were 0.2086 m/s for lean ( =0.8). 0.2638 m/s for stoichiometric ( =1.0) and 0.1864 m/s for rich ( =1.2) conditions. Compared to a methane-air mixture. the presence of carbon dioxide and nitrogen causes a reduction in the laminar burning velocity for two reasons. The dilution effect leads to a lower concentration of reactive species in the fuel-air mixture for a given equivalence ratio. which leads to a lower overall chemical reaction rate of bimolecular reactions in the fuel oxidation reaction mechanism. Also. the presence of this additional inert gas will absorb some of the heat generated. thus lowering the flame temperature which in turn will tend to reduce the overall rate of many of the chemical reactions within the fuel oxidation mechanism. These effects lead to a different behaviour in burning velocity of biogas as a function of equivalence ratio.

1127954,An efficient mathematical model for air-breathing PEM fuel cells,2014,MS Ismail and DB Ingham and KJ Hughes and L Ma and M Pourkashanian,135,Applied energy,,490-503,Elsevier,A simple and efficient mathematical model for air-breathing proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells has been built. One of the major objectives of this study is to investigate the effects of the Joule and entropic heat sources. which are often neglected. on the performance of air-breathing PEM fuel cells. It is found that the fuel cell performance is significantly over-predicted if one or both of these heat sources is not incorporated into the model. Also. it is found that the performance of the fuel cell is highly sensitive to the state of the water at the thermodynamic equilibrium magnitude as both the entropic heat and the Nernst potential considerably increase if water is assumed to be produced in liquid form rather than in vapour form. Further. the heat of condensation is shown to be small and therefore. under single-phase modelling. has a negligible effect on the performance of the fuel cell.

The presence of the particles is assumed not to affect the fluid flow in the cyclone due to the light particle loads which are normally encountered in most small air sampling cyclone applications. The governing fluid flow equations. along with the RNG turbulent model equations. are solved using the control volume method in a body-fitted coordinate system. A particle tracking technique is used to track the motion of the particles in the cyclone. We have found reasonable agreement between the present numerical results and the experimental data of Kim and Lee (1990) for the particle separation efficiency of a small sampling cyclone even though the turbulent effects of the fluid flow have not been included in the particle tracking procedure.

At the same time recent evidence shows that decarbonisation of electricity generation cannot be achieved without a CCS option for gas plants. This article first proposes steam turbine design options to build combined cycle gas turbine plants as carbon capture-ready. Then steam cycle options for the existing fleet of coal-fired units are then presented. Although these plants have not been initially designed to operate with CCS it is possible to achieve effective thermodynamic integration–and an overall electricity output penalty in kWh per tonne of CO2 close to a plant built with capture from the outset–with appropriate steam turbine retrofits.Finally. novel insights into the design …,True,A224WC4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,28,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610211002554,16807605177496910578,/scholar?cites=16807605177496910578,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610211002554/pdf?md5=e92c5552eb3efd83b27ac157c1a9ae5a&pid=1-s2.0-S1876610211002554-main.pdf,0,0,0

Sequential combustion makes use of the excess oxygen in gas turbine exhaust gas to generate additional CO2. but. unlike in conventional supplementary firing. allows keeping gas temperatures in the heat recovery steam generator below 820 °C. avoiding a step change in capital costs.

In the capture plant ramping scenario. increased liquid-to-gas (L/G) ratio resulted in higher CO2 capture rate.

Several options for future CO2 capture from NGCC units can be envisaged including post-combustion capture technology using flue gas scrubbing with aqueous solvents. When an NGCC plant is designed to be ready for a retrofit with post-combustion capture. one of the most important technical considerations is the steam extraction pressure and flow to provide the energy necessary for solvent regeneration. This is determined by the choice of solvent used. but new solvents are being developed and the exact future requirements. in perhaps 10–20 years time. cannot be predicted.

To make contact with existing studies in the literature. the effect of various density contrasts is also examined.

The potential to extend the life of existing plants with paid-off capital could be beneficial and some project developers are exploring retrofit opportunities for CO2 capture demonstration.

1128004,Steam cycle options for capture-ready power plants. retrofits and flexible operation with post-combustion CO2 capture,2010,Mathieu Lucquiaud,,,,,Imperial College London,The energy penalty for post‐combustion carbon dioxide capture from fossil‐fired power plants can be greatly reduced ‐ independently of the intrinsic heat of regeneration of the solvent used ‐ by effective thermodynamic integration with the power cycle. Yet expected changes in electricity generation mix and the current immaturity of post‐combustion capture technology are likely to make effective thermodynamic integration throughout the operating life of such plants a challenging objective to achieve because of a requirement for extensive part‐load operation and also for matching to future technology improvements. Most previous published studies have. however. focused on base‐load operation of the power cycle and the carbon dioxide capture plant and with the assumption of a fixed technology. For carbon dioxide capture‐ready plants the characteristics of the capture plant are also not known when the plant is designed. The plant must operate initially without capture at a similar efficiency to ‘standard’ plants to be competitive. Capture‐ready plants then also need to be able to be retrofitted with unknown improved solvents and to be capable of integration with a range of future solvents. This study shows that future upgradability for post‐combustion capture systems can be facilitated by appropriate steam turbine and steam cycle designs. In addition fossil‐fired power plants with postcombustion capture may need to be able to operate throughout their load range with the capture unit by‐passed. or with intermediate solvent storage to avoid the additional emissions occurring when the absorption column is by‐passed.

Pd and PdAu catalysts. It was found that NO inhibits significantly the CO oxidation reactivity on both Pt and Pd catalysts. On PdAu catalyst. however. the presence of NO resulted in an enhancement of CO oxidation activity. In order to gain an atomistic understanding of this effect. density-function theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the adsorption and reaction properties of NO and CO on these metal surfaces. We have identified that the inhibition effects on Pt and Pd catalysts are due to stronger NO binding. and that the enhanced reactivity on PdAu is due to the reduced NO oxidation barrier on PdAu leading to NO2 formation.,True,czcP2PgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,17,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11244-009-9378-y.pdf,1432588778709591318,/scholar?cites=1432588778709591318,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xianghong_Hao/publication/226834785_Experimental_and_Theoretical_Study_of_CO_Oxidation_on_PdAu_Catalysts_with_NO_Pulse_Effects/links/0deec53a464861499a000000/Experimental-and-Theoretical-Study-of-CO-Oxidation-on-PdAu-Catalysts-with-NO-Pulse-Effects.pdf,0,0,0

Although bismuth (Bi)-promoted platinum (Pt) catalysts show improvement in CO oxidation performance over pure Pt. it is still not known whether Bi acts simply as a site blocker to reduce CO poisoning or whether it is an active participant in the catalytic reactions. In this study. we report density functional theory-based CO oxidation energetics and kinetics in the presence of different Bi dopant configurations. Adsorption energies for both CO and oxygen atoms are found to be reduced by Bi doping. Bi dopant also creates surface areas in its vicinity where CO adsorption is prohibited. whereas molecular oxygen dissociation is promoted.

1128026,Electron transport across molecular junctions: Effect of junction geometry and molecule functionality,2007,Neeti Kapur,,,,,ProQuest,Electronic structure methods probe the interfacial electronic structure and associated electron transport mechanism and can therefore. aid in guiding device design. The intermolecular interactions and orientations of the adsorbed molecular junctions vary with changes in structural parameters such as surface coverage and electrode spacing. These changes lead to shifting of the molecular energy states with respect to the electrode Fermi levels resulting in current flow variations. The electron transport within Au (111)-octane dithiolate-Au (111) junction occurs via conduction through occupied molecular energy states for low molecular coverage and moderate electrode spacing. The electron transport mechanisms also depend on the chemical functionality included in the molecular junction. The conduction through tunable molecules containing delocalized stilbene substituted octahydrosilsesquioxane (POSS) core is examined for potential application as rectifying devices. Both occupied and unoccupied hybrid molecular energy states emerge for Au (111)-stilbene substituted POSS-Au (111) system. which are accessible at biases equal or higher than the range of 2.5 to 3 V. Thus. the electron transport characteristics are sensitive to the molecular configuration and position of substitution. which can be altered depending on the electrical behavior required.

This consideration has led to extensive experimental as well as theoretical studies testing new molecules for interesting conductance behavior. Quantum mechanical studies done by Lin. He and Xiao1 as well as by Lee and Neurock2 for octasilsesquioxanes report that the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) varies with the functionality as well as the number of the non-hydrogen substituents in the octahydrosilsesquioxane (H8 (SiO1. 5) 8) structure. The HOMO-LUMO energy gap drops from 7.06 eV for octahydrosilsesquioxane (H8Si8O12) to 4.5 eV for the phenyl substituted species (Ph8Si8O12). Recent studies done by Laine and coworkers3 found that stilbene substituents [(stilbene) 8Si8O12] reduce the HOMO-LUMO energy gap to approx. 2.6 eV.

Except at the highest adsorption temperatures. the amount of NO 2 adsorbed was greater than that of SO 2 adsorbed. The presence of SO 2 inhibited adsorption of NO 2. but the co-adsorption of NO 2 promoted the adsorption of SO 2. These data point to the possibility that the SO 2 binding sites on the carbon are associated with the reaction NO+ 1 2 O 2→ NO 2. and to the different adsorption mechanisms which …,True,qn6lv5cAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,62,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236196002219,421341330287902726,/scholar?cites=421341330287902726,,,0,0,0
1128038,Uptake of NOx by activated carbons: bench-scale and pilot-plant testing,1997,JK Neathery and AM Rubel and JM Stencel,35,Carbon,9,1321-1327,Pergamon,The possibility of selectively removing NOx from gas containing CO2. N2. O2. H2O. SO2 and NOx has been examined using bench-scale and pilot-scale experimentation. These results have shown that NO can be selectively sequestered from the gas if the oxygen concentration is high enough and the SO2 concentration is low enough. Oxygen enhances the amount of NO removed. and promotes the conversion of NO to NO2 (via NO + 1/2O2 → NO2) and the adsorption of NO2 within the carbons' micropores. The carbon is not consumed if during NO2 desorption its temperature is maintained below about 200 °C. The presence of SO2 inhibits the oxidation of NO and the subsequent storage of NO2 within micropores but. at concentrations typical to gases after post-combustion sulfur scrubbers. such inhibition is an immediate effect probably associated with selective site poisoning rather than a cumulative effect …,True,qn6lv5cAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,62,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622397000894,7170814166727763668,/scholar?cites=7170814166727763668,,,0,0,0

So. a preliminary practical feasibility study of using a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system for snow melting on pavements and bridge decks had been performed for the first time in Turkey on the basis of a university study. The objective of this paper is to investigate the practicability of a GSHP system consisting of the vertical type single U-borehole heat exchangers with different lengths for snow melting on pavements and bridge decks. For this purpose. the vertical drilling of the borehole was performed for three different depths (30. 60. and 90 m) in Elazig. Turkey and U-tube heat exchangers were inserted into the corresponding boreholes. Experiments in winter season of 2006-2007 were carried out for melting snow on surfaces of the prototypes of bridge-slab (BS) and pavement-slab (PS) constructed for the experimental study. The effect of the depth of borehole coupled to heat exchanger on the snow melting system performance was experimentally investigated.

In LBP. each pixel is compared with its neighbors. Similarly. in 1D-LBP. each data in the raw is judged against its neighbors. 1D-LBP extracts feature based on local changes in the signal. Therefore. it has high a potential to be employed in medical purposes. Since. each action or abnormality. which is recorded in SEMG signals. has its own pattern. and via the 1D-LBP these (hidden) patterns may be detected. But. the positions of the neighbors in 1D-LBP are constant depending on the position of the data in the raw. Also. both LBP and 1D-LBP are very sensitive to noise.

Mechanical wear and faulty bearings reduce the efficiency of rotating machines and thus increase energy consumption. The feature extraction process is an essential part of fault diagnosis in bearings. In order to diagnose the fault caused by the bearing correctly. it is necessary to determine an effective feature extraction method that best describes the fault.In this study. a new approach based on texture analysis is proposed for diagnosing bearing vibration signals. Bearing vibration signals were first converted to gray scale images. It can be understood from the images that the signals of different bearing failures form different textures.

Generally. the previous studies were based on the assumption that the complex actions can be recognized by more features. Therefore. generally more than required body-worn sensor types and sensor nodes were used by the researchers. On the other hand. this assumption leads many drawbacks. such as computational complexity. storage and communication requirements.

This paper proposes a new method based on S-transform (ST) and support vector machines (SVMs) for fault classification and identification of a faulty section in a transmission line with a fixed series capacitor placed at the middle of the line. In the proposed method. the fault detection process is carried out by using distinctive features of 3-line signals (line voltages and currents) and zero sequence current. The relevant features of these signals are obtained by using the ST. The obtained features are then used as input to multiple SVM classifiers and their outputs are combined for classifying the fault type and identifying the faulty section. Training and testing samples for the proposed method have been generated with different types of short-circuit faults and different combinations of system parameters in the MATLAB environment. The performance of the proposed method is investigated according to the accuracy of fault classification and faulty section identification.

This conversion has been done via rectifiers based on controlled or uncontrolled semiconductor switches. Advances in the power electronics and microprocessor technologies allowed the use of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) rectifiers. In this paper. dq-axis current and DC link voltage of three-phase PWM rectifier are controlled by using type-2 fuzzy neural network (T2FNN) controller. For this aim. a simulation model is built by MATLAB/Simulink software. The model is tested under three different operating conditions. The parameters of T2FNN is updated online by using back-propagation algorithm. The results obtained from both T2FNN and Proportional+ Integral+ Derivate (PID) controller are given for three operating conditions.

It is proposed that the inner Fe–Cr spinel layer grows according to a mechanism involving void formation at the oxide/metal interface. The driving force for pore formation is the outward magnetite growth: iron vacancies are injected at the oxide/metal interface then condense into voids. The fresh metallic surface made available is then oxidized by CO2. which diffuses fast through the scale. The physical aspects. the integrity and the nature of the scale are shown to be very dependent on the oxygen potential existing in the environment.,True,qVeo2FwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,85,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11085-011-9271-5,7503755591152888867,/scholar?cites=7503755591152888867,,,0,0,0

At 300 K. we extract an exciton diffusion length of LX = 0.36 ± 0.02 μm and an exciton diffusion coefficient of DX = 14.5 ± 2 cm2/s. This represents a nearly 10-fold increase in the effective mobility of excitons with respect to several previously reported values on nonencapsulated samples. At cryogenic temperatures. the high optical quality of these samples has allowed us to discriminate the diffusion of the different exciton species: bright and dark neutral excitons. as well as charged excitons.

The magnetite layer is easily removed by the Pb‐Bi flow when the oxygen concentration is low and the flow velocity is high. This phenomenon is not currently understood.

Consequently. the determination of this physico-chemical data in the temperature range of the ADS operating conditions (350–450° C) is needed for the prediction of the corrosion rates in ADS. The nickel solubility limit in Pb–Bi is available in the literature from 400° C to 900° C but not for lower temperatures.

The corrosion of the T91 in LBE is dependent on the oxygen concentration in the LBE. Dissolution process occurs when the oxygen concentration is low while a protective oxide film forms under high oxygen concentration. The low cycle fatigue resistance of the T91 steel is reduced by a factor at least of 2 when cycling at 300 °C in LBE instead of air. A pre immersion of T91 fatigue specimens in a LBE bath at 600 °C for about 600 h and with a dissolved oxygen concentration less than 10−10 wt% is detrimental on the fatigue resistance.

Une procédure expérimentale a été mise en place afin de procéder à des essais mécaniques en sodium sous atmosphère inerte. Grâce à l’introduction d’une étape préliminaire d’exposition au sodium. la mouillabilité du T91 par le sodium liquide et la structure de l’interface sodium/acier ont pu être étudiés en fonction des différents paramètres d’exposition. Une réduction significative des propriétés mécaniques est observée quand le mouillage de l’acier par le sodium est bon. L’utilisation de différentes teneurs en oxygène et en hydrogène suggère que l’oxygène joue un rôle primordial dans l’amélioration de la mouillabilité du T91. La sensibilité du phénomène de fragilisation à la vitesse de sollicitation et à la température a été caractérisée. A partir de ces résultats. l’existence d’une transition fragile/ductile. fonction de ces deux paramètres a été mis en évidence. L’étude de cette transition suggère qu’une étape de diffusion du sodium dans les joints de grains du T91 est limitante pour la fragilisation. Des analyses en microscopie électronique en transmission et par cartographies d’orientation de fissures arrêtées ont également permis de constater que le mode de rupture est interlatte ou intergranulaire. fournissant ainsi une image cohérente du processus de fragilisation. La même méthodologie a été appliquée à l’acier non allié XC10.

Inc.,The fatigue or dwell fatigue crack initiation process in titanium alloys is usually controlled by slip activity in the alpha phase at the scale of nodules or lamellae. Deep understanding of slip activity in relation with microstructure at different scales is thus a major concern for improving the fatigue and dwell‐fatigue durability.

The order/disorder phase transition of La2Mo2O9. accompanied by an increase of anion conductivity. is suppressed by most of the substituants which stabilize the highly conducting cubic phase down to room temperature. The series La2-xRxMo2-yWyO9 (R= Nd. Gd. Y) was studied with respect to the optimisation of anion conduction and stability against reduction. Tungsten substitution is a good way to minimize oxygen loss under reducing atmosphere. a drawback in applications such as electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells. Ball-milling and dilatometric studies allowed an efficient control and improvement of the samples relative density. for a better characterisation of the oxygen diffusion properties. a first account of which is presented here. The LAMOX family exhibits among the highest oxygen tracer diffusion coefficients.

Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and isotope exchange experiments demonstrate the key role of bulk oxygen species in the oxidation process. When “intimate” soot/YSZ contact is achieved after in situ carbon deposition via propylene cracking. lattice oxygen ions are the predominant species involved in the oxidation reaction. Based on isotopic TPO experiments performed with different oxygen partial pressures in “tight” contact mode and oxygen exchange measurements. it is proposed that the ignition of the soot oxidation on YSZ can be described as a fuel-cell-type electrochemical mechanism at the nanometric scale. The efficiency of this electrochemical process seems to depend both on the YSZ/soot contact and on the oxygen partial pressure.

Using X-ray fluorescence in specially treated samples. we quantitatively determined the fraction of MgO forming surface excess when doping SnO2 with several different concentrations and established a relationship between this amount and the surface energy of the nanoparticles using the Gibbs approach. We concluded that the amount of Mg ions on the surface was directly related to the nanoparticles total free energy. in a sense that the dopant will always spontaneously distribute itself to minimize it if enough diffusion is provided.

Techno-economic analysis is required to find the optimum renewable energy system in the long run. This paper reviews the application of genetic algorithms in optimization of hybrid system consisting of pico hydro system. solar photovoltaic modules. diesel generator and battery sets. It is intended to maximize the use of renewable system while limiting the use of diesel generator. Daily load demand is assumed constant for derivation of annual load. Power derived from the hybrid should be able to meet the demand. Local weather data is used and analyzed to assess the technical and economic viability of utilizing the hybrid system. Optimization of the system will be based on the component sizing and the operational strategy. Genetic algorithms programming is used to evaluate both conditions in minimizing the total net present cost for optimum configuration. Manufacturer data for the hybrid components is used in calculation of sizing to represent actual power derivation. Several operation strategies will be considered while forming the vectors for optimum strategy. Random selection of sizing and strategy is used to initiate the solution for the problem which will have the lowest total net present cost. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to optimize the system at different conditions.,True,7BB210IAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,85,http://wseas.us/e-library/transactions/mathematics/2008/25-652.pdf,7904258243654281799,/scholar?cites=7904258243654281799,,http://wseas.us/e-library/transactions/mathematics/2008/25-652.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. variations in O3 concentrations from urban. suburban and rural regions of the Malaysian Peninsula were investigated using data covering a five-year period (2005–2009) obtained from the Malaysian Department of the Environment. The principal aim of the study is to identify and describe the variations in O3 concentrations recorded at three monitoring stations with different backgrounds. namely Petaling Jaya (S2) (urban). Putrajaya (S1) (suburban) and Jerantut (S3) (rural). The study also investigated the relationship between O3 distribution and its association with nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) and non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC). The results showed that the highest O3 concentration was recorded in a suburban area (Putrajaya (S1) with an average daily maximum value of 60 ± 20 ppbv). The O3 concentration was influenced by the characteristics of nitrogen oxides. particularly the titration of NO. The surface O3 level was found to be influenced by solar radiation and wind direction from the busy areas. most notably Kuala Lumpur’s city centre.

We attempt to capture all possible variations of underlying data and calculation procedures in a global MRIO model constructed with particular focus on the UK. We consider these variations to be random. and determine the stochastic variation of the whole MRIO system using Monte Carlo techniques. 5000 simulation runs were carried out to determine the standard deviations of multipliers.

Whilst the LMDI method provides perfect decomposition. and is time-reversal invariant. its strategy to handle zero-values is not necessarily robust. In order to overcome this problem. it has been recommended to substitute a small value δ= 1 0-10–1 0-20 for any zero values in the underlying data set. and allow the calculation to proceed as usual. The decomposition results are said to converge as δ approaches zero. However. we show that under this recommended procedure the LMDI can produce significant errors if applied in the decomposition of a data set containing a large number of zeroes and/or small values.

This benefit. and hence the responsibility for emissions. varies by purpose or consumption category and is unevenly distributed across and within countries. We quantify greenhouse gas emissions associated with the final consumption of goods and services for 73 nations and 14 aggregate world regions. We analyze the contribution of 8 categories: construction. shelter. food. clothing. mobility. manufactured products. services. and trade. National average per capita footprints vary from 1 tCO2e/y in African countries to ∼30t/y in Luxembourg and the United States. The expenditure elasticity is 0.57.

In this article we determine the CO2 emissions embodied in international trade among 87 countries for the year 2001. We find that globally there are over 5.3 Gt of CO2 embodied in trade and that Annex B countries are net importers of CO2 emissions. Depending on country characteristics—such as size variables and geographic location—there are considerable variations in the embodied emissions. We argue that emissions embodied in trade may have a significant impact on participation in and effectiveness of global climate policies such as the Kyoto Protocol. We discuss several policy options to reduce the impact of trade in global climate policy.

One concern is that changed behavior may offset part of the environmental gain. something that has variously been labeled “take‐back” or “rebound.” In energy economics. the rebound effect encompasses both the behavioral and systems responses to cost reductions of energy services as a result of energy efficiency measures. From an industrial ecology perspective. we are concerned about more than just energy use. Any given efficiency measure has several types of environmental impacts. Changes in the various impact indicators are not necessarily in the same direction. Both co‐benefits and negative side effects of measures directed to solve one type of problem have been identified.

Many post-Kyoto frameworks have been debated. but surprisingly approaches that focus on consumption have received little attention in the climate change literature despite broader interest in other areas. In this article we extend the argument for constructing GHG inventories using a country’s consumption rather than production. First. we argue that constructing GHG inventories using a country’s economic activity instead of geographic territory solves allocation issues for international activities such as international transportation and carbon capture and storage.

Many previous studies have unrealistically assumed that imports are produced with the technology of the importing country. For countries with diverging technology and energy mixes the likely errors are significant. This study uses a model that explicitly includes regional technology differences to the case of Norway. It is found that CO 2 emissions embodied in imports was 67% of Norway's domestic emissions. Around a half of this embodied pollution originates in developing countries. yet they represent only 10% of the value of Norwegian imports.

1128533,Life cycle assessment of a floating offshore wind turbine,2009,Jan Weinzettel and Marte Reenaas and Christian Solli and Edgar G Hertwich,34,Renewable Energy,3,742-747,Pergamon,A development in wind energy technology towards higher nominal power of the wind turbines is related to the shift of the turbines to better wind conditions. After the shift from onshore to offshore areas. there has been an effort to move further from the sea coast to the deep water areas. which requires floating windmills. Such a concept brings additional environmental impact through higher material demand. To evaluate additional environmental burdens and to find out whether they can be rebalanced or even offset by better wind conditions. a prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) study of one floating concept has been performed and the results are presented in this paper. A comparison with existing LCA studies of conventional offshore wind power and electricity from a natural gas combined cycle is presented.

The large number of studies applying economy-wide material flow analysis so far mostly produced aggregated national indicators. making the results difficult to connect to policies. which are often designed for single sectors or consumption areas. This paper provides a detailed assessment of the composition of EU’s material footprint in its global context. aiming at identifying the main product groups contributing to overall material consumption and specifying the geographical sources for the raw materials required to satisfy EU’s final demand. Based on multi-regional input–output (MRIO) modeling. we apply production layer decomposition to assess supply chains and their structural changes from 1995 to 2011.

Much of the literature on mitigation pathways addresses technological and economic aspects of feasibility. but overlooks the behavioral. cultural. and social factors that affect theoretical and practical mitigation pathways. We present a tripartite framework that “unpacks” the concept of mitigation pathways by distinguishing three factors that together determine actual mitigation: technical potential. initiative feasibility. and behavioral plasticity.

1128574,Household sharing for carbon and energy reductions: the case of EU countries,2020,Diana Ivanova and Milena Büchs,13,Energies,8,1909,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,As households get smaller worldwide. the extent of sharing within households reduces. resulting in rising per capita energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article examines for the first time the differences in household economies of scale across EU countries as a way to support reductions in energy use and GHG emissions. while considering differences in effects across consumption domains and urban-rural typology. A country-comparative analysis is important to facilitate the formulation of context-specific initiatives and policies for resource sharing. We find that one-person households are most carbon-and energy-intensive per capita with an EU average of 9.2 tCO 2 eq/cap and 0.14 TJ/cap. and a total contribution of about 17% to the EU’s carbon and energy use. Two-person households contribute about 31% to the EU carbon and energy footprint. while those of five or more members add about 9%. The average carbon and energy footprints of an EU household of five or more is about half that of a one-person average household. amounting to 4.6 tCO 2 eq/cap and 0.07 TJ/cap. Household economies of scale vary substantially across consumption categories. urban-rural typology and EU countries. Substantial household economies of scale are noted for home energy. real estate services and miscellaneous services such as waste treatment and water supply; yet. some of the weakest household economies of scale occur in high carbon domains such as transport. Furthermore. Northern and Central European states are more likely to report strong household economies of scale—particularly in sparsely populated areas …,True,eyJAXfwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/8/1909,7045926368243606330,/scholar?cites=7045926368243606330,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/8/1909/pdf,0,0,0

Consumption‐oriented policy measures attempt to cause voluntary or incentivized interventions that reduce environmental impact through the supply chain by utilizing demand drivers. A large body of life cycle assessment studies describe how specific actions can reduce the environmental footprint of an individual or household. However. these assessments are often conducted with a narrow focus on particular goods and processes.

Consumption side changes are likely to be needed to achieve sufficient emission reductions. The United Nations emphasize the importance of developed countries taking the lead in lowering emissions to achieve the sustainable development goals. This paper assess to what extent Norwegian households can lower their carbon footprint consistent with territorial emission reductions towards the 2 °C target of global warming through implementing a set of behavioral actions.

1128598,Environmental Assessment of Aluminium Production in Europe: Current Situation and Future Scenarios,2009,Kjartan Steen-Olsen,,,,,,A multiregional input-output model representing the world in the year 2000 was constructed based on statistical data. and combined with process specific data on a primary aluminium supply chain. to create a model of the global primary aluminium industry. Using input-output methodology. total emissions of eight substances due to primary aluminium production. their size and origins. were estimated and expressed in terms of global warming potential (GWP) and acidification potential (AP). Simulations from 2000 to 2030 were run based on final demand estimates from external GDP projections and three assumed development scenarios. The baseline. scenario 0. assumed no changes in technologies or relative production and trade patterns - only the model's response to the expected change in final demand was analyzed. By contrast. both scenarios 1 and 2 assumed that the additional aluminium production predicted by the baseline would be produced exclusively in China. Scenario 2 employed the added assumption that the Norwegian aluminium production would experience a steady decline from its 2000 level to zero by 2030.  The baseline scenario showed rapidly increasing aluminium output towards 2030. following the expected GDP developments. Emissions followed the same trend. increasing about 3.3 times over the three decades. As for total cradle-to-gate impacts of primary aluminium production. the model showed large variations from one region to another. Emissions per ton of Chinese primary aluminium were high relative to most other regions. hence the total global GWP and AP from primary aluminium production rose more …,True,5zTgrhYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,4,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/233622,5272590112143471955,/scholar?cites=5272590112143471955,,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/233622/347852_FULLTEXT01.pdf?sequence=3,0,0,0

Inspired by the communicative success of the “Ecological Footprint”(EF) introduced by Rees (Rees and Wackernagel 1996; Rees 1992; Wackernagel and Rees 1996) around two decades ago. the term has been transferred to assessments of humanity’s appropriation of freshwater resources. and more recently to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions1. under the terms “Water Footprint”(WF)(Chapagain and Hoekstra 2004; Hoekstra and Hung 2002) and “Carbon Footprint”(CF)(Hertwich and Peters 2009). respectively.All three footprints are important measures of sustainability. The EF measures appropriation of biologically productive land. while the WF measures consumption of freshwater–perhaps the two most fundamental resources available to us. The CF measures our need for another capacity of the earth. namely that of assimilating greenhouse gases in order to keep their atmospheric concentrations more or less stable. to prevent anthropogenic climate change.,True,5zTgrhYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://www.iioa.org/conferences/19th/papers/files/368_20110430091_Steen-OlsenandWeinzettel.pdf,,,,http://www.iioa.org/conferences/19th/papers/files/368_20110430091_Steen-OlsenandWeinzettel.pdf,0,0,0

Traditionally. it is left to the user to transform the purchase of a product into something that fulfils effectively a final-user need. Today. two streams of research–business management and sustainability–normally with very distinct perspectives on the world. have surprisingly converged to form a common conclusion: selling products is old-fashioned business. Companies should switch their focus to selling need fulfilment. satisfaction. or experiences. Or. in other words. selling integrated solutions or product-services. The business management literature argues that. by focusing on the integrated. final-client needs. and delivering integrated solutions fulfilling these needs. companies will be able to improve their position in the value chain. enhance added value of their offering. and improve their innovation potential. In a business world where many products are becoming equally well-performing commodities. this strategy is one of the ways to avoid a sheer competition on price–a type of competition that Europe never can win with emerging and low-cost economies such as China. In that sense. product-services can mean new business for old Europe. The sustainability knowledge stream argues that need-focused solutions could be inherently more sustainable than products. Product-services could offer the value of use instead of the product itself and decrease the environmental load in two ways. First. companies offering the service would have all the incentives to make the (product-) system efficient. as they get paid by the result.

This paper shows the contrary. LCA is a specific elaboration of a generic environmental evaluation framework. EIA is a procedure rather than a tool. in which LCA certainly may be useful. Particularly in strategic and project EIAs. environmental comparisons of process and abatement alternatives may be relevant. Although these alternatives may lead to different emissions and effects at the location of the process itself (which is usually the focus in project EIAs). they can also influence the demand for activities upstream and downstream in the production chain. Including such secondary effects in an EIA. which may be crucial for a proper comparison of alternatives. requires a system approach that takes into account all relevant effects. This is. in fact.

The assessment report identifies priorities amongst global consumption activities. industrial sectors and materials from primary industries in terms of their environmental impacts and their resource use. This can play a role in directing environmental and resource policy to those areas that really matter. Environmental impacts occur at all stages in the life cycles of products and materials. They are often connected to land use. combustion of fuels. industrial processes. The dispersive use of materials (eg. fertilizers). or resource extraction (including biomass and minerals). The report regards also the rapidly increasing international trade and economic activities leading To The translocation of environmental impacts of consumption to other countries.

It can be said that IE has become a major? eld of application for IOA. The broadening of users of IOA from various backgrounds implies a need for a self-contained textbook on IOA that can meet the needs of students and practitioners without compromising on basic c-cepts and the latest developments. This book was written with the aim of? lling this need. and is primarily addressed to students and practitioners of IE.

This paper estimates panel data vector autoregressions for different sectors of the economy to test for bidirectional causality between productivity and both localization and urbanization economies. The aim is to address some key questions that will help to identify the extent of the endogeneity problem. Can we actually observe bidirectionality in the data? Does it feature more for some industries than for others? Is it more prevalent for localization or urbanization economies?

The paper provides new evidence concerning the distance decay of long-distance travel and on the basis of such estimates assesses the potential order of magnitude of agglomeration benefits from improvements to high-speed rail transport in Great Britain. A new methodology assumed constancy of trip decay with respect to equal average travel times but variability with respect to distance. The expected outcome was that improvement in travel times would reduce the extent to which travelers perceived distance as an obstacle to interaction. Although urban economic theory did not preclude the existence of agglomeration benefits across interregional distances. the empirical evidence suggested that the order of magnitude of agglomeration benefits corresponding to 25% and 50% increases in …,True,zd_SXZMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,66,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/2261-02,15067439702052332506,/scholar?cites=15067439702052332506,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42962276/Assessment_of_Wider_Economic_Impacts_of_20160222-10604-1ubgrv1.pdf,0,0,0

To explain the observed spatial variation in the distance–decay of commute trips. we test for the effects of urban structure and transport supply. The results indicate that these factors are important in explaining the observed heterogeneity in the magnitude of the distance–decay gradients.

This paper reports on four nascent ‘new economic’ narratives which represent fundamentally different imaginaries of the urban economy. Experiments informed by these narratives challenge the dominant neoliberal logic in four key dimensions: What is the purpose of economic development? What are the preferred distributive mechanisms? Who governs the economy? What is the preferred form of economic organisation? The emergence of these experiments illustrates that cities are spaces where counter-narratives can emerge and circulate.

Specifically it addresses transformative social innovation (TSI). defined as the process of challenging. altering. or replacing the dominance of existing institutions in a specific social and material context. Social innovation initiatives and networks are understood as the key collective actors that instigate TSI processes. They do not all start out with transformative ambitions however. Of those that do. only a few eventually achieve transformative impacts; indeed there are many risks of capture and co-option along the way. A relational framing is presented as the most suitable way to theorise the emergent and multiply embedded nature of SI initiatives interacting with changing institutions. where organizational and institutional boundaries are often fluid and under negotiation. To develop middlerange theoretical insights on TSI. we conducted an empirical study of 20 transnational social innovation networks and about 100 associated social innovation initiatives over a four-year period. The resulting contribution towards the solidification of a theory of TSI. consists of three layers: firstly. the research design and methodology employed; secondly. a relational framework for TSI that articulates four key ‘clusters’ of (inter) relations in TSI processes; and. thirdly. a solidifying and iteratively developed set of theoretical propositions on TSI processes. These propositions articulate the complex and intertwined process-relations of TSI. based on our study of the empirics.

Research and action for societal transformation. Routledge, London",,12-25,,This chapter argues that current attempts to integrate sustainability goals into a social innovation context must avoid being overly instrumental and focusing only on indicators and valuation metrics that do not capture the complex and systemic nature of the couplings between social innovation processes on the one hand and (processes of) sustainability transformation on the other hand. We introduce the concept of ‘transformative social innovation’as a suitable way of analysing the interactions of social innovation initiatives with the dynamics of sustainability transformations. Using this concept. this chapter explores the nexus of social innovation and societal transformation. conceptualised specifically in terms of sustainability transformations. We use a dynamic framing of sustainability. as processes of sustainability transformation. conceptualised as broad systemic shifts in the dominant structures and institutions of a given societal context that result in a transformation from an unsustainable state of affairs to one in which both environmental limits and goals for human well-being are addressed. We draw upon insights from the transitions research field (Grin et al. 2010; Markard et al. 2012; Rotmans 2005; Van den Bergh et al. 2011) as a basis for conceptualising a sustainability transformation as a dynamic. systemic and contested change process that involves systemic changes in the dominant institutional arrangements within a particular societal context.

Karl Polanyi introduced the concept of a double movement in society. The first movement is towards marketization: the spread of market thinking and market-based forms of allocation throughout society. driven by international trade and naturalist ideas of competition and utilitarianism. The second movement consists of social protection against the negative consequences of that same marketization through state-based social security systems. This second movement has taken several forms. such as the creation of factory regulations (offering protection against work place hazards and worker exploitation). social security of some sort (state-based poor relief and support for the old and sick). and rise of (nationalistic) fascist parties (promising protection from threats to culture or country).In this paper. we argue that Polanyi’s two-movement model is best reformulated as a three-movement model of i) marketization. 2) state-based social protection and 3) the humanization of the economy. The third movement is a countermovement to the first movement and to some elements of the second movement. Like its two cousins. the humanization movement reaches across sectors. and is based on specific organizing principles that shape the characteristics of formal and informal governing institutions. The three movement model helps to make sense of current developments: the rise in humanization initiatives. against the background of marketization and reform of the welfare state.,True,Lzm0f0AAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rene_Kemp/publication/309619499_The_humanization_of_the_economy_through_social_innovation/links/581a507808aed2439386b58f/The-humanization-of-the-economy-through-social-innovation.pdf,3164235583778122348,/scholar?cites=3164235583778122348,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rene_Kemp/publication/309619499_The_humanization_of_the_economy_through_social_innovation/links/581a507808aed2439386b58f/The-humanization-of-the-economy-through-social-innovation.pdf,0,0,0

Yet. there is often a disconnect as emission reductions through individual actions in the important domains of housing and mobility are challenging to attain due to lock-ins and structural constraints.

The aim of the present study is to test the validity of IPIP-50 on a Romanian sample of students. The factor analysis revealed that the model with five correlated factors is the best suited to describe the structure of IPIP-50. The convergent validity was assessed through the correlations between IPIP-50.

Data from 216 students. nested in 48 groups were analyzed using a multilevel modeling approach. Our results show that the experience of relationship conflict leads to a negative shift from the pre-task to the post-task teamwork-related mental models. Moreover. the results indicate that conscientiousness buffered the negative association between relationship conflict and the change in teamwork-related mental models. Our results did not support the hypothesized moderating effect of agreeableness and show that the detrimental effect of relationship conflict on the shift in teamwork-related mental models is accentuated for group members scoring low rather than high on neuroticism.

The present paper presents the adaptation and validation of the CSW Scale (Crocker et al.. 2003) in a Romanian sample of college students (N= 543 students. 59% F). The validation of this instrument involves:(a) analysis of relations with Five-Factor Model of personality (NEO-FFI) and (b) analysis of relations with relevant behaviors (Self Reported Behaviors List). The results obtained through confirmatory factor analysis show that the CSW Scale has an acceptable configural invariance in the Romanian culture. All CSW Scale dimensions reached acceptable levels of internal consistency indices (above. 70 for all factors). The correlations between the CSW Scale dimensions are statistically significant (at p<. 05). supporting the idea of external and internal contingencies of self-worth.

More precisely. the aim of this study is to look at the extent in which academic performance is influenced by internal factors (the student’s dimensions of personality) and by situational factors. As internal factors. we selected the dimensions of emotional stability. conscientiousness and openness to experience of the Big Five model; the chosen situational variables were teacher’s feedback (positive/negative). the perception of teacher’s control (high vs. low level) and the perception of task structure (well-defined vs. ill-defined). A group of second-year students majoring in Psychology. with the average age of 19. has participated in this research. The results show that the perception of well-defined academic tasks. having clear solving strategies. is related to the students’ receiving positive feedback and perceiving a more relaxed control from the teacher; conscientiousness is encouraged by the perception of tight control from the teacher; achievement in academic synthesis tasks increases when students are emotionally stable and receive positive feedback.

Strategies for eliminating housing deficits need to consider the dynamics of the total dwelling stock in order to balance this objective with other goals. such as employment in the construction sector. costs. and environmental impacts. Existing dwelling stock models were developed mainly for developed countries and are not suitable to address housing deficits.

Although nutrition sciences demonstrate that biophysical characteristics determine food requirements in individuals. and medical and demographic studies provide evidence for large shifts in height. weight. and age structure worldwide. the aggregated effects for food demand are poorly understood. Here. a type–cohort–time stock model is applied to analyze the combined effect of biophysical and demographic changes in the adult population of 186 countries between 1975–2014. The average global adult in 2014 was 14% heavier. 1.3% taller. 6.2% older. and had a 6.1% higher energy demand than the average adult in 1975. Across countries. individuals’ weight gains ranged between 6–33%. and energy needs increased between 0.9–16%. Noteworthy. some of the highest and lowest increases coexist within Africa and Asia. signaling the disparities between the countries of these regions. Globally. food energy increased by 129% during the studied period. Population growth contributed with 116%; weight and height gains accounted for 15%; meanwhile. the aging phenomenon counteracted the rise in energy needs by− 2%. This net additional 13% demand corresponded to the needs of 286 million adults.

1128720,Life cycle assessment introduction and overview,2005,Andrea Russell and Tomas Ekvall and Henrikke Baumann,13,Journal of Cleaner Production,13-14,1207-1210,,The concept of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) was developed from the idea of comprehensive environmental assessments of products. which was conceived in Europe and in the USA in the late 1960s and early 1970s [1]. Originally. LCA was used as a tool by environmental consultants. Eventually. it became clear that different LCAs carried through by different consultants resulted in different and sometimes conflicting conclusions [2. 3]. The large differences in the LCA results could be explained. in part. by different methodological choices [4]. Many initiatives were taken to harmonise LCA methodology. These efforts resulted in methodological guidelines. most of which were valid for a specific geographical area [5. 6]. a particular category of products [7e9]. or a particular application of LCA [10e12]. General methodological guidelines were. in some cases. developed on the basis of consensus within a limited group [13. 14]. A recent example is the ‘‘Handbook on Life Cycle Assessment’’. edited by Jeroen B. Guinee. A review of this handbook is included at the end of this issue of Journal of Cleaner Production. Another review also presented in this issue is that of the recent textbook ‘‘The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to LCA’’by Henrikke Baumann and Anne-Marie Tillman. which gives more of an orientation of the existing guidelines. The various guidelines include different and often conflicting methodological recommendations. An effort to reach consensus on a broad. international level was initiated within the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) in 1990 [15]. The harmonisation process soon resulted in the so-called SETAC …,True,bBIqjdMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,105,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/11745/local_11745.pdf,15041193192808191275,/scholar?cites=15041193192808191275,,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/11745/local_11745.pdf,0,0,0
1128721,An evaluative framework for conceptual and analytical approaches used in environmental management,1999,Henrikke Baumann and Sarah J Cowell,26,Greener Management International,,109-122,,In the last 30 years. a number of new approaches for use in environmental management have been developed for use by decision-makers. This paper presents a framework for comparing these approaches based on various methodological features. These include: nature of the approach. type of decision-maker. overall purpose and object analysed. perspective. investigated dimensions. character of the approach. basis for comparison. system boundaries. type of data. and evaluation of results. Use of the framework is illustrated for four approaches: industrial ecology; design for environment; environmental impact assessment; and environmental accounting. The approaches can be used consecutively. or be complementary. competing. encompassing or overlapping in their applications. The research suggests that there is considerable scope for exploring these relationships between and within approaches.

Opting for an empirically based approach to social life cycle assessment,2013,Henrikke Baumann and Rickard Arvidsson and Hui Tong and Ying Wang,17,Journal of Industrial Ecology,4,517-527,,Social life cycle assessment (S‐LCA) has been discussed for some years in the LCA community. We raise two points of criticism against current S‐LCA approaches. First. the development of S‐LCA methodology has not. to date. been based on experience with actual case studies. Second. for social impacts to be meaningfully assessed in a life cycle perspective. social indicators need to be unambiguously interpreted in all social contexts along the life cycle. We here discuss an empirically based approach to S‐LCA. illustrated by a case study of an automobile airbag system. The aim of the case study is to compare the injuries and lives lost during the product life cycle of the airbag system (excluding waste handling impacts) with the injuries prevented and lives saved during its use.

We first present a number of perspectives on this topic from disciplines such as economic geography. management science. sociology and environmental sciences. Each of these approaches brings in a specific focus: the consequences of geographical dispersion of economic activities. measurement of ecological and social impact. managing sustainability in supply chains. and power asymmetry among economic actors. Until now. these disciplinary research lines have remained unconnected. We argue that ecological economics provides a promising background for a more holistic conceptualization.

Results are presented for two scenarios:‘conventional choices’ and ‘green choices’ by the actors.

1128731,Implications of an interpretive understanding of LCA practice,2008,Emma Rex and Henrikke Baumann,17,,7,420-430,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Despite the desirability of a life cycle perspective and many attempts to facilitate life cycle assessment (LCA). industry has been relatively slow to adopt LCA. In this research. we thus set out to investigate the underpinnings of LCA practice in industry. A literature review shows that the present understanding is that ‘structural’ conditions such as location and sector determine the use of LCA in industry. However. a field study of two companies in the Swedish forest product industry (thus in the same sector and country) indicates that LCA practice is shaped more by individual preferences and chance events. Our results imply a more interpretive understanding of LCA practice than has been put forward by previous research. The two types of understanding are discussed and their implications for practitioners in industry. organizations promoting the use of LCA and further research are presented.

We asked whether forests are important for the poor not only because of the kinds of goods and services they provide. but also because they tend to be located where the poor are. We conducted a spatial analysis to ascertain the degree of spatial association between poverty and forests in seven countries: Brazil. Honduras. Malawi. Mozambique. Uganda. Indonesia. and Vietnam. For most of these countries. there was a significant positive correlation between high natural forest cover and high poverty rate (the percentage of the population that is poor) and between high forest cover and low poverty density (the number of poor per unit area).

To explore mitigation strategies systematically. a dynamic material flow model was developed to simulate the stocks and flows of the U.S. aluminum cycle and analyze the corresponding GHG emissions. Theoretical and realistic reduction potentials were identified and quantified. The total GHG emissions for the U.S. aluminum cycle in 2006 amount to 38 Mt CO2-equivalence. However. the U.S. has increasingly relied on imports of aluminum embodied in various products. The in-use stock is still growing fast in most product categories. which limits current scrap availability for recycling and emissions saving. Nevertheless. there is still large emission mitigation potential through recycling.

When the environmental violation is excessive or the violator is a repeat offender. it evolves into environmental crime. Environmental crime is a relatively new concept and is ever changing. To guarantee the safety and security of the public. environmental laws regulate all activities that have a negative effect on human health. harm a community or the environment. The citizens’ exposure to pollution and/or to dangerous wastes is a major public health problem; therefore. public authorities must act as quickly as possible to identify such environmental issues. An early identification of environmental criticalities would reduce citizens’ exposure risks and remediation costs. The most suitable solution to detecting environmental criticalities and preventing environmental crime is targeted and effective environmental monitoring. In this paper it will be shown how our integrated system. which includes aerial platforms and ad-hoc sensors (eg infrared cameras. multispectral sensors. etc.). can be an effective tool to ensure environmental and human safety and security.

In detail. this project will develop a software and hardware platform for image. data and document analysis in order to support law enforcement investigations. The fight against illegal waste dumping is the first objective of the IDES project and the main goal is to develop algorithms for image analysis in order to automatically identify this environmental criticality. The first task is to identify the statistical link between specific features extracted from satellite images or acquired by airborne sensors. possibly in combination with punctual information (results of chemical analysis. physical property measurements. information pertaining to the population). and environmental criticalities (eg illegal dumping. illegal landfills etc). IDES will offer an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) repository of information extracted and collected by various government bodies. Furthermore. an innovative aspect of IDES is the integration between information extracted from remotely sensed images and information extracted from textual documents through a semantic analysis. The results of this last analysis will be a taxonomydriven document searching and browsing system in which all documents are categorized and all relevant entities in documents (eg people. organizations. places and events) are extracted and represented by means of …,True,rWEZ_HAAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,23,https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/wit-transactions-on-ecology-and-the-environment/173/24496,2852643517648725913,/scholar?cites=2852643517648725913,,https://www.witpress.com/Secure/elibrary/papers/SDP13/SDP13050FU1.pdf,0,0,0

In this research. we demonstrate how river plumes can be monitored and analysed by a combination of remote sensing and river basin modelling to estimate their spatial. temporal. and water quality characteristics. Our results show that multispectral remote sensing is able to differentiate the water quality characteristics and two-dimensional spatial characteristics between plumes from four discharge locations along the coast of Campania.

1128801,Illegal dumping investigation: a new challenge for forensic environmental engineering,2012,M Lega and D Ceglie and G Persechino and C Ferrara and RMA Napoli,163,WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment,,3-11,WIT Press,When Italian law enforcement investigates illegal environmental dumping. data must be carefully compiled. analyzed. and validated in order to successfully prosecute the parties responsible. Investigators must be able to produce a validated data-set construction using recognized scientific methods such as random sampling. Chemical/physical analysis. photographs and/or other data with significant details must conclusively demonstrate the pollution source and causal connection between the pollution and observed environmental damage. Authorized officers appointed by the Prosecutor Office to exercise their functions under technical consultant supervision have extensive powers of investigation in relation to illegal dumping. There are a number of investigation tasks that can be carried out at both the place the waste was dumped (‘on-site’) and in the office/lab to catch and deal with offenders. This paper introduces the use of advanced technologies (special aerial platforms. innovative application of thermography and advanced software tools) and new methods and procedures to detect and fight this illegal activity. This is the first known use of these methods in both the fields of environmental research and law enforcement.

We design a novel coordination algorithm combining three biologically inspired processes: stigmergy. flocking and evolution. Stigmergy. a form of coordination exhibited by social insects. is exploited to attract drones in areas with potential targets. Flocking enables efficient cooperation between flock mates upon target detection. while keeping an effective scan. The two mechanisms can interoperate if their structural parameters are correctly tuned for a given scenario. Differential evolution adapts the swarm coordination according to environmental conditions.

The main responsibility of this phenomenon is attributable to the nutrient enrichment. resulting from eutrophication processes of anthropogenic origin. The blooms deplete oxygen in surface waters through excessive bacterial respiration and decomposition and often release toxic substances (cyanotoxins) causing fish mortality and risks for public health. We have initiated a worldwide program for the early detection of cyanobacterial blooms using combined techniques based on chemical/biochemical analyses of samples collected on specific sites identified with remote/proximal sensing tools. Here we report our results obtained from the analysis of cyanobacterial blooms using a new powerful approach based on the combined use of LCMS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry) and Molecular Networking to detect the presence of known and novel cyanotoxins. In addition. we report the most recent results from our case studies on specific coastal areas and lakes. where the presence of cyanobacteria was confirmed to be related to the excess nutrient input of anthropogenic origin. resulting from wastewater discharges or runoff from fertilisers and manure spread on agricultural areas.

Indeed. the acquisition of real field data provides the evidence of the environmental status and identifies hazards and sources of pollution. When environmental pollution is revealed. it is important to identify the source following the source-path-target model. However. when monitoring operations are planned. often the three-dimensional (3D) nature of monitored hotspots is neglected. Instead. information can be gathered through a multi-parametric. multi-level framework. which combines multiple disciplines and generates correlations between several data sets acquired in the analysed scenario. This novel new framework is named MuM3. meaning that the proposed Monitoring (M) is Multi-Disciplinary. Multi-level and Multi-parametric (ie Mu) and it is developed in all the three dimensions of physical space (the superscript ‘3’). This paper outlines the implementation of this framework. In particular. monitoring polluted coastal waters refers to one of the critical areas identified by EIA regu-lations. The framework incorporates different spatial scales of observation (Levels) and the potential sensors that can be used at each Level. A three-step work-flow model describes the raw data acquisition and the transformation and integration of different indicators into useful information for EIA. A schematic flow chart describes the approach to developing multi-level. multi-parameter connections.

The concepts evolved over decades. beginning in the 1950s with Odum’s work on tracing energy flows in ecosystems. During the 1970s. Odum’s attention was drawn to larger scale systems that included the economies of humans and the concept of net energy. In the 1980s. Odum quantified energy quality and defined it as a “donor-based” evaluation technique. In the 1990s. energy quality was further refined and rigorous definitions for “emergy” and “transformity” were given. The units of emergy were defined as solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ) and the units of transformity were seJ/J.

Accounting for the environmental services required to dilute emissions is suggested as an unavoidable step towards correct evaluation of sustainability of processes.

An emergy-based yield indicator decreases by 40–70% coupled to a parallel increase of a loading indicator. when the environmental services required for the dilution of pollutants are correctly accounted for. As a consequence of including environmental services. a lower sustainability is calculated for each investigated process when compared to evaluations that do not include them.

In order to allow a quantitative comparison. two cropping systems. namely 1 ha of corn production in Italy. and 1 ha of willow production in Sweden. are investigated by means of the parallel application of both methods. The case studies are carried out by performing a quantitative inventory of both natural and economic input flows to the investigated cropping systems. Such input flows are then converted into embodied energy (MJ) as well as emergy (seJ) units. Finally. performance indicators representative for each method are calculated.

Human economies are dependent on high quality fossil fuels and will likely continue depending on them for some time to come. Value of a resource is not only what one pays for it. or what can be extracted from it. but also value can be attributed to the “effort” required in its production. In this analysis we apply the emergy synthesis method to evaluate the work invested by the geobiosphere to generate the global storages of fossil energy resources. The upgrading of raw resources to secondary fuels is also evaluated. The analysis relies on published estimates of historic. global net primary production (NPP) on land and oceans. published preservation and conversion factors of organic matter. and assessments of the present total global storages of coal …,True,NNz7FC8AAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,152,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380010006113,10203327198761452322,/scholar?cites=10203327198761452322,,,0,0,0

In São Paulo Municipality. Brazil. the Sorting and Composting Waste Treatment Plant (SCWTP) is suggested as an appropriated way to manage the 14.000 Mg of USW generated daily by 11 million inhabitants in 2010. The argument is that recovering materials from USW is aligned to sustainable development concept. however there is a lack of a deeper sustainability assessment. raising doubts about the benefits received by society on recovering materials. In this sense. emergy accounting (spelled with “m”) suggests to be a good alternative when assessing these benefits under a global scale.

For this edition Odum refines his original theories and introduces two new measures: emergy and transformity. These concepts can be used to evaluate and compare systems and their transformation and use of resources by accounting for all the energies and materials that flow in and out and expressing them in equivalent ability to do work. Natural energies such as solar radiation and the cycling of water. carbon. nitrogen. and oxygen are diagrammed in terms of energy and emergy flow.

Odum’s attention was drawn to larger scale systems that included the economies of humans and the concept of net energy. In the 1980s. Odum quantified energy quality and defined it as a “donor-based” evaluation technique. In the 1990s. energy quality was further refined and rigorous definitions for “emergy” and “transformity” were given.

A comprehensive overview of polyketide biosynthetic genes of the sponge Plakortis halichondrioides and its symbionts was obtained in the present study by massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing of complex and heterogeneous PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) products amplified from the metagenomic DNA of a specimen of P. halichondrioides collected in the Caribbean Sea. This was accompanied by a survey of the bacterial diversity within the sponge. In line with previous studies. sequences belonging to supA and swfA. two widespread sponge-specific groups of polyketide synthase (PKS) genes were dominant. While they have been previously reported as belonging to Poribacteria (a novel bacterial phylum found exclusively in sponges). re-examination of current genomic sequencing data showed supA and swfA not to be present in the poribacterial genome. Several non-supA. non-swfA type-I PKS fragments were also identified. A significant portion of these fragments resembled type-I PKSs from protists. suggesting that bacteria may not be the only source of polyketides from P. halichondrioides. and that protistan PKSs should receive further investigation as a source of novel polyketides.

The main responsibility of this phenomenon is attributable to the nutrient enrichment. resulting from eutrophication processes of anthropogenic origin. The blooms deplete oxygen in surface waters through excessive bacterial respiration and decomposition and often release toxic substances (cyanotoxins) causing fish mortality and risks for public health. We have initiated a worldwide program for the early detection of cyanobacterial blooms using combined techniques based on chemical/biochemical analyses of samples collected on specific sites identified with remote/proximal sensing tools. Here we report our results obtained from the analysis of cyanobacterial blooms using a new powerful approach based on the combined use of LCMS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry) and Molecular Networking to detect the presence of known and novel cyanotoxins. In addition. we report the most recent results from our case studies on specific coastal areas and lakes. where the presence of cyanobacteria was confirmed to be related to the excess nutrient input of anthropogenic origin. resulting from wastewater discharges or runoff from fertilisers and manure spread on agricultural areas.

Indeed. the acquisition of real field data provides the evidence of the environmental status and identifies hazards and sources of pollution. When environmental pollution is revealed. it is important to identify the source following the source-path-target model. However. when monitoring operations are planned. often the three-dimensional (3D) nature of monitored hotspots is neglected. Instead. information can be gathered through a multi-parametric. multi-level framework. which combines multiple disciplines and generates correlations between several data sets acquired in the analysed scenario. This novel new framework is named MuM3. meaning that the proposed Monitoring (M) is Multi-Disciplinary. Multi-level and Multi-parametric (ie Mu) and it is developed in all the three dimensions of physical space (the superscript ‘3’). This paper outlines the implementation of this framework. In particular. monitoring polluted coastal waters refers to one of the critical areas identified by EIA regu-lations. The framework incorporates different spatial scales of observation (Levels) and the potential sensors that can be used at each Level. A three-step work-flow model describes the raw data acquisition and the transformation and integration of different indicators into useful information for EIA. A schematic flow chart describes the approach to developing multi-level. multi-parameter connections.

Fluoride ions displace surficial hydroxyl groups and coordinate surface-bound titanium atoms directly. For 0.01 M fluoride concentration and 0.10 g L-1 of TiO2 in the range pH 2−6. the degradation rate of phenol is up to 3 times that in the absence of fluoride ions. This behavior has been correlated with the computed surface speciation. The decrease in the degradation rate of phenol as a function of the substrate concentration observed in naked TiO2 at a high concentration of phenol (over 0.01 M) is largely diminished in the presence of fluoride ions.

The main focus is regarding the transformation processes that photochemical reactions induce on organic compounds. The relevant reactions can take place both on the surface of dispersed particles and within liquid droplets (e.g. cloud. fog. mist. dew). Direct and sensitised photolysis and the photogeneration of radical species are the main processes involved. Direct photolysis can be very important in the transformation of particle-adsorbed compounds.

Although magnetite naturally contains FeII. the air-exposed oxide surface is fully oxidized to FeIII and irradiation is required to produce FeII. The magnetite + S2O82– system was superior to the corresponding magnetite + H2O2 one in the presence of radical scavengers and in a natural water matrix. but it induced phenol mineralization in ultrapure water to a lesser extent.

The effect of Fe(III) is due to a sonochemically induced Fenton reaction. where both reactants (Fe(II) and H2O2) are sonochemically synthesized. Hydroperoxide/superoxide. generated upon sonochemical processes in aerated solution. is a key species involved in both Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) and in the production of H2O2. The Fenton reaction between Fe(II) and H2O2 then produces hydroxyl radicals. enhancing the degradation of MB. A further enhancement of the degradation of the substrate in the presence of Fe(III) takes place upon addition of H2O2. which is likely to favor the Fenton process. Interestingly.

At pH < 6. extensive mineralization (more than 90%) of the substituted phenols occurs. whereas. at pH 11. organic carbon is persistently observed. Photocatalysis converts 80% of the nitro group in nitrophenols to NO3− through the intermediate formation of NO2− ions; the remaining 20% is transformed into NH4+ ions.

The size and surface area of the particles seemed to be less important. while the FeII/FeIII ratio played some role. Despite the link between magnetite reactivity and its structural FeII content. light-induced reduction of FeIII to FeII was found necessary to promote the Fenton-based reactions.

The process involves the radical SO4–•. formed from S2O82– in the presence of FeII. Although magnetite naturally contains FeII. the air-exposed oxide surface is fully oxidized to FeIII and irradiation is required to produce FeII. The magnetite + S2O82– system was superior to the corresponding magnetite + H2O2 one in the presence of radical scavengers and in a natural water matrix. but it induced phenol mineralization in ultrapure water to a lesser extent. The leaching of Fe from the oxide surface was very limited. and much below the wastewater discharge limits. The reasonable performance of the magnetite/persulfate system in a natural water matrix and the low levels of dissolved Fe are potentially important for the removal of organic contaminants in wastewater.,True,RZ20P8EAAAAJ:HoB7MX3m0LUC,176,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es503741d,14276780773571899191,/scholar?cites=14276780773571899191,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43685216/Activation_of_Persulfate_by_Irradiated_M20160313-4053-dzj6uf.pdf,0,0,0

Four kinds of magnetite were used having different particle size. surface area and FeII content. Different kinetic behaviors were observed. thereby underscoring the strong implications of surface and chemical properties of magnetite. The size and surface area of the particles seemed to be less important. while the FeII/FeIII ratio played some role. Despite the link between magnetite reactivity and its structural FeII content. light-induced reduction of FeIII to FeII was found necessary to promote the Fenton-based reactions.

DOM in groundwater can undergo significant irradiation when drawn to the surface for agricultural purposes. DOM was generally photostable in lake and photolabile in groundwater. with a more elevated rate constant of DOM disappearance in groundwater samples with higher Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC). DOM in lake water became photolabile upon acidification. The parallel decrease of both Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and NPOC suggests that actual photomineralisation took place in the samples. The •OH radicals play a secondary role into DOM photomineralisation in lake water. despite the fact that their generation rate considerably increases at acidic pH.

The selection of the most feasible packaging options is one of the key approaches towards reducing resources depletion and packaging disposal. From an environmental point of view. selection requires knowledge of all product life stages including the type and the amount of materials used and the manufacturing practices such as recycling and reuse.

The high hazard is often associated with high vulnerability deriving from intense urbanization. in particular along the coastline where streams are habitually culverted. The necessary risk mitigation strategies should be applied at the catchment scale with a holistic approach. avoiding spot interventions.In the present work. a high-risk area. hit in the past by several floods and concurrent superficial landslides due to extremely localized and intense rain events. has been studied. A total of 21 small catchments have been identified: only some of them have been hit by extremely damaging past events. but all lie in the intense-rain high-hazard area and are strongly urbanized in the lower coastal zone. The question is what would happen if an intense rain event should strike one of the not previously hit catchments; some situations could be worse or not. so attention has been focused on the comparison among catchments. The aim of the research has been identifying a priority scale among catchments. pointing out the more critical ones and giving a quantitative comparison tool for decision makers to support strong scheduling of long-time planning interventions at the catchment scale.

In May 2008. some areas in Northern Italy were struck by intense and persistent rainfall. In the Cuneo province (Southern Piedmont). floodplain with some urban areas was inundated over ca. ten square kilometres. and the city of Savigliano (about 21 000 inhabitants) was particularly hit by flood. A purposely-made historical research has evidenced approximately fifty flood events as having occurred since 1350 in the Savigliano area. Based upon historical data. both documents and maps. GIS (Geographical Information System) technique and field surveys were used to quantitatively assess the growing urbanization of the city and to describe flood processes and effects over years.

In this paper. a GIS-based approach for analyzing and assessing a simplified landslide susceptibility in the Entella River catchment is presented. Starting from landslide information mainly provided from newspaper articles and unpublished reports from municipal archives. we performed a series of comparative analyses using a set of thematic maps to assess the influence of predisposing natural and anthropic factors. By evaluating the statistical distribution of landslides in different categories. we assigned weighted values to each parameter. according to their influence on the instability processes. A simplified. reproducible. but effective approach to assess landslide susceptibility in the study area was performed by combining all predisposing factors. The resulting scores in proneness to slope instability classes may be used to generate a simplified landslides susceptibility map of the catchment area which would be easy to regularly update every time a rainfall event that is able to trigger shallow landslides occurs; this would provide a useful tool for local authorities and decision makers for identifying areas which could potentially be affected by instability processes. and would help in determining the most suitable measures in land-planning and landslide risk management.

A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the morphological and land use evolution of the Entella floodplain since the 18th century was carried out using base maps and aerial photos ranging from 1758 to 2016. These diverse sources were Geographical Information System (GIS) georeferenced. Additional information on land-use change was gathered from historical documents and recent research reports. The main transformations to the floodplain include morphological changes. eg. narrowing. channelization. displacement of the river channel and the advance of the coastal line due to fills and embankments. In addition. there has been very significant urbanization with loss of vegetated and agricultural areas. Our results indicate the primary role of human disturbance on morphological changes and landscape modifications of the coastal floodplain. particularly over the last 200 years.

D (in h). and rainfall intensity. I (in mm h−1). that presumably caused the landslide events.

Failures involved mainly forested and natural surfaces. and secondarily cultivated and terraced slopes. with different levels of maintenance. Man-made structures frequently characterize the landslide source areas.

Runoff areas were identified in a static modeling framework as a function of prestorm watertable depth and also in a dynamic modeling framework by simulating basin response to 2. 10. and 25 yr return period 6 h design storms. Variable source area expansion occurred throughout the duration of each 6 h storm and total runoff area increased with design storm intensity.

The results showed that per capita. 2.9±0.3 and 4.7±0.5 kg more potatoes per year would enter the Chinese staple-food diet. under the government’s target. PSF consumed are expected to reach 5.2±0.7 Tg yr− 1. equivalent to substituting potatoes for 4.2±0.8–8.5±0.8 Tg yr− 1 wheat and 5.1±0.9–10.1±1.8 Tg yr− 1 rice under different scenarios.

In this paper. we chose Jimei. a coastal peri-urban district of Xiamen city on the southeast coast of China. as a study area to explore the district’s growth dynamics. to predict future sprawl during the next decade and to provide a basis for urban planning. The SLEUTH urban growth model was calibrated against historical data derived from a series of Landsat TM 5 satellite images taken between 1992 and 2007. A Lee-Sallee value of 0.48 was calculated for the district. which is a satisfactory result compared with related studies. Five coefficients of urban growth. diffusion. spread. breed. slope resistance and road gravity had values of 25. 68. 86. 24 and 23. respectively. in 2007. The growth coefficients (ie.. urban character) can capture urban growth characteristics in Jimei district. The urban DNA revealed that. over the study period. urban growth in the district was dominated both by urbanization through establishment of new urban centers. and by expansion outward from existing urban centers. In contrast to interior cities. in which expansions are dramatically shaped by actual road patterns. urban expansion in the district was likely constrained by the nearby coastline. Future urban growth patterns were predicted to 2020 assuming three different development scenarios. The first scenario simulated a continuation of historical urban growth without changing current conditions.

Cropland soils could provide a sink for carbon that can be modified by farming practices; however. they can also act as a source of greenhouse gases (GHG). including not only nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). but also the upstream carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with agronomic management. These latter emissions are also sometimes termed “hidden” or “embedded” CO2.

Italy). The structure comprised two small storage basins for the deposition of tailings from the separation process of the Prestavel fluorite mine. On their downstream sides. the basins were contained by steep earth embankments. whereas upstream they rested directly on the natural slope. The total height from the base of the lower dam to the crest of the upper dam was over 50 m. On 19 July 1985. the front of the upper dam suddenly burst. triggering a vast mudflow (180 000 m 3) that flowed down-channel through Stava. a small village of 20 buildings. The mudflow rapidly traveled over 4.2 km along the Stava Valley and passed through Tesero. before flowing into the Avisio River. The mudflow destroyed many buildings and resulted in 268 fatalities and 20 injuries. From an analysis of the data collected and field observation. several factors may be cited as having contributed to increasing instability. as the upper dam continued to be raised until the disastrous collapse of 19 July. Foremost among these factors is the mistaken assumption that the tailings deposited in the impoundments would consolidate fairly quickly. Indeed. no monitoring system was ever installed to verify the assumed consolidation. Other operational shortcomings and construction errors were contributing factors.

The high hazard is often associated with high vulnerability deriving from intense urbanization. in particular along the coastline where streams are habitually culverted. The necessary risk mitigation strategies should be applied at the catchment scale with a holistic approach. avoiding spot interventions.In the present work. a high-risk area. hit in the past by several floods and concurrent superficial landslides due to extremely localized and intense rain events. has been studied. A total of 21 small catchments have been identified: only some of them have been hit by extremely damaging past events. but all lie in the intense-rain high-hazard area and are strongly urbanized in the lower coastal zone. The question is what would happen if an intense rain event should strike one of the not previously hit catchments; some situations could be worse or not. so attention has been focused on the comparison among catchments. The aim of the research has been identifying a priority scale among catchments. pointing out the more critical ones and giving a quantitative comparison tool for decision makers to support strong scheduling of long-time planning interventions at the catchment scale. The past events' effects and the geomorphic process analysis together with the field survey allowed us to select three sets of parameters: one describing the morphometric–morphological features related to flood and landslide hazard. another describing the degree of urbanization and of …,True,IlkYPiAAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,23,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/19/53/2019/,17051577805423120837,/scholar?cites=17051577805423120837,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/19/53/2019/,0,0,0

In this paper. a GIS-based approach for analyzing and assessing a simplified landslide susceptibility in the Entella River catchment is presented. Starting from landslide information mainly provided from newspaper articles and unpublished reports from municipal archives. we performed a series of comparative analyses using a set of thematic maps to assess the influence of predisposing natural and anthropic factors. By evaluating the statistical distribution of landslides in different categories. we assigned weighted values to each parameter. according to their influence on the instability processes. A simplified. reproducible. but effective approach to assess landslide susceptibility in the study area was performed by combining all predisposing factors. The resulting scores in proneness to slope instability classes may be used to generate a simplified landslides susceptibility map of the catchment area which would be easy to regularly update every time a rainfall event that is able to trigger shallow landslides occurs; this would provide a useful tool for local authorities and decision makers for identifying areas which could potentially be affected by instability processes. and would help in determining the most suitable measures in land-planning and landslide risk management.

A qualitative and quantitative analysis of the morphological and land use evolution of the Entella floodplain since the 18th century was carried out using base maps and aerial photos ranging from 1758 to 2016. These diverse sources were Geographical Information System (GIS) georeferenced. Additional information on land-use change was gathered from historical documents and recent research reports. The main transformations to the floodplain include morphological changes. eg. narrowing. channelization. displacement of the river channel and the advance of the coastal line due to fills and embankments. In addition. there has been very significant urbanization with loss of vegetated and agricultural areas. Our results indicate the primary role of human disturbance on morphological changes and landscape modifications of the coastal floodplain. particularly over the last 200 years.

In the 20-year period from 1980 to 2000 the State set aside 7.400 million euro for flood damage. or roughly one million euro per day. With this study we developed a flood damage estimation model which land administration bodies and insurance companies could find useful in the management of flood-related damage data. The model simulates event scenarios and evaluates expected economic losses. Potential economic loss assessment implies knowledge of the event. exposed asset values and the degree of damage. Following a widely shared simplifying assumption. flood water level was taken as the only factor indicating event magnitude. The model incorporates the following steps: a) event description: definition of flood parameters (flooded area and water level). utilizing real-time measurements or data from event simulation with a hydraulic model; b) asset damage and identification of the affected population; c) evaluation of the degree of damage as a function of event magnitude; d) attribution of an economic value to different exposed assets; e) quantification of economic loss by multiplying economic losses and damage severity.The method could be used either as a forecasting tool to define event scenarios or for “real-time” damage assessment after a catastrophe.

This paper presents an evaluation of the ecological impacts of SHP based on an emergy analysis of a plant located in Guizhou Province in southwest China. The results suggest that periodic downstream drying-up of the river is the largest contributor to the induced ecological impacts in terms of emergy cost. In 2010. the ecosystem service losses caused by downstream ecosystem degradation totaled 2.35E+18 seJ. which accounts for 38% of the total emergy utilized in the annual operation of this plant. If such losses could be avoided. i.e.. if the SHP operated as designed. SHP projects would produce relatively modest impacts on the environment.

China,2011,Lixiao Zhang and Yueyi Feng and Bin Chen,4,Energies,12,2295-2310,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,The establishment of low-carbon cities has been suggested all over the World. since cities are key drivers of energy usage and the associated carbon emissions. This paper presents a scenario analysis of future energy consumption and carbon emissions for the city of Beijing. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model is used to simulate a range of pathways and to analyze how these would change energy consumption and carbon emissions from 2007 to 2030. Three scenarios have been designed to describe future energy strategies in relation to the development of Beijing city. namely a reference scenario (RS). control scenario (CS). and integrated scenario (IS). The results show that under the IS the total energy demand in Beijing is expected to reach 88.61 million tonnes coal equivalent (Mtce) by 2030 (59.32 Mtce in 2007). 55.82% and 32.72% lower than the values under the RS and the CS. respectively. The total carbon emissions in 2030 under the IS. although higher than the 2007 level. will be 62.22% and 40.27% lower than under the RS and the CS. respectively. with emissions peaking in 2026 and declining afterwards. In terms of the potential for reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions. the industrial sector will continue to act as the largest contributor under the IS and CS compared with the RS. while the building and transport sectors are identified as promising fields for achieving effective control of energy consumption and carbon emissions over the next two decades.

This study aimed at analyzing the impact of urban form on UHI in Beijing using TM/ETM images between 1989 and 2010. Spatial analysis was proposed to explore the relationships between area. compactness ratio. the gravity centers of urban land. and UHI. The UHI in Beijing spatially represented a “NE-SW” spindle. The land surface temperature (LST) was higher in south than in north. Urban Heat Island Ratio Index (URI) was well interrelated with urban land area in different zones. Under the similar urban land area condition. UHI and compactness ratio of urban land were in positive correlation. The moving direction of the UHI gravity center was basically in agreement with urban land sprawl. The encroachment of urban land on suburban land is the leading source of UHI effect.

The indicators associated with urban energy consumption show large spatial variance across regions. possibly due to diversities of geographic features. economic development levels and local energy source availability in China. In absolute terms. cities with the highest total energy consumption are mostly distributed in economic-developed regions as Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Area. Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta of China. however. the per capita urban energy use is significantly higher in the Mid-and-Western regions. With regard to the energy mix. coal still plays the dominant role and cities in Mid-and-Western regions rely more on coal. In contrast. high quality energy carrier as electricity and oils are more used in southeast coastal zone and northern developed areas. The energy intensive cities are mainly located in the northwest. while the cities with higher efficiency are in southeast areas. The large spatial variance of urban energy consumption was also verified by the Theil indices. Considering the Chinese economy-zones of East.

1129312,Biometrical methods in quantitative genetic analysis.,1977,Ram Kathin Singh and Bajrang D Chaudhary,,Biometrical methods in quantitative genetic analysis.,,,Kalyani.,"This is a revised edition of a book which was first published in 1977 [see PBA 48. 7199]. It contains extensively corrected calculations. Assuming that these are finally exact. it will be reassuring for the student to obtain the same numerical results as the authors when working through the copious examples. Typographically the book is still untidy and. although some errors have been eliminated. a number of mathematical symbols now appear upside down despite their more conventional presentation in the first edition. Similar carelessness extends to the bibliography. in which entries do not invariably appear in correct alphabetical sequence. Furthermore. the authors cite several important papers of which no trace can be found in the bibliography. The content of the text has been changed little and the challenging statement"" both's' and'n'should be neither odd nor even"" is retained. Short sections have been added on the joint scaling test and the triple test cross. A generalized method for estimating mean squares in line X tester analyses is included. Explanatory footnotes have been added in certain places. especially in the expanded section on the analysis of pooled data. In general. neither statistical rationale nor the assumptions inherent in different methods are discussed. It is conceivable that a student of this book might confidently undertake a path analysis. on the basis of the four-page oversimplified explanation. without any awareness of the work of Sewall Wright. whose name. though cursorily mentioned in the preface. is apparently nowhere to be found in either the text or bibliography.

1129313,Ascorbic acid. vitamin A. and mineral composition of banana (Musa sp.) and papaya (Carica papaya) cultivars grown in Hawaii,2006,Marisa M Wall,19,Journal of Food Composition and analysis,5,434-445,Academic Press,Banana (Musa sp.) and papaya (Carica papaya) cultivars were harvested from different locations throughout Hawaii and analyzed for vitamin C (ascorbic acid). provitamin A (β-carotene. α-carotene. β-cryptoxanthin). and mineral composition. Dwarf Brazilian (“apple”) bananas had almost three times more vitamin C (12.7 mg/100 g fresh weight) than Williams fruit (4.5 mg/100 g). Also.

Before knowing the actual aspects of social media people must have to know what does social media mean? Social media is a term used to describe the interaction between groups or individuals in which they produce. share. and sometimes exchange ideas. images. videos and many more over the internet and in virtual communities. Children are growing up surrounded by mobile devices and interactive social networking sites such as Twitter. MySpace. and Facebook. Orkut which has made the social media a vital aspect of their life. Social network is transforming the behavior in which youthful people relate with their parents. peers. as well as how they make use of technology. The effects of social networking are twofold.[1] On the positive side. social networks can act as invaluable tools for professionals. They achieve this by assisting young professionals to market their skills and seek business opportunities. Social networking sites may also be used to network efficiently. On the negative side. the internet is laden with a number of risks associated with online communities. Cyber bullying. which means a type of harassment that is perpetrated using electronic technology. is one of the risks. In this paper we cover every aspect of social media with its positive and negative effects. Focus is on the particular field like health. business. education. society and youth.

The present study evaluated the influence of installation configuration together with the meteorological parameters on temperature characteristics of a solar photovoltaic array. Three dimensional simulation using Computational Fluid Dynamics was used in the numerical analysis of the temperature characteristics on solar PV arrays. The Shear Stress Transport k-ω model was employed to analyse the turbulent characteristics of the airstream near the photovoltaic array. A temperature prediction model was developed using Artificial Neural Networks and the model was found to be accurate with a coefficient of determination. R2 above 90%. A Response Surface Methodology optimization model was developed to maximize energy generation while minimizing solar photovoltaic cell operating temperature. The models were able to reduce temperature and improve energy generated by 3.9%. The optimized tilt and azimuth angles were found to be 28.2o tilt and 13.2o respectively yielding an average cell temperature of 29.3 oC which gave 3.9% increase in energy and revenue generated.,True,9alF0hUAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-242851/latest,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-242851/latest.pdf,0,0,0

Computational fluid dynamics was used to simulate airflow characteristics leading to the estimation of soiling on the photovoltaic array. The shading effects caused by the deposited dust particles. and the barrier height and position were also investigated. It was found that increasing the barrier height reduces soiling. but it also caused partial shading of the photovoltaic array. thus causing more reduction in the irradiance received. Increasing the barrier distance increased the amount of deposited particles on the collectors due to turbulent eddies forming behind the barrier.

1129369,CFD Analysis of Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer in a Single Tube-Fin Arrangement of an Automotive Radiator,2005,SN Sridhara and SR Shankapal and V Umesh Babu,,International Conference on Mechanical Engineering,,2033-2043,,Power plants in the automobiles are becoming highly power-packed with increasing power to weight and/or volume ratio. Further. the space available under the bonnet is also decreasing due to the ever increasing demand of small cars by the customers. This has lead to the increased demand on the power packed radiators. which can dissipate maximum amount of heat for any given space. The flow behaviour and temperature profile prediction in the radiator tubes are very useful information and is of great importance to the designer. The geometry of the finned-tube heat exchanger is an intricate one and there are no analytical optimization schemes available to optimize their design. while experimental trial and error is far too time consuming. The radiator designs at present depend on the empirical methods. wherein existing experimental data is used as the thumb rules for the design process. However. for any preliminary design the performance of the radiator can be assessed through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in priori to the fabrication and testing. In the current study a tube fin arrangement of an existing radiator is analyzed for evaluating the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics. The overall pressure. temperature and mass flow rate distribution of the coolant and air in and around the single tube-fin arrangement with 32 fins are evaluated.

The enclosure used for flow and heat transfer analysis has been bounded by adiabatic top wall. constant temperature cold vertical walls and a horizontal bottom wall. The bottom wall is subjected to uniform/sinusoidal/linearly varying temperatures. Nusselt numbers are computed for Rayleigh numbers (Ra) ranging from 10 3 to 10 7 and aspect ratios (H/L) 0.5 and 1. Air is taken as working fluid (Pr= 0.7). Results are presented in the form of stream lines. isotherm plots and average Nusselt numbers. It is observed from this study that the uniform temperature at the bottom wall gives higher Nusselt number compared to the sinusoidal and linearly varying temperature cases. The average Nusselt number increases monotonically with Rayleigh number for both aspect ratio 1 and 0.5 for bottom wall and side walls. For the case of aspect ratio 1. the average Nusselt number for a given Rayleigh number increases at the bottom wall compared to aspect ratio 0.5. However. the average Nusselt number increases as the aspect ratio decreases from 1 to 0.5 for side wall except for uniform temperature case.,True,u9K9CfQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,https://www.sid.ir/en/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=315359,3741548196049510191,/scholar?cites=3741548196049510191,,https://www.sid.ir/EN/VEWSSID/J_pdf/112520120206.pdf,0,0,0

A 3-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation model was used with the Shear Stress Transport k-ω turbulence model being employed for wind flow analysis and discrete phase model was used for dust motion prediction. Response surface modelling was used to analyse the relationships between the installation parameters. dust particle sizes and dust deposition. The investigation revealed that in a 3-dimensional simulation. the influence of tilt angle is almost similar to the effect of azimuth angle for multi-storey rooftop photovoltaic arrays. Dust particle size of 100 µm had the most deposition resulting in more soiling compared to the 10 µm size dust particles. Soiling of roof-mounted solar PV modules is less on multi-storey building installations compared to ground-mounted solar PV arrays which experienced 13% more deposition.

This approach is based on the idea of multiple Lyapunov functions together with simple techniques for introducing slack matrices. Unlike some previous approaches based on multiple Lyapunov functions. both the stability and the stabilization conditions are written as linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems.

It is based on a linguistic hierarchical model with multigranular sets of linguistic terms. and the choice of the most suitable set is a prerogative of each expert.

1129439,Multicriteria analysis in decision making under information uncertainty,2008,P Ya Ekel and JSC Martini and Reinaldo M Palhares,200,Applied Mathematics and Computation,2,501-516,Elsevier,This paper presents results of research related to multicriteria decision making under information uncertainty. The Bellman–Zadeh approach to decision making in a fuzzy environment is utilized for analyzing multicriteria optimization models (< X. M> models) under deterministic information. Its application conforms to the principle of guaranteed result and provides constructive lines in obtaining harmonious solutions on the basis of analyzing associated maxmin problems. This circumstance permits one to generalize the classic approach to considering the uncertainty of quantitative information (based on constructing and analyzing payoff matrices reflecting effects which can be obtained for different combinations of solution alternatives and the so-called states of nature) in monocriteria decision making to multicriteria problems.

This new fuzzy Lyapunov function aggregates more information with respect to the membership function variation (time-derivative) via an augmented state vector. This new fuzzy Lyapunov function is not just parametrized by the membership functions variations but it is also based on a polynomial combination of them. To derive LMI based stability condition using the proposed new fuzzy Lyapunov function two ideas are invoked: i) the inclusion of the membership function time-derivative information using a finite number of vectors and. ii) the use of the so-called null term. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the improvements.,True,xCyz0UMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016441364,14498292058553987287,/scholar?cites=14498292058553987287,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a43c/3c61f796b1d89833b72952fad8e131238ff8.pdf,0,0,0

In                     contrast to other manipulation techniques that are typically derived from form                     or force closure constraints. object closure requires the less stringent                     condition that the object be trapped or caged by the robots.

The solution is divided into two parts:(i) the task modeling as a graph whose vertices are geographic coordinates determined in such a way that a single UAV would cover the area in minimum time; and (ii) the solution of a mixed integer linear programming problem. formulated according to the graph variables defined in the first part. to route the team of UAVs over the area. The main contribution of the proposed methodology. when compared with the traditional vehicle routing problem’s (VRP) solutions. is the fact that our method solves some practical problems only encountered during the execution of the task with actual UAVs. In this line. one of the main contributions of the paper is that the number of UAVs used to cover the area is automatically selected by solving the optimization problem. The number of UAVs is influenced by the vehicles’ maximum flight time and by the setup time. which is the time needed to prepare and launch a UAV.

In                     this paper. costs are determined experimentally by navigating the robot through                     the regions and measuring the influence of the terrain on its motion. We measure                     the robot's vertical acceleration. which reflects the terrain roughness. The                     paper presents a hybrid (discrete—continuous) approach to guide and control the                     robot. After decomposing the map into triangular cells. a path planning                     algorithm is used to determine a discrete sequence of cells that minimizes the                     navigation cost.

The approach relies on a global motion planning based on velocity vector fields along with a dynamic window approach for avoiding unmodeled obstacles. Basically. the vector field is associated with a kinematic. feedback linearization controller whose outputs are validated. and eventually modified. by the dynamic window approach.

The basic idea of some of these works is to plan a path. by determining a sequence of neighboring discrete regions of the configuration space. and to assign a vector field that drives the robots through these regions.

Once in the curve. the robot remains circulating along it. The main motivation for this is the control of unmanned airplanes. where the robot cannot converge to a single point. Our control law is based on an artificial vector field that allows for the generalization to time-varying curves defined in n-dimensional spaces.

The solution is divided into two parts:(i) the task modeling as a graph whose vertices are geographic coordinates determined in such a way that a single UAV would cover the area in minimum time; and (ii) the solution of a mixed integer linear programming problem. formulated according to the graph variables defined in the first part. to route the team of UAVs over the area. The main contribution of the proposed methodology. when compared with the traditional vehicle routing problem’s (VRP) solutions. is the fact that our method solves some practical problems only encountered during the execution of the task with actual UAVs. In this line. one of the main contributions of the paper is that the number of UAVs used to cover the area is automatically selected by solving the optimization problem. The number of UAVs is influenced by the vehicles’ maximum flight time and by the setup time. which is the time needed to prepare and launch a UAV. To illustrate the methodology. the paper presents experimental results obtained with two hand-launched. fixed-wing UAVs.

Both simulated data and experimental data collected from a sailplane aircraft are used to illustrate the methods investigated. In both cases the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is employed to determine the biases associated to each accelerometer and gyro in the inertial measurement unit (IMU). together with high sampling-rate trajectory reconstruction from low frequency sampled GPS data. A comparison between UKF and the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) shows that the former outperforms the latter in the presence of high noise level and large initialization error. sensitivity to the tuning of covariance matrices. and joint estimation of IMU bias terms.

The information obtained from these tests helps the validation and improvement of dynamic models used in various stages of design. Among other functions. these models predict the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure. The most common methods for vibration test make use of an electromechanical shaker. This type of driver may cause problems both for the test as to the structure. This paper presents the application of a vibration test methodology using acoustic excitation. It aims at reducing the number of equipment needed to perform the test as well to obtain a form of excitation less intrusive to the structure. The test was performed in a composite wing with known numerical frequencies.

The goal is reduction of flight time required to fly towards an ascending thermal and climb to a given altitude. The optimization procedure applies a direct method to obtain sub-optimal solutions through parameterization of state variables. unlike a previous study by the same authors which was based on control parameterization. A mathematical programming procedure is used to determine the sub-optimal values for the parameterized state variables. The optimal control law. which is necessary for the generation of the sub-optimal state. is obtained through a step-by-step penalty technique.

The solution is divided into two parts:(i) the task modeling as a graph whose vertices are geographic coordinates determined in such a way that a single UAV would cover the area in minimum time; and (ii) the solution of a mixed integer linear programming problem. formulated according to the graph variables defined in the first part. to route the team of UAVs over the area. The main contribution of the proposed methodology. when compared with the traditional vehicle routing problem’s (VRP) solutions. is the fact that our method solves some practical problems only encountered during the execution of the task with actual UAVs. In this line. one of the main contributions of the paper is that the number of UAVs used to cover the area is automatically selected by solving the optimization problem. The number of UAVs is influenced by the vehicles’ maximum flight time and by the setup time. which is the time needed to prepare and launch a UAV.

As limited time is a constraint of interest we cannot search from an infinite number of points. Thus. we propose a multi-objective approach for such search tasks in which we first search for a good set of positions to place the robot sensors in order to acquire information from the environment and to locate the desired object. Given the interesting properties of the Generalized Voronoi Diagram. we restrict the candidate search points along this roadmap. We redefine the problem of finding these search points as a multi-objective optimization one.

1129533,Segregation of multiple heterogeneous units in a robotic swarm,2014,Vinicius Graciano Santos and Luciano CA Pimenta and Luiz Chaimowicz,,,,1112-1117,IEEE,Several natural systems adopt self-sorting mechanisms based on segregative behaviors. Among these. cell segregation is of particular interest since it plays an important role in the formation of tissues. organs. and living organisms. The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis states that cells naturally segregate because of differences in affinity. which lead similar cells to strongly adhere to each other. By exploring this principle. we propose a controller that can segregate a heterogeneous swarm of robots according to the characteristics of each agent. such that similar robots form homogeneous teams and dissimilar robots are segregated.

We consider the problem of multi-robot coverage. where a group of robots has to spread out to cover the environment. We suppose that some robots have poor actuation performance (e.g. weak motors. friction losses in the gear train. wheel slip. etc.) and some have strong actuation performance (powerful motors. little friction. favorable terrain. etc.). The robots do not know before hand the relative strengths of their actuation compared to the others in the team.

The innovation relies on active power estimation. together with the use of a piecewise-continuous nonlinear function. in order to eliminate the need for costly cascaded low-pass filters usually employed to estimate the reactive power. Moreover. the whole scheme is derived in the time domain on a state-space approach. As a consequence. models that are lower order and more amenable to nonlinear analysis are obtained. Simulated results for two UPS parallel operation connected to a resistive load are presented.

Compared to the traditional extended Kalman filter. the UKF does not require the local linearization of the system equations used in the propagation stage. Important results using the UKF have been reported recently but in every case the system equations used by the filter were considered known. Not only that. such models are usually considered to be differential equations. which requires that numerical integration be performed during the propagation phase of the filter. In this paper the dynamical equations of the system are taken to be difference equations—thus avoiding numerical integration—and are built from data without prior knowledge.

Besides giving an overall view of the field. a procedure is proposed and investigated based on the concept of dissipative synchronization between the data and the model. which is very useful in validating models that should reproduce dominant dynamical features. like bifurcations. of the original system.

The proposed heat sink consists of a PCM filled enclosure heated by substrate-mounted protruding heat sources (micro processors). PCMs. characterized by high energy storage density and small transition temperature interval. are able to store a high amount of generated heat; which provides a passive cooling of microprocessors. The advantage of this cooling strategy is that the phase change materials are able to absorb a high amount of generated heat without energizing the fan. The proposed strategy is suitable and efficient for situations where the cooling by air convection is not practical (thermal control of recent multiprocessors computers. for example). The problem is modelled as. two dimensional. time dependent and convection–dominated phenomena.

Particle swarm optimization is then applied on the reduced topology in order to find out the most economical temperature profiles and size of distributed heat pumps.

These technologies include heat pumps. gas boilers. combined heat and power (CHP) plants. solar photo-voltaic (PV) and so on. Some of these technologies couple different energy carriers in which case the independent analysis of each network could lead to unrealistic results. Optimization of heat pumps and CHP plants in coupled electricity and heating network. for example. needs consideration of both networks’ parameters in order to get results that are optimal in both networks. The first step in such optimization process is to have a load flow model (as an equality constraint) for the two coupled networks.

Too little has been done to investigate the effect of different distributed generation technologies on the operational parameters of different energy networks.

This is the case of district heating networks which are becoming more decentralized and where consumers are becoming prosumers. In such 4th generation heat networks a suitable management of the generation facilities is essential to optimize cost and environmental impact. The decision making requires a complete vision on the state of the grid at each instant. For this purpose. communication solutions are vital tools to exchange information from and towards substations. Technologies like LoRa® and SIGFOX are suitable candidates especially when renovating existent networks. These solutions are already used for many applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and require in-depth study of their suitability for monitoring district heating networks. In this paper. we focused on Lora® technology which has the strength of being easy to deploy at low cost and in an unlicensed band but has. in the same time. some limitations like duty cycle and transmission losses.

In the present experimental work. the heat transfer performance testing of some building walls. with or without PCM. is carried out using a reduced-scale cubic room (the test-cell). The cubic cell is heated by an incandescent bulb placed on its centre. and it is housed in an air-conditioned large-scale room that allows to control the ambient air temperature. The effect of the double PCM layer and of its location relatively to the outside surface of the wall is tested and discussed in terms of overall transmitted heat flux and in terms of reduction of the inside and outside surface temperatures. Findings shows that the additional inertia introduced by the PCM leads to a reduced overall heat flux transmission by the wall and to a lesser daily temperature amplitude on the surface of the …,True,5JHi-SMAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,0,https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/abs/2017/10/e3sconf_asee2017_00057/e3sconf_asee2017_00057.html,,,,https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2017/10/e3sconf_asee2017_00057.pdf,0,0,0
1129618,Thermo-economic and environmental assessment of a hybrid solar power plant with a packed-bed thermal storage and a supercritical orc power block,2016,MT Mabrouk and A Kheiri and M Feidt,,,,,HEFAT,In this paper. an optimization-oriented model of a hybrid solar power plant is proposed. The facility is composed of a parabolic trough solar field. a packed bed thermal storage. a fired heater and a supercritical ORC power block. In a first step. all the components of the power plant are sized. In a second step. its operation is simulated over a typical year using irradiance data as input which allows to assess the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and the amount of CO2 emitted per kWh produced. A new analytical model developed by the authors is used to simulate the operation of the heat storage and permits to reduce considerably the computation time. Therefore. the model is suitable to be integrated in stochastic optimization algorithms. Finally. the effects of the solar field size and the storage tank on the LCOE and CO2 emission are investigated and it has been found that the shape factor of the packed bed storage (the ratio between the hight and the diameter) is a very important parameter that affects the impact of the storage integration on the LCOE and CO2 emission levels.,True,5JHi-SMAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,0,https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/62001,,,,https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/62001/Mabrouk_Thermo_2016.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1129619,Modélisation des pertes énergétiques par défaut d'étanchéité dans un moteur de Stirling,2014,Mohamed Tahar Mabrouk and Michel Feidt and Abdelhamid Kheiri,,,,,,L'étanchéité est l'un des problèmes majeurs à résoudre lors de la conception des moteurs Stir-ling. En effet. l'élimination des pertes de gaz entre la chambre de compression et de détente et entre la chambre de compression et le carter du moteur. synonymes de pertes énergétiques. est d'une importance capitale surtout si l'on travaille à de hautes pressions ou avec des gaz légers comme l'hélium ou l'hydro-gène. L'utilisation des dispositifs classiques d'étanchéité augmente considérablement les dégradations d'exergie par frottements et diminue la fiabilité à cause des phénomènes d'usure. Pour ces raisons. le recours à des dispositifs sans contact permettant la diminution de ces pertes est d'actualité. Dans ce travail. nous proposons un modèle dynamique analytique des pertes par fuites de gaz au niveau du « déplaceur » ainsi qu'au niveau piston moteur. Ces fuites sont modélisées en considérant des écoulements pulsés en espaces annulaires. Nous développons des expressions de ces pertes en fonction des grandeurs physiques mises en jeux. Cette démarche est très utile à la modélisation du moteur en vue de l'optimisation de ses rendements. et permet de faire de meilleurs compromis au niveau de sa conception.

Sci,,598-606,,The corrosion inhibition properties of 1-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl) pyridazinium chloride (EOPC) on carbon steel (CS) in sulfuric acid (0.5 MH2so4) solution has been examined and characterized by weight loss. potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The experimental results reveal that the compound has a good inhibiting effect on the metal tested in 0.5 MH2so4 solution. The inhibition efficiency for this compound studied increased with the increase in the inhibitor concentrations to attain 91.67% at the 10-3 M of EOPC. Polarization curves showed that EOPC acted as a mixed-type inhibitor in sulfuric acid. EIS results show that the change in the impedance parameters (Rt and Cdl) with concentration of EOPC is indicative of the adsorption of molecules leading to the formation of a protective layer on the surface of carbon steel. The effect of the temperature on the corrosion behavior with addition of 10-3M of the inhibitor was studied in the temperature range 298-328 K. and the thermodynamic parameters were determined and discussed.
