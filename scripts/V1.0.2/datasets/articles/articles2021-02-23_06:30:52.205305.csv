1092813,AMELIORATION OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL AND ACQUIRED BEHAVIORS. OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKER AND CEREBELLAR HISTOLOGY BY ETHANOL LEAF EXTRACT OF BALAKAT TREE (Ziziphus talanai (Blanco …,2017,Aaron Carl V Tejano and Lourdes Fatima S David and Angelico G Reyes,,,,,,The sensitivity of the brain to various chemicals during critical periods of development can lead to various developmental consequences to the offspring. Exposure to anti-epileptic drugs such as Valproic Acid (VPA) during postnatal development of the brain can lead to aberrations in development congruent with people diagnosed with autism. The combination of oxidative stress. loss of Purkinje cells (PC) in the cerebellum and retardation or regression of neurodevelopmental and acquired behaviors are the diagnostic features of autism pathophysiology. Hence. there is a need to address autism as well as the necessity to find ameliorative agent for autism.,True,lO6BMVYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://biotaph.org/conferences/index.php/conventions/52/paper/view/816/0,,,,,0,0,0
1092814,Amelioration of Motor Behavioral Aberrations and Cerebellar Abnormalities by Ethanol Leaf Extract of Balakat Tree (Ziziphus talanai (Blanco) Merr.) in Valproic Acid Mice Model …,,Aaron Carl Tejano and Lourdes Fatima David and Angelo Bañares,,,,,,Exposure of the brain to Valproic Acid (VPA). an antiepileptic drug. during critical periods of postnatal brain development can lead to motor behavioral and neuroanatomical anomalies congruent with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) in people diagnosed with autism. Loss of Purkinje cells (PC) in the cerebellum and retardation and regression in acquired motor behaviors are the main diagnostic features of autism pathophysiology. Since autism afflicts 4 in 10.000 children globally. there have been ongoing efforts to address autism by means of ameliorative agents such as bioactive compounds from plants. Preliminary phytochemical screening of the ethanol leaf extract of Ziziphus talanai (Balakat tree) revealed the presence of bioactivechemicals with neuroprotective potentials. This study employed 8 mice pups distributed into 4 groups that received the treatments on postnatal day (PND) 14-16: T-received no treatment; T+ received VPA at 400 mg/kg bw; T1 received 400 mg/kg bw of VPA and 300 mg/kg bw ethanol leaf extract of Z. talanai (ELEZT); and T2 received VPA at 400 mg/kg bw and 400 mg/kg bw ELEZT. T+ exhibited retardation in negative geotaxis maturation. regression of acquired skill for mid-air righting reflex. and density reduction in Purkinje cell layer. ELEZT administered at 300-400 mg/kg bw to T1 and T2 have resulted in comparable significant improvements in neurobehavioral retardation and regression and cytological structure of the PC cells in contrast with T+. These results suggest that the ELEZT possesses ameliorative potentials against behavioral aberrations and altered cerebellar histology in VPA-induced postnatal autism in …,True,lO6BMVYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Angelico_Reyes/publication/344464444_Amelioration_of_Motor_Behavioral_Aberrations_and_Cerebellar_Abnormalities_by_Ethanol_Leaf_Extract_of_Balakat_Tree_Ziziphus_talanai_Blanco_Merr_in_Valproic_Acid_Mice_Model_of_Autism/links/5f79731592851c14bcacb7f8/Amelioration-of-Motor-Behavioral-Aberrations-and-Cerebellar-Abnormalities-by-Ethanol-Leaf-Extract-of-Balakat-Tree-Ziziphus-talanai-Blanco-Merr-in-Valproic-Acid-Mice-Model-of-Autism.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Angelico_Reyes/publication/344464444_Amelioration_of_Motor_Behavioral_Aberrations_and_Cerebellar_Abnormalities_by_Ethanol_Leaf_Extract_of_Balakat_Tree_Ziziphus_talanai_Blanco_Merr_in_Valproic_Acid_Mice_Model_of_Autism/links/5f79731592851c14bcacb7f8/Amelioration-of-Motor-Behavioral-Aberrations-and-Cerebellar-Abnormalities-by-Ethanol-Leaf-Extract-of-Balakat-Tree-Ziziphus-talanai-Blanco-Merr-in-Valproic-Acid-Mice-Model-of-Autism.pdf,0,0,0

SC.,Considerando o papel central do ensino de Evolução Biológica para a compreensão da Biologia. este trabalho buscou identificar e analisar os desafios associados ao ensino desse tema. Para isso. foram selecionadas publicações em periódicos da área de Ensino de Ciências e de Biologia (disponíveis no portal de periódicos da CAPES) e trabalhos científicos de cinco edições do Encontro Nacional de Ensino de Biologia. Após a seleção. esses artigos foram submetidos à Análise de Conteúdo. a fim de identificar e debater os desafios no ensino. Finalmente. com base na produção científica da área. explorar alguns caminhos para superá-los. Os resultados deste estudo demonstraram que existe um aumento na produção de publicações na área nos últimos anos. Porém. o aumento no número de estudos e as recomendações dos Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais (PCNs). não necessariamente modificam a realidade das Instituições de Ensino (IEs).

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between high school student’s understanding and acceptance of biological evolution currently. and their understanding and acceptance of biological evolution after instruction of evolutionary biology. It can be determined that. despite a student’s personal beliefs. that a student can improve their knowledge of evolution and change their level of acceptance of biological evolution.

These venues provide endless unscientific and uncritical support for these treatments. Most of these alleged cures come from anecdotal evidence and rarely point to a scientific study supporting their claims in vivo; however. overwhelmingly there are enumerable postings pointing to resources on the internet. The internet is an attractive location to quickly look-up information about almost anything today. At least 6.75 million global searches are done each day on health-related issues (Eysenbach. 2003). How much of that information is scientifically accurate? When one types in “natural cancer cures” in the google. com search engine. they will immediately get results providing alleged natural cures for cancer. There are no listed results nor sponsored ads which represent a critical look at the claims of these Natural Cancer Cure and Treatment practitioners. This lack of accessibility to contrary information can be a danger to public health interests as most consumers have difficulty distinguishing pseudoscience. poorly done science. and good science.

1092832,An Analysis of Dangers and Health Benefits from the Consumption of Golden Rice,,Reginald V Finley Sr,,,,,,Rice is one of the chief foods produced and consumed around the world with over 481.21 million metric tons of rice consumed each year (Statista. 2015). Even though the availability of rice is high. vitamin deficiency continues to plague underdeveloped and at-risk populations (Gain. 2015). Vitamin A deficiency. in particular. affects 33% of impoverished people globally (WHO. 2009). A lack of sufficient vitamin A can be quite serious as it can cause blindness in children. weaken immune systems. and can also affect developmental growth (Johnson. L. 2009). According to Black. et al (2008). 670.000 children under the age of 5 die each year from Vitamin A deficiency.A solution to reduce the risk of vitamin deficiencies has been to fortify foods. usually artificially. to provide the nutrients that a body needs for good health. Honein. et al. 2001. produced a study showing how fortifying the US grain supply with Folic acid helped reduce incidences of neural tube defects by 19%.

How does this receding of ice affect organisms that depend on this ice?Conservationist groups argue that these drastic changes in the northern latitudes are negatively affecting entire ecosystems (NRDC. 2015).

1092835,Issues in Science and the Public Study,,Reginald V Finley Sr and Xiufeng Liu,,,,,,There is a lot of focus on the Public Understanding of science (PUS); and rightly so. but there is not as much focus on the Public Acceptance of Science (PAS). This is evident in the fact that most 5-12 schools are educated with regard to evolutionary biology and are even tested on the material; however. the statistics show us that most students after graduation. still do not fully accept its veracity (Cavallo. 2008). This is deeply concerning and may contradict the popular idea that more science understanding is what is needed to create a more literate society. It appears that one can obtain the science knowledge. while simultaneously. completely rejecting the science knowledge.As we can see. understanding and acceptance are not mutually inclusive terms. One can exclude the other. In another example. one may understand the geological processes with regard to sedimentation. but may reject the idea that organisms found in these million year old layers evolved (Wise. 2012).

1092861,Variations in access to domestic water supply in EN Nahud district. Sudan,1991,Helen Frances Wood,,,,,,The central aim of this thesis is to develop an understanding of variation in access to domestic water supply in a semi-arid. non-riverain area of Sudan. En Nahud District. in North Kordofan Province. was selected for study because it has existing water supply problems and contains distinct spatial variations in geology. which affects the potential for development of underground water resources. Fieldwork in Sudan was carried out between July and December 1988. and information was collected from a range of sources using a variety of methods. The latter included: semi-structured household interviews conducted with women; key informant interviews; observation; and various published and unpublished articles and data sets. In the thesis. the first chapter introduces the national and international context of this study. Past and present water supply development policies and projects in the Sudan are outlined. and set against the goals of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade. In the second chapter. the research methodology is discussed. Attempt was made to overcome the several spatial. temporal social and economic biases which have occurred in other studies. In the third chapter. the thesis is placed in the physical and socio-economic context of the Province. and the dynamic relationship between water supply and demand is outlined. The following three chapters focus upon the primary constraints which limit access to domestic water supply: water availability; at-source costs; and transportation costs. The components of each. and the way in which they operate to restrict access. are investigated in relation to varying …,True,u2GqQmoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/6195/1/6195_3549.PDF,,,,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/6195/1/6195_3549.PDF,0,0,0

Some dendrobatid frogs seasonally migrate between the leaf litter of the forest floor in the dry season to the canopy in the wet season. which may yield differences in prey (arthropods) and therefore alkaloid availability over space and time. Here. we document a seasonal vertical migration of Andinobates fulguritus (the yellow‐bellied poison frog) from ground to canopy between dry and wet seasons. We observed turnover in alkaloid composition between seasons and found that dry season frogs contained a lower relative quantity of alkaloids; however. there was no change in alkaloid richness between seasons. The 77 alkaloids of 13 structural classes identified in this population appear to be derived mostly from mites and ants. though the two most common alkaloids were mite derived.

The use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) has been suggested as a reliable method for OA treatment owing to their potential to differentiate into several cell lines and their self-renewal and repair capacity. The present study aimed to assess ADSCs in combination with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of a patient with knee OA.A 53-year-old man with OA was selected for this treatment. The human abdominal subcutaneous adipose sample was obtained from the patient with knee OA. Stem cells were obtained from adipose tissue of abdominal origin by digesting lipoaspirate tissue with collagenase. ADSCs were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fasting blood sugar (FBS). Moreover. ADSCs were expanded and characterized by flow cytometry. These stem cells. along with PRP and calcium chloride. were injected into the right knee.

Although the invention of the method of surgery with autologous chondrocyte transplantation. developed tools to treat the cartilage lesions. it couldn’t gain a great success due to problems such as damage to the area of donation. Using the mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose and culturing and differentiating them on scaffolds was considered appropriate as a successful research and clinical strategy.Materials and Methods: In the present study. the mesenchymal stem cells were separated from adipose tissue and cultured in two scaffolds of fibrin glue and alginate medium. After 1. 7 and 14 days of cell differentiation. the survival ability of the differentiated cells were analyzed by Chondrogenic MTT. Moreover. type I and II collagen. aggrecan and Sox9 expression were measured via real time-polymerase chain reaction. In addition. cartilage reconstruction on scaffolds was shown by a histological investigation.Results: Our results showed that the expression of CD90 and CD105 as mesenchymal markers is at a high level whereas the expression of CD34 and CD45 reaches a low level. The LSD test demonstrated that there was no remarkable difference among the chondrogenic MTT. scaffolds groups and control in 7 and 14 days after cell differentiation (p< 0.05). although. fibrin glue had the highest expression in chondrogenic gens.Conclusions: Finding suggests that in order to utilize a new strategy for tissue regeneration utilization of inherent scaffolds such as fibrin glue can act as a protector for mesenchymal stem cells.,True,R4YjrC8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://18.194.240.220/index.php/IJML/article/view/1403,,,,https://18.194.240.220/index.php/IJML/article/download/1403/997,0,0,0

1092896,Animal Consciousness,2016,Chiara Marrapodi,,,,,,The Equine Assisted Psychotherapy & Learning (EAP/L) profession is a fairly recent development and spans both the equine industry as well as the mental health (psychology) profession. The Cambridge Declaration of Animal Consciousness was seen as a ‘boost’in the profession. validating what many people had been saying regarding sentience and consciousness in animals. However. this has led to anthropomorphic misunderstanding of the animal. I assert the underlying issue is that mainstream biological science has not completely come to terms with human consciousness nor can scholars completely agree on a definition of consciousness. so it is paradoxical to assign a human level of consciousness to a broad range of animals on a comparative basis without first having a concrete definition of consciousness in humans. Philosophically. the question remains–is it even possible to really know what consciousness is? I do not believe this is possible within a Cartesian-based science. However if we approach the subject from within Goethean science. a comparative understanding of consciousness can be initiated–one that is beneficial across species boundaries and one that gives meaning to the term consciousness.,True,73tGoqwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/44630946/Journal_Vol_1_Issue_2_2016.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44630946/Journal_Vol_1_Issue_2_2016.pdf,0,0,0

Furthermore. the potential for trauma and stress related psychopathology in animals is examined. More specifically. whether animals may suffer from symptoms of PTSD. This investigation is extended to equines (Equus caballus). As a species equines have been most valuable to humanity and yet there is a paucity of psychological research relating to trauma and stress in their midst. It is with this in mind the author is presenting an introductory examination of equine stress and trauma.

1092901,Homeward bound: A population study on Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Capilano River,2017,April Houweling and Juhui Lee and Miji Lee and Denée Nickel,7,The Expedition,,,,The decline of Pacific salmon populations on the west coast of Canada has been observed for decades. Hatcheries are used as one solution to this issue. however the benefits and detriments of releasing hatchery-grown salmon into the wild are widely debated. We investigated the release and return numbers of Chinook salmon. Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. at the Capilano River Hatchery in North Vancouver. British Columbia. This study focuses on:(1) establishing whether or not there is a declining trend in the number of returning Chinook salmon over the past seven years. and (2) deciphering the survival rate of a population of salmon. Data was collected by counting the returning Chinook salmon over 10 trials of one hour each. We calculated daily average as well as the use of the release and return data of previous years at the Capilano River Hatchery. The returning rate of Chinook salmon over the past seven years displayed a declining trend until the input of our data. which may be a result of unaccounted environmental factors. such as river height. The return numbers for the 2010 population of Chinook salmon was less than 1.28% in comparison to the amount of salmon released (98.1%). When comparing 2010-2016 return numbers per year. there was no significant effect on returns (z= 0.864. df= 6. p= 0.3875). but there was a significant effect of both Sea Surface Temperature (SST)(z= 2.343. df= 6. p= 0.0191) and an interaction between year and SST (z=-2.338. df= 6. p= 0.0194) on return numbers.

The 2nd Threonine within the TTVGYGD sequence of Kv-channels (2T) could be a key component for this allosteric coupling [1].

Kv 2.1 and Kv3. 1). the Shaker as well as the KcsA channels. from entering the (OI). Prolonged depolarization or pH activation causes Kv and KcsA channels respectively to enter (OI). However. the T to A substitution yielded noninactivating channels that instead displayed a second (slow) activation process. which suggested the conversion of the (OI) into a second conductive state (O2).

We trapped two parcels of land planted in warm season perennial grasses between September 2011 and October 2013 in order to obtain a census of the mammal populations residing upon the property and to determine the impact (if any) of the change in agriculture. During the first year of the study. a seemingly inhospitable (urban) agricultural area revealed a diverse population of inhabitants. The second year of trapping resulted in the capture of 2 new species (total of 7 species captured) and the noticeable absence of 1 species; a distinct shift in mammal populations had been observed. There was an inverse relationship between the population increase of Peromyscus maniculatus during 2012 and the decline in the population of Peromyscus leucopus. When a Chi-square test was run (P< 0.05). the hypothesis of competitive exclusion appeared to be supported. In the third year. population numbers of Peromyscus maniculatus had also plummeted.

The hybrid lines of uncertain type II cultivars are selfed. and crossed with two type I testers. green Dolly Varden and W1A. to obtain hybrids. These are now crossed with white Flower of Spring. as source of mutant plastids. and the embryos scored. The three hybrids are all different. one is double heterozygote. Pr1pr1. Pr2pr2 and the other two are single heterozygote for opposite genes. Pr1Pr1. Pr2pr2 and Pr1pr1. Pr2Pr2. From one hybrid. a single true-breeding double dominant Pr1Pr1. Pr2Pr2 is raised. From many single heterozygotes. the male plastids are transmitted with high frequency. although with others the female plastids are favoured. The analysis confirms the importance of the two genes Pr1 and Pr2 controlling biparental plastid inheritance. and in particular the value of the two testers in isolating all type IIs.

Chlorophyll is one of the factors that can affect palm oil production. There are several other factors that affect the productivity of oil palm plants. namely climate. territorial shape. soil conditions. planting material. and cultivation techniques. Altitude (altitude) is one of the outside factors that affect production. Differences in altitude cause differences in productivity so that production data need to be analyzed and compared. Height differences cause differences in productivity so production data need to be analyzed and compared. This research was conducted in the Bah Birung Ulu PTPN IV in April-June 2018. This study aims to determine the effect of altitude in the highlands area the effect of the amount of leaf chlorophyll on the production of oil palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.). The method used is descriptive analytic method by processing secondary data (LM 76) and take leaf samples and measure chlorophyll content using chlorophyll meters. The results showed that in the highlands (Kebuna Bah Birung Ulu) had the highest production in 2006. amounting to 22.976 Ton/ha/year. The highest amount of chlorophyll of palm oil was found in the 2005 planting year. which was 80.5 CCI. The largest production of oil palm is in the 2006 planting year of 22.976 Ton/ha/year with 3.148 mm/year of rainfall.,True,ClpMvzkAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://ejurnal.stipap.ac.id/index.php/JAE/article/view/135,,,,https://ejurnal.stipap.ac.id/index.php/JAE/article/download/135/87,0,0,0
