1304199,Impact of energy efficiency measures on the economic value of buildings,2012,Daniela Popescu and Sven Bienert and Christian Schützenhofer and Rodica Boazu,89,Applied Energy,1,454-463,Elsevier,A main objective of energy policies is to make all levels of the society. from governments to citizen. interested in increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. One of the most important barriers in implementation of energy policies is that the cost of potential energy savings. typically considered being the only financial benefit. does not sufficiently motivate investments. The target is therefore to identify further possible drivers pushing positive reaction according to energy saving action.The paper discusses whether a market-based instrument. capturing the increase of the economic value of energy efficient buildings. can be also used. Methods that quantify the added value due to energy performance. including recommendations on how they can be incorporated in the financial analysis of investments in weatherization. are developed.

District heating contributes to higher energy efficiency. greater security of supply and lower carbon dioxide emissions. There is a need to strengthen the competitiveness of this technology. Important differences between Eastern and Western district heating systems exist not only regarding the level of modern equipment. but also in the conception of design and operating.In most Western European countries. the entire district heating system is demand driven. using control equipment at four independent levels: two at the customer and two managed by the district heating operator. Each building usually has separately regulated systems for supplying heat to the radiators (space heating). to the domestic hot water system and to the ventilation system. The main advantage of this concept is that customers establish the space heat demands by means of thermostatic valves. at the first level of the heat demand control. without the risk that the District Heating Company delivers more or less heat than necessary. In most Eastern European countries. the mentality is different: the District Heating Company evaluates the quantity of heat for each building and delivers it through a distribution network to substations. A number of 20-30 buildings. usually blocks of flats. are connected to the substation and must share the quantity of heat delivered. Only few consumers can adjust the quantity of consumed heat. using thermostatic valves. and the others are forced to receive the rest.,True,R1SQY9IAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,8,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florina_Ungureanu/publication/266268355_Simulation_of_Consumption_in_District_Heating_Systems/links/54d31edf0cf2501791816f8d/Simulation-of-Consumption-in-District-Heating-Systems.pdf,13266633757238511137,/scholar?cites=13266633757238511137,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Florina_Ungureanu/publication/266268355_Simulation_of_Consumption_in_District_Heating_Systems/links/54d31edf0cf2501791816f8d/Simulation-of-Consumption-in-District-Heating-Systems.pdf,0,0,0

Mini-scale hydropower installations are environmentally-friendly technologies. unlike large hydroelectric power plants that have certain drawbacks from the environmental point of view. A safe and clean solution is the cross-flow turbine. but the commercial types require a minimum head. usually captured by additional hydro-technical works that can also damage the environment. In this context. a very good solution could be a low head turbine that has no adverse environmental impact. since no water storage is necessary. The objective of this paper is to investigate a cross flow pico-turbine prototype. in order to verify whether. when well designed. such a turbine can operate with good efficiencies at very low heads.

1304230,Experimental and numerical determination of thermohydraulic properties of regenerators subjected to oscillating flow,2011,Sandro Schopfer,,,,,,Regenerators are key components in many thermal devices such as Stirling cryocoolers. magnetic refrigeration devices etc. They act as temporal thermal energy storage and therewith separate two thermal reservoirs. Regenerators are typically made up of porous structures referred to as the packing material that can lead to complex flow pathways of the heat transfer fluid through the regenerator. The nonisothermal and periodically reversing flow type allows for thermal energy exchange with the packing material of the regenerator. The performance of such devices depends greatly on the geometry of the porous structure. itsmaterial properties. length scales involved as well as operating conditions. This thesis is a study of thermohydraulic properties of thermal regenerators under oscillating flow conditions. In the first part of this thesis. thermodynamic models are developed for the extraction of the friction factor and Nusselt number from an experiment based on a harmonic approximation technique. These models are verified using a two dimensional pore scale model that allows to calculate friction factor and Nusselt number on a theoretical basis independent from an experiment. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the application of the models presented in part one to an experiment. A test apparatus that allows to measure temperature and pressure drop for various types of regenerators is presented. The measurements for a microchannel and packed bed of spheres regenerator are characterized using spectral analysis.

Switzerland,2019,Liliane Ableitner and Arne Meeuw and Sandro Schopfer and Verena Tiefenbeck and Felix Wortmann and Anselma Wörner,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.07242,,,,Prosumers in many regions are facing reduced feed-in tariffs and currently have no possibility to influence the level of remuneration for the locally produced solar energy. Peer-to-peer communities may offer an alternative to the feed-in tariff model by enabling prosumers to directly sell their solar energy to local consumers (possibly at a rate that is beneficial for both consumer and prosumer). The Quartierstrom project investigates a transactional energy system that manages the exchange and remuneration of electricity between consumers. prosumers and the local electric grid provider in the absence of intermediaries. This whitepaper describes the prototypical real-world system being implemented in the town of Walenstadt. Switzerland. with 37 participating households. The community members of this pilot project pay a reduced tariff for grid usage if the electricity produced by a prosumer is sold to another community member. which is located on the same voltage or grid level downstream a substation1. Such a tariff structure incentivizes local balancing. ie locally produced energy can be consumed locally whenever possible to avoid costs from higher grid levels. The blockchain is a novel technology suitable to log the produced and consumed units of energy within a community. making it possible to implement market places. In those marketplaces. both prosumers and consumers can indicate a price at which they are willing to sell/buy locally produced solar energy without the intermediation of a utility.

Moreover. it is unclear which type of information smartphone apps should transport to consumers and if there are any customer segmentation criteria for smartphone app design. With respect to the theoretical and managerial importance of recommendation services in the form of smartphone apps we want to shed some light on this topic. Combining literature from the fields of IS and marketing research. we hypothesize that personalized recommendations via smartphone apps can help to boost sales in physical grocery stores. Furthermore. we hypothesize that additional popularity information (in the form of “stars”) does not amplify the positive effect of personalized recommendations. In addition. we assume that the effects of recommendation usage differ for men and women. We conducted a field study with a European grocery retailer to test our hypotheses.

1304237,Assessment of the consumer-prosumer transition and peer-to-peer energy networks,2019,Sandro Schopfer,,,,,,Technical advances and the decreasing costs of photovoltaic (PV) and battery (B) systems are key drivers for the consumer-prosumer transition. and crucial components in many countries' energy strategies for reducing the emission intensity in energy systems and supporting the phase-out of nuclear energy generation. The build-up and expansion of solar capacities in response to the gradual reduction of electricity generated from fossil or nuclear fuels leads to an increasingly decentralized energy supply system. which consists of many small utility- and residential-scale generators spread across a service area alongside larger centralized power plants that compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. Consequently. the decentralization of the energy system also implies a shift from large (mostly publicly owned) investors in centralized power stations to smaller. private investors in small-scale PV systems. During the past decade. remuneration rates for PV systems in many countries have been continuously reduced in response to falling PV module costs. In some service areas. the remuneration rate is considerably less than the retail rate for energy. making it more attractive to self-consume a large share of the generated electricity. Self-consumption is defined as the share of the annually generated energy that can be directly consumed by the prosumer. The fraction that cannot be self-consumed is injected into the grid at a remuneration rate. The achieved rate of self-consumption is an important factor that influences the profitability of photovoltaic battery (PVB) systems and depends (among other factors) on how well the load …,True,xNIs4u4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,3,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/341266,7704424356206691410,/scholar?cites=7704424356206691410,,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/341266/1/PhDThesisFinalSAN_researchCollection.pdf,0,0,0

1304282,Frameworks. Practices. Mentors. Norms: What Shapes Public Managers?,2013,Elisabeth Graffy,73,,2,289-290,Wiley-Blackwell,Stivers (2008) and Thompson (2010) argue that the ethical norms that emerged during the past century—concurrent with the evolution of public administration as a field—favor social ideals and practices that align with scientific rationality. individualism. reductionism. specialization. and efficiency. These prevailing norms tear at a natural sense of connectedness. undermine collective forms of governance. and foster alienation. The inference here is that administrative frameworks that perpetuate these underlying norms undermine waves of reform aimed at stimulating more engaged. connected government and citizenship.This is precisely the notion of what Durant and Ali call “pentimento.” where old ways of thinking infuse new practices and produce no real change. When widespread civic entrepreneurship to address democratic deficits in government (see Warren 2009) leaves estrangement little improved or worse. as the authors claim. established norms may simply be profoundly at odds with those new practices. The same tension seems to apply to wicked and sustainability governance problems for which interdisciplinarity and engagement are also prescribed (Batie 2008; Graffy 2012). Citizen trust and administrative legitimacy may need to be fundamentally damaged before opportunities for extensive. innovative. and meaningful collaboration emerge (see Moynihan 2003).,True,iYV_BTAAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisabeth_Graffy/publication/260138649_Frameworks_Practices_Mentors_Norms_What_Shapes_Public_Managers/links/59ee3509aca272029ddf67c6/Frameworks-Practices-Mentors-Norms-What-Shapes-Public-Managers.pdf,3799861620839261574,/scholar?cites=3799861620839261574,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisabeth_Graffy/publication/260138649_Frameworks_Practices_Mentors_Norms_What_Shapes_Public_Managers/links/59ee3509aca272029ddf67c6/Frameworks-Practices-Mentors-Norms-What-Shapes-Public-Managers.pdf,0,0,0

Our scenario reduction heuristic leads to choosing very similar expansion decisions as does a standard scenario reduction method. but the overall computation time for reducing the scenario set and solving the reduced problem is substantially lower.

Inc.,Interest in renewable energy sources derived from plant biomass is increasing. raising concerns about fuel vs. food competition. One strategy to produce additional cellulosic biomass without reducing food‐harvest potential is to grow winter cover crops after harvest of the primary summer crop.

In contrast to marginal land. which refers to a set of biophysical and economic criteria usually imposed by experts or policymakers. the designation of ACL refers to a land-use decision by a land owner. As such. ACL is argued to be a more appropriate indication of land availability for dedicated energy crop production.

The investigation is undertaken in two categories: same inner heat transfer area and aperture area (case I) and same aspect ratio and aperture area (case II). These studies are carried out for five isothermal wall temperatures (523 to 923 K in steps of 100K). The effect of inclination is studied for seven inclinations from 0 (cavity aperture facing sideways) to 90 (cavity aperture facing down). in steps of 15. The cavity shapes used are: cylindrical. conical (frustum of a cone). cone-cylindrical (combination of frustum of cone and cylindrical shape). dome-cylindrical (combination of hemispherical and cylindrical shape). hetro-conical. reverse-conical (frustum of a cone in the reverse orientation) and spherical. For both cases. conical cavity yields the lowest convective loss among the cavities investigated whereas spherical cavity results in the highest convective loss. Convective heat loss from cavities of different shapes and sizes are characterized by using different internal zone areas of the cavity (Acw. Acz. Acb and Aw). Acb is found to be better parameter for characterization of the convective heat loss. Nusselt number correlation is developed using convective zone area (Acb).

Convective heat loss is found to decrease for cavities having mouth blockage created by reducing aperture area (case I) whereas it enhances when mouth blockages are introduced by increasing the cavity dimensions and keeping the same aperture area (case II). Convective loss is characterized by using the convective zone area (Acb). Conical cavity yields the lowest convective loss whereas hetro-conical cavity gives the highest convective loss among different shapes investigated. Radiative loss is independent of cavity inclination and is found to be nearly constant for all cavity shapes and cavity configurations (with or without mouth blockage) so long as the aperture area remains the same; it is proportional to the aperture area.

WA (United States),Building energy codes have significantly increased building efficiency over the last 38 years. since the first national energy code was published in 1975. The most commonly used path in energy codes. the prescriptive path. appears to be reaching a point of diminishing returns. The current focus on prescriptive codes has limitations including significant variation in actual energy performance depending on which prescriptive options are chosen. a lack of flexibility for designers and developers. the inability to handle optimization that is specific to building type and use. the inability to account for project-specific energy costs. and the lack of follow-through or accountability after a certificate of occupancy is granted. It is likely that an approach that considers the building as an integrated system will be necessary to achieve the next real gains in building efficiency. This report provides a high-level review of different formats for commercial building energy codes. including prescriptive. prescriptive packages. capacity constrained. outcome based. and predictive performance approaches.

1304359,Impact of ASHRAE Standard 169-2013 on building energy codes and energy efficiency,2016,Rahul Athalye and Todd Taylor and Bing Liu,6,Proceedings of SimBuild,1,,,A more recent period of weather data published in the ASHRAE 2009 Handbook of Fundamentals was used in developing ASHRAE Standard 169-2013. The new Standard remapped counties to climate zones based on the new weather data. More than 400 counties out of a total of over 3.000 in the US were reassigned to different climate zones and most of the counties were reassigned to warmer climate zones. Many code requirements. such as for wall insulation. are less stringent in warmer climate zones. Thus. when a county is reassigned to a warmer climate zone. new buildings built in that county are likely to be less energy efficient than before. The new county-to-climate zone mapping in ASHRAE Standard 169-2013 has been adopted by Standard 90.1 and may be adopted by other codes and standards as well. In this paper. we present the impact of changing the county-climate zone mapping on energy codes and building energy efficiency in the country. The analysis shows that adopting the new county-to-climate zone mapping in ASHRAE Standard 169-2013 results in an overall weakening of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 at the national level while the impacts at the state level can be dramatic. as there are several states where large population centers are reassigned to a warmer climate zone.,True,3I9z1xIAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC,7,http://www.ibpsa-usa.org/index.php/ibpusa/article/download/389/375,8171579829704926642,/scholar?cites=8171579829704926642,,,http://www.ibpsa-usa.org/index.php/ibpusa/article/download/389/375,0,0,0

Each retro-commissioning measure is evaluated against the original baseline in terms of its potential for energy and cost savings. while each retrofit measure is evaluated against the commissioned building. All measures are evaluated in five locations (Miami. Las Vegas. Seattle. Chicago and Duluth) to understand the impact of climate conditions on energy and cost savings. The results show that implementation of the seven operation and maintenance measures as part of a retro-commissioning process can yield an average of about 22% energy use reduction and 14% energy cost reduction.

Percent compliance for any given building was simply the percent of individual requirements that passed. A field investigation method has been developed. which goes beyond the binary approach. to determine lost savings due to non-compliance. Prototype building simulations were used to estimate the energy cost impact of varying levels of non-compliance for newly constructed office buildings in climate zone 4C. 1 Field data collected from actual buildings on specific conditions relative to code requirements was then applied to the simulation results to find the potential lost energy savings for a single building and for a sample of buildings. This new methodology was tested on nine office buildings in climate zone 4C. The amount of additional energy cost savings they could have achieved had they complied fully with the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code was determined. For each building. the annual lost energy cost savings ranged from a minimum of $101 to a maximum of $638 and 2% to 29% of total annual energy cost.

How communicated motives for environmental policy affect public perceptions of corporate greenwashing,2015,Gerdien de Vries and Bart W Terwel and Naomi Ellemers and Dancker DL Daamen,22,Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management,,142-154,,Companies in the energy sector face a dilemma regarding how to communicate their environmental policies to the public. Communicating that environmental policies and activities are motivated by concern for the environment could elicit positive reactions. but may also lead to accusations of corporate greenwashing – the idea that companies deliberately frame their activities as ‘green’ in order to look environmentally friendly. The results of three experiments demonstrate that people easily suspect greenwashing when an energy company invests in environmental measures. Importantly. suspicions of corporate greenwashing are reduced by acknowledging economic motives instead of communicating environmental motives for such investments. Suspicion of strategic organizational behavior mediates the effect of communicated motive on perceived corporate greenwashing.

However. little attention has been given to the possibility that offering voice may have negative effects as well. We propose that negative consequences are particularly likely to occur when employees perceive the opportunity to voice opinions to be “pseudo voice”—voice opportunity given by managers who do not have the intention to actually consider employee input (i.e.. managerial disregard). The effects of this kind of deception were examined by means of a survey among employees (N = 137) and managers (N = 14) of a Dutch healthcare organization. We hypothesized and found that perceived pseudo voice led to reduced voice behavior and. as a result. increased intragroup conflict.

Terwel and Naomi Ellemers,10,Environmental Communication,2,206-226,,The mitigation of climate change requires reductions in the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. One way to achieve this in the short run is through the implementation of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology. The viability of CCS not only depends on technical and regulatory issues. but also on public attitudes. Communication plays an important role in shaping these attitudes. This paper reports on two experiments performed to examine effects of emphasis framing in CCS communications. meaning that greater weight is given to advantages of CCS over disadvantages or vice versa. Although emphasis framing can be effective in shaping attitudes. our findings suggest that there may be long-term costs to using this communication technique as it can be perceived as manipulative.

An example of positive framing is emphasising the climate benefits of a technology while neglecting to mention associated safety risks. I predict that. over time. people begin to perceive positive framing as an attempt to manipulate them into supporting a technology.

1304384,A positive shift in the public acceptability of a low-carbon energy project after implementation: The case of a hydrogen fuel station,2019,Nicole Huijts and Gerdien de Vries and Eric JE Molin,11,Sustainability,8,2220,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Public acceptability of low-carbon energy projects is often measured with one-off polls. This implies that opinion-shifts over time are not always taken into consideration by decision makers relying on these polls. Observations have given the impression that public acceptability of energy projects increases after implementation. However. this positive shift over time has not yet been systematically studied and is not yet understood very well. This paper aims to fill this gap. Based on two psychological mechanisms. loss aversion and cognitive dissonance reduction. we hypothesize that specifically people who live in proximity of a risky low-carbon technology—a hydrogen fuel station (HFS) in this case—evaluate this technology as more positive after its implementation than before. We conducted a survey among Dutch citizen living nearby a HFS and indeed found a positive shift in the overall evaluation of HFS after implementation. We also found that the benefits weighed stronger and the risks weaker after the implementation. This shift did not occur for citizens living further away from the HFS. The perceived risks and benefits did not significantly change after implementation. neither for citizens living in proximity. nor for citizens living further away. The societal implications of the findings are discussed.

The social categorization perspective assumes a negative effect because members of a diverse work-group are more positively inclined towards members who are similar to them than to members who are dissimilar.

1304399,Facts and feelings: Framing effects in responses to uncertainties about high-voltage power lines,2017,G de Vries and JA de Bruijn,,,,,,"To ensure power supply security. electricity transmission system operators (TSOs) have to upscale high-voltage overhead power lines. However. upscaling frequently meets opposition. Opposition can be caused by uncertainties about risks and benefits and might lead to costly delays (Linder. 1995; Wiedemann. Boerner.& Claus. 2016). To minimize opposition. TSOs and related public services need to respond to these uncertainties in a credible and convincing (effective) way. Effective risk communication is associated with sharing facts. However. factual responses can be perceived as ""cold"" and technocratic. To make factual responses warmer. it has been suggested to refer to organisational values or show personal commitment (e.g.. De Bruijn. 2011; De Wit. Das. & Vet. 2008). For example. when confronted with uncertainties about the impact of electro-magnetic fields on local residents’ health. a TSO spokesperson can share scientific findings as well as ensure that her organisation will never take any irresponsible risks because safety is a key value for them. Although it is generally assumed that a factual response is more effective when warmth is added. empirical evidence for this assumption is lacking. To fill this scientific gap. we conducted systematic research. The findings contribute to society because they can help improve effective communication and opinion-formation on power lines. The research consisted of three phases. In the first phase. experts identified the most relevant uncertainties about overhead power lines and formulated warm and cold responses to these uncertainties. The effectiveness (credibility and persuasiveness) of …",True,Rrto4P0AAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,0,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:tudelft.nl:uuid%3Afc3d15ef-a4aa-4367-bf8d-5c1552a91e46,,,,,,0,0,0

The roots of the CEOS are generally computed by subroutine-based calculations that involve logical if-else conditions. This approach can lead to nonsmoothness and convergence issues when used with gradient-based solvers in an EO framework. In this work. we propose a new general EO approach for selecting the appropriate root of the CEOS by incorporating derivative constraints specific to the desired (vapor or liquid) phase. We prove that these constraints are capable of isolating the liquid. middle and vapor root. The derivative constraints are tested using the EO phase-equilibrium formulation of Gopal and Biegler (1999) which is suitably extended for handling CEOS and relaxing the derivative constraints in the event of disappearance of phases.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,A new equation‐oriented process model for multistream heat exchangers (MHEX) is presented with a special emphasis on handling phase changes. The model internally uses the pinch concept to ensure the minimum driving force criteria. Streams capable of phase change are split into substreams corresponding to each of the phases. A novel disjunctive representation is proposed that identifies the phases traversed by a stream during heat exchange and assigns appropriate heat loads and temperatures for heat integration. The disjunctive model can be reformulated to avoid Boolean (or integer) variables using inner minimization and complementarity constraints. The model is suitable for optimization studies. particularly when the phases of the streams at the entry and exit of the MHEX are not known a priori.

Group methods were originally devised for simple absorber and stripper calculations with no major extensions for handling distillation. In this work. group methods are systematically analyzed and further improved by modifying some of the previously proposed approximations. As a result. the improved group method exhibits accurate predictions and this is demonstrated using simulation and optimization case studies for a variety of chemical systems and operating conditions. It is observed that the prediction of output variables is in close agreement with that of the rigorous equilibrium stage model. In case of optimization problems. the optimal number of trays and feed locations differ by only one or two trays.

In this work. the intrinsic kinetics for this reaction was generated in a stirred batch reactor at atmospheric pressure over the temperature range of 353−373 K. The effect of various parameters such as temperature and catalyst loading was investigated. and also the reusability of the catalyst was studied. Further. the performance of various catalysts was evaluated. The presence of water as a reaction product inhibits the reaction rate. leading to lower conversion levels. The reaction was studied with special emphasis toward variation of selectivity with conversion. An activity-based kinetic model was developed for the reacting system. which represents the data quite well.

The characteristics of the dimerization reaction make it a potential candidate for reactive distillation. The dimer. being heavier than C4. can be maintained at a low concentration level in the reactive zone by simultaneous distillation. thereby suppressing the subsequent oligomer-producing reactions. In this work. the influence of important design and operating parameters on the performance of the reaction in a hybrid reactive distillation column is studied through process simulations. the results show that a high selectivity toward diisobutene can be achieved along with adequate temperature control in the presence as well as absence of polar components.

In the case of irreversible reactions involving several products. reactive distillation may effectively improve the selectivity toward a desired intermediate product. However. multiunit processes for such reactions cannot be simply discounted without a systematic comparison with reactive distillation. This work emphasizes such a comparison using the isobutene dimerization reaction as an example. The multiunit configurations considered include the conventional reaction-separation network with and without recycle and a distillation column coupled with a side reactor. Potential configurations of process alternatives are generated for a wide range of the conversion of isobutene and the alternatives are compared on the basis of the selectivity toward diisobutene achieved and cost incurred for identical isobutene conversion.

The oxidation process is described by detailed chemistry of foundational hydrocarbon fuels. We present results obtained for three conventional jet fuels and two rocket fuels as examples. Modeling results demonstrate that HyChem models are capable of predicting a wide range of combustion properties. including ignition delay times. laminar flame speeds. and non-premixed flame extinction strain rates of all five fuels. Sensitivity analysis shows that for conventional. petroleum-derived real fuels. the …,True,cz5jkscAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,142,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010218018301317,14241047499023969439,/scholar?cites=14241047499023969439,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0010218018301317,0,0,0

The reactor environment is vitiated and the experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure. Species time history data were collected for n-dodecane and oxygen. as well as for 12 intermediate and product species over a span of 1–40 ms residence times using real time gas chromatography. The experimental data were compared against the predictions of four detailed kinetic models. The results showed that the fuel oxidation proceeds through an early pyrolytic stage where the fuel breaks down into smaller hydrocarbon fragments. including mostly C2–4 alkenes. and a late oxidation stage where the fragments oxidize to CO. The kinetic models were observed to diverge notably in their predictions from one another.

Results indicate that flooding is caused by unstable wave formation (slugging) at the hydraulic jump which forms in the lower pipe limb close to the bend. The gas flow velocities at flooding are well below those expected for vertical pipes. and are found to depend on tube diameter. the length of the lower limb. and on the radius of curvature of the bend.

In part I. experiments were described in which flooding limits were measured in air-water flow in various pipe elbows of this type; flooding was found to be caused by the onset of slugging at a hydraulic jump which formed in the lower limb of the elbow close to the bend. In the present paper a theoretical model is developed by which the flooding limits for this elbow geometry can be predicted. The model assumes that a smooth stratified flow exists in the lower limb of the elbow. with a free outfall at the exit. Flooding is assumed to coincide with slug formation just downstream of the bend where the liquid depth is greatest.

At T_s= 25oC. we observe pinned-stage linear evaporation for pure droplets. but a binary droplet undergoes two distinct evaporation stages: an early pinned stage and a later receding stage. In the binary droplet. the more volatile ethanol. evaporates faster leading to a nonlinear trend in the evaporation process at the early stage. The phenomenon observed in the present study at T_s= 25oC is similar to that presented by previous researchers at room temperature. More interesting dynamics is observed in the evaporation process of a binary droplet at an elevated substrate temperature. We found that the lifetime of the droplet exhibits a non-monotonic trend with the increase in ethanol concentration in the binary mixture. which {can be attributed to} the non-ideal behaviour of water-ethanol binary mixtures. Increasing T_s decreases the lifetime of the (50\% ethanol+ 50\% water) binary droplet in a logarithmic scale.

1304446,Effect of substrate temperature on evaporation of ethanol-water sessile droplet,2019,Pradeep Gurrala and Pallavi Katre and Saravanan Balusamy and Sayak Banerjee and Kirti Chandra Sahu,,,,,,The evaporation dynamics of an ethanol-water (E 50%+ W 50%) binary sessile droplet of volume 5µl is studied experimentally and theoretically. The focus of this work is to investigate the effect of the substrate temperature (Ts) on the evaporation dynamics. A cellulose acetate tape with a surface roughness of 668 nm is used as the substrate. Two distinct evaporation stages are observed at Ts= 25 ⁰C. namely an early pinned stage and a later receding stage. The higher volatile ethanol evaporates faster leading to a nonlinear trend in the evaporation process at the early stage. In contrast. at Ts= 60 ⁰C. three distinct phases are observed. which are the early spreading stage. an intermediate pinned stage and a late receding stage of evaporation. We have developed a theoretical model that combines evaporative diffusion. natural convection and passive transport of vapour. which predicts the experimental behaviour well.,True,cz5jkscAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC,0,https://www.iith.ac.in/~ksahu/2019_Sayak_acfm.pdf,,,,,https://www.iith.ac.in/~ksahu/2019_Sayak_acfm.pdf,0,0,0

1304453,Masking mechanical damages in the modern control systems of combustion engines,2006,Zbigniew Dąbrowski and Henryk Madej,13,Journal of KONES,3,,,We have to admit that the modern car engine is now a device of much higher level of reliability than it used to be some years ago. while the microprocessor-based steering system. supported by the board diagnostic equipment makes this reliability even higher. However. it doesn’t mean that mechanical failures provoked by manufacturing errors. operation of the device. its exploitation or premature wearing cannot appear at all. Nor it means that that the failures will be always recognized by diagnostic equipment. The OBD systems were actually created for environmental purposes and their development to the form that could guarantee proper diagnosing in the case of typical mechanical failures is currently a subject of many studies. However. the main topic of the paper does not consist in listing the cases of difficult or unidentifiable faults but in showing that there is a group of failures (mainly of mechanical type) that stimulate the developed steering system to regulate and weaken typical exterior symptoms. and subsequently to make the damage in certain propagation range unidentifiable even for an experienced mechanic. Therefore. the main objective of the paper consists in answering the question about the direction of the development of diagnostic systems. and suggesting some additional symptoms that could be taken into account. as well as the way they should be analyzed in order to minimize possibility of such occurrences.,True,m8od83AAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,54,https://ilot.lukasiewicz.gov.pl/KONES/2006/03/6.pdf,12689982238599045686,/scholar?cites=12689982238599045686,,,https://ilot.lukasiewicz.gov.pl/KONES/2006/03/6.pdf,0,0,0

The possibility of passenger car engine operation on H2-CH4 mixtures has been demonstrated in the paper. with the underlining of the potential of those mixtures in the increasing of the engine efficiency. Necessary changes in strategy of engine regulation. especially in air/fuel ratio. ignition advance and EGR rate. were noticed and prepared. The methane-hydrogen blends. which were used in the research programme featured ratios as follows: 5%. 10% and 15% of hydrogen. For selected engine operating points. following data has been acquired: in cylinder pressure variation. crank angle. manifold pressure and finally mass fuel consumption. On the basis of registered data for all fuels-burned temperature in cylinder has been estimated. as well as the charge combustion ratio. and the heat release rate. With help of mathematical model describing the exhaust gases formation it has been possible to estimate the NO. CO and CO2 emission level. Obtained results made it possible to compare the combustion process for all tested fuels and pointed on the significant influence of hydrogen percentage for the methane-hydrogen blends. on the CO2 emission reduction up to 20%.

1304477,The influence of selected gaseous fuels on the combustion process in the SI engine,2017,Marek Flekiewicz and Grzegorz Kubica,12,Transport Problems,,,,This paper presents the results of SI engine tests. carried out for different gaseous fuels. The analysis carried out made it possible to define the correlation between fuel composition and engine operating parameters. The tests covered various gaseous mixtures: methane with hydrogen from 5% to 50% by volume and LPG with DME from 5% to 26% by mass. The first group. considered as low-carbon-content fuels can be characterized by low CO2 emissions. Flammability of hydrogen added in those mixtures realizes the function of the combustion process activator. Thus. hydrogen addition improves energy conversion by about 3%. The second group of fuels is constituted by LPG and DME mixtures. DME mixes perfectly with LPG. and differently than other hydrocarbon fuels. consisting of oxygen as well. which makes the stoichiometric mixture less oxygen demanding. In the case of this fuel an improvement in engine volumetric and overall engine efficiency has been noticed compared with LPG. For the 11% DME share in the mixture an improvement of 2% in the efficiency has been noticed. During the tests. standard CNG–LPG feeding systems have been used. which underlines the utility value of the research. The stand-test results have been followed by combustion process simulation including exhaust forming and charge exchange.,True,m8od83AAAAAJ:nb7KW1ujOQ8C,4,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-345c120a-b8bd-4118-9e74-a6d2093f1cd3,2765262000344999009,/scholar?cites=2765262000344999009,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-345c120a-b8bd-4118-9e74-a6d2093f1cd3/c/flekievicz_influence_2017t12z3.pdf,0,0,0

In this work. the influence of the addition of oxygenated hydrocarbons to diesel fuels on performance and emission parameters of a diesel engine is experimentally studied. 3-Pentanone (C5H10O) and Methyl anon (C7H12O) were used as oxygenated fuel additives. It was found that the addition of oxygenated hydrocarbons reduced the production of soot precursors with respect to the availability of oxygen content in the fuel. On the other hand. a serious increase of NOx emissions is observed. For this reason the use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to control NOx emissions is examined. From the analysis of it is examined experimental findings it is seen that the use of EGR causes a sharp reduction in NOx and smoke simultaneously. On the other hand.

INTRODUCTION ue to the shortage of petroleum product and its increasing cost. efforts are on to develop alternative fuels especially to diesel oil for full or partial replacement. The most promising substitutes for petroleum fuels are the alcohols but are not suitable for compression ignition (CI) engines because of its low cetane number and non miscibility. The addition of oxygen containing compounds to diesel fuel has been proposed as a method to complete the oxidation of carbonaceous particulate matter and associated hydrocarbons. In addition. many oxygenates have high cetane number and their association with diesel results in high cetane number and hence lower exhaust emissions. Due to this advantages. there is growing interest in the introduction of oxygenates into diesel fuel. Di methyl ether (DME) was considered as an ignitionimproving additive to methanol powered diesel engines [1]. However. DME is a gaseous fuel and therefore requires that a vehicle be adopted for gaseous operation [2]. In addition. the fuel delivery infrastructure is not currently suitable to distribute large quantities of a gaseous fuel. For these reasons. there is interest in new liquid compression ignition fuels or fuel additives. which have high cetane rating and reduce particulate emissions and at the same time they are compatible with current vehicle technology and fuel delivery infrastructure. Some oxygenated compounds like ethers or methyl carbonates have been tested as additives to improve the performance of diesel fuels [3].

This had become a major concern as the harmful pollutants are being produced in the exhaust of engines. The present works aims at the suitability study of esterified pine oil blended with diesel fuel as a replacement of diesel in an unmodified CI engine. The direct pine oil is a source obtained from agriculture. It has the innate characters like high viscosity. high calorific value and low cetane number values. It was found that esterified pine oil blended with diesel fuel could be successfully used with acceptable performance and better thermal efficiency. From the experimental investigation it is found that by blending pine oil with diesel. brake thermal efficiency can be increased up to 25%. friction power can be reduced by 4 kW. All the emission were observed to be low for the blended samples. The major contents like CO2 and NOx were decreased by 30%.

Availability of emergency systems through preventive maintenance scheduling has an important role in Probabilistic Safety Analysis (PSA). Preventive maintenances can be replaced with reloading time maintenance and reduce unavailability of the system. especially in the last days of reload cycle. Of course. the emergency core cooling systems connect to circuit in accidents and control the intensity of the unavailability. For reducing unavailability of standby emergency systems. preventive maintenance scheduling method is offered. In this paper. an Advanced Progressive Real Coded Genetic Algorithm (APRCGA) is applied to optimize the availability of standby systems with preventive maintenance scheduling.
