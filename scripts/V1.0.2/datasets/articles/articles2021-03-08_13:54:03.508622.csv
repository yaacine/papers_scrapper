1137974,Do personal characteristics and cultural values that promote innovation. quality. and efficiency compete or complement each other?,2004,Ella Miron and Miriam Erez and Eitan Naveh,25,Journal of organizational behavior,2,175-199,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,This study examines whether the same personal and contextual characteristics that enhance innovation could also contribute to quality and efficiency. Three hundred and forty‐nine engineers and technicians in 21 units of a large R&D company participated in the study. Using CFA and HLM models. we demonstrated that people have the ability to both be creative and pay attention to detail. and that an innovative culture does not necessarily compete with a culture of quality and efficiency. Yet. to reach innovative performance creative people need to take the initiative in promoting their ideas. with the possible corresponding price of low performance quality.

1137975,Achieving competitive advantage through implementing a replicable management standard: Installing and using ISO 9000,2005,Eitan Naveh and Alfred Marcus,24,,1,1-26,No longer published by Elsevier,This paper investigates the effects of implementing the international standard ISO 9000 on measures of business and operating performance. Based on the literature and a case study we identified two stages in implementing ISO 9000—(1) Installation. which has two dimensions: (a) external coordination and (b) integration; and (2) Usage. which also has two dimensions: (a) in daily practice and (b) as a catalyst for change. The hypotheses were that installation of ISO 9000 is positively related to use of ISO 9000. and use of ISO 9000 is positively related to operating performance. In addition. use of ISO 9000 is positively related to business performance since operating performance is positively related to business performance.

We also examined mediating team processes. Using data on 41 teams in an R&D company. we found that including creative and conformist members on a team enhanced team radical innovation. whereas including attentive-to-detail members hindered it. Creative members enhanced task conflict and hindered team adherence to standards. In contrast. conformists reduced task conflict. and conformists and attentive-to-detail members enhanced team adherence to standards.

1137978,Standardization and discretion: does the environmental standard ISO 14001 lead to performance benefits?,2006,Sharon Link and Eitan Naveh,53,IEEE transactions on engineering management,4,508-519,IEEE,This study sought to determine if the environmental management standard ISO 14001 helps organizations reduce the negative impact their business activities may have on the environment. and as a result. also improves their business performance. Forty organizations participated in the study and described how they implement ISO 14001 requirements. They also reported how the standard impacts on their environmental and business performance. The results show that if ISO 14001 requirements become part of the organization's daily practices. then standardization of the organization's handling of environmental issues follows-leading. consequently. to better organizational environmental performance. In addition. standardization augments its effect on organizational environmental performance through its positive impact on employee discretion.

This study suggests a new theory of safety climate and brings empirical evidence that helps explain the occurrence of treatment errors. Four safety climate dimensions have been identified. They include employee perceptions of the suitability of the organization’s safety procedures for their daily work. employee perceptions of the frequency and the clarity of the safety information distributed by the organization. the way employees interpret their managers’ safety practices. and the perceived priority given to safety within the organization.

We examine renewable‐power provision in the U.S. electric utility sector between 2001 and 2006. and find that firms adopt more renewable‐power generation when their peers (i.e.. firms in the same regulatory jurisdiction) face greater renewable‐power standards in other jurisdictions. The underlying mechanism is that forward‐looking firms assess when extrajurisdictional regulations foreshadow regulatory changes where they operate. Our analyses support this mechanism versus plausible alternatives.

Among many economists. the idea that expenditures on the environment positively affect firms is controversial (Majumdar and Marcus. 2001). Standard economic assumptions are that spending on environmental protection imposes costs and slows productivity improvements. but Porter has argued that environmental challenges. by inducing firms to economize. can improve their productivity (Porter. 1991). Based on the evidence from several case studies. Porter and van der Linde (1995a) concluded that the environment spending can. in fact. enhance a firms’ competitiveness. A considerable body of work now supports this idea that under some circumstances it ‘pays to be green’(Gladwin. 1993; Hart. 1995; Shrivastava. 1995; Russo and Fouts. 1997; King and Lenox. 2002; Orsato. 2006). In the years since Porter and van der Linde a number of management scholars have explored these claims and offered their own frameworks for addressing the relationship between environmental protection and competitive advantage (Klassen and Whybark. 1999; Marglolis and Walsh. 2003; Vogel. 2005).,True,_CsXcyEAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,14,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=rJpMDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA38&dq=info:0aanKkFb7LYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=in_LDSVyVg&sig=nl14dV9TQPBHXCe4Y6zIOpGps28,13181010544853231313,/scholar?cites=13181010544853231313,,,0,0,0

1138011,The dynamic relationship between firm capabilities. regulatory policy. and environmental performance: renewable energy policy and investment in the US electric utility sector.,2009,Adam Ryan Fremeth,,,,,,The choice by a firm to improve its environmental performance is a result of both characteristics that distinguish firms from one another and the public policy that compels such action. This dissertation examines how policy outcomes and subsequent firm responses are contingent upon the capabilities of the firms to respond to such policy. I present a theory of compliance specificity that ties firms and regulators together based on the heterogeneity of capabilities that firms hold with regards to a pending public policy of variable stringency. I test this theory within the context of the regulation and investment of renewable power in the U.S. electric utility sector and the growth of a utility scale renewable energy industry. I have identified that firms are able to shape the stringency of an environmental policy in the electric utility sector as the heterogeneity among firms can impact the potential costs that a regulator would face in the case that a policy is set that would leave firms out-of-compliance. Further. the choices that firms make with regards to their use of renewable power is conditioned on the contingent relationships of the capabilities that they possess and these same policies that they have influence over.

A central insight from this research is that regulators who are uninformed about firm costs or market demand conditions can maximize social welfare by offering pricing structures that effectively pay informational rents to the firm. These induce the firm to truthfully reveal true costs or market demand. Subsequent models have built on Baron and Myerson by adopting alternative assumptions on dimensions such as the firm’s technology. regulatory policy instruments and commitment abilities. Despite these theoretical extensions. there has been little empirical assessment of the relationship between asymmetric information and regulated rates.In this chapter we conduct a qualitative investigation of the relationship between regulators’ knowledge of regulated firms and their policy decisions. While directly observing the extent of regulatory knowledge presents a measurement challenge for researchers. we instead identify mechanisms through which information about regulated entities is revealed to external parties. including regulators. We focus our attention on three types of mechanism: the first considers the development of tacit knowledge through a regulator’s prior experience in office in the task of administering regulatory policies; the second is the publication of codified knowledge about a firm in the form of other agency. or judicial. rules or orders.

We find robust statistical support for our predictions in a statistical analysis of financial campaign contributions to state politicians by firms in the U.S. electric utility industry during the period 1999–2010.

By studying intra-firm campaign contributions of CEOs and political action committees (PACs). we investigate these two hypotheses surrounding public politics and demonstrate that strategic and agency-based motivations may hold simultaneously. Exploiting transaction-level data. with over 6.8 million observations. we show that (i) when PACs give to specific candidates. executives give to the same candidates. especially those who are strategically important to the firm; and (ii) when executives give to candidates who are not strategically important.

Few empirical estimates exist. however. on the implications of existing rules on firms’ political spending. Exploiting within firm-cycle cross-candidate variation and across firm-cycle variation. we demonstrate that the regulation of PAC campaign contributions generates large spillovers into other corporate political expenditures such as lobbying.

Crown corporations play an important role in Canada’s economy. accounting for approximately 3.4% of national GDP. employing more than an estimated 195.000 workers. and controlling net assets valued at more than $220 billion. 3 There are more than 40 federal Crown corporations and more than 180 provincial Crown corporations operating in a broad range of sectors from economic development (eg Export Development Canada and Alberta Investment Management) to transportation (eg VIA Rail Canada and BC Transit). culture and media (eg Canadian Broadcast Corporation and Manitoba Film and Music). and utilities and power generation (eg BC Hydro and Nalcor). 4Unlike government departments. Crown corporations are designed to operate at greater arm’s length from government since it is deemed that their objectives are best implemented through a corporate model. which affords more autonomy and flexibility in operations and strategic planning.

It also tests whether strong governance conditions improve the performance of firms with free cash flow and/or limit the investments in unprofitable sales growth. Consistent with agency theory. firms with free cash flow gain less from sales growth than firms without free cash flow. But different governance conditions affect sales growth and performance in different ways. Having substantial management stock ownership mitigates the influence of free cash flow on performance. despite allowing higher sales growth.

Ltd.,This exploratory study reports the results of a quantitative cross‐sectional analysis of 68 case descriptions of major projects. Variables describing the context of the projects. project planning and implementation processes. and project outcomes were coded using information contained in the case descriptions. Factor analysis was used to identify major factors associated with context. process and outcomes. The influences of context on process. and context and process on outcomes were estimated using regression. The results indicate that a number of contextual variables strongly influence aspects of the project planning and implementation process. and then indirectly influence project outcomes through the planning and implementation process. In addition. both process and contextual variables affect outcomes directly.

In this initial research on risk in actual business decisions. we examined the risk assessments bankers assigned to commercial borrowers. We tested hypotheses derived from research in strategy. finance. and behavioral decision theory in order to assess the influence of both organizational and cognitive factors on the likelihood of risk assessment errors.

A variance components simulation of corporate and business effects,1997,Thomas H Brush and Philip Bromiley,18,Strategic management journal,10,825-835,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,In a widely cited paper. Rumelt (1991) presents estimates of the relative influence of corporate. business unit. and other influences on business unit profitability and finds the corporation explains almost none of the variability in business unit profitability. Using a Monte Carlo simulation. we examine the relation of variance component magnitudes to other indicators of the importance of a particular effect. Our results demonstrate that variance components can be an extremely nonlinear indicator of importance. We also question whether Rumelt's corporate effect represents the possible contributions of corporate strategy to business unit performance. This addresses a puzzle raised by Rumelt (1991) concerning the small effect of corporations in explaining performance. and suggests that Rumelt's findings should not be seen as demonstrating the insignificance of corporate strategy. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons.

Based on the seminal RBV articles. we argue that using the RBV does not align with the objectives and activities of operations management researchers in several ways. First. the dependent variable in the RBV is sustained competitive advantage. Using sustained competitive advantage as a dependent variable implies that scholars focus on explaining the differences between the relatively few firms with sustained competitive advantage and all the other firms. ignoring performance variations within the great mass of firms. In addition. competitive advantage exists at the level of the business or the firm and does not directly translate into the normal level of operations management research. Measuring sustained competitive advantage also presents difficulties.

MA,Bowman’s (1980) study has often been cited as the starting point for risk research within strategic management. Bowman credited work in finance and economics for motivating his interest in risk. Within industries. he found negative associations between corporate risk and return. He labeled this finding the “risk/return paradox” because it contradicted the positive risk-return relation of financial portfolio theory. Bowman explained how risk-return relations for organizations may differ from those in equity markets:“The firm with lower risks and higher returns (to the firm) can have its securities priced relatively higher by the securities marketplace. thus lowering its return to the securities buyer. which then eliminates the paradox at the level of the securities owner or buyer”(Bowman. 1980: 25).Finance and strategic management have developed different theoretical perspectives on risk.

1138046,Towards a practice‐based view of strategy,2014,Philip Bromiley and Devaki Rau,35,Strategic Management Journal,8,1249-1256,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,Many studies in strategic management attempt to explain macro‐level firm behaviors or characteristics and/or the influence of such behaviors or characteristics on firm performance. Current strategy scholarship. however. rarely considers specific. actual techniques that managers might use to develop strategies or generally applicable firm practices. We propose a practice‐based view (PBV) of strategy scholarship to address this gap. In contrast with the resource‐based view emphasis on things that other firms cannot imitate. the PBV examines publicly known. imitable activities. or practices amenable to transfer across firms. We provide evidence for the PBV and discuss its contribution to strategy. The PBV has two important implications. one relating to potential explanations for performance and the other relating to the kinds of prescription strategy that scholars might offer.

In reflecting on the scholarly impact of these papers-and what such an impact might mean for future work in organizational trust-we discuss the concept of trust. briefly revisit the papers. consider the different ways in which the research has been used. and offer thoughts on the relevance of trust to organizational research.Bromiley and Cummings suggest that the inclusion of trust would expand and extend the research framework of transaction cost economics (TCE). Yet this call for TCE research to include the concept of trust has been largely ignored. Why? We summarize and analyze the apparent justifications for omitting or ignoring trust. leading to a critical examination of several theoretical aspects of TCE.

In studies of the US retail food industry. we find that while a general dynamic capability affects firms’ competence in supply chain management (a business competency). it does not affect their competence in environmental management (a social competency). Firm mission and the extent to which firms obtain technical assistance are found to affect the acquisition of this latter competency. These findings offer insights into the resource‐based view (RBV) of the firm and provide lessons for corporate social responsibility.

This stream of work argues that new leadership theory about integrative public leadership is needed because the context is different from that traditionally investigated by leadership researchers. In this paper. we advance the study of integrative public leadership by arguing that transformational leadership theory does apply to multi-sector collaborations. but needs to be augmented with an additional construct called “civic capacity.” We elaborate on this construct and suggest that it consists of three components: civic drive. civic connections. and civic pragmatism.,True,0BW83TMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,113,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984311000816,7500161687610989367,/scholar?cites=7500161687610989367,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1050.9480&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The seminal work on organizational memory is Walsh and Ungson’s article published in the Academy of Management Review in 1991.

While models of this sensemaking process suggest that information gathering affects interpretations (which affect action and performance). researchers have argued that our understanding of the role of information in changing interpretations is underdeveloped. This paper investigates the role of the time managers spend searching for information and the diversity of the information they find in changing managers’ perceptions that an equivocal. strategic issue represents a threat and opportunity for their businesses.

We suggest that one way leaders do this is by encouraging followers to engage in networking behavior. However. we argue that such encouragement is more effective when leaders are seen as less transformational. because followers are then less able to benefit from their leaders’ social capital. We support our arguments with a study of 142 followers and their leaders. Our findings show that followers engage in greater networking behaviors when encouraged by their leaders to do so. but this association is moderated by leaders’ transformational leadership style such that it is stronger as transformational leadership behaviors decrease. We thus introduce an unrecognized cost of leaders’ transformational leadership behaviors.

It is also increasingly recognized that individual differences affect work behaviours in substantial ways. but few studies on work design have investigated these differences.

While previous leadership research has examined the role of leader attributions. it has neglected the role of attributional complexity. We theorize and find support for a relationship between higher attributional complexity and transformational leadership behaviours. based on a sample of 100 leaders and their direct reports. Leaders who were more complex in their social judgments. attributing complex external and internal causes to others' behaviours and actions. were seen as more transformational by their direct reports.

While prior research has investigated the role of personality on conflict resolution styles at the individual level. little work has examined the role of personality on the emergence of conflict. This may be partially due to the fact that the emergence of conflict is inherently a group-level phenomenon. and thus requires the aggregation of personality to the group (or at least dyadic) level of analysis. I propose that each of the Big Five personality traits (or specific facets). at the group level. affect the emergence of either task conflict. relationship conflict. or both.

Scholars are now paying growing attention to the possibility that the collective capability of organizational learning plays a key role in determining innovation. We propose that leadership style. an individual feature. and organizational learning. a collective process. simultaneously and positively affect firm innovation.

Ltd.,Our study of 134 North American and European ski resorts examines the influence of externally focused organizational capabilities on the generation of proactive environmental strategies under contingent effects of uncertainty in the general business environment. We find that the capabilities of strategic proactivity and continuous innovation are associated with proactive environmental strategies. Managerial perceptions of uncertainty in the general business environment moderate the deployment of the capability of continuous innovation at all levels of uncertainty and stakeholder engagement at low and average levels of uncertainty. The study contributes to the resource‐based view (RBV) by illuminating an important contingency under which capabilities are likely to be deployed to generate a proactive corporate strategy.

Research Question/Issue: We examine whether director interlocks enable or inhibit a firm's adoption of a proactive environmental strategy. Specifically. using resource dependence theory. we argue that director interlocks with suppliers are linked to varying likelihoods that a firm adopts a proactive environmental strategy. depending on the relation between the provided resources and the environmental approach. Research Findings/Insight: Based on a sample of US electric firms. our results show that director interlocks with firms providing knowledge‐intensive business services are positively linked to the adoption of proactive environmental strategies. However. director interlocks with firms providing financial resources and fossil fuel are negatively related to the adoption of these strategies for our sample. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Board linkages may enable and inhibit proactive environmental strategies. We contribute to resource dependence theory by offering empirical evidence that the reduction of uncertainty about critical resources by director interlocks may either make business change easier or constrict a firm's autonomy. making change more difficult. Practitioner/Policy Implications: The influence of interlocking directors varies depending on the type of resources that director interlocks transfer to their organizations. As a result. the selection of specific director interlocks can become very important to the strategic goals of the firm.

Foreign ownership is categorized according to the control exercisable at different levels of ownership. These categories are. in turn. determined by the institutional structure of the Indian environment that helps define the property rights accruing at different levels of ownership. Firms' performance is measured as return on sales and return on assets.

These variations are explained as a function of three network effects: the first is the conversion effect. driven by operations‐related increasing returns to scale; the second is the consumption effect. driven by demand‐side increasing returns to scale; the third is an imitative effect. We expect the conversion effect to be felt more strongly during earlier phases of a technology's evolution. while a strong consumption effect is felt throughout. The imitative effect is also expected to be felt throughout. These hypotheses are examined with respect to electronic switching adoption in the local operating sector of the U.S. telecommunications industry.

In practice. managers use different themes of advertising (for example. price advertisements versus product advertisements) and within each theme they employ different versions of an advertisement. In this study. we evaluate the dynamic effects of different themes of advertising that have been employed in a campaign. We develop a model that jointly considers the effects of wearout as well as that of forgetting in the context of an advertising campaign that employs five different advertising themes.

Traditional measures for comparing the strategic performance across firms or over time have been return on investment (ROI) and its component ratio. return on sales (ROS). We decompose the ROS ratio into four separate ratios that capture the impact of changes in a firm's productivity. price recovery. product mix and capacity utilization on its profitability. These ratios help to highlight the micro sources of strategic success or failure. They can be used to assess changes in the performance of a firm compared to itself over time. or to other firms in its industry group.

Two sets of performance measures are computed for local operating companies. using data envelopment analysis. for the years 1973. 1978. 1981. 1984 and 1987.

Ltd.,The impact of corporate social performance on firm financial performance has been examined previously with mixed results. This study examines the possibility that corporate social performance enhances financial performance by allowing the firm to differentiate. and that this effect may be moderated both by innovation. which also drives firm differentiation. and the level of differentiation in the industry. Hypotheses concerning both direct and moderating effects are developed and tested using secondary data. Our results support both innovation and the level of differentiation in the industry as moderators for a positive relationship between corporate social performance and financial performance: corporate social performance most strongly affects performance in low‐innovation firms and in industries with little differentiation.

But this does not always account well for the heterogeneity observed in corporate strategies toward complex environmental issues such as climate change. In this chapter. we propose that strategy is often developed in light of expectations and assumptions concerning a ﬁrm’s internal competencies and the external market and nonmarket environments. These expectations. we propose. are shaped by institutional forces at multiple levels. including the ﬁrm. the national industry. the global industry. and the speciﬁc environmental issue. In particular. we argue that collective interpretations about the nature of and solutions to climate change constitute important drivers of strategy. and these collective interpretations are molded and contested within institutional ﬁelds.In addition to providing a fresh perspective on corporate environmental strategy. this chapter makes a number of contributions to institutional theory. First. we reject a strict dichotomy between the inﬂuence of the institutional environment and the competitive environment. as corporate perceptions of market trends are themselves subject to institutional construction. Second. we argue that tensions and political contestation across the complex terrain of interpenetrating and nested ﬁelds give rise to heterogeneity and change as integral features of institutional ﬁelds rather than difﬁculties to be explained away.

Key in this literature is the concept of rationalization. This is where individuals attempt to justify past and future corrupt deeds to themselves and others. In this article. we argue that rationalization often entails a process of overcompensation whereby the justification forwarded is excessive in relation to the actual act. Such over-rationalization provides an impetus for further and more serious acts of illegality.

Environmental managers. serving as boundary spanners. are exposed to these technical and institutional pressures. as well as multiple discourses with institutional fields.

Because the automobile industry plays a crucial role in mitigation of greenhouse gases. successful policy requires not just the assent but the active cooperation of this sector.

This can only be achieved through the effective leadership and commitment of senior managers and the development of sound teamworking throughout the organization. To this end. forward-looking organizations have formulated a range of teams. including: environmental steering committees; environmental action teams; process improvement teams; and quality and environment circles. The aims of this book are to bring together practical experiences and theoretical developments in relation to the role of teamworking within the context of environmental management. Contributions from an international group of leading practitioners and academics present examples of how teamworking can be utilised to solve the complex and uncertain environmental challenges that organisations face. The book is divided into three key sections. The first section examines–in a number of different organizational contexts–the problems that confront managers during the process of forming and developing environmental teams. In the second section. the book examines how environmental teams can trigger changes in core operations and integrate environmental concerns in business decision-making at every level in the organization. In the final section. the focus of the book shifts to environmental networks and their role as inter-organizational co-ordinators.

Ltd.,What explains differences in firms’ abilities to acquire competitive capabilities? In this paper we propose that a firm’s embeddedness in a network of ties is an important source of variation in the acquisition of competitive capabilities. We argue that firms in geographical clusters that maintain networks rich in bridging ties and sustain ties to regional institutions are well‐positioned to access new information. ideas. and opportunities. Hypotheses based on these ideas were tested on a stratified random sample of 227 job shop manufacturers located in the Midwest United States. Data were gathered using a mailed questionnaire. Results from structural equation modeling broadly support the embeddedness hypotheses and suggest a number of insights about the link between firms’ networks and the acquisition of competitive capabilities.

We propose that conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle is a powerful way of integrating the diverse trust literature and distilling generalizable implications for how trust affects organizing. We develop the notion of trust as an organizing principle by specifying structuring and mobilizing as two sets of causal pathways through which trust influences several important properties of organizations. We further describe specific mechanisms within structuring and mobilizing that influence interaction patterns and organizational processes.

While information sharing and trust have been theorized to be key features of the interorganizational ties that facilitate the acquisition of competitive capabilities. we argue that these mechanisms provide an incomplete explanation because they do not fully address the partially tacit nature of the knowledge that underlies competitive capabilities. Joint problem‐solving arrangements play a prominent role in capability acquisition by promoting the transfer of complex and difficult‐to‐codify knowledge.

Given that people's network contacts often share their demographic attributes (i.e.. the network is homophilous). the two approaches seem equivalent and the first seems preferable because it is easier to implement. In this paper. we demonstrate several important limits to this rationale. First. we argue and show. in an analysis of 1.518 project teams in a contract research and development firm. that even when internal organizational networks are significantly homophilous with respect to demographic variables. the very logic of the causal structure that underlies theories of demographic diversity carries ambiguous performance implications.

We argue that. in a buyer-supplier context. purchasing managers will be trusted to a greater extent by supplier representatives when they are free from constraints that limit their ability to interpret their boundary-spanning roles. We conceptualize and measure three key components of role autonomy: Functional influence. tenure. and clan culture. Taken together. these components of role autonomy shape and define the purchasing manager's willingness and capacity to make and uphold commitments to supplier representatives.

This trend. however. has left a disconnect between the literatures on formal organization and informal social structure such that crucial questions and problems at the intersection of the two streams of research have been neglected.

1138171,Does trust still matter? Research on the role of trust in inter-organizational exchange,2006,Bill McEvily and Akbar Zaheer,280,Handbook of trust research,,,Edward Elgar. Cheltenham. UK,What is the nature of interorganizational trust? Is the concept even meaningful? If so. what role (if any) does it play in affecting the performance of interfirm exchange? These questions were at the heart of what motivated our study ‘Does trust matter? Exploring the effects of interorganizational and interpersonal trust on performance’(Zaheer. McEvily and Perrone. 1998). At the time of our study. there was considerable theoretical doubt and ambiguity about the influence of trust. an inherently individual-level concept. on exchange performance. an organizational-level outcome. Our goal was to provide some conceptual clarity on the topic and our approach was three-fold. First. we proposed a theoretical basis upon which interpersonal and interorganizational trust could be conceptualized as related. but distinct constructs. We argued that whereas trust originates from individuals. the object of trust may be another person or entity. including a collective entity such as an organization. Thus. while interpersonal trust is the trust of one individual in another. interorganizational trust is the collectively-held trust orientation by members of one organization toward another organization. Second. we developed a theoretical model that related trust at the two levels of analysis. interpersonal and interorganizational. to exchange performance. Our core proposition (summarized in the figure below) advanced the idea that trust. both interorganizational and interpersonal. enhanced performance by lowering the transaction costs of exchange. Third. we empirically tested our model with survey data from a sample of buyer-supplier relationships.,True,lzOin3YAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,151,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2d94/4b9745616723c11113669f532f97750390c4.pdf,9108844075980452041,/scholar?cites=9108844075980452041,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2d94/4b9745616723c11113669f532f97750390c4.pdf,0,0,0

We also find that benefits yielded by hybrid network positions. combining elements of both closure and bridging. are greatest when old closure ties are combined with either very young or very old bridging ties.

However. only recently have organizational researchers devoted considerable attention to understanding the significance of trust for the organization and coordination of economic activities. The relatively recent interest in trust for organizational studies invites a slightly different take on the question “Why trust?” Specifically. why has the concept of trust become important for theories about organizations. and why now?

1138174,Architects of trust: The role of network facilitators in geographical clusters,2004,Bill McEvily and Akbar Zaheer,,,,189-213,Russell Sage Foundation,Can trust be purposively designed and constructed? Trust is often treated as a dyadic phenomenon that unfolds between two parties according to a fairly well defined evolutionary path. We seek to broaden our understanding of the developmental logic of trust by proposing that trust can be intentionally shaped and further that certain actors are skilled in the art and craft of building trust among others. Such architects of trust play a vital role as network facilitators in geographical clusters where firms simultaneously collaborate and compete. Our theory is based on a grounded case study of the office furniture manufacturing industry clustered in the western Michigan region. The case demonstrates that network facilitators create trust by taking deliberate actions that include identifying shared interests. developing common expectations. leveraging a critical mass of influence. and compressing networks in physical space and time. By defining and identifying the active network role played by network facilitators. we provide a theoretical framework for explaining why and how trust emerges in networks of firms to enable collaborative competition in geographical clusters. Geographical clusters have captivated the attention of a diverse array of social scientists from political science (Sabel 1993; Saxenian 1994). sociology (Powell 1990; Kanter 1995). strategic and international management (Porter 1990; Nohria 1992). and economic geography (Krugman 1991; Scott 1992; Storper 1992). What is most striking about this form of economic activity is that firms in geographical clusters often simultaneously collaborate while competing in downstream product markets …,True,lzOin3YAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,125,https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/architects-of-trust-the-role-of-network-facilitators-in-geographi,2982922673372834992,/scholar?cites=2982922673372834992,,,0,0,0

We conduct experiments that specifically address the question of whether it is possible for individuals to exhibit trust for a group. beyond the trust they exhibit for individual members of that group.

I argue that trust and risk frequently co-occur and overlap. In conjunction. the concepts produce hybrid social judgments that combine elements of trust and risk. The point of overlap among trust and risk centers on the choice to be vulnerable to the decisions and actions of another party. However. the types of decision making and information processing involved represent important differences between the two types of social judgments. Whereas risk involves probabilistic decision making and more controlled information processing. trust involves heuristic decision making and more automatic information processing.

We conduct an experiment in which we vary the target of trust among passersby at several locations around a city. measuring both behavioral distrust and trust attitudes towards these varying targets.

Social networks are thought to play an important role in knowledge sharing. but are presumed to create a trade-off such that a network can be optimized to promote either knowledge seeking or knowledge transfer. but not both.

1138188,From iron cage to iron shield? How bureaucracy enables temporal flexibility for professional service workers,2007,Forrest Briscoe,18,Organization Science,2,297-314,INFORMS,This paper develops a model of how organizations influence the temporal flexibility of professional service workers. The model starts by identifying a key source of temporal inflexibility for these workers: an inability to hand clients off among one other. Hand-offs are impeded by high levels of client-to-worker specificity. stemming from three common characteristics of professional service work.

1138189,Social activism in and around organizations,2016,Forrest Briscoe and Abhinav Gupta,10,Academy of Management Annals,1,671-727,Routledge,Organizations are frequent targets for social activists aiming to influence society by first altering organizational policies and practices. Reflecting a steady rise in research on this topic. we review recent literature and advance an insider-outsider framework to help explicate the diverse mechanisms and pathways involved. Our framework distinguishes between different types of activists based on their relationship with targeted organizations. For example. “insider” activists who are employees of the target organization have certain advantages and disadvantages when compared with “outsider” activists who are members of independent social movement organizations. We also distinguish between the direct and indirect (or spillover) effects of social activism. Much research has focused on the direct effects of activism on targeted organizations. but often the effects on non-targeted organizations matter more for …,True,xAPeIecAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,141,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/19416520.2016.1153261,13809202757902819803,/scholar?cites=13809202757902819803,,http://www.personal.psu.edu/fsb10/papers/Briscoe_Gupta_2016_AMA_Social_Activism_in_&_Around_Organizations.pdf,0,0,0

This study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature by investigating how local employer practices can enable employees to successfully use the programs designed to benefit them. Using a research approach that controls for regulatory environment and program design. we analyze unique longitudinal personnel data from a large law firm to demonstrate that assignment to powerful supervisors upon organization entry improves career outcomes for individuals who later use a reduced-hours program.

Determinants of the decision to work as an independent contractor among information technology workers,2009,Matthew J Bidwell and Forrest Briscoe,52,Academy of Management Journal,6,1148-1168,American Society of Nephrology,We examined which IT workers take jobs as independent contractors. Contracting offers less job security and less employer-provided training than regular employment. We base our predictions of which workers contract on how their preferences and resources match such jobs. Using career history data. we found that the likelihood of contracting increases with skill levels and presence of negative cues. and falls (for men) with family responsibilities. Contracting is more likely among workers whose careers are either just beginning or well advanced; the latter group also remains in contracting longer.

Practice opacity. third-party responses. and the interorganizational diffusion of controversial practices,2012,Forrest Briscoe and Chad Murphy,57,Administrative Science Quarterly,4,553-584,Sage Publications,We examine the role of a practice’s opacity (versus transparency) in the interorganizational diffusion of organizational practices. Though the opacity of a practice is typically thought to impede diffusion. a political-cultural approach to institutions suggests that opacity can sometimes play a positive role. Given that adoption decisions are embedded in a web of conflicting interests. transparency may bring negative attention that. when observed by prospective adopters. inhibits them from following suit. Opacity. in contrast. helps avoid that cycle. Using the curtailment of health benefits for retirees among large U.S. employers (1989 to 2009). we compare the diffusion of transparent adoptions (i.e.. partial or complete benefit cuts) with opaque adoptions (i.e.. spending caps that trigger disenrollment).

Studying collegiate adoptions of a controversial supplier-sanction practice championed by anti-sweatshop activists. we compare how non-targeted organizations are influenced by different types of practice adoptions in their environment. Drawing on interorganizational learning theory. we argue and show that disruption-linked adoptions—those that occur following activists’ disruptive protests against the adopting organization—appear to be taken under coercive pressure and therefore provide non-targeted organizations with poor inferences about the merits of the practice.

When merging law firm partners share clients with one another. both within and across the boundaries of the formerly separate firms. they create new relationships that connect the organizational units together. We examine both the antecedents and consequences of post-acquisition integration through client sharing. Drawing on network theory. we consider how the configuration of prior referral relationships influences new sharing of clients undertaken by individual partners. We also use the prior referral-network structure to predict which partners will cut their former intraunit client-sharing ties.

Well-established theory associates larger organizations with bureaucratic constraint. loss of workplace control. and dissatisfaction. but this author finds that large scale is also associated with greater schedule and career flexibility. Ironically. the bureaucratic processes that accompany large-scale organization also allow for a reduction of patient demands on individual physicians. freeing those physicians to pursue other career activities or to fulfill family responsibilities. Large-scale organizations thus appear to represent a trade-off between workplace control and temporal flexibility. and many physicians appear to embrace this trade-off.

Yet to implement value purchasing. the large companies in this study created new organizational forms. provided employees with financial incentives to select low-cost health plans. and used business tactics such as competitive bidding to negotiate more favorable rates and to improve quality among health plans.

Shifting to more complex work often reduces the importance of a single individual’s knowledge for the firm’s exchange relationships because complex work requires inputs from a broader set of the firm’s members. Although complex work decreases the likelihood that a single individual can shift the exchange relationship to another firm. we propose that it increases the vulnerability of the firm’s performance to departures of those individual managers who act as coordinators of knowledge. This leads us to focus on how the internal knowledge network formed to maintain each relationship can compound or mitigate the loss of a coordinating manager.

1138209,Cross-regional R&D collaboration and local knowledge spillover,2017,Minyuan Zhao and Mazhar Islam,,,,,Emerald Publishing Limited,Firms are increasingly organizing cross-regional R&D collaborations among different units. Such collaborations should promote knowledge flows across distance and bring new knowledge to the local communities. However. the nature of cross-regional collaborations varies widely depending on the organizations within which they are organized. Compared with collaborations within small firms. collaborations in large firms tend to be routinized. which reduces the need for interpersonal interactions and increases the dependence on organizational structure. As a result. additional spillover from cross-regional collaboration is likely to be lower if the collaboration is within large firms. We extend this argument to the regional level and hypothesize that regions with a higher level of cross-regional collaborations tend to generate more valuable technologies. but when large firms dominate the formation of such collaborations …,True,X4vS8nsAAAAJ:2l5NCbZemmgC,30,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S0742-332220170000036010/full/html,12047729115156579764,/scholar?cites=12047729115156579764,,,0,0,0

These stores act as mini-banks and offer loan repayments. utility bill collections. online purchase payments. funds transfers and credit cards. In addition. most stores offer more sophisticated financial services through automated teller machines and multimedia kiosks. often leveraging partner relationships. The main drivers in the evolution of mini-banks are CVS’ strength in the strategic application of information technology. opportunities in the Japanese financial sector resulting from a series of government-initiated reforms and the continued weakness of many Japanese banks following the collapse of the Bubble.

The media in its role as information intermediary reduces information asymmetry between potential alliance partners. and thereby influences whether two firms ally with each other. Asymmetric negative media coverage raises potential transaction hazards in alliances and introduces the risk of negative reputation spillovers for the potential partner with less negative media coverage. We contrast the influence of media on alliance formation with the positive economic effects of business complementarity and partner-specific alliance experience on alliance formation. We find that the likelihood of alliance formation driven by business complementarity declines in the presence of increased potential one-sided transaction hazards.

Epistemic authority effects in social judgment,2005,Arie W Kruglanski and Amiram Raviv and Daniel Bar-Tal and Alona Raviv and Keren Sharvit and Shmuel Ellis and Ruth Bar and Antonio Pierro and Lucia Mannetti,37,Advances in experimental social psychology,,345-392,,A critical aspect of human social functioning concerns people’s informational dependence on others (Kelley & Thibaut. 1969). As we negotiate our way through the labyrinths of interpersonal relations and task exigencies. we encounter a continuous flow of information in the form of communications. advice. exhortations. and pleas from a variety of sources. These pose the ubiquitous question of whom to (informationally) trust and whose statements to discount or regard with suspicion. The issue has profound implications not only for one’s personal dealings with one’s social and physical environments but also for the workings of society itself. In this vein. the political scientist Robert Putnam (2000) commented on the declining trust in government characteristic of contemporary American society and on the dangers this poses to its communal functioning. In other words. for many Americans the government has ceased to represent an informational source to be relied on. encouraging political disengagement and civic apathy. The significance of source variables for individuals’ reactions to the information given has not been lost on social psychologists. To the contrary. such variables have figured prominently in major theories of communication and persuasion beginning with the classic works of the Yale group (Hovland. Janis. & Kelley. 1953; Hovland & Weiss. 1951). This continues with the currently influential dual-mode theories of persuasion (Chaiken.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Mergers of equals are often considered simply symbolic. Whereas existing literature on the topic views equality as underscoring the importance of distributive justice. power. or identity. the role of culture remains relatively obscure. In this study. the authors explore equality as a dynamic construct associated with two major processes in mergers of equals: cultural clash and cultural construction. The authors employ a qualitative case study with interviews and analysis of company materials from BroadBand. a wireless Internet access provider. to address the role of culture and equality in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The results shed light on how and why social actors entering into mergers may enact a culture of equality. First. firms may develop new aspirations and patterns of appreciation and initiate practices and strategies that construct equality as an integral part of the merger.

1138231,Predicting intentions to report administrative and disciplinary infractions: Applying the reasoned action model,1999,Shmuel Ellis and Shaul Arieli,52,Human Relations,7,947-967,Sage Publications,The present study focuses on the reporting of administrative and disciplinary irregularities. The reasoned action model (Ajzen & Fishbein. 1980) is applied to predict officers' intentions to report illegal or irregular activities in the Israeli Defense Forces. The findings show that although the model's two predictors (attitude toward reporting and subjective norm) significantly predicted intention to report. the effect of subjective norm was much stronger than the effect of the attitude component. In spite of the military's strong formal system and although social forces have great potential to impose the reporting norm on an organization's members. actual reporting does not meet expectations. The results are discussed in light of the organizational culture that develops as the combat unit struggles to survive in an extremely turbulent environment.,True,yCIAXdkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,71,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001872679905200705,17981903845129171437,/scholar?cites=17981903845129171437,,https://tad.colman.ac.il/paper-all/9135.pdf,0,0,0
1138232,On the perception and operationalization of risk perception,2008,Yoav Ganzach and Shmuel Ellis and Asya Pazy and Tali Ricci-Siag,,,,,,We compare and critique two measures of risk perception. We suggest that a single question—“How risky is the situation?”—captures the concept of risk perception more accurately than the multiple-item measure used by Sitkin and Weingart (1995). In fact. this latter measure inadvertently captures notions of attractiveness or expected return. rather than risk perception. We further propose that the error underlying the construction of Sitkin and Weingart’s measure is explained in terms of a top-down model of risk perception. in which perceived risk and perceived return are consequences. rather than determinants. of attractiveness.

We suggest that the boundaries that define the structures. practices. and values of firms prior to a merger become reinforced. contested. or revised in the integration process. thus shaping the firm identity that emerges. In a field study of a series of four sequential mergers. we find that the boundary negotiation process acts as an engine for identity creation in postmerger integration. Our analysis of the process through which postmerger identity is created reveals two stages of identity creation. In the first stage. boundaries are negotiated to leverage and import certain practices and values of the premerger firms; in the second stage. these boundaries are blurred as managers build on the set of imported practices and values to impose further systems that define the …,True,yCIAXdkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,68,https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1120.0814,1620206981969207363,/scholar?cites=1620206981969207363,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shmuel_Ellis/publication/270634964_One_Out_of_Many_Boundary_Negotiation_and_Identity_Formation_in_Postmerger_Integration/links/54d6005a0cf2970e4e663984/One-Out-of-Many-Boundary-Negotiation-and-Identity-Formation-in-Postmerger-Integration.pdf,0,0,0

Another aim of the study was to explore the impact of the existence of early warning signals about decision outcomes on the magnitude of the negative outcome bias. Eighty-three managers were asked to read vignettes describing a managerial decision and its outcomes. The outcomes were either positive or negative. and in half of the cases early warning signals existed that made it possible to predict potential negative outcomes while in the other half there were no such signals.

Flight simulators were used in this study for simulating scripts of typical tasks performed by pilots. 135 pilots were requested to participate in two training sessions. separated by a time break. The duration of the break were ranged from 14 days to 199 days. In each session they were asked to repeat a certain task until they achieved a certain performance level. Three measures of forgetting were generated: absolute forgetting intensity. relative intensity of forgetting and recovery cost. Results demonstrated a strong effect of break length on the three measures of forgetting. Furthermore. most of the break length effect was explained by the linear function.

Ironically. its ascendancy occurred as its principle academic progenitors. financial agency theorists. conceded the shareholder maxim misleading. Now. Financial Agency theorists speak of enlightened stakeholder theory and instruct directors to maximize the firm's long-term value. This theory's persistence owes much to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Principles of Corporate Governance. The Principles uneasily incorporates the two contending corporate models. shareholder value maximization and stakeholder theory. Unfortunately. this shareholder-stakeholder counterpoint has lost its relevance. Accordingly good governance principles must rest on a microeconomic theory in which the firm operates as a voluntary association that. by safeguarding firm specific investments. encourages capital (especially. human capital) investments.

The paper examines the environmental institutional distance of countries using the concepts of formal and informal institutional distances. The results show that whereas a high formal environmental distance between home and host countries leads multinational enterprises to achieve a different level of environmental performance according to each country's legal requirements. a high informal environmental distance encourages these firms to unify their environmental performance independently of the countries in which their units are based.

Furthermore. we propose that the update of trustors' expectations derived from previous interactions may moderate the relationship between reciprocity and future transfers of trust. In this context. we also address the previous literature's calls to reinforce the trust measurement; to that aim. we present two robust and comparable indexes for measuring trust transfer and its reciprocity. Our methodology relies on an experimental design with two rounds of decision making and multiple triads of agents.

Results show that the functional breadth of a subsidiary’s inter-organizational network has an inverted ‘U’-shaped relationship with its radical and incremental innovation performance.

Many scholars call for the development of systems thinking to improve our ability to manage wisely. But how do people learn in and about complex dynamic systems?

System dynamics is designed to help avoid such policy resistance and identify high‐leverage policies for sustained improvement. What does it take to be an effective systems thinker. and to teach system dynamics fruitfully? Understanding complex systems requires mastery of concepts such as feedback. stocks and flows. time delays. and nonlinearity. Research shows that these concepts are highly counterintuitive and poorly understood. It also shows how they can be taught and learned. Doing so requires the use of formal models and simulations to test our mental models and develop our intuition about complex systems.

Whereas DE models assume homogeneity and perfect mixing within compartments. AB models can capture heterogeneity across individuals and in the network of interactions among them. AB models relax aggregation assumptions. but entail computational and cognitive costs that may limit sensitivity analysis and model scope.

Our data suggest that the critical determinants of success in efforts to learn and improve are the interactions between managers' attributions about the cause of poor organizational performance and the physical structure of the workplace. particularly delays between investing in improvement and recognizing the rewards. Building on this observation. we propose a dynamic model capturing the mutual evolution of those attributions. managers' and workers' actions. and the production technology.

Engineering Systems Division,Todays problems often arise as unintended consequences of yesterdays solutions. Social systems often suffer from policy resistance. the tendency for well-intentioned interventions to be defeated by the response of the system to the intervention itself. The field of system dynamics. created at MIT in the 1950s by Jay Forrester. is designed to help us learn about the structure and dynamics of the complex systems in which we are embedded. design high-leverage policies for sustained improvement. and catalyze successful implementation and change. Drawing on engineering control theory and the modern theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. system dynamics often involves the development of formal models and management flight simulators to capture complex dynamics. and to create an environment for learning and policy design. Unlike pure engineering problems if any exist. human systems present unique challenges. including long time horizons. issues that cross disciplinary boundaries. the need to develop reliable models of human behavior. and the great difficulty of experimental testing. Successful change in social systems also requires the active participation of a wide range of people in the modeling and policy design process. people who often lack technical training.

1138318,Appropriate summary statistics for evaluating the historical fit of system dynamics models,1984,John D Sterman,10,Dynamica,2,51-66,,System Dynamics modelers are often faulted for their reluctance to employ formal measures of goodness-of-fit when assessing the historical behavior of models. As a result. the validity of system dynamics models is often questioned even when the model's correspondence to historical behavior is quite good. This paper argues that the failure to present formal analysis of historical behavior creates an impression of sloppiness and unprofessionalism. After reviewing the concept of validity in simulation modeling. the paper proposes a simple set of summary statistics appropriate for system dynamics models (the root-mean-square error and Theil inequality statistics). The statistics allow the error due to individual behavior modes to be analyzed. do not require the use of formal parameter estimation procedures. and can be conveniently computed.

Like any stock. atmospheric CO2 rises when the inflow to the tub (emissions) exceeds the outflow (net removal). is unchanging when inflow equals outflow. and falls when outflow exceeds inflow. Participants were informed that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are now roughly double net removal. so the tub is filling.Yet. 84% drew patterns that violated the principles of accumulation. If emissions followed the path in the typical example shown. atmospheric CO2 would continue to rise. Nearly two-thirds of the participants asserted that atmospheric GHGs can stabilize even though emissions continuously exceed removal—analogous to arguing a bathtub continuously filled faster than it drains will never overflow. Most believe that stopping the growth of emissions stops the growth of GHG concentrations. The erroneous belief that stabilizing emissions would quickly stabilize the climate supports wait-and-see policies but violates basic laws of physics. Training in science does not prevent these errors. Three-fifths of the participants have degrees in science. technology. engineering. or mathematics (STEM); most others were trained in economics. Over 30% hold a prior graduate degree. 70% of these in STEM. These individuals are demographically similar to influential leaders in business. government. and the media. though with more STEM training than most.

Ltd.,Knowledge intensive processes are often driven and constrained by the mental models of experts acting as direct participants or managers. Descriptions of these relationships are not generally available from traditional data sources but are stored in the mental models of experts. Often the knowledge is not explicit but tacit. so it is difficult to describe. examine. and use. Consequently. improvement of complex processes is plagued by false starts. failures. institutional and interpersonal conflict. and policy resistance. Modelers face difficulties in eliciting and representing the knowledge of experts so that useful models can be developed. We describe and illustrate an elicitation method that uses formal modeling and three description format transformations to help experts explicate their tacit knowledge. We use the method to elicit detailed process knowledge describing the development of a new semiconductor chip.

A challenge to researchers. educators. and citizens,2009,Matthew A Cronin and Cleotilde Gonzalez and John D Sterman,108,Organizational behavior and Human decision Processes,1,116-130,Academic Press,Accumulation is a fundamental process in dynamic systems: inventory accumulates production less shipments; the national debt accumulates the federal deficit. Effective decision making in such systems requires an understanding of the relationship between stocks and the flows that alter them. However. highly educated people are often unable to infer the behavior of simple stock–flow systems. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that poor understanding of accumulation. termed stock–flow failure. is a fundamental reasoning error. Persistent poor performance is not attributable to an inability to interpret graphs. lack of contextual knowledge. motivation. or cognitive capacity. Rather. stock–flow failure is a robust phenomenon that appears to be rooted in failure to appreciate the most basic principles of accumulation. leading to the use of inappropriate heuristics.

The concept of what a sustainable society might be like. or how it might be created. however. still requires a great deal of attention. It is generally accepted that such a society must be based on widespread adoption of activities that are sustainable in economic. environmental and social terms. Organizational attention to the concept of sustainability has tended to focus on the environmental aspect. For example. a multi-level. multi-systems based model of ecological sustainability applying to organizations was developed by Starik and Rands (1995). This basic framework can be modified and applied to the level of societies. Doing so of necessity requires attention to social aspects of sustainability. In this chapter we begin by reviewing the concept of sustainable development. and suggest that sustainability requires reconciling not only economic. environmental and social considerations. but cultural and ‘managerial’ones as well. We then re-examine the Starik and Rands model. attempt more fully to develop basic assumptions upon which it is built. and develop an analogue of it at the societal level. We further discuss how this model might be used to guide efforts to develop an ecologically sustainable society in a particular nation. the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We examine the Marshall Islands in terms of its potential for sustainable development. and suggest how the characteristics of an ecologically sustainable society might be applied by Marshallese society to move the Marshall Islands closer to sustainability.,True,lI_aIVYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,11,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=zjNmAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA22&dq=info:PbXgpmmyDHsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=EIo3AKdyGn&sig=PiFbpVRpyyYjOlCbKMy97HesIN0,8866657933226718525,/scholar?cites=8866657933226718525,,,0,0,0

Cheltenham, Northhampton, Edward Elgar",,155-186,,This chapter empirically explores the relationship between the strategic formulation and implementation of environmental change in Pennsylvania's manufacturing facilities between 1995 and 1998. Findings develop richer models of dominant stakeholder pressures and critical environmental events. and generally confirm the conceptual framework suggesting that management's perceptions of stakeholder pressures and critical environmental events drive the level and success of environmental change within manufacturing facilities. Aspects of the facility's organizational context influence this relationship. Formal environmental policies. environmental departments and improved waste reduction opportunities increase the number of successful environmental change implementations in surveyed facilities. Alternatively. the threat of punitive events leads to a greater number of unsuccessful implementations at the facility level of the firm. Manufacturing facilities face ever-increasing pressures to address their environmental impact. But how do these pressures influence environmental activities within these organizations? This chapter empirically studies the process of environmental improvement within a broad cross-section of Pennsylvania's manufacturing facilities.

The nature and impact of environmental regulation has been steadily increasing on an international level. Many multinationals have established a policy of compliance with the strictest laws in existence among the nations in which they operate. Suppliers are finding it more difficult to procure raw materials in the face of declining natural resources. Competitors are gaining advantage by investing in environmental technologies. products. and services. Shareholders are including environmental ‘good citizen’considerations in their investment portfolio decisions. Customers are insisting on more environmentally-friendliness. not simply at the point-of-sale. but throughout the entire life of a product or service. These various pressures have resulted in a considerable increase in attention to environmental management. both in the popular business press and in academic research. Much of the recent literature in this relatively new area of inquiry has focused on environmental management strategy. particularly on the development of typologies of environmental management approaches (Angell. 1996; Arnfalk & Thidell. 1992; Hunt & Auster. 1990; Post and Altman. 1992).Research has provided a good understanding of much of the content of environmental change.

Given that the term used to characterize this area of focus.'business and society'. denotes the study of relationships. it should not be surprising that scholarship in this area has specialized in the subject of external relations management. Business strategy scholars interested in this subject can learn a great deal about the categorical arguments used to justify the claims regarding what constitutes a firm's legitimate responsibilities. In particular. scholars who tend to focus on the instrumental aspects of external relations involving suppliers. channels of distribution. unions. etc.. can gain a better understanding of the full range of relationships firms must manage. including those external claims made on firm resources that are represented as “moral obligations'. In addition. the recent theoretical work pertaining to stakeholder relations has the advantage of being more bi-directional in orientation than the dominant inside-out models of customer relations. supplier relations. etc.. that populate the broader organizations literature. The first section of our chapter details the history of scholarship on business and society relations. showing how the number and variety of claims regarding corporate social responsibility have increased through the years. and how the scholarship on stakeholder relations has,True,lI_aIVYAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15186716887621893302&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Such scholarship needs to be looked at in different ways and with various approaches relevant for different circumstances. Macro views need increasing recognition. but to supplement rather than replace currently emphasized meso/micro perspectives. Also. human agency is not to be replaced with mechanistic prescription. but leadership scholars are in a position to contribute to the strategy and organization theory research that currently minimizes leader influence. This philosophy is illustrated through the interplay of leadership with the four contexts of: stability. crisis. dynamic equilibrium. and edge of chaos; the latter operationalized through a complexity theory/dynamic systems perspective.

Will organizations naturally self-organize to seek greater fitness? We suggest that. as hierarchies. organizations may be collectively led to establish a dynamic system where bottom-up structuration emerges to increase the long-term viability of the organization. Thus. it is our contention that while there is order for free. a desired order is not. To examine if a desired order for free emerges calls for analyses emphasizing the interplay among leadership. organization hierarchy. and CAS perspectives where these are systematically compared and contrasted.

1138373,Toward a macro-oriented model of leadership: An odyssey,1982,JAMES G Hunt and RICHARD N Osborn,,Leadership: Beyond establishment views,,196-221,Southern Illinois University Press,Buried deep within an obscure. seven-year-old. final technical report lies the spirit of a macro-oriented leadership model. This chapter traces the development of the model through the conflicting thickets of theoretical integration and empirical verification. It is essentially a status report on an emerging long-range programic research effort. The journey started in the late sixties with an analysis of leadership in mental health institutions (see Hunt. Osborn & Larson. 1973). The initial thrust was to expand and refine: 1) Fiedler's (1967) contingency approach to leadership effectiveness. and 2) the multiple administrative level leader-ship work suggested by Nealey and Blood (1968). Leadership was begin-ning to emerge from the grip of determinism toward a problematic thrust. Perhaps one leadership style was not best in all situations? Perhaps there were systematic differences between the effective leadership of supervisors and their bosses?Our initial results in one facility were quite promising. Leadership was important and the association between leadership and various measures of performance and satisfaction was moderated by a number of group factors. Further. it appeared that the leadership of upper-level managers was important alone and in combination with the leader behavior of the first-,True,-78d8iYAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,76,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=q3rYFFNkjY0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA196&dq=info:dAJWnO6bcLMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=xuvF2I4UGN&sig=bKq8eOa3oD-m9V_WR2bxIuGxSR8,12930005979308098164,/scholar?cites=12930005979308098164,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,Despite burgeoning research on companies' environmental strategies and environmental management practices. it remains unclear why some firms adopt environmental management practices beyond regulatory compliance. This paper leverages institutional theory by proposing that stakeholders – including governments. regulators. customers. competitors. community and environmental interest groups. and industry associations – impose coercive and normative pressures on firms. However. the way in which managers perceive and act upon these pressures at the plant level depends upon plant‐ and parent‐company‐specific factors. including their track record of environmental performance. the competitive position of the parent company and the organizational structure of the plant.

Ltd.,This article combines new and old institutionalism to explain differences in organizational strategies. We propose that differences in the influence of corporate departments lead their facilities to prioritize different external pressures and thus adopt different management practices. Specifically. we argue that external constituents—including customers. regulators. legislators. local communities. and environmental activist organizations—who interact with influential corporate departments are more likely to affect facility managers' decisions. As a result. managers of facilities that are subjected to comparable institutional pressures adopt distinct sets of management practices that appease different external constituents.

ISO is not only an acronym for the International Organization for Standardization. but is also a term that refers to its Greek meaning: ‘equal.’ The main rationale for the creation of ISO 14001 was that its worldwide acceptance should facilitate international trade by harmonizing otherwise diffuse environmental management standards and by providing an internationally accepted blueprint for sustainable development. pollution prevention. and compliance assurance.However. the implementation of ISO 14001 varies significantly across the globe.

Based on evidence from 156 published field trials and 525.479 study subjects from 1975 to 2012. we quantify the energy savings from information based strategies. On average. individuals in the experiments reduced their electricity consumption by 7.4%. Our results also show that strategies providing individualized audits and consulting are comparatively more effective for conservation behavior than strategies that provide historical. peer comparison energy feedback.

This paper shows that the perceived competitiveness impact of the standard depends mostly on the involvement of firms' external stakeholders (distributors. customers. community members. and regulatory agencies) in its design. ISO 14001 is a process standard. and it is difficult for stakeholders to get credible information on the effectiveness of the standard if they are not involved in its design. Stakeholders' involvement in a firm's ISO 14001 standard becomes a valuable organizational capability. which is difficult to imitate by competitors.

We demonstrate that substantive cooperative strategies are more likely to be pursued by firms that enter a VA close to its initiation. while symbolic cooperation is more likely behavior by late joiners. We show that late joiners and early joiners within VAs adopt different cooperative strategies because they face different institutional pressures. Our analysis is based on the strategies of firms participating in the Climate Challenge program (1995–2000) established by the U.S. Department of Energy and representatives of the national electric utilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The financial industry is in a unique position to move corporations towards corporate sustainability. However. there is often little transparency regarding the metrics used to evaluate corporate social and environmental performance and the trade‐offs involved in the evaluation. In this paper we discuss the various trade‐offs of sustainability screening methodologies.

In this article. we demonstrate that the certification of environmental practices by a third party should be analyzed as a strategy distinct from—although related to—the disclosure of the eco-certification through a label posted on the product. By assessing eco-labeling and eco-certification strategies separately. researchers can identify benefits associated with the certification process. such as improved reputation in the industry or increased product quality. independently from those associated with the actual label.

Two promising policies. the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) and the Mandatory Green Power Option (MGPO). have been implemented in many states but the evidence about their effectiveness is mixed. In this paper. we argue that recognizing the natural. social. and policy context under which MGPO and RPS are adopted is necessary in order to measure their true effectiveness. This is because the context rather than the policy might lead to positive outcomes and there is the possibility for sample bias. When controlling for the context in which the policies are implemented. we find that RPS has a negative impact on investments in renewable capacity.

Ltd.,This paper analyzes how economic deregulation impacts firm strategies and environmental quality in the electric utility industry. We find evidence that the deregulation introduced to this historically staid industry has stimulated environmental differentiation. Differentiation is most likely to appear where its point of uniqueness is valued by customers. and we confirm this relationship in our sample. Specifically. utilities that served customers who exhibited higher levels of environmental sensitivity generated more ‘green’ power. The tendency for firms to differentiate in this way is lessened if they are relatively more dependent on coal‐fired generation or relatively more efficient. Thus. there is evidence that firms sort themselves into either differentiation or low‐cost strategies as the competitive realities of a deregulated world unfold.

Based on the analysis of 177 U.S. electric utilities from 1998 to 2001. our results show that the process of retail deregulation has a negative impact on firms' productive efficiency. as measured using Data Envelopment Analysis. Furthermore. firms that are vertically integrated into electricity generation. or that rely on the market for the supply of their electricity. are more efficient than firms that adopt hybrid structures combining vertical integration and contracting.

Increased availability of information potentially generates an abundance of riches upon which to base investment decisions. but it also raises issues of commensurability. information overload. and confusion. Using a unique data set combining environmental ratings from three leading purveyors. we identify the principal components of corporate environmental performance. We find that two distinct factors—the environmental processes and practices implemented by firms. and the environmental outcomes they generate—explain 80% of the variance of the data. We also find corporate financial performance to be associated to process but not to outcome measures.,True,ZE02oYAAAAAJ:sSrBHYA8nusC,240,https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amp.2012.0123,7423824445700898892,/scholar?cites=7423824445700898892,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6xx9021b/qt6xx9021b.pdf,0,0,0

Disclosing environmental impact privately to consumers can reduce the costs and/or increase the moral benefits of conservation behaviors. while publicly disclosing such information can provide an additional motivation for conservation - cultivating a green reputation. In a unique field experiment in the residence halls at the University of California – Los Angeles. we test the efficacy of detailed private and public information on electricity conservation. Private information was given through real-time appliance level feedback and social norms over usage. and public information was given through a publicly visible conservation rating.

Such findings are consistent with institutional sociology. which emphasizes the importance of regulatory. normative and cognitive factors in shaping firms’ decisions to adopt specific organizational practices. above and beyond their technical efficiency. Similarly. institutional theory emphasizes legitimation processes and the tendency for institutionalized organizational structures and procedures to be taken for granted. regardless of their efficiency implications. However. the institutional perspective does not address the fundamental issue of business strategy necessary to explain the persistence of substantially different strategies among firms that are subjected to comparable levels of institutional pressures. In this chapter. we present current research arguing that such firms adopt heterogeneous sets of environmental management practices despite facing common institutional pressures because organizational characteristics lead managers to interpret these pressures differently.,True,ZE02oYAAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,164,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1711785,4512534130220510253,/scholar?cites=4512534130220510253,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6476837.pdf,0,0,0

We show that mandatory disclosure programs in the electricity industry achieve stated policy goals. We find that the proportion of fossil fuels decreases. and the proportion of clean fuels increases in response to disclosure programs. However. the programs may produce unintended consequences. For example. programs may make “clean” firms cleaner. while leaving “dirty” firms relatively unchanged. If the marginal benefits of pollution abatement are larger at dirty firms than at clean firms. disclosure programs may induce inefficient abatement allocations. (JEL D83. Q58.

1138416,Innovative CSR: From risk management to value creation,2017,Céline Louche and Samuel Idowu,,,,,Routledge,"By and large. corporations of the 21st century have come to realise that their obligations to societies in terms of corporate social responsibility are fourfold: economic. ethical. altruistic and strategic. Meeting these four responsibilities is crucial to their survival in their various markets and industries; it also requires them to rewrite their previously less socially responsible business models in order to do so. All indications continue to suggest that it is those organisations that are perceived to be socially responsible by stakeholders in modern markets that survive and prosper. Corporations have equally realised that by being innovative in all things–including their CSR activities and initiatives–they will add value to the so-called bottom line. to the positive contributions they make to society and to how they are perceived by their key stakeholders. However. many criticisms have been made of CSR in its current form. often related to the lack of value that it generates within the enterprise and the fact that it offers only a partial and short-term response to the full challenges of sustainable development. The time has come to shift the CSR focus away from risk management towards a more progressive and entrepreneurial approach that seeks to create value and identify sustainable opportunities for strategic innovation.

Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action.

1138428,Organizing for high reliability: Processes of collective mindfulness,2008,Karl E Weick and Kathleen M Sutcliffe and David Obstfeld,3,,1,81-123,Sage,High reliability organizations (HROs) are harbingers of adaptive organizational forms for an increasingly complex environment. It is this possibility that warrants an effort to move HROs more centrally into the mainstream of organizational theory and remedy the puzzling state of affairs identified by Scott in the epigraph. Stated summarily. HROs warrant closer attention because they embody processes of mindfulness that suppress tendencies toward inertia. The fact that HROs are seldom portrayed this way or used more widely as templates for organizational design is due partly to their seeming exoticness and partly to uncertainty about how they might generalize to organizations that operate under less trying conditions. We will argue that HROs are important because they provide a window on a distinctive set of processes that foster effectiveness under trying conditions. The processes found in the best HROs provide the cognitive infrastructure that enables simultaneous adaptive learning and reliable performance. A focus on these processes represents a theoretical enrichment of previous discussions on the origin and context of organizational accidents (eg. Perrow. 1984) which have been framed in a largely macro-level. technology-driven structural perspective. The enrichment arises from the fact that. by explicating a set of cognitive processes that continuously reaccomplish reliability. we supply a mechanism by which reliable structures are enacted. This mechanism is often underdeveloped in non-HROs where people tend to focus on success rather than failure and efficiency rather than reliability. We suspect that failures in process improvement …,True,FNrWt3cAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,2990,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.465.1382&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=37,15680472686272778288,/scholar?cites=15680472686272778288,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.465.1382&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=37,0,0,0

The unexpected is often dramatic. as with hurricanes or terrorist attacks. But the unexpected can also come in more subtle forms. such as a small organizational lapse that leads to a major blunder. or an unexamined assumption that costs lives in a crisis. Why are some organizations better able than others to maintain function and structure in the face of unanticipated change? Authors Karl Weick and Kathleen Sutcliffe answer this question by pointing to high reliability organizations (HROs). such as emergency rooms in hospitals. flight operations of aircraft carriers. and firefighting units. as models to follow. These organizations have developed ways of acting and styles of learning that enable them to manage the unexpected better than other organizations.

We add to Levinthal and Rerup’s conjectures by examining Western and Eastern versions of mindfulness and how they function as a process of knowing an object. In our expanded view. encoding becomes less central. What becomes more central are activities such as altering the codes. differentiating the codes. introspecting the coding process itself. and. most of all. reducing the overall dependence on coding and codes. Consequently. we shift from Levinthal and Rerup’s contrast between mindful and less mindful to a contrast between conceptual and less conceptual.

1138437,Uncertainty in the transaction environment: an empirical test,1998,Kathleen M Sutcliffe and Akbar Zaheer,19,Strategic management journal,1,1-23,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Previous studies examining the relationship between uncertainty and vertical integration have produced a conflicting set of results. To clarify this puzzle we drew on the literature to conceptualize three distinct forms of uncertainty—primary. competitive. and supplier—and hypothesized that each had a different effect on vertical integration. The hypotheses were tested using experimental data collected from 308 managers.

Huber. Sutcliffe. Miller. and Click provide us with an encompassing analysis of the determinants of organizational change. This is an important contribution because organizational changes are of great and increasing importance. They affect organizational performance. They create new work tasks and new social relationships in the workplace. They create high workloads and stress levels for managers. The study reported here makes clear that the frequencies of different types of organizational changes are predictable. and it indicates which factors predict the frequencies of which types of change. Armed with this knowledge. managers can better prepare themselves. their employees. and their organizations for the consequences of change. to the benefit of all concerned.In contrast with individual prior studies. in this study the authors considered a variety of factors that might reasonably be thought to cause or constrain organizational change. They identified 24 such factors and were able to group them into five categories (which they called constructs):(1) characteristics of the organization's environment.(2) characteristics of the organization's performance.(3) characteristics of the organization's top manager.(4) characteristics of the organization's strategy. and (5) characteristics of the organization's structure.

Considering the ‘sharing economy’ as an umbrella construct and an essentially contested concept. we position the sharing economy as resting on three foundational cores: (1) Access economy. (2) Platform economy. and (3) Community-based economy. We show how each core holds distinct promises and paradoxes. This organizing framework shows how combining the cores can help sharing-economy initiatives to navigate certain tensions. but can also lead to new ones. We highlight the paradoxical nature of the sharing economy and make a case for balanced initiatives that combine the promises of each core while mitigating contradictions. We conclude by introducing the nine articles of the special issue. connecting their contributions to our organizing framework.,True,7NNAku4AAAAJ:jtOrAYjvdewC,410,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162517309101,6561678269996642940,/scholar?cites=6561678269996642940,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aurelien_Acquier/publication/319314333_AcquierDaudigeosPinkse_TFSC_2017/data/59a3e3d5458515703116f6be/AcquierDaudigeosPinkse-TFSC-2017.pdf,0,0,0

CSR. corporate governance and their interlink seem particularly relevant for multinational enterprises (MNEs). which. due to their activities in multiple contexts around the world and concomitant visibility. generally face higher demands to be transparent and disclose information about such issues. Insights into whether and in which cases disclosures on the two topics actually merge has been very limited. however.

Chile had turned to policies that have since been widely emulated across the globe. The neoliberal agenda—a label used more by critics than by the architects of the policies—rests on two main planks. The first is increased competition—achieved through deregulation and the opening up of domestic markets. including financial markets. to foreign competition. The second is a smaller role for the state. achieved through privatization and limits on the ability of governments to run fiscal deficits and accumulate debt.There has been a strong and widespread global trend toward neoliberalism since the 1980s. according to a composite index that measures the extent to which countries introduced competition in various spheres of economic activity to foster economic growth. As shown in the left panel of Chart 1. Chile’s push started a decade or so earlier than 1982. with subsequent policy changes bringing it ever closer to the United States.

Building on new research. this note finds that the productivity slowdown reflects both crisis legacies and structural headwinds. In advanced economies. the global financial crisis has led to “productivity hysteresis”—persistent productivity losses from a seemingly temporary shock. Behind this are balance sheet vulnerabilities. protracted weak demand and elevated uncertainty. which jointly triggered an adverse feedback loop of weak investment. weak productivity and bleak income prospects. Structural headwinds—already blowing before the crisis—include a waning ICT boom and slowing technology diffusion. partly reflecting an aging workforce. slowing global trade and weaker human capital accumulation.

What are the distributional consequences of fiscal austerity measures? This is an important policy question. This paper analyzes the effects of fiscal policies on income inequality in a panel of advanced and emerging market economies over the last three decades. complemented by a case study of selected consolidation episodes. The paper shows that fiscal consolidations are likely to raise inequality through various channels including their effects on unemployment. Spending-based consolidations tend to worsen inequality more significantly. relative to tax-based consolidations. The composition of austerity measures also matters: progressive taxation and targeted social benefits and subsidies introduced in the context of a broader decline in spending can help offset some of the adverse distributional impact of consolidation.

Our main finding is that contractionary monetary policy shocks increase income inequality. on average. The effect is asymmetric—tightening of policy raises inequality more than easing lowers it—and depends on the state of the business cycle. We find some evidence that the effect increases with the share of labor income and is mitigated by redistribution policies. Finally. while an unexpected increase in policy rates increases inequality. changes in policy rates driven by an increase in growth and inflation are associated with lower inequality.,True,kx7wu10AAAAJ:JQOojiI6XY0C,99,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560617302279,16301500046765785253,/scholar?cites=16301500046765785253,,https://www.cepweb.org/wp-content/uploads/Zdzienicka.pdf,0,0,0

A cross‐country analysis,2007,Davide Furceri,28,Fiscal Studies,1,103-120,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,The aim of the paper is to analyse the relationship between government expenditure volatility and long‐run growth. Using cross‐country panel data from 1970 to 2000. the paper finds that countries with higher government expenditure business‐cycle volatility have lower growth. even after controlling for other country‐specific growth correlates such as investment. government expenditure. human capital. population growth and output volatility.

Chile had turned to policies that have since been widely emulated across the globe. The neoliberal agenda—a label used more by critics than by the architects of the policies—rests on two main planks. The first is increased competition—achieved through deregulation and the opening up of domestic markets. including financial markets. to foreign competition. The second is a smaller role for the state. achieved through privatization and limits on the ability of governments to run fiscal deficits and accumulate debt.There has been a strong and widespread global trend toward neoliberalism since the 1980s. according to a composite index that measures the extent to which countries introduced competition in various spheres of economic activity to foster economic growth. As shown in the left panel of Chart 1. Chile’s push started a decade or so earlier than 1982. with subsequent policy changes bringing it ever closer to the United States.

The presence of such risks underlies a potential demand for mechanisms to soften the blow from adverse economic shocks. Such a protective infrastructure—which may. of course. have ancillary benefits that are not related to offering protection against the impact of adverse shocks—will be referred to in this chapter as “country insurance.” Protective measures that countries can take themselves (“self-insurance”) include sound economic policies. robust financial structures. and adequate reserve coverage. Beyond self-insurance. countries have also established regional arrangements that pool risks whereas. at the multilateral level. the IMF has a central role in making its resources temporarily available to ease the costs of economic adjustment when shocks create balance of payments difficulties for a member country. In addition. the IMF. through the policy advice it provides under surveillance. has a key role in helping countries improve their own crisis-proofing armor. This chapter analyzes a number of mechanisms through which countries can self-insure. with particular focus on national balance sheets—including the roles of countries’ external liability structures and self-insurance through reserves accumulation.

Research Department,The fiscal challenges facing advanced economies are unprecedented. and bring to the fore questions about how to assess fiscal sustainability. Intertemporal solvency—the notion that governments eventually repay their debts—requires only that adjustments to bring debt dynamics back on track occur at some point in the future. Given the sovereign’s right to tax and (not) spend. changes in these variables can always make the problem of insolvency disappear. But markets are not impressed by promises that are unsupported by countries’ track record of adjustment (words unsupported by deeds). and so it is critical to examine this track record to see whether it is indeed consistent with satisfying the intertemporal constraint.In this note. we reexamine the issue of debt sustainability in a large group of advanced economies. Our hypothesis is that. when debt is in a moderate range. its dynamics are sustainable in the sense that increases in debt elicit sufficient increases in primary fiscal balances to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. At high debt levels. however. the dynamics may turn unstable. and the debt ratio may not converge to a finite level. Such a framework allows us to define a “debt limit” that is consistent with the country’s historical track record of adjustment in the sense that. without an extraordinary fiscal effort. any debt increment beyond this limit would cause debt to increase without bound. It bears emphasizing that this debt limit is not an absolute and immutable barrier. but it does define a critical point above which the country’s historical fiscal response to rising debt becomes insufficient to maintain debt sustainability. Nor should the limit be …,True,_WkJqxgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,307,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/_spn1011.ashx,7437684565535095596,/scholar?cites=7437684565535095596,,https://www.imf.org/-/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/_spn1011.ashx,0,0,0

Okun likened these mechanisms to a “leaky bucket.” Some of the resources transferred from rich to poor “will simply disappear in transit. so the poor will not receive all the money that is taken from the rich”—the result of administrative costs and disincentives to work for both those who pay taxes and those who receive transfers.,True,_WkJqxgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,171,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.423.3338&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=14,5426617825376405836,/scholar?cites=5426617825376405836,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.423.3338&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=14,0,0,0

1138530,Policy rules for open economies,1999,Laurence M Ball,,,,127-156,University of Chicago Press,What policy rules should central banks follow? A growing number of economists and policymakers advocate targets for the level of inflation. Many also argue that inflation targeting should be implemented through a “Taylor rule” in which interest rates are adjusted in response to output and inflation. These views are supported by the theoretical models of Svensson (1997) and Ball (1997). in which the optimal policies are versions of inflation targets and Taylor rules.Many analyses of policy rules assume a closed economy. This paper extends the Svensson-Ball model to an open economy and asks how the optimal policies change. The short answer is they change quite a bit. In open economies. inflation targets and Taylor rules are suboptimal unless they are modified in important ways. Different rules are required because monetary policy affects the economy through exchange rate as well as interest rate channels.’Section 3.2 presents the model. which consists of three equations. The first is a dynamic. open economy IS equation: output depends on lags of itself. the real interest rate. and the real exchange rate. The second is an open economy Phillips curve: the change in inflation depends on lagged output and the lagged change in the exchange rate. which affects inflation through import prices.

1138532,Does inflation targeting matter?,2004,Laurence M Ball and Niamh Sheridan,,,,249-282,University of Chicago Press,Economists have long sought the ideal framework for monetary policy. Since the early 1990s. many have come to believe they have finally found the right approach: inflation targeting. Proponents of this policy cite many benefits. Inflation targeting solves the dynamic consistency problem that produces high average inflation. It reduces inflation variability. and if “flexible” it can stabilize output as well (Svensson 1997). Targeting locks in expectations of low inflation. which reduces the inflationary impact of macroeconomic shocks. For these reasons. many economists advocate inflation targeting for the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. This paper attempts to measure the effects of inflation targeting on macroeconomic performance. We examine twenty Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. seven that adopted inflation targeting during the 1990s and thirteen that did not. Not surprisingly. economic performance varies greatly across individual countries. both targeters and nontargeters. On average. however. there is no evidence that inflation targeting improves performance as measured by the behavior of inflation. output. or interest rates. If we examine inflation-targeting countries alone. we see that their performance improved on average between the period before targeting and the targeting period. For example. inflation fell and became more stable. and output growth also stabilized. However. countries that did not adopt inflation targeting also experienced improvements around the same times as targeters. This finding suggests that better performance resulted from something other than targeting …,True,HVshe5oAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1247,https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c9561/c9561.pdf,777007981754009158,/scholar?cites=777007981754009158,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c9561/c9561.pdf,0,0,0

It derives several results about the efficiency of alternative rules in a simple macroeconomic model. First. efficient rules can be expressed as ‘Taylor rules’ in which interest rates respond to output and inflation. But the coefficients in efficient Taylor rules differ from the coefficients that fit actual policy in the United States. Second. inflation targets are efficient. Indeed. the set of efficient rules is equivalent to the set of inflation‐target policies with different speeds of adjustment.

1138536,What determines the sacrifice ratio?,1994,Laurence Ball,,,,155-193,The University of Chicago Press,Disinflations are a major cause of recessions in modern economies-perhaps the dominant cause. In the United States. for example. recessions occurred in the early 1970s. mid-l970s. and early 1980s. Each of these downturns coincided with falling inflation caused by tight monetary policy (Romer and Romer 1989).Is there an iron law that disinflation produces large output losses? Or can favorable circumstances and wise policies reduce or even eliminate these costs? Economists have suggested a wide range of answers to these questions. One traditional view is that disinflation is less expensive if it occurs slowly. so that wages and prices have time to adjust to tighter policy. An opposing view (Sargent 1983) is that quick disinflation can be inexpensive. because expectations adjust sharply. Some economists argue that disinflation is less costly if tight monetary policy is accompanied by incomes policies or other efforts to coordinate wage and price adjustment. Finally. a number of authors suggest features of the economic environment that affect the output-inflation trade-off. such as the initial level of inflation (Ball. Mankiw. and Romer 1988). the openness of the economy (Romer 1991). and the nature of labor contracts (Gordon 1982).,True,HVshe5oAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,830,https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c8332/c8332.pdf,6268575124539017659,/scholar?cites=6268575124539017659,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c8332/c8332.pdf,0,0,0

When price adjustment is costly. firms adjust to large shocks but not to small shocks. and so large shocks have disproportionate effects on the price level. Therefore. aggregate inflation depends on the distribution of relative-price changes: inflation rises when the distribution is skewed to the right. and falls when the distribution is skewed to the left. We show that this theoretical result explains a large fraction of movements in postwar U. S. inflation.

New classical economists argue that credibility problems are central-that disinflation would be costless if the public believed policy announcements. Many new Keynesians. by contrast. view credibility as less important. They blame the costs of disinflation on infla-tionary inertia arising from the frictions in wage-and price-setting. especially the staggered timing of price adjustment introduced by John Taylor (1979. 1980) and Olivier Blanchard (1983. 1986). Does staggered price-setting imply that disinflation is costly. even with perfect cred-ibility? The literature contains a confusing array of answers to this question.

It rose to 5.7% in 1980 and 8.1% in 1994. The rise in unemployment was especially severe in the European Community. where 1994 unemployment averaged 11.5%.

1138550,Hysteresis in unemployment: old and new evidence,2009,Laurence M Ball,,,w14818,,National Bureau of Economic Research,This paper argues that hysteresis helps explain the long-run behavior of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is influenced by the path of actual unemployment. and hence by shifts in aggregate demand. I review past evidence for hysteresis effects and present new evidence for 20 developed countries. A central finding is that large increases in the natural rate are associated with disinflations. and large decreases with run-ups in inflation. These facts are consistent with hysteresis theories and inconsistent with theories in which the natural rate is independent of aggregate demand.,True,HVshe5oAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,353,https://www.nber.org/papers/w14818,2874235602687579235,/scholar?cites=2874235602687579235,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14818/w14818.pdf,0,0,0

A puzzle emerges when Phillips curves estimated over 1960-2007 are used to predict inflation over 2008-2010: inflation should have fallen by more than it did. We resolve this puzzle with two modifications of the Phillips curve. both suggested by theories of costly price adjustment: we measure core inflation with the median CPI inflation rate. and we allow the slope of the Phillips curve to change with the level and variance of inflation. We then examine the hypothesis of anchored inflation expectations. We find that expectations have been fully"" shock-anchored"" since the 1980s. while"" level anchoring"" has been gradual and partial. but significant.

We begin with a critical assessment of the existing literature. arguing that most work is based on implausible models of inflation–output dynamics. We then suggest that this problem may be solved with some recent behavioral models. which assume that price setters are slow to incorporate macroeconomic information into the prices they set. A specific such model is developed and used to derive optimal policy. In response to shocks to productivity and aggregate demand. optimal policy is price level targeting. Base drift in the price level. which is implicit in the inflation targeting regimes currently used in many central banks. is not desirable in this model.

The depressed path of output typically results from reductions of roughly equal proportions in the employment rate. the capital-to-labor ratio. and total factor productivity.

In advanced economies. markups have increased by an average of 39 percent since 1980. The increase is broad-based across industries and countries. and driven by the highest markup firms in each economic sector. For emerging markets and developing economies. there is less evidence of a rise in markups. We find a positive relation between firm markups and other indicators of market power. such as profits or industry concentration. Focusing on advanced economies. we investigate the relation between markups and investment. innovation. and the labor share at the firm level. We find evidence of a non-monotonic relation. with higher markups being correlated initially with increasing and then with decreasing investment and innovation rates. This non-monotonicity is more pronounced for firms that are closer to the technological frontier.

That is. whether measured as labor productivity or total factor productivity. productivity rises in booms and falls in recessions. Recent macroeconomic literature views this stylized fact of procyclical productivity as an essential feature of business cycles. largely because of the realization that each explanation for this stylized fact has important implications for the workings of macroeconomic models. In this paper. we seek to identify the empirical importance of the four main explanations for this stylized fact. and discuss the implications of our results for the appropriateness of different macroeconomic models. Until recently. economists generally regarded the long-run average rate of productivity growth as important for growth and welfare; procyclical productivity. by contrast. seemed irrelevant for understanding business cycles. Economists presumed that high-frequency fluctuations in productivity reflected cyclical mismeasurement—for example. labor and capital worked harder and longer in booms—but these cyclical variations in utilization were not themselves important for understanding cycles.

We find little evidence that this slowdown arises from growing mismeasurement of the gains from innovation in information technology–related goods and services.

Because the domestic production of these products has fallen. the quantitative effect on productivity was larger in the 1995–2004 period than since then. despite mismeasurement worsening for some types of information technology.

Contemporaneously. however. investments in ICT may be associated with lower TFP as resources are diverted to reorganization and learning. We find that US industry results are consistent with general‐purpose technology (GPT) stories: the acceleration after the mid‐1990s was broad‐based – located primarily in ICT‐using industries rather than ICT‐producing industries. Furthermore. industry TFP accelerations in the 2000s are positively correlated with (appropriately weighted) industry ICT …,True,m35OGfgAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,257,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0475.2007.00402.x,2630472721998060495,/scholar?cites=2630472721998060495,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.122.7783&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Assessing links between China and other Asian economies,1999,John Fernald and Hali Edison and Prakash Loungani,18,Journal of International Money and Finance,4,515-535,Pergamon,Several commentators have suggested that competition from China—in particular its 1994 `devaluation' and strong export performance during 1994–95—may have contributed to the Asian crisis of 1997–98. We provide evidence against this view. We show that the devaluation was not important in economic terms. and China's strong export performance in 1994–95 was matched by other Asian economies. We also show that the period 1993 and 1996 was marked by relative stability in the export shares of China and other Asian economies in various geographical regions and industries.

For the United States and Europe. we highlight that this slow pace began prior to the Great Recession. The timing thus suggests that it is important to consider factors other than just the deep crisis itself or policy changes since the crisis. For the United States. at the frontier of knowledge. there was a burst of innovation and reallocation related to the production and use of information technology in the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s. That burst ran its course prior to the Great Recession. Continental European economies were falling back relative to that frontier at varying rates since the mid-1990s.

Recent literature finds that the estimated effects of technology shocks are sensitive to how one treats hours per capita. However. after allowing for (statistically and economically significant) trend breaks in productivity. results are much less sensitive: hours fall when technology improves. The issue is that the common high–low–high pattern of productivity growth and hours (i.e.. the low-frequency correlation) inevitably leads to a positive estimated response. The trend breaks control for this correlation.

It shows how to impute nominal service output from financial intermediaries’ interest income. and how to construct price indices for those financial services. We model financial intermediaries as providers of financial services which resolve asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders. We embed these intermediaries in a dynamic. stochastic. general-equilibrium model where assets are priced competitively according to their systematic risk. as in the standard consumption-based capital-asset-pricing model. In this environment. we show that it is critical to take risk into account in order to measure financial output accurately. We also show that even using a risk-adjusted reference rate does not solve all the problems associated with measuring nominal financial service output. Our model allows us to address important outstanding questions in output and productivity measurement for financial firms. such as:(1) What are the correct “reference rates” to use in calculating bank output? In particular. should they take account of risk?(2) If reference rates need to be risk-adjusted. should they be ex ante or ex post rates of return?(3) What is the right price deflator for the output of financial firms?

1138618,Assessing fiscal episodes,2014,António Afonso and João Tovar Jalles,37,Economic Modelling,,255-270,North-Holland,In an OCDE panel. for the period 1970–2010. we assess the effects of fiscal consolidation episodes. with four different definitions. Our results reveal that lower final government consumption increases private consumption in three out of the four approaches. when a fiscal consolidation occurs. and the debt ratio is above the cross-country average. The magnitude of these coefficients is higher for countries with lower debt levels. implying more successful consolidations associated with reduced crowding-out effects. There is some evidence of non-Keynesian effects for both private consumption and private investment. and the effects of social transfers on private investment tend to be negative. both in the short and long run. In a financial crisis. such effects are also more prone to happen.

1138620,Dividing the pie in Brazil: income distribution. social policies and the new middle class,2014,Jens Arnold and João Jalles,,,,,OECD,Brazil has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty and inequality. This reduction is explained by strong growth but also by effective social policies. Besides growth. public services and cash transfers have played the biggest role. the latter notably through the successful “Bolsa Familia” programme. Among public services. improved access to education has played a major role. allowing more Brazilians to move into better-paid jobs. However. shortages in physical school infrastructure are limiting the hours of instruction that students receive. The high drop-out rate needs to be reduced through early interventions such as expanding early-childhood education. by reducing grade-repetition and through more tailored support for those at risk. The quality of teaching could also be raised through more in-service teacher training and stronger performance incentives for teachers.

The trend or Kuznets elasticity is about 0.6 for China. higher than that in advanced countries but below that of major emerging markets. The elasticity is somewhat lower for consumption-based emissions than for production-based emissions. providing mild evidence consistent with the “pollution haven” hypothesis. The Kuznets elasticity is much lower for the last three decades than for the three previous decades. suggesting a longer-term trend toward decoupling as China has become richer. Further evidence of this comes from provincial data: richer provinces tend to have smaller Kuznets elasticities than poorer ones.

Forecasts during non‐recession years are revised slowly; in recession years. the pace of revision picks up but not sufficiently to avoid large forecast errors. Our second finding is that forecasts of the private sector and the official sector are virtually identical; thus. both are equally good at missing recessions.

Inadequate attention to this aspect could result in a biased picture of total competition. leading to misguided antitrust decisions. Drawing on the conceptual framework outlined by Landes and Posner [Harvard Law Review. 94 (1981) 937]. we measure potential foreign competition by the intertemporal response of industry import-share to industry-specific and aggregate economic factors. and our estimates indicate wide variation across industries in this dimension.

1138644,The economics of tacit collusion: implications for merger control,2007,Marc Ivaldi and Bruno Jullien and Patrick Rey and Paul Seabright and Jean Tirole,,,,,Emerald Group Publishing Limited,Tacit collusion refers to a group of oligopolists’ ability to coordinate. even in the absence of explicit agreement. 2 to raise price or more generally increase profit at the detriment of consumers. It has been treated under the notion of collective dominance in a number of important European Court decisions and under the “coordinated effects” label in the US. The present chapter focuses on the economic analysis of the impact of mergers on collusion and its consequences for anti-trust policy. 3The legal treatment of collusion depends on the form it takes: explicit. tacit. or any combination of the two. Explicit collusion or cartel agreements are usually banned under antitrust laws. such as Section 8.1 of the US Sherman Act or Article 81 of the European Treaty. The treatment of tacit collusion has however been subject to more controversy than that of cartels. due the absence of a formal agreement or explicit coordination. 4 For this reason the use of the concept of tacit collusion has almost exclusively been used in merger control policy. Moreover the European Commission has relied more heavily on it than the US anti-trust authorities. This can be attributed mostly to the difference in the legal procedures. While the Clayton Act prohibits a merger the effect of which “may substantially lessen competition”. until recently. the European merger regulation allowed the Commission to declare incompatible with the EC treaties mergers that “create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective,True,51AU69EAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,35,"http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICAL%20ECONOMY%20The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20Antitrust,%20Volume%20282.pdf#page=234",4673532277458374497,/scholar?cites=4673532277458374497,,"http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/POLITICAL%20ECONOMY%20The%20Political%20Economy%20of%20Antitrust,%20Volume%20282.pdf#page=234",0,0,0

These include. for example. environmental regulations (in which some industries have increased regulatory exposure) and finance and accounting (where all industries have reporting requirements). In other areas. such as antitrust cartels. enforcement is unregulated. and antitrust leaves the market as the default tool to police against anticompetitive behavior. In all of these areas. detection of noncompliance by a firm can result in significant penalties. This issue of noncompliance has implications in the merger and acquisitions (M&A) context. In a transaction between an acquiring firm (buyer) and a target firm (seller). there is asymmetric information about the target's quality.

This paper examines what Bork said and did not say about cartel enforcement and offers an examination of how the actual structure of cartel enforcement played out relative to what Bork advocated. To provide some perspective on Bork’s view of cartel enforcement. we compare his views with those of the other major influential antitrust book of the time by Richard Posner. We identify three distinct stages of cartel enforcement. Stage 1 is characterized by a low number of cartels prosecuted along with low fines and jail terms. Consistent with Bork’s vision. stage 2 demonstrates a significant increase in cartels prosecuted. although fines and jail terms remain low.

We find that in industries dominated by small firms. an increase in uncertainty about future profits depresses investment; in all other industries. increased uncertainty has virtually no effect (or has a positive effect) on investment. The data set from which these findings emerge is a balanced panel. consisting of annual data from 1958 to 1991 for 252 manufacturing industries in the United States. The theoretical work on this topic points to uncertainty about future profit flows as one of the important actors that determines the ease with which firms can access external credit. The prediction made by the theory is that an increase in uncertainty exacerbates informational asymmetries. and hence makes lenders reduce the flow of credit; this in turn lowers investment in credit-constrained firms. If one is willing to accept firm size as a proxy for access to external credit. then our finding that greater uncertainty lowers investment in small-firm-dominated industries is consistent with the theoretical prediction.,True,51AU69EAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,13,https://ideas.repec.org/p/fip/fedgif/557.html,3739635238935914475,/scholar?cites=3739635238935914475,,,0,0,0

Building on the seminal methodology by Blanchard and Katz (1992). combined with multiple sources of regional population and migration data. we show that interstate mobility in response to relative labor demand conditions is not as high as previously established and has been weakening since the early 1990s. In addition. we find that mobility is countercyclical: net migration across regions responds more strongly to spatial disparities in recessions than in normal times. While the declining trend in mobility has been driven by weaker out-migration from states experiencing negative relative shocks. the mobility surge in recessions is mostly accounted for by temporarily stronger in-migration to better-performing states.,True,lww9-rcAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC,124,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00642,265550339768811766,/scholar?cites=265550339768811766,,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/REST_a_00642,0,0,0

1138665,International spillovers of labour market policies,2013,Mai Chi Dao,65,Oxford Economic Papers,2,417-446,Oxford University Press,This paper uses a dynamic open-economy model to analyse the domestic and international spillover effects of policies aiming at reducing domestic labour costs. e.g.. through cuts in labour taxes and unemployment benefits. when labour markets are unionized. Domestically. unionization dampens the downward wage adjustment due to unions' strategic rent-seeking and leads to a more muted expansion relative to a frictionless setting. Externally. the rent-sharing mechanism ensures that the terms of trade improvement benefits both firms and workers. and thus increases hiring. This is in contrast to the spillover effect in a frictionless setting. where the terms-of-trade induced wealth effect reduces individual labour supply. increases wages. and reduces hiring. When the model is enriched with sticky prices and a common monetary policy across countries.

A key question is how much of the post-2007 decline is reversible. something which is central to the policy debate. The key finding of this paper is that while around 1⁄ 4–? of the post-2007 decline is reversible. the LFPR will continue to decline given population aging. This paper’s measure of the “employment gap” also suggests that labor market slack remains and will only decline gradually. pointing to a still important role for stimulative macro-economic policies to help reach full employment. In addition. given the continued downward pressure on the LFPR. labor supply measures will be an essential component of the strategy to boost potential growth. Finally. stimulative macroeconomic and labor supply policies should also help reduce the scope for further hysteresis effects to develop (eg. loss of skills. discouragement).,True,lww9-rcAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,24,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=eMwQCQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT7&dq=info:9YdVMyOgHNQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=sKpXb8RjTd&sig=JvRI8oXo1GGyynByMIw-UgiC8Js,15284267308434163701,/scholar?cites=15284267308434163701,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ravi_Balakrishnan/publication/276163030_Recent_US_Labor_Force_Dynamics_Reversible_or_not/links/55bf8e5d08aec0e5f44761cf/Recent-US-Labor-Force-Dynamics-Reversible-or-not.pdf,0,0,0

For this purpose. we develop a two region overlapping generations model where countries differ in their population growth and mortality risk. Besides exploring the implications of demographics for saving and the current account over the long-run. we also study how these might be affected by differences in the coverage and sustainability of old-age transfer schemes. The model predicts that population structure and life expectancy (which affects the need to save to meet old age consumption) affect current account levels. and that while countries with more generous unfunded transfer schemes tend to have lower saving and more capital inflows over the long-run. this effect may be dampened by natural limits (on taxation) of these schemes.

1138686,Lectures on macroeconomics,1989,Olivier J Blanchard and Stanley Fischer and OLIVIER AUTOR BLANCHARD,,,,,MIT press,The main purpose of Lectures on Macroeconomics is to characterize and explain fluctuations in output. unemployment and movement in prices. Lectures on Macroeconomics provides the first comprehensive description and evaluation of macroeconomic theory in many years. While the authors' perspective is broad. they clearly state their assessment of what is important and what is not as they present the essence of macroeconomic theory today. The main purpose of Lectures on Macroeconomics is to characterize and explain fluctuations in output. unemployment and movement in prices. The most important fact of modern economic history is persistent long term growth. but as the book makes clear. this growth is far from steady. The authors analyze and explore these fluctuations. Topics include consumption and investment; the Overlapping Generations Model; money; multiple equilibria. bubbles. and stability; the role of nominal rigidities; competitive equilibrium business cycles. nominal rigidities and economic fluctuations. goods. labor and credit markets; and monetary and fiscal policy issues. Each of chapters 2 through 9 discusses models appropriate to the topic. Chapter 10 then draws on the previous chapters. asks which models are the workhorses of macroeconomics. and sets the models out in convenient form. A concluding chapter analyzes the goals of economic policy. monetary policy. fiscal policy. and dynamic inconsistency. Written as a text for graduate students with some background in macroeconomics. statistics. and econometrics.

1138687,The dynamic effects of aggregate demand and supply disturbances,1988,Olivier J Blanchard and Danny Quah,,,,,National Bureau of Economic Research,We interpret fluctuations in GNP and unemployment as due to two types of disturbances: disturbances that have a permanent effect on output and disturbances that do not. We interpret  the first as supply disturbances. the second as demand disturbances. We find that demand disturbances have a hump shaped effect on both output and unemployment; the effect peaks after a year and vanishes after two to five years. Up to a scale factor. the dynamic effect on unemployment of demand disturbances is a mirror image of that on output. The effect of supply disturbances on output increases steadily over time. to reach a peak after two years and a plateau after five years. 'Favorab1e supply disturbances may initially increase unemployment. This is followed by a decline in unemployment. with a slow return over time to its original value. While this dynamic characterization is fairly sharp. the data are not as specific as to the relative contributions of demand and supply disturbances to output fluctuations. We find that the time series of demand-determined output fluctuations has peaks and troughs which coincide with most of the NBER troughs and peaks. But variance decompositions of output at various horizons giving the respective contributions of supply and demand disturbances are not precisely estimated. For instance. at a forecast horizon of four quarters. we find that. under alternative assumptions. the contribution of demand disturbances ranges from 40 to over 95 per cent.,True,QtVE6DwAAAAJ:Sg-YnEhjH50C,5849,https://www.nber.org/papers/w2737,14108043734454874905,/scholar?cites=14108043734454874905,,https://www.nber.org/papers/w2737.pdf,0,0,0

Identification is achieved by using institutional information about the tax and transfer systems to identify the automatic response of taxes and spending to activity. and. by implication. to infer fiscal shocks.

While adverse shocks can potentially explain much of the rise in unemployment. there is insufficient heterogeneity in these shocks to explain cross‐country differences. Alternatively. while explanations focusing on labour market institutions explain current heterogeneity well. many of these institutions pre‐date the rise in unemployment.

In this paper. we argue that this fact implies that shocks have much more persistent effects on unemployment than standard theories can possibly explain.

We argue that if wages are largely set by bargaining between insiders and firms. shocks which affect actual unemployment tend also to affect equilibrium unemployment.

Do they need to go on forever to be rational? Can they have real effects? These are some of the questions asked in the first three sections. The general conclusion is that bubbles. in many markets. are consistent with rationality. that phenomena such as runaway asset prices and market crashes are consistent with rational bubbles. In the last two sections. we consider whether the presence of bubbles in a particular market can be detected statistically. The task is much easier if there are data on both prices and returns. In this case. as shown by Shiller and Singleton. the hypothesis of no bubble implies restrictions on their joint distribution and can be tested.

However. the standard new Keynesian framework implies no such trade‐off. In that framework. stabilizing inflation is equivalent to stabilizing the welfare‐relevant output gap. In this paper. we argue that this property of the new Keynesian framework. which we call the divine coincidence. is due to a special feature of the model: the absence of nontrivial real imperfections. We focus on one such real imperfection. namely. real wage rigidities. When the baseline new Keynesian model is extended to allow for real wage rigidities. the divine coincidence disappears. and central banks indeed face a trade‐off between stabilizing inflation and stabilizing the welfare‐relevant output gap.

Inefficient unemployment fluctuations arise when we introduce real-wage rigidities.

Even if unemployment falls. workers may be worse off. going through many spells of unemployment and entry‐level jobs. before obtaining a regular job.

These results do not survive once we use instrumental variables techniques to correct for the endogenous nature of the explanatory variables. Furthermore. they suffer from omitted variables bias as they overestimate the effect of initial income per capita and thus underestimate the speed of conditional convergence. Instead. we provide new evidence for the impact of natural resource dependence on income per capita in a systematic empirical cross-country framework. In addition to a significant negative direct impact of natural resources on income per capita. we find a significant indirect effect of natural resources on institutions. We allow for interaction effects and provide evidence that the natural resource curse is particularly severe for economic performance in countries with a low degree of trade openness. Adopting policies directed toward more trade openness may thus soften the impact of a resource curse. We also check the robustness of our results by using a variety of instruments and also employing the ratio of natural capital rather than natural resource exports to national income as an explanatory variable.

1138730,Natural resources. volatility. and inclusive growth: perspectives from the Middle East and North Africa,2012,Mr Rabah Arezki and Mr Mustapha K Nabli,,,,,International Monetary Fund,This paper takes stock of the economic performance of resource rich countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) over the past forty years. While those countries have maintained high levels of income per capita. they have performed poorly when going beyond the assessment based on standard income level measures. Resource rich countries in MENA have experienced relatively low and non inclusive economic growth as well as high levels of macroeconomic volatility. Important improvements in health and education have taken place but the quality of the provision of public goods and services remains an important source of concerns. Looking forward we argue that the success of economic reforms in MENA rests on the ability of those countries to invest boldly in building inclusive institutions as well as high levels of human capacity in public administrations.,True,JPqqWx4AAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,68,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=199qNtuYKK0C&oi=fnd&pg=PT9&dq=info:gAGGRLYto_gJ:scholar.google.com&ots=5uJVb9p_HH&sig=_wbrJuprZyuYp-kPALaJ2vn1_qE,17916214003466895744,/scholar?cites=17916214003466895744,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/58332/1/716598450.pdf,0,0,0

Our main finding is that prior to capital account liberalization the causality runs from the South African Rand to the gold price volatility but the causality runs the other way around for the post-liberalization period.

G.. Ramey. V.A.. 1995. Cross-country evidence on the link between volatility and growth. American Economic Review 85. 1138–1151 (December).] highlighted an empirical relationship that has now come to be regarded as conventional wisdom—that output volatility and growth are negatively correlated. We reexamine this relationship in the context of globalization—a term typically used to describe the phenomenon of growing international trade and financial integration that has intensified since the mid-1980s. Using a comprehensive new data set. we document that. while the basic negative association between growth and volatility has been preserved during the 1990s. both trade and financial integration significantly weaken this negative relationship.

We categorize the 106 countries in our sample into three groups--industrial countries. emerging markets. and other developing economies. Using a dynamic factor model. we then decompose macroeconomic fluctuations in key macroeconomic aggregates--output. consumption. and investment--into different factors. These are:(i) a global factor. which picks up fluctuations that are common across all variables and countries;(ii) three group-specific factors. which capture fluctuations that are common to all variables and all countries within each group of countries;(iii) country factors. which are common across all aggregates in a given country; and (iv) idiosyncratic factors specific to each time series. Our main result is that. during the period of globalization (1985-2005). there has been some convergence of business cycle fluctuations among the group of industrial economies and among the group of emerging market economies.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the sources of the recent decline in prices. and examines its macroeconomic. financial and policy implications. The recent drop in prices is a significant. but not an unprecedented event as it has some significant parallels with the price collapse in 1985-86. The recent decline has been driven by a number of factors: several years of upward surprises in the production of unconventional oil; weakening global demand; a significant shift in OPEC policy; unwinding of some geopolitical risks; and an appreciation of the US dollar. Although the relative importance of each factor is difficult to pin down. OPEC’s renouncement of price support and rapid expansion of oil supply from unconventional sources appear to have played a crucial role since mid-2014. The oil price drop will lead to substantial income shifts from oil exporters to oil importers resulting in a net positive effect for global activity over the medium term. Although several factors could counteract its impact on global growth and inflation. the drop in oil prices will pose significant challenges for monetary. fiscal. and structural policies.,True,zxtvOKsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,351,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2624398,5696641656332311190,/scholar?cites=5696641656332311190,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/129351/1/823791513.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. we identify 109 episodes of large net private capital inflows to 52 countries over 1987–2007. Episodes of large capital inflows are often associated with real exchange rate appreciations and deteriorating current account balances. More importantly. such episodes tend to be accompanied by an acceleration of GDP growth. but afterwards growth has often dropped significantly. A comprehensive assessment of various policy responses to the large inflow episodes leads to three major conclusions.

While these capital flows have been associated with high growth rates in some developing countries. a number of countries have experienced episodic collapses in growth rates and significant financial crises over the same period. crises that have exacted a serious toll in macroeconomic and social costs. As a result. an intense debate has emerged in both academic and policy circles about the effects of financial integration on developing economies.

It is shown that competitiveness varies greatly across countries. in perhaps surprising ways. and that it is not driven by financial system concentration. Rather. systems with greater foreign entry and fewer entry and activity restrictions tend to be more competitive. confirming that contestability—the lack of barriers to entry and exit—determines effective competition.

1138774,Are lagging regions catching up with leading regions,2010,Ejaz Ghani and Lakshmi Iyer and Saurabh Mishra,,The poor half billion in South Asia,,64-89,,South Asia is home to nearly half a billion poor people. This high level of poverty persists despite the high economic growth in the region over the past decade. Are the economically lagging regions catching up with the leading regions of South Asia or are they falling further behind? The chapter examines the trends regarding convergence and divergence across the regions of South Asia. We consider the trends in several different human development outcomes: income and poverty. health. and education outcomes. Throughout the chapter. we compare these trends with the corresponding trends in a global sample of developing countries to assess whether South Asia conforms to global patterns. A particular concern in this regard is whether poverty acts as a barrier to future growth. generating a ‘poverty trap’. This can occur because poor areas are unable to make the required investments for growth. or because they are not able to generate enough productivity improvements. Several theoretical models have explored how credit constraints or other frictions can prevent required investments in physical or human capital in poor countries. thereby trapping them in poverty (see. among others.

In this framework. Economic Fitness is an innovative approach that improves the mathematical and conceptual scheme. For convenience. these methods were originally conceived on trade in goods. This paper extends the Economic Fitness methodology to include a trade in services element to yield a universal matrix of world trade and thus provide a more complete picture of a country's development and global competitiveness. The paper applies two algorithms to the universal trade in goods and services matrix to contrast country competitiveness and change in complexity and diversification when services are added to the traditional goods-only matrix. The results show that (i) the competitiveness of many countries was previously over-or underestimated. that is. many countries gain or lose positions in the ranking of economic fitness when services trade is considered alongside goods; and (ii) complex services tend to cluster with complex manufacturing. suggesting a common capabilities structure.

1138781,Promoting shared prosperity in South Asia,2013,Ejaz Ghani and Lakshmi Iyer and Saurabh Mishra,110,,,,The World Bank,The geography of poverty has changed. More than 70 percent of the world s poor live not in low-income countries. but in middle-income countries. In 2008. nearly 570 million people lived on less than US$1.25 a day in South Asia. compared to 385 million in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition. nearly 70 percent of the poor people in South Asia live in the lagging regions. Improving the living standards of these regions is crucial to achieving the goal of shared prosperity. Economic growth is not sufficient to enable the lagging regions of South Asia to catch up with the leading regions. in terms of proportional reductions in poverty rates. Policies must be specifically targeted toward achieving greater growth and poverty reduction in these regions. One particular policy channel to achieve shared prosperity is pro-poor fiscal transfers. For the most part. interstate fiscal transfers in South Asian countries do promote equity through transfer of resources to poorer regions. but this outcome usually occurs when pro-poor redistribution has explicit rules and transparency. Further. simply directing financial resources to lagging regions may not be sufficient. and may need to be complemented with increases in capacity. transparency. and participation to facilitate accountability at the local level. Policy makers need to boost shared prosperity and take another look at the millennium development goal paradigm.

How can government policies help the lagging regions to catch up with the leading regions? One obvious way is to provide the right business environment for the private sector to make investments. Tis would include things like improving the regulatory environment. taking steps towards market integration of lagging regions with leading ones. providing connectivity through transport and communication investments. and ensuring macroeconomic stability. Another way is to intervene directly in sectors or locations in which the private sector is reluctant to invest. Such intervention can take many different forms. such as providing subsidies for investments in lagging regions. investing in developing human capital in the lagging regions. or compensating for the regional variation in growth and industry patterns by using transfer payments.

We note that global export basket is increasingly composed of manufacturing versus resources but product specialization has marginally evolved. Many countries have also witnessed an increase in the relative importance of modern services and are benefitting from the ongoing globalization of services. Low income countries (LICs) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have largely failed to share in these trends as a relatively high share of natural resources continue to characterize their exports. Over time. production sophistication (export sophistication in both goods and services) has risen. It has increasingly become an important component of the economic growth process.

As in previous work (Barro 1977. 1978). the stress is on the distinction between anticipated and unanticipated movements of money. The first portion deals with annual data.

Despite the necessity of dealing with pronounced serial correlation of residuals in the equations for unemployment. output. and the price level. the main results are consistent with those obtained from annual data.

Using U.S. data from 1931 to 1987. we test this hypothesis by constructing an index measuring the dispersion among stock prices from different industries. We find that lagged values of this index significantly affect unemployment. We show that the stock market dispersion index is less contaminated by aggregate demand influences than Lilien's employment dispersion index. which makes our test less vulnerable to the Abraham and Katz (1986) critique.,True,VEEthcgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,171,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030439329090059D,4114798824028141740,/scholar?cites=4114798824028141740,,,0,0,0

We find that an accountability system based on a low-level test of basic skills apparently led to generally reduced performance by high-achieving students. while an accountability system based on a more challenging criterion-referenced exam apparently led to improved performance in college on mathematics and other technical subjects.

We show that previous studies using these models have been subject to a number of theoretical and empirical flaws. The result of these flaws has been to overestimate the degree of substitutability between money and near money assets.

With endogenous population. Edgeworth conjectured that the Benthamite principle of maximizing total utility (classical utilitarianism) would lead to a larger population size and a lower standard of living than the Millian principle of maximizing per capita utility (average utilitarianism). One objection to the Benthamite criterion was that its application to a world with finite resources often implied large population size in conjunction with an ‘embarrassingly low’ average standard of living. In a static environment with altruistic parents. this may not be warranted. In a growth situation. this criticism is even less likely to be supported.

In so doing. we hope to shed some light on the problem of economic development posed by Lucas (1988). ie. accounting for the observed diversity across countries. The idea that government policy can induce growth effects and thus diversity in growth rates can be traced to asymmetry in tax policies has been explored quite extensively. With a few exceptions. however. such analysis has been conducted for closed economies without taking account of the growing interaction among countries in the world in terms of commodity trade and capital flows. When capital is internationally mobile. the foreign-source capital income becomes an additional tax base from which the fiscal authorities in both the home and foreign countries can generate tax revenues. As we show in a companion paper (Razin and Yuen. 1992). the tax treatment of this income by the two governments and the degree of capital mobility will determine whether tax-driven growth differences can be preserved in an open economy.

The mechanism at play is that during periods of high uncertainty. firms that are credit constrained switch the composition of investment by reducing productivity-enhancing investment—such as on ICT capital—which is more subject to liquidity risks (Aghion et al.. 2010). The effect is larger during recessions. when financing constraints are more likely to be binding. than during expansions. Our statistical method—a difference-in-difference approach using productivity growth of 25 industries from 18 advanced economies over the period 1985–2010—mitigates concerns with omitted variable bias and reverse causality.

Second. contrary to the negative aggregate demand interpretation in the recent literature. uncertainty shocks acted as a negative aggregate supply shock in the earlier periods.

This paper examines the effects of higher country-specific uncertainty on cross-border banking flows using data from the Bank for International Settlements Locational Banking Statistics. The bilateral structure of this data allows disentangling supply factors from demand factors. thereby helping identify the effect of higher uncertainty on cross-border banking flows from other confounding factors. The results of this analysis suggest that: (i) uncertainty in a source country (domestic economy) is both a lender-specific push and pull factor that robustly predicts a decrease in outflows (cross-border lending) and inflows (cross-border borrowing); (ii) the decline in cross-border borrowing is larger than the …,True,0Vfv_lcAAAAJ:H7P4rdOtXtsC,32,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560619300555,15903806553817390658,/scholar?cites=15903806553817390658,,,0,0,0

To understand this puzzling phenomenon. I propose a credit channel as a propagation mechanism of US financial uncertainty shocks to EMEs. I augment a boom-bust cycle model of EMEs by Schneider and Tornell (Rev Econ Stud 71(3):883–913 2004) with a portfolio choice model of constrained international investors. As international investors pull their money from EMEs—to satisfy their Value-at-Risk constraints—in response to financial uncertainty shocks. borrowing costs increase and domestic credit contracts.

The novelty of our approach is that we distinguish between aggregate and sectoral channels of uncertainty and compare their effects on the unemployment rate. Using S&P500 data we construct both an aggregate measure of time-series volatility in stock returns and a sectoral measure of cross-industry uncertainty in stock returns. We find that an increase in aggregate uncertainty leads to an immediate increase in unemployment. only lasting for three quarters. An increase in sectoral uncertainty leads to a longer-lasting increase in unemployment. with the peak impact occurring after two years. The combination of the two channels can account for the unemployment experience during periods such as the Great Recession when unemployment increased sharply at the outset and remained persistently …,True,0Vfv_lcAAAAJ:AzKEL7Gb_04C,29,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164070415001238,1502196264706951435,/scholar?cites=1502196264706951435,,https://www.imf.org/~/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/_wp1536.ashx,0,0,0

Using the newly available economic policy uncertainty index from six emerging market economies (Brazil. Chile. China. India. Korea. and Russia). we compare the impact of financial uncertainty shocks—measured by stock market volatility—and that of policy uncertainty shocks on the economy. We find that financial uncertainty shocks have much larger and more significant impact on output than policy uncertainty shocks. except for China where the government has direct controls over financial market activity.

But do all industries gain equally from countercyclical fiscal policy? What are the channels through which countercyclical fiscal policy affects industry-level growth? We answer these questions by applying a difference-in-difference approach to an unbalanced panel of 22 manufacturing industries for 55 countries—including both advanced and developing economies—during the period 1970-2014. Among the nine industry characteristics that we consider based on different theoretical channels. we find that the credit constraint channel—proxied by asset fixity—identifies the best transmission mechanism through which countercyclical fiscal policy enhances growth.

We investigate the effect of domestic policy uncertainty on FDI inflows into 16 host countries using the OECD bilateral FDI panel data set and the economic policy uncertainty index from 1985 to 2013. The bilateral structure of the data enables us to disentangle pull factors of FDI from its push factors. thereby obtaining a cleaner causal identification of the higher domestic policy uncertainty effect. To alleviate remaining endogeneity concerns. we use the timing of “exogenous” elections as an instrument.

We test this claim and search for a relevant channel using panel data on sectoral growth for 22 manufacturing industries from 36 advanced and emerging market economies over the period 1990-2014. Our difference-in-difference strategy is based on the theoretical prediction that inflation uncertainty has larger effects in industries that are more credit constrained by increasing effective real borrowing costs. The results show that industries characterized by high external financial dependence. low asset tangibility. and high R&D intensity tend to grow faster in countries with well-anchored inflation expectations.

To the extent to which the effect of bank lending shocks depends critically on firms’ ability to access alternative sources of financing. the rapid development in public debt markets from the 1980s might have weakened this effect. Indeed. we confirm that the effect of bank lending shocks on output has decreased significantly since the 1980s. Consistent with the financial innovation-based explanation of such reduced effects of bank lending shocks. we find that their effects on corporate bond markets have substantially changed as well.

First. the response of hours worked (and employment) to a permanent technology shock-identified by a structural VAR model with long-run restrictions-is smaller in developing economies than in advanced economies. Second. the level of PPP-adjusted income per capita-a proxy for the importance of subsistence consumption-is strongly and robustly associated with the relative variability of employment and consumption to output across countries.

By estimating the dynamic response of US cross-border bank lending towards 45 recipient countries to exogenous domestic fiscal shocks (both measured by spending and revenue) between 1990Q1 and 2012Q4. we find that expansionary domestic fiscal shocks lead to a statistically significant increase in cross-border bank lending and the size of the effect is comparable to an exogenous decline in the federal funds rate by about 25 bp (50 bp) for spending (revenue) shocks.

We apply a state-dependent local projection method to the exogenous tax shock series by Romer and Romer (2010) and find that a tax cut strongly stimulates the output when households are highly indebted. The expansionary effect of a tax cut in the period of high household debt is particularly significant for (i) consumption than investment;(ii) a personal income tax than a corporate income tax;(iii) during bad times than good times. These findings support household indebtedness as a measure of liquidity constraint for wealthy hand-to-mouth households at the macro-level. In response to a tax cut. households increase (decrease) labor supply when they are highly indebted (not indebted). This lack of a neoclassical wealth effect further contributes to an increase in the output. The state-dependent effects of tax policy. which influence the disposable income of the household directly. are more notable than those of the government spending policy. lending further support to the role of the household liquidity constraint channel of tax policy.,True,0Vfv_lcAAAAJ:dL6bBWYs_hoC,0,ftp://165.132.78.176/repec/yon/wpaper/2020rwp-178.pdf,,,,ftp://165.132.78.176/repec/yon/wpaper/2020rwp-178.pdf,0,0,0

Financial Markets. and Monetary Policy over the Last Century,2019,Sangyup Choi and Chansik Yoon,,Available at SSRN 3386824,,,,What has been the effect of uncertainty shocks in the US economy over the last century? What are the historical roles of the financial channel and monetary policy channel in propagating uncertainty shocks? Our empirical strategies enable us to distinguish between the effects of uncertainty shocks on key macroeconomic and financial variables transmitted through each channel. A hundred years of data further allow us to answer these questions from a novel historical perspective. This paper finds robust evidence that financial conditions have played a crucial role in propagating uncertainty shocks over the last century. supporting many theoretical and empirical studies emphasizing the role of financial frictions in understanding uncertainty shocks. However. heightened uncertainty does not amplify the adverse effect of financial shocks. suggesting an asymmetric interaction between uncertainty and financial shocks. Interestingly. the stance of monetary policy seems to play only a minor role in propagating uncertainty shocks. which is in sharp contrast to the recent claim that binding zero-lower-bound amplifies the negative effect of uncertainty shocks. We argue that the contribution of constrained monetary policy to amplifying uncertainty shocks is largely masked by the joint concurrence of binding zero-lower-bound and tightened financial conditions.,True,0Vfv_lcAAAAJ:lw-us_wcTJgC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3386824,,,,ftp://165.132.78.176/repec/yon/wpaper/2019rwp-142.pdf,0,0,0

While the key finding from Agca and Celasun (2012) that higher public external debt is associated with higher private borrowing costs is confirmed during the pre-crisis sample. we find that such a relationship no longer holds after the global financial crisis. implying another new normal in the second phase of global liquidity.,True,0Vfv_lcAAAAJ:WTQy_8Ay2UsC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7684284976839612855&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0
1138865,Essays on Financial Market Volatility and Real Economic Activity,2015,Sang Yup Choi,,,,,,"This dissertation studies how financial market volatility or uncertainty in the U.S. economy affects real economic activity both in the U.S. and other open economies. Chapter 1 critically examines a stylized fact about the effects of uncertainty shocks on the U.S. economy. A link between uncertainty and firms' investment. hiring. and production decisions has drawn much attention in contemporary discussions after the 2008 financial crisis. Bloom (2009) showed that uncertainty events. identified by spikes in stock market volatility. triggered immediate falls in output and employment. followed by rapid rebounds. I show that such stock market volatility shocks failed to produce this same pattern of responses after 1983. Chapter 2 studies the effects of risk aversion shocks. measured by increases in the VIX . on emerging market economies (EMEs). By estimating a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model. I find that. although risk aversion shocks do not have much impact on U.S. output. they do have a noticeable impact on the output of EMEs. To explain the contrast between the impact of risk appetite shocks on EMEs and the impact on the U.S. economy. a credit channel is proposed as a propagation mechanism. In the model. an increase in the VIX is translated to a risk-aversion shock that generates a ""flight to quality."" As international investors pull their money from EMEs. borrowing costs increase and domestic credit falls as a consequence of credit market imperfections. Higher borrowing costs. in turn. lead to a fall in investment that causes a real depreciation and a decline in total output through sectoral linkages. Finally. Chapter 3. which is co-authored …",True,0Vfv_lcAAAAJ:Aul-kAQHnToC,0,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5sc558cp,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt5sc558cp/qt5sc558cp.pdf,0,0,0
1138866,An Anatomy of Credit Booms: Evidence from Macro Aggregates and Micro Data,2008,Enrique G Mendoza and Marco E Terrones,,,w14049,,National Bureau of Economic Research,This paper proposes a methodology for measuring credit booms and uses it to identify credit booms in emerging and industrial economies over the past four decades. In addition. we use event study methods to identify the key empirical regularities of credit booms in macroeconomic aggregates and micro-level data. Macro data show a systematic relationship between credit booms and economic expansions. rising asset prices. real appreciations. widening external deficits and managed exchange rates. Micro data show a strong association between credit booms and firm-level measures of leverage. firm values. and external financing. and bank-level indicators of banking fragility. Credit booms in industrial and emerging economies show three major differences:(1) credit booms and the macro and micro fluctuations associated with them are larger in emerging economies. particularly in the nontradables sector;(2) not all credit booms end in financial crises. but most emerging markets crises were associated with credit booms; and (3) credit booms in emerging economies are often preceded by large capital inflows but not by financial reforms or productivity gains.,True,Vk3szEgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,903,https://www.nber.org/papers/w14049,313995425179828615,/scholar?cites=313995425179828615,,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w14049/w14049.pdf,0,0,0

NJ: American Economic Association. 1911,The phenomenon of globalization. which refers to the rising trade and financial integration of the world economy. has gathered steam in recent decades. The growth rate of world trade has been greater than that of world output in almost all years since 1960. and the cumulative increase in the volume of world trade is almost three times larger than that of world output over this period. A more dramatic element in the process of globalization has been the surge in cross-border capital flows over the last two decades. Since the early 1980’s. gross capital flows have jumped from less than 5 percent to approximately 20 percent of GDP for advanced countries. For emerging markets. gross capital flows have increased almost fourfold over the same period and now account for roughly 5 percent of GDP in these economies. 1 What is the impact of globalization on the synchronization of business cycles across countries?

Yet empirical research has had limited success in uncovering this relationship. This paper reexamines the issue in light of broader data and a new modeling approach that incorporates two key features of the theory. Unlike previous studies. we model inflation as non-linearly related to fiscal deficits through the inflation tax base and estimate this relationship as intrinsically dynamic. using panel techniques that explicitly distinguish between short- and long-run effects of fiscal deficits.

Following the largest housing bubble of modern history. Japan experienced a massive asset market crash in the early 1990s that marked the start of its “Lost Decade.” After prolonged credit booms. many emerging countries in Asia faced major financial crises in the second half of the 1990s.

Foreign reserves have grown very rapidly since then. as if those countries were practicing a New Mercantilism that views foreign reserves as a war chest for defense against Sudden Stops. This paper conducts a quantitative assessment of this argument using a stochastic intertemporal equilibrium framework in which precautionary foreign asset demand is driven by output variability. financial globalization. and Sudden Stop risk. In this framework. credit constraints produce endogenous Sudden Stops. We find that financial globalization and Sudden Stop risk can explain the surge in reserves but output variability cannot.

This paper answers this question by applying a method proposed in our earlier work for measuring and identifying credit booms to data for 61 emerging and industrial countries over the 1960-2010 period. We identify 70 credit boom events. half of them in each group of countries. Event analysis shows a systematic relationship between credit booms and a boom-bust cycle in production and absorption. asset prices. real exchange rates. capital inflows. and external deficits. Credit booms are synchronized internationally and show three striking similarities in industrial and emerging economies:(1) credit booms are similar in duration and magnitude. normalized by the cyclical variability of credit;(2) banking crises. currency crises or Sudden Stops often follow credit booms. and they do so at similar frequencies in industrial and emerging economies; and (3) credit booms often follow surges in capital inflows.

To address these questions. we first estimate the global components in house prices and various macroeconomic and financial variables. We then evaluate the roles played by a variety of global shocks. including shocks to interest rates. monetary policy. productivity. credit. and uncertainty. in explaining house price fluctuations using a wide range of FAVAR models. We find that house prices are synchronized across countries. and the degree of synchronization has increased over time.

Ayhan Kose and Paolo Mauro and Jonathan Ostry and Martin Schindler and Marco E. Terrones,,,,229-272,International Monetary Fund,Financial globalization has increased dramatically over the past three decades. particularly for advanced economies. while emerging market and developing countries experienced more moderate increases. Divergences across countries stem from different capital control regimes. as well as from a range of persistent factors. including different degrees of institutional quality and domestic financial development. While. in principle. financial globalization should enhance international risk sharing. reduce macroeconomic volatility. and foster economic growth. in practice its effects are less clear-cut. Countries gain or lose from financial integration depending on their domestic economic and institutional conditions. The results in this Occasional Paper are broadly supportive of an approach envisaging a gradual and orderly sequencing of external financial liberalization and emphasizing the desirability of complementary reforms in macroeconomic policy framework and the domestic financial system as essential components of a successful liberalization strategy.

Empirical work relating it to macroeconomic variables has had only limited success in explaining the phenomenon. This paper presents a two-currency banking model to show that deposit and loan dollarization are determined by a broader set of factors. These include interest rates and exchange rate risk. as well as structural factors related to costly banking. credit market imperfections. and availability of tradable collateral.

How Soon and How Strong?,2014,Prakash Kannan and Alasdair Scott and Marco E Terrones,,,,239-274,International Monetary Fund,The global economy experienced its deepest downturn in the post-World War II period as the 2007–09 financial crisis rapidly spread around the world. A large number of advanced economies fell into recession. and economies in the rest of the world slowed abruptly. Global trade and financial flows shrank. while output and employment losses mounted. Credit markets remained frozen as borrowers engaged in a drawn-out deleveraging process and banks struggled to improve their financial health.Many aspects of the current crisis were new and unanticipated. 1 Uniquely. the disruption combined a financial crisis at the heart of the world’s largest economy with a global downturn. But financial crises—episodes during which there is widespread disruption to financial institutions and the functioning of financial markets—are not new. 2 Nor are globally synchronized downturns. Therefore. history can be a useful guide to understanding the present. To put the recession caused by the 2007–09 global crisis in historical perspective. some broad questions about the nature of recessions and recoveries and the role of countercyclical policies are addressed in this chapter.

Even with important gaps in the data. the empirical literature is able to conclude that offshore outsourcing is unlikely to have accounted for a meaningful part of the job losses in the recent downturn or contributed much to the slow labor market rebound.

The standard theory of the size of government in a representative democracy links the tax burden to measures of the pre-tax income inequality.

Treasury officials recognized the dangers arising from mounting foreclosures and worked to facilitate limited mortgage modifications. but going further was politically unacceptable because public funds would have gone to some irresponsible borrowers.

There has recently been some success in implementing these theories using calibration models. Dixit (1988) applies a calibrated model to US.-Japan competition in the automobile industry. He uses a conjectural variations (CV) approach to capture firm interactions. where the conjectures result from use of profit maximization equations calibrated to market data.

We develop a majority-voting model which focuses on the effect of aging on this dilemma. Surprisingly. the theory predicts that tax rates on capital income could actually rise as the population ages. even though older individuals would be expected to own more capital than the young and thus vote against higher taxes. We then confront the key prediction of the model with panel data for ten European Union countries. over the period 1970–1996. We investigate the asymmetric effect of aging on the taxation of capital and labor. The implications of the model are shown to be consistent with panel data. JEL no. H0. H5.

Disagreement about prices rises with their level. declines under independent central banks. and both its level and its sensitivity to macroeconomic variables are larger in countries where central banks became independent only around the mid-1990s.

Forecast dispersion is positively correlated with the volatility of macroeconomic variables. but not necessarily with the level of the same variables.

As opposed to the benchmark rational expectation models. households in the sticky information environment update their expectations sporadically rather than instantaneously owing to the costs of acquiring and processing information.

Instead. the empirical evidence is more in line with implications of"" noisy"" information models (Woodford. 2002; Sims. 2003).

A lower level of variance in an autoregressive model of output growth can be either due to a change in the structure of the economy (a change in the propagation mechanism) or a reduced error term variance (reduced impulses). In Germany the decline output volatility is due to a decline in the persistence of the growth process. This is in contrast to the US results. where a break in the variance seems to dominate the decline in persistence. A change in the conduct of monetary policy (the establishment of another monetary policy regime) could be part of an explanation for the change in propagation.

1138956,Can the precautionary motive explain the chinese corporate savings puzzle? evidence from the liquid assets perspective,2011,Yi Huang,,"International Monetary Fund, Working Paper",,,,China’s national savings rate as of 2009 was more than twice the overall world rate and finds few historic parallels among other economies. It has increased more than 15 percentage points. from 39% to 54% of GDP over the past five years (IMF. 2010). The extraordinarily high savings rate. which is determined by various economic and institutional factors. results in a large gap between savings and investment. and. therefore. massive current account surplus and global imbalance1. Why is the savings rate so high? Not only is the question challenging. but it also has important policy implications2. However. previous studies have mainly focused only on household savings in China (Modigliani and Cao. 2004; Chamon and Prasad. 2010).Several studies find that the real driver of the recent Chinese savings boom is the corporate sector. in which savings shot up to more than 26% of GDP in 2007 from about 15% of GDP at the beginning of the decade (Anderson. 2009). Savings in the corporate sector increased relative to savings in other sectors. According to the IMF (2010). the rise in corporate savings reflects a combination of rapid growth. limited competition. financial underdevelopment. and low input costs. Despite high profits. Chinese firms pay very low dividends in comparison with firms in both developed and emerging markets (Porter et al.. 2009). Therefore. the IMF suggests that China should manage high corporate savings by raising the costs of factor inputs (including capital). widening corporate ownership. boosting dividend payouts. and increasing competition in domestic markets.,True,2swp1kgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,14,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.406.2844&rep=rep1&type=pdf,16065589842477973945,/scholar?cites=16065589842477973945,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.406.2844&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

We also show that these responses are determined by the degree to which firms are directly and indirectly exposed to US-China trade through the global value chains. In particular. US firms that are more dependent on exports to and imports from China have lower stock returns and higher default risk around the announcement dates. whereas the reduced import competition from China has a limited effect on the firms. We also find consistent patterns of stock market reactions by Chinese firms. Two reverse experiments in 2019 further validate how the complex structure of global trade shapes stock market reactions to policy shocks.,True,2swp1kgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,13,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3504602,17527840683159512260,/scholar?cites=17527840683159512260,,https://repec.cepr.org/repec/cpr/ceprdp/DP14173.pdf,0,0,0

In China. MW policies vary across more than 2.800 counties. We exploit the MW policy discontinuities at county borders and explore how MWs affect firms located around shared borders of any two adjacent counties that are subject to different MWs. We find that corporate investments increase as a result of MW hikes. The effect is stronger for firms that are labor-intensive. that cannot sufficiently pass labor cost on to consumers. that have better access to finance. and that are located in regions with better contract enforcement. Our findings are explained by a capital-labor substitution hypothesis: firms make more investments in fixed assets and adopt new technologies to offset growing labor costs caused by the higher wage floor. We also document a positive effect of MWs on long-term debts. suggesting the increase in investment is externally financed.,True,2swp1kgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,6,https://cicm.pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn/Public/Uploads/upload/cicm_paper/Firm%20Pricing%20and%20Investment-02-Sibo%20Liu.pdf,11926578124971427821,/scholar?cites=11926578124971427821,,https://cicm.pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn/Public/Uploads/upload/cicm_paper/Firm%20Pricing%20and%20Investment-02-Sibo%20Liu.pdf,0,0,0

1138965,Impact of uncertainty shocks on the global economy,2017,Laurent Ferrara and Menzie Chinn and Raffaella Giacomini,,,hal-01636762,,,Uncertainty shocks originating in emerging markets or stemming from specific policies in advanced economies can have major repercussions for the global economy. It is important to invest in studying the issues of uncertainty in an open economy. as certain key variables of the global economy (such as capital flows and exchange rates) appear especially vulnerable to uncertainty shocks. This special issue gathers some recent papers on the topic but obviously a lot remains to be done as regards research in this area. in order for example to disentangle the channels of cross-border spillovers from uncertainty shocks. Building theoretical models to properly account for such transmission of shocks is challenging. Last. one of the empirical difficulties economists face is how to clearly identify uncertainty shocks given that they often occur in parallel with other shocks. notably financial ones. Those issues are clearly topics for future research.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.),True,2swp1kgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,5,https://ideas.repec.org/p/hal/journl/hal-01636762.html,4841502797910537858,/scholar?cites=4841502797910537858,,,0,0,0

On 10 July 2018. it raised the stakes by imposing tariffs of 10% on an additional set of Chinese imports worth $200 billion. Both times. the Chinese government retaliated immediately. imposing tariffs on US imports of similar value. Two recent studies find that US tariffs on China have led to a significant welfare loss (about $7.8 billion. or 0.04% of US GDP) and significant increases in consumer prices in the US. due to an almost complete pass-through of the tariffs to US prices (Amiti et al. 2019. Fajgelbaum et al. 2019).In a recent study. we evaluate firms’ equity market responses to the various trade war announcements by both the US and Chinese governments in 2018 and 2019 (Huang et al. 2018). We find that within an industry. firms’ reactions to the announcements are heterogeneous. depending on their direct and indirect exposure to US–China trade. More specifically. US publicly listed firms that are more dependent on exports to and imports from China showed lower equity returns but higher default risks in the threeday window around 22 March–the day President Trump signed the first executive memorandum imposing tariffs on Chinese exports. Chinese publicly listed firms that are more reliant on the US as a market for final sales (but not inputs) were also affected significantly more than firms with no direct exposure within the same industry.

The net foreign assets of China. which are mainly dominated by foreign reserve assets and foreign direct investment liabilities. have grown rapidly since its entry to the World Trade Organization in 2001 and exceeded 14 percent of its gross domestic product at the end of 2016. In contrast. the excess returns of gross assets over gross liabilities. which mostly correspond to the sizable capital gains from the latter. are negative. These results occur mainly because of the composition effect between risky liabilities and safe assets. where China takes a short position in equity and a long position in debt.

To achieve this goal the paper analyses and extends the early warning system developed by Kaminsky. Lizondo and Reinhart (1998) and Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) that is based on the ‘signal’ approach. This system monitors several indicators that tend to exhibit an unusual behaviour in the periods preceding a crisis. When an indicator exceeds (or falls below) a threshold. then it is said to issue a ‘signal’ that a currency crisis may occur within a given period. The model does a fairly good job of anticipating some of the crises in 1997/1998. but several weaknesses to the approach are identified. The paper also evaluates how this system can be applied to an individual country.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Annual data from Norway and the United Kingdom from 1874 to 1971 are used to reassess the empirical performance of the purchasing power parity (PPP) doctrine.

The data are comprehensive. security-level holdings of emerging market equities by U.S. investors. We document that at a point in time U.S. portfolios are tilted towards firms that are large. have fewer restrictions on foreign ownership. or are cross-listed on a U.S. exchange. The size of the cross-listing effect is striking. In contrast to the well-documented under-weighting of foreign stocks. emerging market equities that are cross-listed on a U.S. exchange are incorporated into U.S. portfolios at full international CAPM weights.

Assessing links between China and other Asian economies,1999,John Fernald and Hali Edison and Prakash Loungani,18,Journal of International Money and Finance,4,515-535,Pergamon,Several commentators have suggested that competition from China—in particular its 1994 `devaluation' and strong export performance during 1994–95—may have contributed to the Asian crisis of 1997–98. We provide evidence against this view. We show that the devaluation was not important in economic terms. and China's strong export performance in 1994–95 was matched by other Asian economies. We also show that the period 1993 and 1996 was marked by relative stability in the export shares of China and other Asian economies in various geographical regions and industries.

1138989,Was China the First Domino?: Assessing Links Between China and the Rest of Emerging Asia,1998,John G Fernald and Hali J Edison and Prakash Loungani,,Assessing Links between China and the Rest of Emerging Asia (March 1998),,,,We assess links between China and the rest of emerging Asia. Some commentators have argued that China's apparent devaluation in 1994 may have contributed to the Asian financial crisis. We argue that the devaluation was not economically important: The more relevant exchange rate was a floating rate that was not devalued. and high Chinese inflation has led to a very sharp real appreciation of the currency. Although in principle export competition with China could nevertheless have placed pressure on other Asian exporters. we argue that the striking feature of the data is the common movement between export growth from China and from other developing Asian economies. To the extent there is evidence of export competition. it is the period from about 1989 to 1993: China's exchange rate depreciated sharply. Chinese export growth exceeded export growth of other Asian economies. and the composition of Asian exports (measured by export shares of various goods to the United States and other industrial economies) changed substantially. Finally. we speculate on the effects of the Asian crisis on China's prospects. China's economic growth is likely to slow because of increased trade competition as a result of the devaluation of other Asian currencies and because of reduced capital inflows. In addition. these reduced inflows are likely to reduce job creation in the non-state sector and. hence. make enterprise restructuring more difficult in China.,True,qPVZxn8AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,104,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=94960,13842367736309624341,/scholar?cites=13842367736309624341,,https://www.federalreserve.gov/PubS/ifdp/1998/604/ifdp604.pdf,0,0,0

The main conclusions derived from the large model are: (1) that exchange-rate-oriented monetary policy could have curbed misalignments without undermining counterinflation policy. but (2) a major impact on current balances would have required compensatory fiscal policy as well.

However. many of the peptides and their analogues do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) efficiently. Nanoparticles such as iron oxide can cross the BBB. and here we describe a novel method for the conjugation of a peptide antisauvagine-30 (ASV-30) to iron oxide nanoparticles. Previous research has shown that direct infusion of ASV-30 into the brain reduces anxiety-like behavior in animal models via actions on corticotropin releasing factor type 2 (CRF2) receptors. Therefore. we tested whether iron oxide+ASV-30 complexes cross the BBB of rats and then determined whether iron oxide+ASV-30 nanoparticles are localized with CRF2-expressing neurons. Finally we tested the hypothesis that systemic infusion of iron oxide+ASV-30 can reduce anxiety-like behavior.

The integrity of the cubic mesoporous phase was retained even at relatively high loadings of titania. The TiO 2-MCM-48 materials were extensively characterized by a variety of physico-chemical techniques.

The relative amount of Ti 4+ ions in tetrahedral position was dependent on the order of addition of the precursor. Even at relatively high loadings of titania. no distinct bulk phase of titania could be observed indicating that the titania nanoclusters are well dispersed on the high surface area mesoporous material and probably exist as amorphous nanoclusters.

These studies demonstrate that ZnO nanoparticles have a wide range of antibacterial activities toward various microorganisms that are commonly found in environmental settings. The antibacterial activity of the ZnO nanoparticles was inversely proportional to the size of the nanoparticles in S. aureus.

In this study. a linear relationship between the pseudo-first-order rate constant (kobs) for polyhalogenated alkane reduction and iron mass loading (ρm) was only obtained when reduction appeared to be mass-transport-limited.

While a detailed explanation for this nonlinearity remains unclear. the reaction order in ρm (from plots of log(kobs) versus log(ρm)) approached unity as the system pH decreased. suggesting that the behavior may be linked to changes in the thickness of a passive oxide overlayer.

Remarkably higher iron and titanium leaching rates were observed when compared with normal ilmenite in 5.0 M HCl at 30 °C and 6.0 M H2SO4 at 110 °C. respectively. Roasting of ilmenite with ZnO or ZnS converts acid resistant FeTiO3 to more reactive Fe2O3 and Zn2TiO4. resulting in enhanced leaching. Roasting FeTiO3 with ZnS generates SO2 as a byproduct. which can be used to produce H2SO4 acid required in the sulfate process. Added ZnO or ZnS can be recovered as ZnO. therefore the overall process acts as a catalytic decomposition of FeTiO3.

A novel approach for the processing of the Raman spectroscopy data was employed. It was found that in particular cases. the various parameters of the Raman spectra can be assigned to fractions of the films with different thicknesses. In particular. such quantities as the full width at half maximum of the 2D peak and the position of the 2D graphene band were successfully applied for the elaborated approach. Both the G-and 2D-band positions of single layer fractions were blue-shifted. which could be associated with the nitrogen doping of studied films. The XPS study revealed the characteristics of incorporated nitrogen. which was found to have a binding energy around 402 eV. Moreover. based on the statistical analysis of spectral parameters and the observation of a G-resonance. the twisted nature of the double-layer fraction of graphene grown with a lower hydrogen feeding rate was demonstrated.

Both natural phenomena and human activities affect the cleanliness of air. In the last decade. many countries experienced an unprecedented industrial growth. resulting in changing air quality values. and correspondingly. affecting our life quality. Air quality can be accessed by employing microchips that qualitatively and quantitatively determine the present gases and dust particles. The so-called particular matter 2.5 (PM2. 5) values are of high importance. as such small particles can penetrate the human lung barrier and enter the blood system. There are cancer cases related to many air pollutants. and especially to PM2. 5. contributing to exploding costs within the healthcare system. We focus on various current and potential future air pollutants. and propose solutions on how to protect our health against such dangerous substances. Recent developments in the Organ-on-Chip (OoC) technology can be used to study air pollution as well. OoC allows determination of pollutant toxicity and speeds up the development of novel pharmaceutical drugs.

One of these artifacts is the loss of contact between the probe tip and the sample. We propose to apply an additional nonlinear force on the upper surface of a cantilever. which will help to keep the tip and surface in contact. In practice. this force can be produced by the precisely regulated airflow. Such an improvement affects the AFM system dynamics. which were evaluated using a mathematical model that is presented in this paper. The model defines the relationships between the additional nonlinear force. the pressure of the applied air stream. and the initial air gap between the upper surface of the cantilever and the end of the air duct. It was found that the nonlinear force created by the stream of compressed air (aerodynamic force) prevents the contact loss caused by the high scanning speed or the higher surface roughness. thus maintaining stable contact between the probe and the surface. This improvement allows us to effectively increase the scanning speed by at least 10 times using a soft (spring constant of 0.2 N/m) cantilever by applying the air pressure of 40 Pa. If a stiff cantilever (spring constant of 40 N/m) is used. the potential of vertical deviation improvement is twice is large. This method is suitable for use with different types of AFM sensors and it can be implemented practically without essential changes in AFM sensor design.

1139254,Increasing the observability of the thin films manufacturing process,2004,D Viržonis and V Sinkevičius,53,Elektronika ir Elektrotechnika,4,,,Thermal evaporation of solids is a technology of most common use during the industrial manufacturing of thin condensed films. The qualitatively new requirements for these films call to investigate a new common ways to improve the controllability and observability of the manufacturing process. The dynamic measurement of the electrical properties of the resistive evaporator power circuit is thought to be a reasonable solution for the observability improvement. An experimental data and the mathematical modeling of the evaporator power circuit and the thermal interaction between the evaporator and the evaporating material are described. The mathematical description of an entire process allows distinguishing between the informative and non-informative quantities measured. It is concluded that presented method is sufficient for in-situ evaporator temperature measurement during the manufacturing process. It does not require for the add-on instrumentation in the vacuum chamber of the evaporation system. therefore is acceptable for application in industrial conditions.

Additionally. multistep pathways require mechanisms that enable the sequential addition of reactants and purification of intermediates that are consistent with reasonable geochemical scenarios. Here. we show that 2-aminothiazole reacts selectively with two-and three-carbon sugars (glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde. respectively). which results in their accumulation and purification as stable crystalline aminals. This permits ribonucleotide synthesis. even from complex sugar mixtures. Remarkably. aminal formation also overcomes the thermodynamically favoured isomerization of glyceraldehyde into dihydroxyacetone because only the aminal of glyceraldehyde separates from the equilibrating mixture.

Changes in the amounts of sulphate. nitrate. and chloride mixed with dust particles correlate with air masses from different source regions. The uptake of secondary acids depended on the individual dust particle mineralogy; high amounts of nitrate accumulated on calcium-rich dust while high amounts of sulphate accumulated on aluminosilicate-rich dust. Oxidation of S(IV) to S(VI) by iron in the aluminosilicate dust is a possible explanation for this enrichment of sulphate. which has important consequences for the fertilization of remote oceans by soluble iron. This study shows the segregation of sulphate from nitrate and chloride in individual aged dust particles for the first time. A transport and aging timeline provides an explanation for the observed segregation. Our data suggests that sulphate became mixed with the dust first. This implies that the transport pathway is more important than the reaction kinetics in determining which species accumulate on mineral dust. Early in the study. dust particles in volcanically influenced air masses were mixed predominately with sulphate. Dust mixed with chloride then dominated over sulphate and nitrate when a major dust front reached the R. V. Ronald Brown.

Soot aerosols represent a major research focus as they influence climate by absorbing incoming solar radiation resulting in a highly uncertain warming effect. The uncertainty stems from the fact that the actual amount soot warms our atmosphere strongly depends on the manner and degree in which it is mixed with other species. a property referred to as mixing state.

A series of portable multi-staged air cleaner efficiency tests were performed examining tobacco smoke as a source of pollution. Portable indoor air cleaners were effective in removing of particles. reaching up to 97% removal efficiency based on particle number concentrations after 30 minutes. while Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADRPNC) varied from 37 ± 4 to 237 ± 11 m3 h–1. The removal of VOCs varied from 21.4 to 45.7% and CADRVOC ranged from 2.2 ± 0.3 to 29.9 ± 2.8 m3 h–1. indicating substantially lower efficiency.

Since free iron concentrations are extremely low in airway surface liquid (ASL). we hypothesize that CFA impairs antimicrobial peptides (AMP) function and can be a source of iron to bacteria. We tested this hypothesis in vivo by instilling mice with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA01) and CFA and determine the percentage of bacterial clearance. In addition. we tested bacterial clearance in cell culture by exposing primary human airway epithelial cells to PA01 and CFA and determining the AMP activity and bacterial growth in vitro. We report that CFA is a bioavailable source of iron for bacteria. We show that CFA interferes with bacterial clearance in vivo and in primary human airway epithelial cultures. Also. we demonstrate that CFA inhibits AMP activity in vitro. which we propose as a mechanism of our cell culture and in vivo results. Furthermore. PA01 uses CFA as an iron source with a direct correlation between CFA iron dissolution and bacterial growth. CFA concentrations used are very relevant to human daily exposures. thus posing a potential public health risk for susceptible subjects. Although CFA provides a source of bioavailable iron for bacteria. not all CFA particles have the same biological effects. and their propensity for iron dissolution is an important factor.

In this study. chemical imaging of fly ash has been performed using a dual-beam focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM) system for a better understanding of how simulated atmospheric processing can modify the morphology. chemical composition and element distribution within individual particles. A novel approach has been applied for cross-sectioning fly ash particles with the FIB in order to explore element distribution within the interior of individual particles. Our results indicate that simulated atmospheric processing can cause disintegration of aluminosilicate glass. a dominant material in fly ash particles.

To address this. we measured concentrations of 11–16 nm diameter particles from ground level to 1000 m during the 2013 New Particle Formation Study at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site in Lamont. Oklahoma. The measurements were performed using a tethered balloon carrying two condensation particle counters that were configured for two different particle cut-off diameters. These observations were compared to data from three scanning mobility particle sizers at the ground level. We observed that 11–16 nm diameter particles were generated at the top region of the boundary layer. and were then rapidly mixed throughout the boundary layer. We also estimate liquid water content of nanoparticles using ground-based measurements of particle hygroscopicity obtained with a Humidified Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer and vertically resolved relative humidity (RH) and temperature measured with a Raman lidar. Our analyses of these observations lead to the following conclusions regarding nanoparticles formed during NPF events at this site: (1) ground-based observations may not always accurately represent the timing. distribution. and meteorological conditions associated with the onset of NPF; (2) nanoparticles are highly hygroscopic and typically contain up to 50 % water by volume. and during conditions of high RH combined with high particle hygroscopicity. particles can be up to 95 % water by volume; (3) increased …,True,krTSwicAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,15,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/311/2018/,16480342774206795990,/scholar?cites=16480342774206795990,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/311/2018/,0,0,0

In this paper the investigation of the reaction of SO2 on the surface of mixed particles composed of Fe2O3 and NaCl was made by means of DRIFTS and XPS and the corresponding reactive uptake coefficients were calculated. The main products were sulfate/bisulfate and the minor product was sulfite/bisulfite. It was shown that the reaction rates with SO2 are correlated with zero order kinetis. The reactive uptake coefficient for SO2 oxidation by O2 was determined. Different proportions of NaCl resulted in distinct reaction abilities. With increasing the proportion of NaCl. the BET uptake coefficient increased at first and decreased afterwards. When NaCl accounted for 70% of the mixture. the BET uptake coefficient accounted to 4.62× 10-6. which is 8.07 times as much as that of pure α-Fe2O3 (5.72× 10-7). The FeCl2-SO-3 formed and served as a temporal reservoir of sulfur species. which can be used to explain the experiment results. The mixture shows a significant capacity to scavenge SO2. it is important to implicate the heterogeneous gas-to-particle conversion mechanism of atmospheric SO2. reevaluate the impact involving mineral dust mixed with sea salt and the influence of the aerosol radiative forcing and the sulfate cooling effect.,True,krTSwicAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,1,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-GDXH200707032.htm,9762604353482811109,/scholar?cites=9762604353482811109,,,0,0,0

The desolvation effects and intra‐protein interactions. which cause variations in pKa values of protein ionizable groups. are empirically related to the positions and chemical nature of the groups proximate to the pKa sites. A computer program is written to automatically predict pKa values based on these empirical relationships within a couple of seconds. Unusual pKa values at buried active sites. which are among the most interesting protein pKa values. are predicted very well with the empirical method.

One of the more widely used approaches for predicting pKa values in proteins is the PROPKA program. which provides convenient structural rationalization of the predicted pKa values without any additional calculations. The PROPKA Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a new tool for studying the pH-dependent properties of proteins such as charge and stabilization energy. It facilitates a quantitative analysis of pKa values of ionizable residues together with their structural determinants by providing a direct link between the pKa data. predicted by the PROPKA calculations. and the structure via the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program. The GUI also calculates contributions to the pH-dependent unfolding free energy at a given pH for each ionizable group in the protein. Moreover. the PROPKA-computed pKa values or energy contributions of the ionizable residues in question can be displayed interactively. The PROPKA GUI can also be used for comparing pH-dependent properties of more than one structure at the same time. The GUI considerably extends the analysis and validation possibilities of the PROPKA approach. The PROPKA GUI can conveniently be used to investigate ionizable groups. and their interactions. of residues with significantly perturbed pKa values or residues that contribute to the stabilization energy the most. Charge-dependent properties can be studied either for a single protein or …,True,lOz-SVQAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,271,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-11-6,5061072461061980949,/scholar?cites=5061072461061980949,,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-11-6,0,0,0

A chemical bond that has received considerable attention due to its importance in biological phenomena and in the relations between gas and condensed phases is the hydrogen bond. typically a relatively weak interaction involving an electronegative donor X. a hydrogen. and the electronegative acceptor Y:RXH and R′-Y are commonly (although not necessarily) separately identifiable molecules bound together by the weak hydrogen-bonding interaction.

An approach for studying intermolecular interactions is to employ a model potential. Such potentials. broadly referred to as “molecular mechanics” (MM). can generally not account for bond breaking but can. in principle. account for a range of intermolecular interactions. The effective fragment potential (EFP) is an accurate method for treating the broad range of intermolecular interactions. at a small fraction of the cost of ab initio calculations that produce comparable accuracy.

We sought to determine whether ZnO NPs induce pulmonary toxicity in mice following sub-acute or sub-chronic inhalation exposure to realistic exposure doses. Mice (C57Bl/6) were exposed to well-characterized ZnO NPs (3.5 mg/m3. 4 hr/day) for 2 (sub-acute) or 13 (sub-chronic) weeks and necropsied immediately (0 wk) or 3 weeks (3 wks) post exposure. Toxicity was assessed by enumeration of total and differential cells. determination of total protein. lactate dehydrogenase activity and inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as well as measurements of pulmonary mechanics. Generation of reactive oxygen species was assessed in the lungs. Lungs were evaluated for histopathologic changes and Zn content. Zn concentration in blood. liver. kidney. spleen. heart. brain and BAL fluid was measured. An elevated concentration of Zn2+ was detected in BAL fluid immediately after exposures. but returned to baseline levels 3 wks post exposure.

Measurements using a Monitor for AeRosols and GAses (MARGA) revealed two periods of high aerosol nitrate (NO3−) concentrations during the campaign. These periods of high nitrate were correlated with increased concentrations of supermicron crustal and sea spray aerosol species. particularly Na+ and Ca2+. and with a shift towards aerosol with larger (1 to 2.5 μm) diameters. We suggest this nitrate aerosol forms by multiphase reactions of HNO3 and particles. reactions that are facilitated by transport of crustal dust and sea spray aerosol from a source within the United States. The observed high aerosol acidity prevents the formation of NH4NO3. the inorganic nitrogen species often dominant in fine-mode aerosol at higher pH.

The negative influence of repolymerised lignin structures on enzymatic hydrolysis was confirmed by the addition of resorcinol in autohydrolysis. which is known to promote repolymerisation reactions and decreased the biomass digestibility.

At the present rate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. in less than two decades mankind will lose the opportunity to limit the global temperature increase to 2 °C (as stated in the Paris Agreement). a fact that makes carbon dioxide an urgent target for recycling efforts. In this context. the combination of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2RR) with carbon-neutral energy sources opens the door for the valorization of carbon dioxide as a medium for energy storage and as a source for the production of building blocks in a fossil fuel-free chemical industry. In particular. the efficient reduction of CO2 to CO would provide a versatile compound for the production of liquid fuels and plastics by established industrial processes. However. a key challenge for the eCO2RR on its way toward technological viability is the development of highly active and robust electrocatalysts capable of targeting a single CO2 reduction product and of inhibiting the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous media.

1139429,Decomposition of N2O over Ru/Fe/Al2O3 catalyst nanoparticles,,Gaston O Larrazabal,,,,,,As the third-largest greenhouse gas and the most important ozone-depleting substance. nitrous oxide (N2O) represents a significant environmental issue. In this work. the catalytic activity towards N2O decomposition of six different Ru/Fe/Al2O3 nanoparticle powders synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) was investigated. The powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction and N2 adsorption with the BET method. The catalytic tests were conducted with a feed of N2O dissolved in helium in a tubular fixed bed reactor. The prepared powders were found to have a BET specific surface area of approximately 170 g/m2. The prepared powders were catalytically active in the direct decomposition of N2O; 50% conversion of N2O was achieved at approximately 380 C with the best-performing catalyst. The activity of the catalysts improved as the content of ruthenium increased until 2 wt%. after this point no improvement of the activity with higher Ru content was observed. The addition of iron when Ru was already present did not result in any improvement of the catalyst performance under the studied conditions compared to a Ru-only sample. however. a Fe/Al2O3 powder was found to shift the decomposition of N2O towards lower temperatures compared to the spontaneous thermal decomposition.,True,u3R1zkAAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/process-engineering/particle-technology-laboratory-dam/documents/lectures/micro-nano/exercise/sample_report.pdf,,,,https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/process-engineering/particle-technology-laboratory-dam/documents/lectures/micro-nano/exercise/sample_report.pdf,0,0,0

Pitfalls and limitations in gas adsorption data analysis,2003,Johan C Groen and Louk AA Peffer and Javier Pérez-Ramı́rez,60,,1-3,1-17,Elsevier,Physical gas adsorption is extensively used in the characterization of micro- and mesoporous materials and is often considered as a straightforward-to-interpret technique. However. physical phenomena like the tensile strength effect. adsorbate phase transitions. and monolayer formation in combined micro- and mesoporous materials frequently lead to extra contributions in the adsorption isotherm. Models for pore size determination mostly do not account for this. and assignment to real pores leads to improper analysis of adsorption data.

As a passive film. oxides may inhibit reaction by providing a physical barrier between the underlying metal and dissolved oxidants. Sustained reduction of solutes requires localized defects in the passive film (e.g.. pits). or some mechanism for transferring electrons through the oxide. In the semiconductor model. conduction band electrons from the oxide may contribute to solute reduction. but electron hopping (resonance tunneling) appears to be more important due to the high population of localized states in oxides formed under environmental conditions.

To define the loss of mitochondrial function by apoptosis. we monitored cellular respiration during continuous exposure to doxorubicin. A phosphorescence analyzer capable of stable measurements over at least 5 h was used to measure [O2]. In solutions containing glucose and cells. [O2] declined linearly with time. showing that the kinetics of oxygen consumption was zero order. Complete inhibition of oxygen consumption by cyanide indicated that oxidations occurred in the respiratory chain.

Therefore. solution-proceessable and stable cathode buffer layer is of great importance for the application of PSCs. Here we demonstrate high performance PSCs by employing as-prepared zirconium acetylacetonate (a-ZrAcac) film spin-cast from its ethanol solution as cathode buffer layer. The PSCs based on a low bandgap polymer PBDTBDD as donor and PC 60 BM as acceptor with a-ZrAcac/Al cathode demonstrated an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.75% which is significantly improved than that of the devices with traditional Ca/Al cathode.

1139644,The impact of downside risk on risk-adjusted performance of mutual funds in the Euronext markets,2001,Robert van der Meer and Frank Sortino and Auke Plantinga,,Available at SSRN 277352,,,,Many performance measures. such as the classic Sharpe ratio have difficulty in evaluating the performance of mutual funds with skewed return distributions. Common causes for skewness are the use of options in the portfolio or superior market timing skills of the portfolio manager. In this article we examine to what extent downside risk and the upside potential ratio can be used to evaluate skewed return distributions. In order to accomplish this goal. we first show the relation between the risk preferences of the investor and the risk-adjusted performance measure. We conclude that it is difficult to interpret differences in the outcomes of risk-adjusted performance measures exclusively as differences in forecasting skills of portfolio managers. We illustrate this with an example of a simulation study of a protective put strategy. We show that the Sharpe ratio leads to incorrect conclusions in the case of protective put strategies. On the other hand. the upside potential ratio leads to correct conclusions. Finally. we apply downside risk and the upside potential ratio in the process of selecting a mutual fund from a sample of mutual funds in the Euronext stock markets. The rankings appear similar. which can be attributed to the absence of significant skewness in the sample. However. find that the remaining differences can be quite significant for individual fund managers. and that these differences can be attributed to skewness. Therefore. we prefer to use the UPR as an alternative to the Sharpe ratio. as it accounts better for the use of options and forecasting skills.,True,rj_hI24AAAAJ:hCrLmN-GePgC,27,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=277352,15575505816935007081,/scholar?cites=15575505816935007081,,https://econwpa.ub.uni-muenchen.de/econ-wp/fin/papers/0407/0407016.pdf,0,0,0

Fundamental indexes are formed on the basis of book value of the assets. gross dividends. revenue. operating income and a composite of these values. Previous research in the US has shown that fundamental indexation provides positive risk-adjusted returns. We analyze whether the fundamental indexing strategy generates a positive alpha after correcting for risk factors and costs of managing the index portfolios. We use the three factor model of Fama and French to correct for risk. We find that fundamental indexation has a higher factor loading on the risk factors based on book-to-market (HML) and size (SMB).

In our opinion. the stock market performance contributed only partly to this situation. More important is the poor choice of benchmarks used in risk and performance control. In this paper. we propose a more suitable benchmark and an attribution model for evaluating the investment performance of pension funds. The benchmark in this paper implies a clear choice for the reliability of the future pension claims. We emphasize the importance of making a distinction between nominal and real liabilities for pension funds. The investment strategy of a pension fund should be based on assets that matching the risk characteristics with its liabilities. We propose a portfolio of assets that is cash flow matched with the real liabilities and one matched with the nominal liabilities.

Both private and institutional investors delegate a considerable part of the management of their asset portfolios to external fund managers. Investors face the problem of selecting the best from a large set of potential portfolio managers. This selection process involves the evaluation of the return distribution generated by the portfolio manager. An important aspect of this evaluation is the risk attitude of the investor. There are at least two general approaches for the evaluation of the attractiveness of return distribution. The first approach is to choose a preference model. such as a utility function. and use the expected value of this preference model as the decision criterion. This approach allows the user to model explicitly the risk preferences of the investor.

It uses a contingent claims perspective to offer a new explanation for the difference in abnormal returns between acquirers of private and public targets. In this context. an acquisition is analogous to buying a call option and the value of the acquirer increases with uncertainty about its growth prospects (options). We test this idea by studying the relation between announcement returns and acquirer's characteristics that proxy for the existence of growth options. Consistent with the contingent claims hypothesis. the private acquisition gains are associated with the combined effects of growth options (having higher runup before the acquisition announcement) with low level of leverage (near-all equity capital) and with uncertainty (measured by age and analyst coverage of acquirers).,True,rj_hI24AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,5,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1351847X.2012.742025,15000676576869869364,/scholar?cites=15000676576869869364,,,0,0,0

The style investing hypothesis predicts that assets in the same style show strong comovement with respect to their underlying fundamentals and that reclassifying assets into a new style raises its correlation with that style. We test this prediction by studying how comovement varies with proxies of popularity. We use different kinds of data. such as data on stocks. mutual funds. IPO’s and financial analysts. We provide strong evidence that when popularity of a style is high investors base their demand for stocks on an individual stock level.

Organisations and Management),Divesting from fossil companies has been put forward as a means to address climate change. We study the impact of such divesting on investment portfolio performance. To this extent. we systematically investigate the investment performance of portfolios with and without fossil fuel company stocks. We investigate mispricing in stock returns and test for the impact of (reduced) diversification by excluding fossil fuel companies from the portfolio. While the fossil fuel industry outperforms other industries based on returns only. we show that this is due to the higher systematic risk of this industry. as there is no statistically significant difference between the riskadjusted performance of stocks in the fossil fuel sample and the non-fossil fuel sample. We conclude that divesting from fossil fuels does not have a statistically significant impact on overall portfolio performance. and only a very marginal impact on the utility derived from such portfolios. The policy implication is that investors can divest from fossil fuels without significantly hurting their financial performance.,True,rj_hI24AAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C,4,https://ideas.repec.org/p/gro/rugsom/16005-eef.html,5670245861285483444,/scholar?cites=5670245861285483444,,,0,0,0

In this article. we try to find an answer to the question as to why value stocks generate superior returns to growth stocks by dividing growth and value stocks into switching-and fixed-style stocks.

The microcredit crisis following from microfinance‐induced suicides in 2010 in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh indicates that weak corporate governance and imprudent risk taking have far‐reaching consequences. Yet. analyses of corporate governance mechanisms among microfinance institutions (MFIs) remain underdeveloped. As a response. this study examines the impact of CEO power on MFI risk taking by deriving explicit predictions of this effect from a characterization of the microfinance industry. Based on a sample of 280 microfinance institutions. our results suggest that powerful CEOs of microfinance non‐governmental organizations (NGOs) have more decision‐making freedom than powerful CEOs of other types of MFIs.

Consistent with the goal of reducing credit premia. more timely purchases are observed for eligible bonds characterized by higher credit risk.

With the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015. a better understanding of portfolio related carbon dioxide (CO2) exposures has become increasingly important for investors. regulators and society at large. Carbon-intensive stocks still carry a substantial weight in common market benchmarks. We analyze if investors are actively divesting by deviating from market benchmark allocations to reduce carbon exposures.

1139671,Social investment in microfinance: The trade-off between risk. return and outreach to the poor,2011,Rients Galema and Robert Lensink,,The handbook of microfinance,,367,World Scientific,Access to finance is a crucial mechanism for generating persistent economic growth and for reducing worldwide poverty. Although data on access to financial services is still limited. it is clear that there is a huge unmet demand for financial services by the poor. Beck et al.(2007). for instance. estimate that about 40 to 80 percent of the populations in developing economies lack access to the formal banking sector. The access to financial services differs considerably between developing countries. According to the World Bank (2008). less than 50percent of the population in most developing countries has a bank account. whereas in most Sub-Saharan African countries. more than 80 percent of the population lack a bank account. The limited access to financial services by the poor is due to many reasons. such as a lack of education. a lack of collateral. and the small transactions leading to high costs for financial institutions. Since the late 1970s. however. specialized microfinance institutions serving the poor have tried to overcome these problems in innovative ways eg. by using grouplending schemes. dynamic incentives and by hiring local loan officers. The microfinance movement has been impressive. both in terms of new programmes introduced and in terms of the number of clients that are reached. Nowadays. more than 10.000 MFIs in more than 85 countries serve over 100 million micro-entrepreneurs.

Price and funding cost margins in multinational banking,2016,Rients Galema and Michael Koetter and Caroline Liesegang,20,Review of Finance,5,1981-2014,Oxford University Press,In a proposed model of a multinational bank. interest margins determine local lending by foreign affiliates and the internal funding by parent banks. We exploit detailed parent-affiliate-level data of all German banks to empirically test our theoretical predictions in pre-crisis times. Local lending by affiliates depends negatively on price margins. the difference between lending and deposit rates in foreign markets. The effect of funding cost margins. the gap between local deposit rates faced by affiliates abroad and the funding costs of their parents. on internal capital market funding is positive but statistically weak.

1139674,Governance and microfinance institutions,2012,Rients Galema and Robert Lensink and Roy Mersland,,Research handbook on international banking and governance,,,,During the last decade. much has been written on microfinance (see for recent overviews. eg Hermes and Lensink (2007. 2011) and Armendariz and Morduch (2010)). The literature on microfinance is diverse. It includes theoretical studies on the design of optimal contracts and. more recently. the testing of these theories through randomized control experiments. It also includes impact studies that try to find out whether microfinance measurably improves the lives of the poor. Finally. there are macro studies that study how MFIs are effected by the macroeconomic environment in which they operate and how they trade-off outreach and financial sustainability. Yet. comparatively little has been written on the corporate governance of microfinance institutions (MFIs); most of the existing studies on MFI governance consist of consultancy reports that assume that MFIs are comparable to regular commercial firms (Labie and Mersland. 2011).The lack of scientific studies on microfinance governance is unfortunate. because a number of recent MFI failures have been attributed to bad governance systems. Until recently. researchers and policymakers considered microcredit as an important instrument to lift poor people. especially women. out of poverty. An enormous amount of anecdotes and simple empirical analyses support the positive view on microcredit. Policy makers became almost euphoric about the possible role of microfinance as a development instrument after Mohammad Yunus received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.

1139675,Microfinance as a socially responsible investment,2011,Rients Jan Galema,,,,,,In 1967. as the Vietnam War is raging. a US reverend named Luther E. Tyson receives a letter from a woman in Ohio asking whether he knows of any mutual fund that does not invest in war-related industries. He realizes that no such mutual fund exists. so he decides to create one. In 1971. starting with $101.000. he and three cofounders develop one of the world’s first mutual funds dedicated to both the social and financial well-being of its investors: the Pax World Fund. Little could Tyson have known that the Pax World Fund would help give birth to the socially responsible investment (SRI) movement. Since 1971. interest in the SRI industry has expanded exponentially. such that today 11% of the $25.1 trillion in total assets under professional management in the US is involved in socially responsible investing (SIF. 2007).Around the time the Pax fund is created in the US. a fierce war results in the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in December 1971. After the war. US trained economist Muhammad Yunus returns to his home country to teach at Chittagong University in southeast Bangladesh. After the famine of 1974. he becomes disillusioned with his career as an economics professor and decides to start experimenting with lending to poor households. Although his personal means are limited. he finds that even small loans are sufficient for villagers to run small profitable businesses. Surprisingly. borrowers are not only profiting from his lendings. but are also able to repay him reliably. even though they have no collateral.

A powerful CEO is defined as one that also chairs the board of directors. CEO power is reflected in higher performance variability if CEOs have more latitude of action. ie managerial discretion. Managerial discretion can be limited by having stakeholder electives on the board. We find that CEO power only has an effect on MFI performance variability when there are no stakeholder electives on the board. Furthermore. we argue that CEOs in non-profit MFIs have more discretion. because their dual mission implies their CEOs are harder to control.

I use proprietary data provided by one of the biggest Dutch P2P lending platforms. on which personal acquaintances of the borrower are able to invest before other P2P investors do. I find that P2P investors invest more in loans of borrowers to whom they are personally acquainted. More initial investment by investors acquainted with the borrower is subsequently associated with a higher likelihood of obtaining a second loan from the P2P lender. larger investments by other P2P investors and lower ex post defaults.

When investors have a tendency to tilt their portfolio towards domestic assets. the carbon intensity in the home market may well affect the carbon exposures of their portfolios and hence climate risk. This paper analyzes the carbon exposure and home bias of stock portfolios across a wide range of different investors from the euro area using a unique stock-level holdings data. We find that at the stock-level. carbon-intensive firms have higher ownership when the stocks are from the EU-home market.

Our international analysis shows that the environmental dimension of a country's institutional framework is approximately twice as impactful as the social dimension. when it comes to determining the cost of corporate loans.

The second and third step characterises and categorises the influential studies. respectively. while the last step investigates the (sometimes conflicting) results and interpretations offered by influential studies in depth. Unlike existing approaches. in which the reviewers predominantly assess the relevance of candidate studies for their review themselves. ILA outsources its study assessment to the community of researchers by using researchers' average study influence judgement approximately embedded in citations. This process offers reviewers a much needed valid and predominantly author independent mean to select studies from ever increasing research areas.

ILA can assess any type of unpublished work with a higher precision than previous studies and adjust for the imperfections of citation based study influence measurement in any synthesis setting. respectively.

First. we extend previous work to argue that CSR’s impacts on corporate financial performance (CFP) are moderated by five factors: CSR form. firm characteristics. time. national framework and industrial characteristics. Focusing on industrial characteristics. we theorise that differences in industries’ dependency on certain stakeholder groups. their proximity to the end consumer. their potential for social and environmental damages and their level of product/service differentiation moderate CSR’s value relevance. Our second contingency perspective considers for whom CSR might pay. While previous research has almost exclusively viewed CSR’s value from a corporate perspective. we argue that stakeholders. government. and investor perspective are also relevant. Empirically. we analyse CSR’s value across ten industry sectors from a corporate and investor aspect. respectively. We find that CSR has substantial value for corporations in the health care. industrials. and consumer discretionary sectors but not elsewhere. Publicly informed investors can exploit this positive CSR effect in the former two industries. which yields significantly abnormal excess returns of more than 6% and 8.5% per annum. respectively.

Journal of Financial Economics) document that companies in industries perceived as sinful-so called sin stocks (ie alcohol. tobacco. gambling)-deliver a significant and positive abnormal stock market performance. This potentially attractive characteristics make these sin stocks a relevant investment opportunity for pension funds. In fact. following a rather conservative interpretation of pension funds' fiduciary duty. one might argue that pension funds have to investment overproportionally in sin stocks due to their seemingly superior returns to act in the best financial interest of their beneficiaries. This best financial interest. however. is unlikely the best interest of the beneficiary from a wider wellbeing perspective as. for instance. investments in tobacco companies are unlikely supportive of public health and hence beneficiaries' life expectancy. Before one dives into this legal paradoxon it is worth considering the practicalities of investing in these so called sin stocks. as the academic studies documenting their preferential characteristics used nearly exclusively hypothetical portfolios and not actual investment funds. In fact. only one sin stock based investment fund exists to the best our of knowledge. the Vice Fund. In this chapter. we pursue the first in depth analysis of the financial attractiveness of the Vice Fund. which penalizes instead of rewards responsible corporations. Despite the financial potential of the Vice Fund’s underlying sin stocks has recently been indicated. we find the Vice Fund’s abnormal return to be statistically indistinguishable from zero.

1139705,Portfolio diversification and environmental. social or governance criteria: Must responsible investments really be poorly diversified,2010,Andreas GF Hoepner,,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,,We contribute to the responsible investment literature by theoretically challenging the widely held belief that integrating environmental. social or governance (ESG) screens in investment strategies must lead to a diversification penalty compared to otherwise identical conventional investment strategies. The theory of responsible investment. which defines itself by the integration of ESG criteria in investment processes. is strongly underdeveloped. Without any sophisticated theoretical or empirical investigation. authors have jumped since decades into the conclusion that ESG screens must have a generally negative effect on portfolio diversification. because they limit the available investment universe (eg Barnett and Salomon. 2006; Renneboog. ter Horst and Zhang. 2008; Rudd. 1981). Metaphorically. this line of reasoning argues that allocating eggs on the highest possible number of baskets and allocating the baskets on the highest possible number of people is always the safest way to walk eggs home from a grocery store.We find this belief to be a too simplistic interpretation of Modern Portfolio Theory and challenge it with a simple model. In metaphoric terms. our simple theory finds that the safety of walking eggs home does not only depend on the number of baskets and the number of people carrying them. but it also depends on the quality of the baskets. Intuitively. most people would only allocate the eggs they transport over sufficient quality baskets. as using additional baskets with holes would be perceived as counter-productive.

On this matter. the 2005 Freshfields report concluded that pension funds’ fiduciary duties (eg prudent action for proper purpose) only permit the consideration of an ESG criterion. if this process has no detrimental financial effects. While a body of research exists on the general relationship between ESG criteria and financial performance/risk management. no study has yet investigated the financial and risk implications of integrating any ESG criterion into an investment process from the perspective of pension funds. whose unique financial and legal characteristics require a specialised research design (eg a prudent. very large scale investment process). To study this effect. we develop a test of the prudent integration of ESG criteria in realistic and synthetic pension fund investment processes.

They operate the payments system. are a source of credit for large parts of the economy. and (except in times of crisis) act as a safe haven for depositors’ funds. The banking system aids in allocating resources from those in surplus (depositors) to those in deficit (borrowers) by transforming relatively small liquid deposits into larger illiquid loans. Via this intermediation process. banks help match deposit and loan supply and provide liquidity to an economy. Ifintermediation is undertaken in an efficient manner. then deposit and credit demands can be met at low cost. benefiting the parties concerned as well as the economy overall (via positive externalities including long-term economic growth and progress in human development). The recent financial crisis. however. has brought a focus on negative externalities in banking such as the contagious effects of bank failures and costs of government bailouts.Tangential to these. but by no means less important. are social. environmental. ethical and trust issues (SEET). Over the last decade. corporate social responsibility has developed into an important strategy to enable firms to increase and smooth cash flows through consumer goodwill and loyalty. respectively (Carroll. 1999; Carroll and Shabana. 2010; Mintzberg. 1983).

In this paper. we investigate whether and. if so. how carbon emission performance is related to corporate financial performance and how the disclosure of carbon emissions in the annual and standalone reports mediates such relationship. Specifically. we construct a 42-item disclosure index to quantify the quality of corporate carbon emissions disclosure for 62 FTSE 100 firms from the period 2010 to 2012. We find that while carbon emissions are negatively associated with financial performance. they are positively related to the level of carbon disclosure. which then leads to better financial performance at a marginal significance level.

1139713,Social. environmental. and trust issues in business and finance,2012,Christoph F Biehl and Andreas GF Hoepner and Jianghong Liu,,"Socially responsible finance and investing. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley",,,,Some commentators might believe as though social. environmental. and trust (SET) issues came from nowhere in the last few years to rapidly surge on the agenda of business and financial institutions. However. SET concerns in business and finance existed long before Enron. the subprime mortgage crisis. or the BP oil spill. This chapter analyzes SET development in three steps. First. the chapter discusses SET issues and their impact on business and finance throughout history. For this purpose. a manual review of the literature finds 154 SET records. which serve as a basis for the analysis. The SET issues are found to emerge and advance over time. Initially. concerns centered around social issues with direct influence on people in the region and had an increasing impact on business and finance through unions and pension funds. Over time. environmental factors became increasingly important. and even some social factors emerged without direct influence on the concerned people themselves. These new factors. especially some environmental disasters. have influenced business through new legislation. Recently. trust issues emerged as a direct reaction to the financial crisis. They are very important to business and especially the financial services industry.,True,kwqoaz0AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,19,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=M8gCL6ceangC&oi=fnd&pg=PA111&dq=info:Z8Ui9m9bRSAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=S0sxCMd9mC&sig=qzBLESbz6xrIGKMD_Yf_XXFdpzo,2325365319035700583,/scholar?cites=2325365319035700583,,,0,0,0

1139715,The ‘Price of Sin’Aversion: Ivory Tower Illusion or Real Investable Alpha?,2015,Hampus Adamsson and Andreas GF Hoepner,,Available at SSRN 2659098,,,,In their pioneering work. Hong & Kacperczyk [HK](2009) document a significant outperformance of so-called sin stocks: publicly traded companies involved in producing alcohol. tobacco and gaming. Drawing on theories of neglected stocks and segmented markets. the authors suggest this outperformance to be due to a shunning effect caused by norm-constrained institutional investors who effectively pay a price for sin aversion. Motivated by a line of criticism against their research design. this study re-examines whether the sin stocks premium recorded by HK is actually investable for real world investors or derives from an ‘ivory tower style’research design? We limit our analysis to only those stocks included in the global equity index benchmarks of institutional investors thereby excluding thousands of stocks usually considered too illiquid in practice. Among these stocks. we still document the sin stock premium in HK’s equal weighted sin-industry portfolios. Equal-weighted sub-industry portfolios are. however. practically barely investable for many institutional investors with their value-weighted benchmarks and are. if analysed in Fama-French models. exposed to a small cap bias in two ways. First. if small cap firms outperform large cap firms. then the equal-weighted portfolio is likely to outperform its value-weighted equivalent and a value-weighted market. Hence. we value-weight our sin-industry portfolios. which leads the premium for gambling firms to disappear. Second. Fama-French’s model controls for return differentials between small cap and large cap firms within all industrial sectors.

We then use the geographic coordinates of these banks’ branches and of 14.100 businesses to analyze how the lending techniques of banks near firms are related to credit constraints at two contrasting points of the credit cycle. We find that while relationship lending is not associated with credit constraints during a credit boom. it alleviates such constraints during a downturn.

Profitability and age are the most robust determinants of capital structure targets. Although banking system development has in general enabled firms to get closer to their leverage targets. information asymmetries between firms and banks are still relatively large.

Our results contradict the widespread view that foreign banks have been driving FX lending to retail clients as a result of easier access to foreign wholesale funding. Our cross-sectional analysis shows that foreign banks do lend more in FX to corporate clients but not to households. Moreover. we find no evidence that wholesale funding had a strong causal effect on FX lending for either foreign or domestic banks.

It describes the contribution. as well as the limitations of the legal view literature with regard to our understanding of the causality between financial development and economic growth. The legal view demonstrates that. through its impact on the financial system. an effective legal system indirectly promotes economic development. However. the particularities of the transition process – notably the existence of soft budget constraints – are such that the methodology and the results of the legal view cannot be applied to transition economies without provisos.,True,FiCbTUAAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,49,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:ECOT.0000036577.87682.a3,11761906548678920671,/scholar?cites=11761906548678920671,,https://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/economics/publications/De_Economist.pdf,0,0,0
1139734,The Limits of Lending? Banks and Technology Adoption across Russia,2019,Cagatay Bircan and Ralph De Haas,,Review of Financial Studies,,,,We exploit historically determined variation in local credit markets to identify the impact of bank lending on innovation across Russian firms. We find that deeper credit markets increase firms’ use of bank credit. their adoption of new products and technologies. and their productivity growth. This relationship is more pronounced in industries farther from the technological frontier. more exposed to import competition. and that export more. These impacts are also stronger for firms near historical R&D centers or railways and in regions with supportive institutions. Consistent with these results. credit markets contribute to economic growth in such regions.Authors have furnished a data set. which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.,True,FiCbTUAAAAAJ:5qfkUJPXOUwC,31,https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/33/2/536/5512485,14935271369209954429,/scholar?cites=14935271369209954429,,http://ralphdehaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bircan_De-Haas_RFS.pdf,0,0,0

London,What are the costs and benefits of cross-border banking integration and how has the balance between the two shifted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis? This question is not only of academic interest but also pertinent to policy discussions in the wide range of countries that have opened up their banking sectors to foreign investors over the past three decades. The process of financial globalisation during this period has resulted in high levels of foreign ownership of banks across the world. To name but a few examples.

We provide new evidence on this question by studying the relation between legal same-sex relationship recognition policies (SSRRPs) and attitudes toward sexual minorities in Europe. Using data from the European Social Surveys covering 2002–2016 and exploiting variation in the timing of SSRRPs across countries. we show that legal relationship recognition is associated with statistically significant improvements in attitudes toward sexual minorities. These effects are widespread across demographic groups but are consistently larger for more conservative groups in countries with less gender equality.

We find that for given levels of economic and financial development and environmental regulation. CO2 emissions per capita are lower in economies that are relatively more equity-funded. Industry-level analysis reveals two distinct channels. First. stock markets reallocate investment towards less polluting sectors. Second. they also push carbon-intensive sectors to develop and implement greener technologies. In line with this second effect. we show that carbon-intensive sectors produce more green patents as stock markets deepen.

Our findings are threefold. First. information sharing reduces defaults. especially among new borrowers. and increases the return on lending. Second. lending tightens at the extensive margin as loan officers. using the new registry. reject more applications. Third. lending also tightens at the intensive margin: microloans become smaller. shorter and more expensive. This affects both new borrowers and lending relationships established before the registry.

Research Department,We use focused interviews with bank managers to analyse how multinational banks use internal capital markets to control their subsidiaries. It is found that foreign bank affiliates are strongly influenced by the capital allocation and credit steering mechanisms of the parent bank. Parent banks generally set credit growth targets. which may then be supported by book capital and debt funding. This passive approach establishes a minimum amount of local book capital and is driven by regulatory considerations. In addition. some banks have started to use semi-active economic capital models. By charging subsidiaries for the use of economic capital. parent banks introduce a constraint at the individual loan level. This bottom-up approach determines the pace at which subsidiaries are able to meet their credit growth targets. Our findings suggest that the credit growth of subsidiaries may critically depend on the financial position of the parent bank.,True,FiCbTUAAAAAJ:evX43VCCuoAC,24,https://ideas.repec.org/p/dnb/dnbwpp/051.html,3251488291618209445,/scholar?cites=3251488291618209445,,,0,0,0

1139744,Whistle blowing and rational loyalty,2004,Wim Vandekerckhove and MS Ronald Commers,53,Journal of Business Ethics,1,225-233,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Today's complex and decentralized organization gives rise to organizational needs for both loyalty and institutionalized whistle blowing. However. ethicists see a contradiction between both needs. This paper argues there is no such contradiction. It shows why earlier attempts to go beyond the dilemma are not satisfying. The solution proposed in this paper starts from an organizational perspective instead of an individual one. It does so by reframing the concept of loyalty into “rational loyalty”. This means that the object of loyalty is not the physicality of an organization. but its corpus of explicit mission statement. goals. value statement and code of conduct. An implication is that organizations are – as their side of the duty of loyalty – obliged to institutionalize whistle blowing.,True,Q6ru9YIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,154,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:BUSI.0000039411.11986.6b,176724282654530212,/scholar?cites=176724282654530212,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49210433/Vandekerckhove_Commers-Whistle_Blowing_and_Rational_Loyalty_2004.pdf,0,0,0

Cognitive limitations determine the search for and the analysis of information and. as a consequence. constrain the identification of opportunities. Moreover. typical personal characteristics – locus of control. need for independence and need for achievement – suggest that entrepreneurs will tend to take a central position in their stakeholder environments and thus fail to adapt to the complexity of stakeholder relationships in their entrepreneurial activity. We approach this problem by adopting a network perspective on stakeholder management. We propose a heuristic approach of stakeholder analysis. which requires two mappings of the entrepreneurial constituents.

In the past thirty years numerous pieces of legislation have been passed to offer protection to whistleblowers from retaliation for disclosing organisational wrongdoing. An area that remains uncertain in relation to whistleblowing and its related policies in organisations. is whether these policies actually increase the individualisation of work. allowing employees to behave in accordance with their conscience and in line with societal expectations or whether they are another management tool to control employees and protect organisations from them.

We develop our argument by identifying rights and duties involved in whistleblowing as two clusters: one of justice and one of benevolence. Legislative arguments have evolved to cover the justice issues and the tendency exists of extending rights and duties into the realm of benevolence. This article considers the problematic assumptions and implications of whistleblowing as a positive duty. by examining the extent to which the Good Samaritan argument holds with regard to whistleblowing.

Given the historical. political and organizational context in which the notion of ‘whistleblowing’appeared in Western public affairs from the early 1970s (Vandekerckhove 2006). this focus on the whistleblower is not surprising. When systematic empirical research began in the 1980s. the researchers faced an agenda determined largely by an antagonism between managers in organizations. on the one hand. and activists. including whistleblowers. who were trying to change corporate and governmental behavior. on the other. The result was a crude antagonism between whistleblowers as ‘ethical resisters’ and organizations as ‘bureaucratic hierarchies’(Glazer and Glazer 1989).

In this article. we depart from current scholarly depictions of this figure as a fearless truth-teller who is fully independent of the organization. We argue for a new framing that sees the self-construction of the whistleblower as infused with passionate attachments to organizational and professional norms. even after one experiences severe reprisals. We base our claims on recently gathered empirical data and draw on Judith Butler to theorize how. contrary to existing understandings. passionate attachments to one’s organization and profession shape whistleblower subjectivity. rather than conscious risk-taking. or autonomous self-reinvention. Our second contribution is to highlight the importance of practical and material supports for this vital figure in society; until now the whistleblower has been idealized as an extraordinary hero rather than a real human in need of …,True,Q6ru9YIAAAAJ:WTSGYGHz1bkC,35,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0170840618814558,6849613213061834269,/scholar?cites=6849613213061834269,,http://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/21346/13/21346%20VANDEKERCKHOVE_Whistleblower_Subjectivities_2018.pdf,0,0,0

Traditionally. these issues of ethics and social responsibility in business settings have been discussed and commented on by prescriptive approaches that are grounded in philosophical traditions. Building on the idea that we need to develop a more comprehensive and complete understanding of the value that people assign to ethics and how it influences their actions and decisions. in the present article we discuss and review the importance and relevance of adopting also a descriptive approach that is grounded in the behavioral sciences (referred to as behavioral business ethics). This approach has the advantages to promote our insights into how people can show both good and bad behavior and why this is the case.

1139758,Responsible investment in times of turmoil,2012,Wim Vandekerckhove and Jos Leys and Kristian Alm and Bert Scholtens and Silvana Signori and Henry Schäfer,31,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,The SRI phenomenon is said to be entering the mainstream of financial intermediation. From a fairly marginal practice promoted or campaigned for by NGO’s and at odds with financial practice and orthodoxy it grew into well formulated policy adopted by a wide range of investors. Academic literature on SRI has also boomed on the assumption that mainstreaming is taking place. However. little thinking has been carried out on questions specifically arising from this alleged ‘mainstreaming’. This book. addressed to those with a scholarly or practitioner’s interest in SRI. starts filling this neglected dimension. Today. one cannot ignore the difficulties of main stream financing. The financial spheres are trembling globally in one of the worst crises since the 1930’s. As a response to the crisis. the intermediation of ‘financial responsibility’will undoubtedly be the subject of new regulation and scrutinizing. This book looks into what these turbulences will imply for SRI. In view of these circumstances. one might or even should. ask oneself whether the phenomenon was not an empty fad during the exuberant high of financial euphoria that came abruptly to an end with current financial crises. To put it rather sec: are financial intermediaries that promote ‘sustainability’credible. while it is obvious that some developments in financial intermediation-predictably. as some say-were unsustainable? Is this an opportunity for enhancing SRI because of the strength and superiority it has developed or will it disappear due to a return to financial myopia?

1139759,Questioning cosmopolitanism,2010,Stan Van Hooft and Wim Vandekerckhove,6,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Wim Vandekerckhove and Stan van Hooft The philosopher. Diogenes the Cynic. in the fourth century BCE. was asked where he came from and where he felt he belonged. He answered that he was a “citi-1 zen of the world”(kosmopolitês). This made him the rst person known to have described himself as a cosmopolitan. A century later. the Stoics had developed that concept further. stating that the whole cosmos was but one polis. of which the order was logos or right reason. Living according to that right reason implied showing goodness to all of human kind. Through early Christianity. cosmopolitanism was given various interpretations. sometimes quite contrary to the inclusive notion of the Stoics. Augustine’s interpretation. for example. suggested that only those who love God can live in the universal and borderless “City of God”. Later. the red-covery of Stoic writings during the European Renaissance inspired thinkers like Erasmus. Grotius and Pufendorf to draw on cosmopolitanism to advocate world peace through religious tolerance and a society of states. That same inspiration can be noted in the American and French revolutions. In the eighteenth century. enlig-enment philosophers such as Bentham (through utilitarianism) and Kant (through universal reason) developed new and very different versions of cosmopolitanism that serve today as key sources of cosmopolitan philosophy. The nineteenth century saw the development of new forms of transnational ideals. including that of Marx’s critique of capitalism on behalf of an international working class.,True,Q6ru9YIAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,28,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=FNIGB729C4EC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:0ml7QNODDP4J:scholar.google.com&ots=No__aPH4WI&sig=JaxucXhygHqiAusLTI_f-0ou9tI,18306151528697391570,/scholar?cites=18306151528697391570,,,0,0,0

Previous research on whistleblowing has mainly studied this phenomenon as a one-off decision by someone perceiving wrongdoing within an organisation to raise a concern or to remain silent. Earlier suggestions that whistleblowing is a process and that people find themselves inadvertently turned into whistleblowers by management responses. have not been followed up by a systematic study tracking the path of how a concern is repeatedly raised by whistleblowers. This paper provides a quantitative exploration of whistleblowing as a protracted process. rather than a one-off decision.

Can we even say that ‘whistleblowing’occurs all over the world. in every country or every society. in a way that is so similar that it can be researched everywhere the same way? The answer to these broad questions is almost certainly ‘no’. As discussed in Chapter 1. the term ‘whistleblowing’itself has its own origins in particular societies and particular cultures. where there are many ways of understanding it. even before trying to cross into other languages and cultures. How the concept is perceived in different cultures is a crucial threshold question.

Although there is a vast body of literature on whistleblowing using micro-ethical (egopoietic) or meso-ethical (sociopoietic) frameworks. whistleblowing has previously not been researched using a macro-ethical or ecopoietic framework. This paper is the first to explicitly do so. Empirical research suggests whistleblowing is a process rather than a single decision and action. I argue this process evolves depending on how whistleblowing is facilitated (positively or negatively) throughout that process. i.e. responding to whistleblowers and providing information about whistleblowing activity. The paper develops a typology of whistleblowing facilitation to complement Floridi’s IE.

However. the institutions to whom whistleblowers report—which are in the literature addressed as internal or external recipients of whistleblowing concerns—have been given limited scholarly attention. Research has instead focused on motives. behaviour. and experiences of whistleblowers on the one hand. and whistleblowing legislation on the other. Particularly the role of external agencies. like ombudsmen. anti-corruption agencies. and Inspector General offices. in dealing with whistleblowing concerns has been under-studied. With the aim of starting to fill this research gap. this paper reports the findings of a comparative study of governmental whistleblowing agencies (other than courts) and non-governmental whistleblowing protection organizations (NGOs). as important examples of external recipients of whistleblowing concerns. in 11 countries with whistleblowing legislation. The study aimed to find similarities and differences between these agencies. and to identify challenges and dilemmas that the installation of whistleblowing agencies bring about.

However. design fees. representing just a fraction of development costs but paid largely up-front. are significantly higher for green construction projects.

We decompose external appraisals of rental housing by international valuation firms in England and the Netherlands in two waves. keeping the samples of valued homes constant between these years. We find a notable change in the behavior of external property appraisers. In England. energy performance does not impact assessed values in 2012. while estimation results for 2015 show a significant discount in assessed values for D-. E- and F- relative to C-labeled dwellings. For the Netherlands. we do not observe a significant relationship between energy efficiency and assessed values in 2010. but in 2015 we find that more energy efficiency leads to higher external valuations.,True,7xBx308AAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC,5,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11146-019-09720-0,12049413103247937301,/scholar?cites=12049413103247937301,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11146-019-09720-0,0,0,0
1139777,The financial impacts of coworking: Rental prices and market dynamics in the commercial office market,2019,Andrea Chegut and Mike Langen,,Available at SSRN 3481142,,,,Coworking providers. like WeWork. have shifted the competitive landscape for office tenants through differentiating office amenities. leasing fully-equipped desks or offices over flexible time periods. However. even though coworking providers are a tenant type in consumer demand. little is known about the strategic interaction of this growing tenant with landlords in the real estate sector. In this paper. we assess landlord-coworking provider interaction through lease contract valuation. assessing if landlords see coworking providers as a substitute. benefit or risk. compared to other tenants. Using lease contracts from six US cities between 2008 to 2018. we compare rent conditions between coworking providers and tenants within the same building. We document that landlords treat coworking providers as substitutes not differentiating in effective rent compared to other tenants. Coworking providers take systematically longer lease durations. resulting in higher tenant incentives. such as free rent periods and tenant improvement concessions. Controlling for lease duration. coworking providers receive significantly more tenant concessions. We do not find value-increasing external effects of coworking providers. concluding that landlords are indifferent towards coworking tenants.,True,7xBx308AAAAJ:ILKRHgRFtOwC,5,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3481142,16363490383575488453,/scholar?cites=16363490383575488453,,,0,0,0

In fact. improvements in the energy-efficiency or sustainability of buildings have been shown to lead to positive financial returns. Attention to green building practices has substantially increased over the last decade. but more research is needed on the actual costs and benefits of implementing energy efficiency measures into buildings. Moreover. evidence on financial performance of such investments is limited outside of the U.S. To fill this gap in the literature. this study investigates the financial implications of green building practices in the United Kingdom. the second largest property market worldwide. The United Kingdom was the first to introduce a formal green building rating scheme in 1990 ñ BREEAM. This rating scheme laid the foundation for the development of rating schemes such as LEED. which is promoted by the U.S. Green Building Council and GreenStar in Australia. We match proprietary information on the addresses of BREEAM rated office buildings. made available to us by BRE. to the characteristics of geographically nearby control buildings. their rental rates and selling prices. This results in a dataset of approximately 7.000 subject and control buildings. We then model the characteristics of green buildings that impact price. occupancy rates and rental performance. controlling for differences in quality between subject and control buildings using a hand-collected set of hedonic characteristics.

Practicing architects require evidence to justify both functional and aesthetic building needs within the financial ecosystem. Some buildings that become real estate assets are valued using models that consider some proxies for understanding value. but these features are abstract and may misidentify the sub-optimal differentiation that design brings. The lack of feedback between real estate valuation and building design often leads to poor design and economic outcomes. To address this miscommunication. we investigate the transaction price performance of four external architectural form features—diagonality. curvature. setbacks and podiums. Whilst controlling for drivers that are known to explain transaction price variation. we find that diagonality and podiums have a positive pricing differential of 12.4 and 9.7% more than rectilinear control buildings. respectively. Buildings with setbacks have a negative pricing differential of 10%. Furthermore. these results are also consistent for rental valuation.

Accelerators are firm development programs that utilize physical space. mentorship. capital. and community engagement to accelerate the financial feasibility of start-up firms. A sample of US accelerator treated and matched control firm’s over the 2005 to 2015 period yields a study of 16.720 firms. Results indicate that there is statistically significantly more cumulative funding for accelerated firms. when taking into consideration the endogenous choice and selection of start-up firms into programs and series stage in cumulative funding. Secondly. we assess variation across accelerator participation timing and find that firms with pre-funding when coming into an accelerator leads to higher cumulative funding. Lastly. we document accelerator amenities like free physical space. program length. program cohort size. investor equity stake and scale of capital injection impacts cumulative funding.

The purpose of this work is to associate sustainable design measures with their potential economic premiums. Our approach assumes that the value of a design intervention is correlated with its financial return: incremental increases in design performance leads to proportional increases in real estate rent value.We tested the proposed design and financial workflow in six pre-concept urban design projects in Boston. Lisbon and Kuwait City. We optimized daylight availability and walkability in each project. Then. we applied a premium to the rent price of each space based on the increased design performance. The applied value-add is based on previous empirical research of sustainability premiums in rent prices. Our results show that increasing the rent prices based on performance can provide up to 5% improvement in the simple yield for a project. producing an incremental cash flow in operation of the property. The results illustrate that. in addition to increasing the design quality. improved performance can add economic value to a project.,True,7xBx308AAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,1,http://web.mit.edu/afs.new/athena/dept/cron/project/sustainabledesignlab/publications/BS2017_Early_Design_01_3_1205_Turan_2017-03-28_19-27_a.pdf,879789963399631316,/scholar?cites=879789963399631316,,http://web.mit.edu/afs.new/athena/dept/cron/project/sustainabledesignlab/publications/BS2017_Early_Design_01_3_1205_Turan_2017-03-28_19-27_a.pdf,0,0,0

Yet. what makes a view alluring is also what makes it ineffable and difficult to characterize. We introduce two new metrics to quantitatively assess view access in open floorplans. and using the metrics. we measure the economic impact of views on office rents in Manhattan. New York City. We evaluate spatial view access in 5.154 office spaces; and then. combining the view analysis results with rent transaction data. we model the financial performance of rents paid by tenants with varying views whilst controlling for other vital factors impacting office rents. We find that spaces with high access to views have a 6% net effective rent premium over spaces with low access to views. This financial impact is independent of other values drivers like daylight. In the case where there is both high daylight and view access. there is also a 6% effective rent premium. Office tenants value views and have historically paid for them. The metrics introduced in this work can be used in architectural design and planning to analyze the potential for views in new and existing buildings.

This books provides a sociological analysis of this transformation process. termed the ecological restructuring or ecological modernization of production. This process of ecological modernization can be seen as a refinement of production. in the sense of removing impurities. purifying and polishing away its detrimental character. Refinement also points at the fine-tuning and improvement of production. be it not according to a limited definition of economic progress but in respect of the new standards of ecological rationality. Finally. refinement refers to petrochemical processes and thus indicates the case study area of this volume: the (Dutch) chemical industry. The aim of the present study goes one step beyond the description of the ecological refinement of production. It aims to formulate a social theory for understanding and explaining how and to what extent industrial production is transformed in a more ecologically sound direction: the ecological modernization theory. I believe that both the theoretical elaborations and the supporting empirical evidence presented in this study. confirm the value of this ecological modernization theory for understanding contemporary environment-informed developments in industrial production and for outlining projections for future environmental reform.

Building on earlier ecological modernization studies that focused on Europe. North America. and East and Southeast Asia. Mol takes here a more global perspective. He also addresses the increasing roles of non-state actors. especially international institutions. non-governmental organizations. popular movements. and transnational corporations. After examining the confusion created by the failure to distinguish among globalization. global capitalism. and neoliberalism.

At the core of this social scientific and policy-oriented approach is the view that contemporary societies have the capability of dealing with their environmental crises. Experiences in some countries demonstrate that modern institutions can incorporate environmental interests into their daily routines. Elsewhere. economic and political interests dominate development trajectories and environmental deterioration continues. challenging the premises of ecological modernisation. This volume brings together research on ecological modernisation practices around the world. Studies on Western.

It can be hypothesised that the environment is on its way to becoming a crucial factor in the widely discussed transformation of modernity. To what extent do environmental considerations and interests contribute ‐ or may contribute in the future ‐ to the restructuring of production? Ecological modernisation theory is a valuable starting‐point for analysing the contemporary reflexive reorganisation and transformation of production along ecological criteria.

To do this it focuses on changing social practices and institutional developments associated with environmental deterioration and reform. This article both profits from and contributes to this theoretical framework by analysing the transformations of the environmental movement. in particular non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Although the spectrum of environmental NGOs remains broad and different form country to country. some general transformations can be identified.

But in contrast to the early seventies. eco-alarmism in its present form seems to reflect growing uncertainties and anxieties related to the changing character of late modern society. Such uncertainties and anxieties do not only pertain to high-consequence risks. as exemplified by the Chernobyl accident. but also to local problems of providing safe drinking water from the tap. Ulrich Beck's risk-society theory. elaborated by Anthony Giddens. analyses these eco-anxieties against the background of changing conditions of modernity. Because of its overall pessimistic undertone and its basic questioning of the role of science and technology in overcoming an eco-catastrophe. the risk-society theory seems to fundamentally contradict ecological modernisation theory.

The point that an ecological modernization perspective puts on the research agenda is that. although global capitalism has not been beaten and continues to show its devastating environmental effects in all corners of the world. we are moving beyond the era of a global treadmill of production that only further degrades the environment.

But formulating policies for the greening of lifestyles and consumption patterns (e.g. traffic-behaviour. food. housing and leisure) turns out not to be an easy task. as consumption has become a global phenomenon and nation–states have lost their authoritative monopoly. This paper argues that. in the context of a globalising world of networks and flows. sustainable consumption policies have to be conceived of in terms of deterritorialised politics and programs which rely also on non-state environmental authority for the greening of consumption practices.

While some countries (such as Brazil) have for quite some time supported successful large‐scale programmes to improve the production and consumption of biofuels. policy‐makers and research institutions in most developed and developing countries have only recently turned their attention to biofuels.

We construct measures of export uncertainty. government policy uncertainty and price uncertainty to augment a growth model. and using econometric techniques we test for robustness of the effects of these measures on economic growth in a cross-section of 138 developing and developed economies during the 1970–1995 period. The result clearly shows a robust and negative effect of uncertainty on economic growth. These results underline the importance of export stability and policy credibility.,True,0HANvIwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,132,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02707331.pdf,9974281381688409419,/scholar?cites=9974281381688409419,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6909124.pdf,0,0,0

Organisation and Management,This paper studies the determinants of capital structure choice of Dutch firms. Our main objective is to investigate whether and to what extent the main capital structure theories can explain capital structure choice of Dutch firms. A better understanding of the capital structure determinants in a relatively small yet open industrialized economy is essential not only for enriching empirical studies in this field. but also for the purpose of cross country asset evaluation. By estimating a panel data model explaining both the absolute level of leverage with respect to various factors and the year-to-year changes in leverage with respect to the changes of various factors. we find evidence suggesting the relevance of the pecking order hypothesis in explaining the financing choice of Dutch firms. which implies the importance of asymmetric information models in explaining capital structure choice of Dutch firms.

Within the credit view the bank lending channel focuses on the special role of bank loans. and predicts that monetary contractions reduce loan supply to firms facing information problems. However. the ‘relationship lending channel’ argues that. especially in bank-based economies. bank-dependent firms have close ties with banks. which may reduce the sensitivity of their use of bank debt to monetary shocks. The sensitivity of corporate debt structures to changes in the monetary policy stance is analysed using a sample of 22.000 firms in the Euro area and the UK.

In contrast. the functioning of financial markets is mostly assumed to be perfect and efficient. Modigliani and Miller (1958. hereafter MM) show that in the latter case the capital structure of the firm is irrelevant for the user cost of capital and does neither affect investment nor the value of the firm. Since the publication of their seminal paper a large number of studies has pointed out that the empirical relevance of the MM-proposition is small. Financial markets suffer from several (institutional) market imperfections.

1139845,Bank-specific daily interest rate adjustment in the Dutch mortgage market,2011,Leo De Haan and Elmer Sterken,39,Journal of Financial Services Research,3,145-159,Springer US,This paper presents an empirical analysis of the interest rate setting behavior of the four largest banks in the Dutch mortgage market. using advertised interest rates at a daily frequency. The evidence for the long run pricing behaviour suggests that the banks operate in a competitive environment as they base their interest rates on funding cost. However. two banks appear to be less cost sensitive than the others. In the short run. most of the banks adjust their rates less strongly to funding cost increases than to decreases. which suggests competitive pressures. For one bank significant evidence is found for a quicker response to negative than to positive deviations of actual from desired interest rates.,True,0HANvIwAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,25,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10693-010-0095-2.pdf,13743545617441274735,/scholar?cites=13743545617441274735,,https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/77286067/Haan_Sterken2011_Article_Bank_SpecificDailyInterestRate.pdf,0,0,0

Evidence from adjusted Lerner indices for US banks,2012,Michael Koetter and James W Kolari and Laura Spierdijk,94,Review of Economics and Statistics,2,462-480,The MIT Press,The quiet life hypothesis posits that firms with market power incur inefficiencies rather than reap monopolistic rents. We propose a simple adjustment to Lerner indices to account for the possibility of forgone rents to test this hypothesis. For a large sample of U.S. commercial banks. we find that adjusted Lerner indices are significantly larger than conventional Lerner indices and trending upward over time. Instrumental variable regressions reject the quiet life hypothesis for cost inefficiencies. However. Lerner indices adjusted for profit inefficiencies reveal a quiet life among U.S. banks.,True,Eu0Lh4gAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,484,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00155,17842170126896554408,/scholar?cites=17842170126896554408,,https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/REST_a_00155,0,0,0

To identify the moral hazard effect of bailout expectations on bank risk. we exploit the fact that regional political factors explain bank bailouts but not bank risk. The sample includes all observed capital preservation measures and distressed exits in the German banking industry during 1995–2006.

Contrary to the usual quantitative proxies of financial development. the quality of financial institutions is measured in this study as the relative ability of banks to intermediate funds. An improvement in bank efficiency spurs five times more regional growth then an identical increase in credit does. More credit provided by efficient banks exerts an independent growth effect in addition to direct quantity and quality channel effects.,True,Eu0Lh4gAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,240,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426609000405,3519371559770430282,/scholar?cites=3519371559770430282,,https://helda.helsinki.fi/bof/bitstream/handle/123456789/7805/163096.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Furthermore. the neglect of systematic differences in cross-country studies could drive the result that finance matters. We suggest a measure of bank’s intermediation quality using bank-specific efficiency estimates and focus on the regions of one economy only: Germany. This quality measure has a significantly positive effect on growth. This result is robust to the exclusion of banks operating in multiple regions. controlling for the proximity of financial markets. when distinguishing different banking sectors active in Germany. and when excluding the structurally weaker East from the sample.,True,Eu0Lh4gAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,163,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560610000781,7128337951510529696,/scholar?cites=7128337951510529696,,,0,0,0
1139850,Real estate prices and bank stability,2010,Michael Koetter and Tigran Poghosyan,34,Journal of Banking & Finance,6,1129-1138,North-Holland,Real estate prices can deviate from their fundamental value due to rigid supply. heterogeneity in quality. and various market imperfections. which have two contrasting effects on bank stability. Higher prices increase the value of collateral and net wealth of borrowers and thus reduce the likelihood of credit defaults. In contrast. persistent deviations from fundamentals may foster the adverse selection of increasingly risky creditors by banks seeking to expand their loan portfolios. which increases bank distress probabilities. We test these hypotheses using unique data on real estate markets and banks in Germany. House price deviations contribute to bank instability. but nominal house price developments do not. This finding corroborates the importance of deviations from the fundamental value of real estate. rather than just price levels or changes alone. when assessing bank stability.,True,Eu0Lh4gAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,163,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426609003070,16732932448593277732,/scholar?cites=16732932448593277732,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39942468/Real_estate_prices_and_bank_stability20151112-16430-1vhrvgr.pdf,0,0,0

Series 2: Banking and Financial Supervision,We investigate the consistency of efficiency scores derived with two competing frontier methods in the financial economics literature: Stochastic Frontier and Data Envelopment Analysis. We sample 34.192 observations for all German universal banks and analyze whether efficiency measures yield consistent results according to five criteria between 1993 and 2004: levels. rankings. identification of extreme performers. stability over time and correlation to standard accounting-based measures of performance. We find that non-parametric methods are particularly sensitive to measurement error and outliers. Furthermore. our results show that accounting for systematic differences among commercial. cooperative and savings banks is important to avoid misinterpretation about the status of efficiency of the total banking sector. Finally. despite ongoing fundamental changes in Europe?s largest banking system. efficiency rank stability is very high in the short run. However. we also find that annually estimated efficiency scores are markedly less stable over a period of twelve years. in particular for parametric methods. Thus. the implicit assumption of serial independence of bank production in most methods has an important influence on obtained efficiency rankings.,True,Eu0Lh4gAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC,161,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/19757,10326398800884317706,/scholar?cites=10326398800884317706,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/19757/1/200610dkp_b.pdf,0,0,0

First. higher                     market power is associated with lower risk. Second. holding assets in many                     countries reduce market power at home. but banks with a higher share of foreign                     assets exhibit higher market power.

But such deviations can also be due to omitted systematic differences among banks. In this study. we examine the effects of heterogeneity on bank efficiency scores. We compare different specifications of a stochastic cost and alternative profit frontier model with a baseline specification. After conducting a specification test. we discuss heterogeneity effects on efficiency levels. ranks and the tails of the efficiency distribution. We find that heterogeneity controls influence both banks’ optimal costs and profits and their ability to be efficient. Differences in efficiency scores are important for more than only methodological reasons.

In this study we employ a unique data set of approximately 1000 mergers to analyze the determinants of bank mergers. We use undisclosed information on banks’ regulatory intervention history to distinguish between distressed and non-distressed mergers. Among merging banks. we find that improving financial profiles lower the likelihood of distressed mergers more than the likelihood of non-distressed mergers. The likelihood to acquire a bank is also reduced but less than the probability to be acquired. Both distressed and non-distressed mergers have worse CAMEL profiles than non-merging banks. Hence. non-distressed mergers may be motivated by the desire to forestall serious future financial distress and prevent regulatory intervention.,True,Eu0Lh4gAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,152,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037842660700088X,8050118244498279886,/scholar?cites=8050118244498279886,,,0,0,0

We suggest an integrated micro–macro approach with two core virtues. First. we measure financial stability directly at the bank level as the probability of distress. Second. we integrate a microeconomic hazard model for bank distress and a standard macroeconomic model. The advantage of this approach is to incorporate micro information. to allow for non-linearities and to permit general feedback effects between financial distress and the real economy. We base the analysis on German bank and macro data between 1995 and 2004. Our results confirm the existence of a trade-off between monetary and financial stability.

However. the success of bank mergers remains a continuous matter of debate.This paper suggests a taxonomy to evaluate post‐merger performance on the basis of cost and profit efficiency (CE and PE). I identify successful mergers as those that fulfill simultaneously two criteria. First. merged institutes must exhibit efficiency levels above the average of non‐merging banks. Second. banks must exhibit efficiency changes between merger and evaluation year above efficiency changes of non‐merging banks. I assess the post‐merger performance up to 11 years after the mergers and relate it to the transfer of skills. the adequacy to merge distressed banks and the role of geographical distance. Roughly every second merger is a success in terms of either CE or PE.

Oxygen exposure at 300 K under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions leads to the formation of a continuous NiO (111)-like film consisting of nanosized domains. At 750 K. we observe the formation of a nanoheterogeneous film composed primarily of NiO (111) surface oxide nuclei. which exhibit virtually the same energy-dependent reflectivity as in the case of 300 K and which are separated by oxygen-free Ni (111) terraces.

However. there are many barriers which prevent the full potential of DR being realised. Unlocking of this potential. through identification of DR enablers. can be aided through systematic classification and analysis of DR barriers. To this end. while previous works mostly focused on individual aspects. this paper develops a comprehensive ‘socio-techno-economic’ review. classification and analysis of DR barriers and enablers in a Smart Grid context. This provides an intellectual framework which may be used to underpin further work on the study and integration of DR. DR barriers are classified as either fundamental (i.e.. relating to intrinsic human nature/essential enabling technology) or secondary (i.e.. relating to anthropogenic institutions/or system feedbacks).

1141457,A review on torrefied biomass pellets as a sustainable alternative to coal in power generation,2014,LJR Nunes and JCO Matias and JPS Catalão,40,,,153-160,Pergamon,The torrefaction of biomass is a thermochemical process based on the de composition of hemicellulose. which is the dominant reaction. while the cellulose and lignin fractions remain almost unaffected. Torrefaction of biomass improves its physical properties like grindability. particle shape. size. and distribution. pelletability. and composition properties like moisture. carbon and hydrogen contents. and calorific value. The already higher energy density can be increased further by a pelletizing step after torrefaction. These improved properties make torrefied biomass particularly suitable for co-firing in power plants. Co-firing biomass with fossil fuels is one of the solutions to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of existing power plants.

1141477,A power quality index based on equipment sensitivity. cost. and network vulnerability,2004,Geun-Joon Lee and Mihaela M Albu and Gerald Thomas Heydt,19,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,3,1504-1510,IEEE,This paper focuses on voltage sag phenomena and their impact on customer satisfaction. In order to derive a unique power quality of service index. information from both the supply network (according to standards in use) and the customer (defined in terms of load sensitivity and interruption cost) are merged. The well-known CBEMA power acceptability curve is revisited with definitions from the IEEE Standard 1159 superimposed. This depiction suggests a way to assign a cost or index of power quality events. Although individual cost assignments used in the calculation are subject to question. once the assignments are made. the calculation is consistent and gives a useful measure of quality of service. The method is illustrated factoring severity of the events based on the CBEMA curve and IEEE 1159 classified power quality events.

The diffusion of DG in the electrical networks could be beneficial to improve network operation. but excessive amounts of DG in operation could cause violations of the system constraints. This paper presents a new method to obtain the optimal size of DG sources in electrical distribution systems. taking into account the time-dependent evolution of generation and load.

The external stage is carried out by selecting a set of candidate nodes through a clustering-based approach based on normalised loss sensitivity factors and normalised node voltages.

A negative effect of these states is represented by the increase of power losses in the network elements. Even if the symmetrical sinusoidal state is initially considered for the power losses. in reality this often leads to power lines overloading. especially for the neutral.

The load curves provided by smart meters were processed and their main indicators were calculated. By outliers elimination. the remaining data have led to the discovery of accurate patterns that characterized very well the load curves characteristics through indicators. The proposed approach was tested using a real database with 60 substations from a rural area. With the help of these patterns. the operation and planning of electric distribution systems could be made more efficient.,True,Oe4p0esAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7905046/,5952304881824437803,/scholar?cites=5952304881824437803,,,0,0,0
1141551,Determination of typical load profiles in hydro-power plant by clustering techniques,2010,Daniela Comanescu and Gheorghe Grigoras and Gheorghe Cartina and Florina Rotaru,,,,1294-1297,IEEE,The operational strategy for maintain system stability is based on technological system services bidden by the OTS from the market. The modality from which the producers evaluated themselves the reserve of power takes an important role. Analyzing load profile from the hydro cascade is the first step that electrical companies must do for evaluated the daily power reserve. Thus they can provide better and improve efficiency marketing strategies. An alternative to the settlement based on metered demand is load profile based settlement. Results obtained demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to become first step of an efficient evaluated strategy.,True,Oe4p0esAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5510523/,9932879261286777076,/scholar?cites=9932879261286777076,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Grigoras_Gheorghe/publication/251937274_Determination_of_typical_load_profiles_in_hydro-power_plant_by_clustering_techniques/links/5942438c0f7e9b1d4531d5bc/Determination-of-typical-load-profiles-in-hydro-power-plant-by-clustering-techniques.pdf,0,0,0
1141552,Evaluation of the performances of efficient transformers in distribution networks by fuzzy techniques,2010,Gheorghe Grigoras and Gheorghe Cartina and Elena-Crenguta Bobric and Florina Rotaru,,,,1281-1284,IEEE,The replacement of the old transformers with efficient transformers provide an excellent opportunity to conserve energy right from the distribution installations and to recover the cost of equipment rendered obsolete by deployment of the Smart Grid System. The size and complexity of distribution networks make it impossible to carry out an exhaustive analysis and consequently. the assessment of solutions for various optimization problems. One of the most important such problems is to evaluate energy saving solutions for these networks. The paper proposes using fuzzy techniques to overcome this difficulty. A study case is presented for an urban distribution network. by using the fuzzy techniques.,True,Oe4p0esAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5510405/,5828891572322674213,/scholar?cites=5828891572322674213,,,0,0,0
1141553,Two-stage distributed generation optimal sizing with clustering-based node selection,2012,Florina Rotaru and Gianfranco Chicco and Gheorghe Grigoras and Gheorghe Cartina,40,International journal of electrical power & energy systems,1,120-129,Elsevier,Nowadays. distributed generation (DG) is playing a significant role in the electrical energy systems. The diffusion of DG in the electrical networks could be beneficial to improve network operation. but excessive amounts of DG in operation could cause violations of the system constraints. This paper presents a new method to obtain the optimal size of DG sources in electrical distribution systems. taking into account the time-dependent evolution of generation and load. This method adopts a procedure composed of two nested calculation stages. The external stage is carried out by selecting a set of candidate nodes through a clustering-based approach based on normalised loss sensitivity factors and normalised node voltages. The internal stage is an exhaustive search driven by the calculation of an objective function with energy losses and voltage profile components. aimed at finding upgraded DG sizes using …,True,FOpO2_0AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,96,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142061512000397,1951450295259343426,/scholar?cites=1951450295259343426,,,0,0,0
