1317726,Mexico’s low carbon futures: An integrated assessment for energy planning and climate change mitigation by 2050,2017,Alejandra Elizondo and Vanessa Pérez-Cirera and Alexandre Strapasson and José Carlos Fernández and Diego Cruz-Cano,93,Futures,,14-26,Pergamon,This paper shows an integrated assessment for energy planning and climate change mitigation in Mexico. as an international case study. The Mexico 2050 Calculator was used to run a number of low carbon future scenarios by 2050. The calculator consists of a whole-systems model. which combines the main sectors of the Mexican economy into a single visual tool. By integrating energy and carbon dynamics across all sectors and carrying out a sensitivity analysis of the entire model. we compare four low carbon energy scenarios to assess current energy policy strategies in the country. The methodology proposed in this paper can also be applied to any other nation. particularly to those with similar models already available. Our findings show the relative impact of each sector and their various interactions for achieving Mexico’s ratified climate commitments.

1317730,Innovation subject to sustainability: the European policy on biofuels and its effects on innovation in the Brazilian bioethanol industry,2012,Henrique Pacini and Alexandre Betinardi Strapasson,8,Journal of Contemporary European Research,3,,,Biofuels are a suitable complement for fossil energy in the transport sector and bioethanol is the main biofuel traded worldwide. Based on the assumption that innovation can be influenced by regulation. the Brazilian bioethanol industry is facing new requirements from external actors while reaching for international markets. Until 2010. national environmental laws were the main sustainability instrument that the biofuel industry faced. With the introduction of sustainability criteria for biofuels in the European Fuels Quality Directive (FQD) and Renewable Energy Directive (RED) of 2009. bioethanol producers have been pressured to innovate in respect of the requirements of future markets. Here. the aim is to analyse the case of Brazil. given the potential exports of sugarcane-based ethanol from this country to the EU. Brazil provides an interesting overview of how a bioethanol industry innovated while facing sustainability requirements in the past. A comparison between the European requirements and the industrys status quo is then explored. The EU criteria are likely to have effects on the Brazilian bioethanol industry and incremental improvements in sustainability levels might take place based on the sustainability requirements. In addition. the industry could follow two other paths. namely risk diversification by engaging in multi-output models; and market leakage towards less-regulated markets. At the same time. an environmental overregulation of the biofuel market may make it more difficult for emerging biofuel industries in other countries. especially in Africa. by creating a barrier rather than contributing to its expansion.

1317731,Sustainability Assessment of Large Irrigation Dams in Senegal: A Cost-Benefit Analysis for the Senegal River Valley,2016,Stanislaw Manikowski and Alexandre Strapasson,4,Frontiers in Environmental Science,,18,Frontiers,Starting in the 1970s. the Senegalese Government invested in the development of irrigated schemes in the Senegalese part of the Senegal River Valley (S-SRV). From that time to 2012. the irrigated schemes increased from 10.000 ha to more than 110.000 ha. In the meantime. the economic viability of these schemes started to be questioned. It also appeared that the environmental health and social costs might outweigh the benefits of irrigation. Using a life cycle assessment approach and project cost-benefits modelling. this study (i) quantified the costs and benefits of the S-SRV irrigated rice production. (ii) evaluated the costs and benefits of its externalities and (iii) discussed the irrigated rice support policy. The net financial revenues from the irrigated schemes were positive. but their economic equivalences. The economic return rate (EER) was below the expected 12% and the net present value (NPV) over 20 years of the project represented a loss of about US$-19.6 million. However. if we also include the project’s negative externalities. such as the reduced productivity of the valley ecosystems. protection cost of human health. environmental degradation and social impacts. then the NPV would be much worse. approximately US$-572.1 million. Therefore. the results show that to stop the economic loss and alleviate the human suffering. the S-SRV development policy should be revised using an integrated approach and the exploitation technology should aim at environmental sustainability. This paper may offer useful insights for reviewing the current Senegalese policies for the valley. as well as for assessing other similar cases or future projects …,True,II1U5T0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,15,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00018/full,4119142496271380102,/scholar?cites=4119142496271380102,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00018/full,0,0,0
1317732,The limits of bioenergy: a complex systems approach to land use dynamics and constraints,2016,Alexandre Strapasson,1,"Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the ISSS-2015 Berlin, Germany",1,,,This paper summarises a PhD thesis recently defended by the author at Imperial College London. The aim is to present a novel methodology to obtain an understanding of the potential limits of bioenergy by using a complex systems approach for assessing land use dynamics and constraints. Although bioenergy is classified as a renewable energy source. land is a finite resource and its expansion limited. The anthropogenic demands on land result from a combination of multiple provisioning services. These include global food consumption. dietary preference. crop and livestock yields. land use integration. wastes and residues. and bioenergy yields and forms. as well as the allocation of surplus land for forestry and energy crops. and the potential role of negative emission technologies. Thus. bioenergy is just one part of a complex land-use system. The general hypothesis is that there are fundamental limits to the overall scale and rate of the sustainable expansion of bioenergy. which can be assessed by means of combinations of empirical data. mapping tools and complex systems models. To this end. a novel methodological approach is proposed. which is based on two original integrated models. The first one is termed the Global Calculator Land Use Change Model (GCLUC). developed as part of the Global Calculator initiative. in which land is freely allocated worldwide and food security is assumed a priority. The second considers land for dedicated energy crops as a delimited reserve. by integrating Hubbert’s curve principles (originally proposed for peak oil assessments) in agro-ecological zoning schemes (as recently done for sugarcane …,True,II1U5T0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,14,http://journals.isss.org/index.php/proceedings59th/article/view/2585,5234075127766995394,/scholar?cites=5234075127766995394,,,https://journals.isss.org/index.php/proceedings59th/article/download/2585/881,0,0,0

1317737,Land use futures in Europe: how changes in diet. agricultural practices and forestlands could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions,2016,ALEXANDRE Strapasson and JEREMY Woods and KOFI Mbuk,,,,,Imperial College London,Food consumption patterns and production methods have major implications for land use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Climate change mitigation policies are usually focused on energy. transport. buildings. infrastructure and industry. However. changes in our diet and associated land use for food production could substantially affect GHG emissions1. 2. 3. Europe’s dietary patterns have changed over time. including an increase in the consumption of processed food and variations in its international food trade balance. In addition. Europe has increased crop and livestock yields. and has modernised its agricultural systems. Consequently. land use in Europe has also changed. affecting land distribution for crops. livestock. forests. bioenergy. settlements and infrastructure. New land use dynamics can have major impacts on biodiversity. soil conservation. water management and GHG emissions. Agriculture represents around 10% of the total GHG emissions in the European Union’s 28 member states (EU28). which stood at 4.611 MtCO2eq in 20134.The current balance of land use in the EU28 is illustrated in Figure 1. Perhaps surprisingly. the share of forested land has increased by 7% since 1990. The EU forest sector is predominantly managed (85%) and available for wood supply. Approximately three quarters of forest produce each year is harvested. which may have contributed to an annual uptake of around 435 MtCO2eq at the farm level5. making EU forests a GHG emissions sink.,True,II1U5T0AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandre_Strapasson/publication/301302411_Land_use_futures_in_Europe_How_changes_in_diet_agricultural_practices_and_forestlands_could_help_reduce_greenhouse_gas_emissions/links/57115c1008ae4ef74524b20d/Land-use-futures-in-Europe-How-changes-in-diet-agricultural-practices-and-forestlands-could-help-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions.pdf,15896014986325269490,/scholar?cites=15896014986325269490,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandre_Strapasson/publication/301302411_Land_use_futures_in_Europe_How_changes_in_diet_agricultural_practices_and_forestlands_could_help_reduce_greenhouse_gas_emissions/links/57115c1008ae4ef74524b20d/Land-use-futures-in-Europe-How-changes-in-diet-agricultural-practices-and-forestlands-could-help-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions.pdf,0,0,0

Its great hydropower units allowed the country to indiscriminately use electricity for obtaining heat. However. this electricity can now be replaced by different energy sources of chemical origin. This research aimed to identify the distortion in the Brazilian energy mix. as well as to assess the potential for primary energy saving bound to be obtained by replacing electricity by final energy transformed into useful energy through combustion. instead of orienting it to electric power generation. Estimations were conducted on the replacement of electricity by natural gas in thermal end-uses of the different consumer sectors. Moreover. a comparative analysis was conducted on the energy mixes among the different countries in the world. concerning useful energy in the form of heat. so as to estimate the electric power percentage that could be replaced in Brazil and the amount of energy destined to an equivalent combustion chemical reaction. The possible environmental gains deriving from such a replacement were also analyzed.

Routledge, London",,210-227,,Bioenergy is an opportunity for tackling global warming and promoting sustainable development globally. More than a renewable energy source. bioenergy can be used as a vector for rural development. contributing to a more equitable geopolitical relationship worldwide. However. the confluence of energy and food demands and the increasing scarcity of natural resources impose an increasing need to find new strategies for sustainable bioenergy. The challenge is how to promote bioenergy in a symbiotic way with food production and conservation of ecosystems and their services. Therefore. land use assessments for biomass are fundamental for governing the equitable use of land and the allocation of that land to different productive and non-productive uses. Energy and food securities are strategic issues for any country and they often supersede options to develop economically and environmentally sustainable bioenergy. which in turn entail extra effort requiring public policies encompassing global responsibilities. World population. for example. is likely to increase from about 7 billion in 2014 to 9.6 billion inhabitants by 2050. in a range between 8.3 and 10.9 billion (UN. 2011). Associated with this United Nations forecast. income per capita is likely to keep increasing in the coming decades. especially in emerging countries with high population. which consequently would lead to a greater demand for food and energy per capita. Rural exodus is also a challenge for cities in developing countries. mainly in Africa and parts of Asia and Latin America.

The GC is an accessible integrated model which calculates the cumulative emissions of a basket of the main greenhouse gases that result from a set of technological and lifestyle choices made at the global level and as defined by the user within a single system dynamics tool. Using the GC. we simulated ambitious scenarios against business as usual trends in order to stay below 2 °C and 1.5 °C of maximum temperature change by the end of this century and carried out a sensitivity analysis of the entire GC model option space. We show that the calculator is useful for making broad simulations for energy. carbon and land use dynamics. and demonstrate how combined and sustained mitigation efforts across different sectors are urgently needed to meet climate targets.,True,II1U5T0AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X2030047X,8096943011555605072,/scholar?cites=8096943011555605072,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X2030047X,0,0,0

It builds on the success that a number of countries have had in developing their own countrylevel 2050 Calculators but it extends the approach by illustrating the detrimental impacts of climate change associated with global-level choices. The project is led by the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) 5. and co-funded by Climate-KIC6.The Global Calculator presents a novel methodological approach for modelling both carbon and land use dynamics at a global scale for the following sectors: Transport; Manufacturing; Electricity; Land. Food and Bioenergy (“Land/Food/Bioenergy”); and Buildings. It also considers climate change impacts. different rates of population growth and urbanisation. and scenarios for the inclusion of speculative Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGR) technologies. All sectors and variables are interconnected in a dynamic model. which allows users to generate a large number of GHG emission reduction trajectories online.

In spite of the very brittle nature of Silicon. due to the action of the encapsulating polymer and residual compressive stresses resulting from the lamination stage. cracks experience crack closure and contact during mechanical unloading. partially recovering their original electric response. Crack propagation in case of cyclic loading. as. e.g.. in case of vibrations due to transportation and use. have also been reported for the very first time.

1317791,Numerical model for the prediction of the electric response of Solar Cells in presence of cracks,,Irene Berardone and Mauro Corrado and Marco Paggi,,,,,,The durability of photovoltaic (PV) modules is under debate by the scientific Community [1-3] and international organizations [4]. The reduction of the feed-in tariffs gives prominence to the understanding of the sources of losses in the energy production and to the quantification of the degradation of PV systems. The problem of durability is expected to be even more relevant in the next few years due to the rapid progress of building-integrated photovoltaics with the use of not standardized modules. In these cases. in addition to energy production. PV modules have also to guarantee a safe structural performance and other architectonic specifics like shadowing. All of these aspects will have to be taken into account when designing their layer composition.At present we are still far from having a simulation tool able to quantify the impact of cracks on the electric response and on the durability of PV modules. Under the assumption of a worst case scenario. cracks have been treated in [1] as defects interrupting fingers and leading to insulated portions of the Silicon cell. Using an electric model accounting for the active cell area. an estimate of maximum powerlosses has also been made in [1]. The position and the orientation of cracks with respect to busbars were discovered to be among the most relevant quantities. since they impact on the electric performance in different ways in relation to the size of the portion of the solar cell that becomes insulated. Alternatively to the direct experimental approach. a method to estimate the probability of cracking has been proposed in [5] based on Weibull statistics of Silicon and on the stress level in solar cells predicted …,True,zVg7-i4oUigC:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://musam.imtlucca.it/FIRB_varie/EUPVSEC.pdf,,,,,http://musam.imtlucca.it/FIRB_varie/EUPVSEC.pdf,0,0,0

1317806,p-block elements as negative electrode materials for Magnesium-ion batteries: electrochemical mechanism and performance,2016,Fabrizio Murgia,,,,,,One of the most challenging hurdles that the World has to face in the next decades is the sustainable use of energy. In a scenario where western societies are largely dependent of the fossil fuels for maintaining their wellness. i.e. for heating. automotive transportation and electricity production. and developing countries need to feed their growing economies. it is worth underlying both the major impact on the environment due to the indiscriminate use of such combustibles but also the geopolitical issues for the non-producing countries. Energy harvesting by renewable sources can help limiting the dependence on fossil fuel exploitation but cannot perfectly replace conventional power plant due to its intrinsic intermittency.Batteries are the devices that can draw a line under this situation. since they can stock the energy surplus when the plant is operating and then can squeeze it in the power grid when there is a lack of production. Moreover. they are also targeted to fulfil the even growing demand of energy for portable applications (mobile phones and computers. and nowadays cars and trucks). The excellent performance and the well-established technology of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) put them in a crucial position for supporting this new energy revolution.

The leakage in a device can be identified only during the physical test. once after the product is developed. leading to increased development time and cost. The leakage is purely based on the type of sealing element (O-rings) and sealing pressure. Since the sealing elements are hyperelastic and exhibit highly nonlinear behavior. there is no standard formulation available to predict the sealing pressure. It can be predicted using finite element analysis (FEA) in the design stage itself. One of the main inputs for the finite element analysis is the exact material parameter of the sealing element.

The focus of the study is on the swirling effect imposed by helicoid surfaces. Six helicoid swirl inserts of single vane. double vanes and triple vanes with swirl number (Sw) of 0.75 and 1.1 are used in this study. The heat transfer measurements are made for the Reynolds number range of 12700-32700 and for the nozzle exit to impinging plate distance (H/D) of 1. 2. 3 and 4 using thermo chromic liquid crystal technique. The swirling impinging jet is also compared with circular impinging jet on the heat transfer performance. The obtained experimental results provide the information on the behavior of single. double and triple helicoid swirl inserts on the heat transfer performance. The experimental values are analyzed with multi objective optimization technique of principle component analysis by computing multi response performance index (MRPI). Their performance is presented in terms of heat transfer rate through evaluation of Nusselt number on the impinging surface and heat transfer uniformity and decay of Nusselt number. The principle component analysis reveals that the double helicoid with higher H/D ratio improves performance of the swirling jet with relatively higher computed MRPI.

Availability of firm low-carbon technologies. including nuclear. natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration. and bioenergy. reduces electricity costs by 10%–62% across fully decarbonized cases. Below 50 gCO2/kWh. these resources lower costs in the vast majority of cases. Additionally. as emissions limits decrease. installed capacity of several resources changes non-monotonically.

In the face of these transformations. many conventional electricity resource capacity expansion models are no longer adequate for rigorous decision support and policy analysis. This working paper describes the formulation of “GenX.” a highly-configurable electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art improvements in electricity system modeling to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape. GenX is a constrained optimization model that determines the mix of electricity generation. storage. and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in a future planning year at lowest cost subject to a variety of power system operational constraints and specified policy constraints. such as CO2 emissions limits. The appropriate level of model resolution with regards to chronological variability of electricity demand and renewable energy availability. power system operational detail and unit commitment constraints. and transmission and distribution network representation each vary for a given planning problem or policy question.

1317875,Decarbonization of power systems: analyzing different technological pathways,2016,Nestor A Sepulveda,,,,,,Climate change poses a major challenge to society. Different sectors of society will need to respond in different ways; for the power sector. the response will require the aggressive reduction of CO2 emissions to near zero by 2050. There is no unique pathway for achieving a given level of decarbonization. and different pathways will require greater or lesser resources. In general. as the degree of carbon mitigation increases. each additional unit of reduction will become more expensive. The world has limited resources. as do national economies. Thus. whether the solution to decarbonization is achieved through markets or through centralized planning. the solution should be the one that maximizes society's welfare. i.e.. that achieves the goal at minimum cost for society. This thesis explores the potential cost implications of different decarbonization pathways for the electricity generation mix in the year 2050. The impacts of different CO2 reduction targets and technological choices on the cost of decarbonization are compared. The average price of electricity is used as a metric for the cost of decarbonization to society. An important requirement of the analysis is to take account of changes in the expected cost of existing technologies over this period. as well as the possibility that new technologies will become available. This research takes a systemic view. including a detailed representation of the interactions between different types of power system technologies. taking into consideration the synergies and limitations that each asset class creates and/or imposes on others.

Volume 1: Applied Energy Symposium: MIT A+ B,,22-24,,The characteristics of fossil fuels (low-cost storage. economic variable output enabled by low-capitalcost high-operating-cost power systems. etc.) have resulted in an energy system where fossil fuels separately supply energy to the electricity. industrial (heat) and transport (liquid fuels) sectors. World systems are undergoing a profound change driven by (1) large-scale addition of wind and solar and (2) the goal of a low-carbon electricity grid. Nuclear. wind and solar have high capital costs and low operating costs where the cost of energy increases rapidly if operate at part load. We examined integrating the electricity and industrial sectors by (1) nuclear co-generation with production of heat for industry and electricity and (2) addition of heat storage to increase reactor capacity factors. This system design substantially reduces total energy costs by three separate mechanisms. Modeling of electricity and industrial energy systems shows nuclear cogeneration reduces energy costs by changing the hourly energy demand curves to better match production from low-carbon energy sources resulting in higher power-plant utilization. Cogeneration enables optimizing the electricity and industrial sector by varying industrial production to minimize total costs with added electricity sales at times of high prices.

En pratique. les tenants de cette approche s' opposent à la libéralisation du commerce agricole. exigent une protection accrue des producteurs locaux incapables de rivaliser avec la concurrence étrangère et favorisent le maintien d'une agriculture de proximité pour alimenter les marchés régionaux. Entres autres retombées positives. l'agriculture de proximité créerait plus d'emplois locaux.

Their installation into thermally insulated roofs of low energy buildings can be a problem because of thermal bridges and condensation problems. This article is focused on a CFD simulation thermal analysis that includes four variations of light pipes with a segment of a flat roof. Common light pipes with a hollow light guiding tube were compared to special light pipes containing an additional glass unit located inside the tube.

The advantage of this system is its suitability for installation in both new and existing buildings in the form of precast heat insulation panels attached to their facades. The study shows that by active control of the supply water temperature. it is possible to alternate the walĺs function between space heating and a thermal barrier. The wall system has the potential to significantly reduce heat loss when used as a thermal barrier. When operated as space heating. embedding the pipes in thermal insulation reduced the heating capacity by 50% as compared to systems with pipes arranged in a concrete core and by 63% for pipes arranged in a layer underneath the surface.

1317930,Thermal CFD analysis of tubular light guides,2013,Ondřej Šikula and Jitka Mohelníková and Josef Plášek,6,Energies,12,6304-6321,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Tubular light guides are applicable for daylighting of windowless areas in buildings. Despite their many positive indoor climate aspects they can also present some problems with heat losses and condensation. A computer CFD model focused on the evaluation of temperature distribution and air flow inside tubular light guides of different dimensions was studied. The physical model of the tested light guides of lengths more than 0.60 m proves shows that Rayleigh numbers are adequate for a turbulent air flow. The turbulent model was applied despite the small heat flux differences between the turbulent and laminar model. The CFD simulations resulted into conclusions that the growing ratio of length/diameter increases the heat transmission loss/linear transmittance as much as by 50 percent. Tubular light guides of smaller diameters have lower heat transmission losses compared to the wider ones of the same lengths with the same outdoor temperature being taken into account. The simulation results confirmed the thermal bridge effect of the tubular light guide tube inside the insulated flat roof details. The thermal transmittance of the studied light guides in the whole roof area was substituted with the point thermal bridges. This substitution gives possibility for simple thermal evaluation of the tubular light pipes in roof constructions.

1317960,Characterizing fuel reactivity in advanced internal combustion engines,2014,Marc E Baumgardner,,,,,Colorado State University. Libraries,The urgent need to increase efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions from internal combustion engines has resulted in an increased interest in alternative combustion modes.  Premixed or partially premixed compression ignition modes. such as homogeneous-charge compression ignition (HCCI). reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) and multi-zone stratified compression ignition (MSCI) have been a particular focus because of their potential to deliver enhanced fuel efficiency and meet exhaust emissions mandates without the addition of costly after-treatment technologies. For HCCI and other single fuel. partially premixed compression ignition schemes such as MSCI. many studies have shown that fuels with characteristics intermediate between gasoline and diesel fuel are necessary. Many researchers have shown. however. that existing industry metrics such as Octane Number and Cetane Number are insufficient to represent fuel ignition characteristics for advanced engine combustion modes. In light of the poor performance of traditional metrics. new methods have been proposed to try and better characterize. order. and rank fuels used in HCCI operation. However. studies have since shown that when a broad array of fuels are considered. these recent metrics fail to adequately define a characteristic HCCI fuel index.

1317966,Optical Diagnostics of Simple Biogas Flames,,Weston Staab and Harrison Van Til and James Consiglio and Marc Baumgardner,,,,,,BackgroundThe environmental and monetary impacts from disposing of organic waste streams from agricultural. animal. and industrial sources represent a significant cost as well as a potent health hazard. specifically. in developing world countries [1]. Processing these organic waste streams to create a combustible gas (eg biogas) is a promising alternative to traditional means of disposal in that the resulting biogas provides a renewable energy source as well as a nutrient rich slurry stream that can be used as an effective fertilizer [2]. Moreover. for the approximately two billion people who still rely on biomass as cooking fuel. the use of biogas could play a vital role in mitigating the significant negative health effects of cooking with traditional fuel supplies [3].[4]. A chief challenge in biogas research is the limited knowledge of how the combustion process is affected by components in the biogas mixture [5]–components such as H2S. organic compounds. and high amounts of CO2. which are not present in traditional hydrocarbon fuels.

Introduction aser-generated sparks can be used to ignite fuel-air mixtures. In recent years. several research groups1–11 have investigated the use of laser as an ignition source in automotive engines. jet engines and stationary gas-turbines. It is shown that laser ignition retains distinct advantages when compared to the classical ignition systems. By changing the focal length of the focusing lens. lasers allows for more flexibility in positioning the spark inside the combustor thus the ignition process can be initiated in a more favorable location where the fuel-air mixture is homogenous.

A Kalman filter observer is required to estimate the unknown states at the output from the noisy data. However. the main downside of the LQG controller's is that its robustness cannot be guaranteed because it consists of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and Kalman observer. and due to observer incorporation within the LQR framework results in loss of robustness which is undesirable.

1318020,The Global Petroluem Picture,2011,Robert Rapier,,"The Economics of Alternative Energy Sources and Globalization, USA, Bentham Science Publishers",,3-12,,For over 100 years. petroleum has played a key role in the global energy picture. Sharp increases in the price of petroleum can bring on recession and bankrupt industries in petroleum-importing countries. while at the same time providing huge windfalls for exporting countries. The twenty-first century. however. will see petroleum's share of the global energy portfolio diminish as global production begins to decline. A number of candidates will vie to take over as petroleum’s dominance fades. The renewable candidates include renewable distillates and ethanol. The energy investment required to produce a renewable fuel will be an important measure for determining how sustainable these fuels can be if petroleum is no longer enabling their production.,True,7HVXlbQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,1,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=LML86HsAnCMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:Fi7f_A2n3uQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=TueL6yhhWy&sig=WMrbfu8SN3TcLbamdk7BLU8QuFw,16491802563996233238,/scholar?cites=16491802563996233238,,,,0,0,0

The invention relates to a process for the hydroformyla tion of olefinically unsaturated compounds. in which the homogeneous. liquid mixture comprising catalyst and alde hyde which leaves the hydroformylation reactor is treated in countercurrent with synthesis gas at elevated temperature in a downstream extraction column.It is known that compounds containing olefinic double bonds can be reacted with carbon monoxide and hydrogen to form aldehydes (OXO process). The process is not restricted to the use of olefinic hydrocarbons. but can also be applied to starting materials which contain not only a double bond but further functional groups. preferably ones which remain unchanged under the reaction conditions. The classical oXo process employs cobalt as catalyst. Its effectiveness is based on the formation of cobalt carbonyl compounds by …,True,7HVXlbQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1,https://patents.google.com/patent/US7087795B2/en,12635680884033406532,/scholar?cites=12635680884033406532,,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/97/86/84/c9e87b5caed7d4/US7087795.pdf,0,0,0
