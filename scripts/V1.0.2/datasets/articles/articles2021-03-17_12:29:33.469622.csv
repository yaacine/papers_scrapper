Burestedt. C Nistor. U. Schagerlöf and J. Emnéus. Anal. Chem.. 2000. 72. 4171–4177).

In the present study. an outdoor soil burial test was performed in order to evaluate the susceptibility to degradation of polyolefins–cellulose composites. The structural and morphological changes were analyzed by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The weight loss of composite samples after burying in soil was recorded. The presence of new bands. as an indicator of degradation. was confirmed by FTIR-ATR spectra. The thermal stability of the composites after soil burial analyzed by TGA was slightly improved. with relatively higher temperatures being required to decompose the samples after exposure to environmental factors. SEM micrographs presented some modifications of the polymer surface. such as holes. cracks. exfoliations. and fractures. Increasing the cellulose percentage of the composite samples led to increased weight loss. From the obtained results. it can be concluded that composites based on polyolefins and renewable resources undergo a slow process of biodegradation after contact with environmental microorganisms and. with appropriate composition. could be applied to various environmental fields.

The study was designed to assess the effects on plants by the applications of PHs obtained from Trichoderma isolates grown on keratin wastes. Trichoderma isolates were characterized for indole-3-acetic acid and siderophores production. activity of lytic enzymes. phosphorous solubilization and inhibition of pathogens growth. using qualitative specific tests. Fungal isolates were cultured on a medium with keratin wastes (wool and feathers) to obtain PHs. Fungal PHs were tested in vivo for plant biostimulant action. as follows:(i) seeds germination test;(ii) activation of plant proton pump;(iii) evaluation of effect on tomato seedling growth. PHs from T. asperellum cultured on feathers medium reached the highest values for all parameters recorded (plant height and diameter. number of leaves and branches). with the exception of those for plant biomass. which were maximum for the wool medium. The metabolites released by keratin degradation under the activity of selected T. asperellum isolate improved crop health and productivity.

The energy transitions in the MW region are enough to cause bond rotation. Recently. microwave irradiation (MWI) has attracted much attention as a tool of preference in achieving and/or accelerating organic reactions. When matter is irradiated with MW. the ability of a molecule to absorb MWI is a function of two main mechanisms. These are namely molecular polarizability which in turn is a function of its dipole moment. and its ionic conduction. This chapter reviews the literature on the synthesis and reactions of three-. four- and five-membered heterocycles using MWI.

More so. the association of allelically imbalanced genes to important traits is yet to be understood. Here we assessed allelic imbalance (AI) in the heterozygote state of rice under non- and water-stress treatments and determined association of asymmetrically expressed genes with grain yield (GY) under drought stress by in-silico co-localization analysis and selective genotyping. The genotypes IR64. Apo and their F1 hybrid (IR64 × Apo) were grown under normal and water-limiting conditions. We sequenced the total RNA transcripts for all genotypes then reconstructed the two chromosomes in the heterozygote. We are able to estimate the transcript abundance of and the differential expression (DE) between the two parent-specific alleles in the rice hybrids. The magnitude and direction of AI are classified into two categories: (1) symmetrical or biallelic and (2) asymmetrical. The latter can be further classified as either IR64- or Apo-favoring gene. Analysis showed that in the hybrids grown under non-stress conditions. 179 and 183 favor Apo- and IR64-specific alleles. respectively. Hence. the number of IR64- and Apo-favoring genes is relatively equal. Under water-stress conditions. 179 and 255 favor Apo- and IR64-specific alleles. respectively. indicating that the number of allelically imbalanced genes is skewed towards IR64.

Dordrecht,The papaya (Carica papaya L.) is usually being harvested when they are about 25% ripe or when a tinge of yellow color appears on the skin. It takes only one to two weeks before the fruit ripens completely from the time of harvest. Losses due to postharvest diseases in some species reach up to about 60% of annual production. The two most important qualities required for efficient marketing of fruits are the taste and the overall appearance. The flexibility in marketing is determined mainly by the rate of fruit ripening. An extended ripening phase would prolong its shelf-life. thus allowing the fruit to be shipped to distant markets without spoilage. thereby increasing the potential target markets. and enabling the fruit to reach the market in better condition.

For this purpose. polymeric films were deposited on polycarbonate track-etched (PCTE) membranes of 50 nm and 100 nm pore size. The films were generated by low-pressure glow discharge plasma polymerization of vinyl acetic acid (CH2CHCH2COOH) or perfluorohexane (n-C6F14) monomers. The plasma discharge was operated under pulsed conditions to provide better control of the polymeric film chemistry along with improved control of film thickness. The gradual reduction in average membrane pore sizes with increasing film thickness resulted in controlled decreases in the permeation rates of O2 and CO2 gases. In addition to film thickness. the permeation rates were observed to be functions of the specific composition and cross-link …,True,CaFsmpUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,38,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738808001531,14188914093454926377,/scholar?cites=14188914093454926377,,,0,0,0

Morphological tailoring of conformal coatings of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conductive polymer (CP) on the A‐CNT scaffold is demonstrated by controlling CP thickness at the nm scale. Results show that the CP nano‐films dominate the electrode capacitance in a supercapacitor application. contributing as much as 10x (pseudo)capacitance over the electric double layer of pristine A‐CNT due to volumetric vs. surface charge storage. Comparison to theoretical ion mobilities shows that the conformal CP films have active sites at ∼30% doping. indicating the CP quality is similar to thin films on flat substrates and that all these sites are accessed at all CP thickness values (up to 10 nm PEDOT thickness) and do not limit the rate of ion transport in and out of …,True,CaFsmpUAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,30,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/admi.201400076,15534393686747925393,/scholar?cites=15534393686747925393,,,0,0,0

With the increases in population in time. human beings started to look for new resources willing to get “the more” and “the fastest”. Just like the invention of steam. firstly. they increased the density of the resources and produced “more” energy. However. instead of working on the density of water. which spreads with the solar energy. they chose an easier way. which was fuel that produced more energy when burnt. Unfortunately. the damages these fuel products create in the atmosphere and environment shaded their benefits. It did not take so long for the earth to run out of energy resources and to threaten environmental and human health. As a result of that. new energy resources were started to be sought and the studies enlightened the concepts of sustainable. renewable energy. Renewable energy is defined as “the energy source. which continues its existence for the following days within the evolution of nature”. Educators pointed out a need in students for gaining consciousness on renewable energy resources. In the light of the importance of renewable and sustainable energy. a “Renewable Energy Awareness Scale” that questioned to what extent the individuals were aware of renewable energy was developed. The Renewable Energy Awareness Scale. which consisted of 50 items. was administered as a pilot study. The factor analysis concluded with a scale of 39 items with a reliability coefficient of 0.944 was developed.,True,YTGkjFYAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,38,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/tojde/issue/16923/176621,11124774489000889554,/scholar?cites=11124774489000889554,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/156386,0,0,0

The former nitrogen states are consistent with a protonated amine. presumably. due to carbamate formation. The lower binding energy component (~396 eV) could possibly be due to strongly chemisorbed CO2. The maximum sorption capacity was about 4 mmole CO2/g sorbent at 85°C and 1 bar.

The electrical conductivity was measured in situ during the reduction process. The conductivity increased continuously during the hydrogen treatment because of the creation of anion vacancies and accompanying small polaron electrons. The conductivity–time relationship exhibits three distinct regions indicated as I. II. and III. For each of steps I and II. the conductivity increases exponentially with the reduction. It is suggested from the kinetic analysis of the data that region I is due to desorption of adsorbed oxygen states. Region II appears to be the reduction of surface lattice oxygen.

1177244,Thermodynamics of CO2 adsorption on polyethyleneimine mesoporous silica and activated carbon,2017,J Al-Marri and K Al-Saad and MA Saad and DJ Cortes and MM Khader,,,,,,A thermodynamic study of the enthalpies of adsorption of CO2 was conducted on polyethyleneimine 10k/ mesoporous silica (PEI-10k/MPS) and activated carbon (AC). These materials were chosen because of their high CO2 sorption capacities at about 85°C for PEI and about 20°C for the AC. therefore can capture CO2 with high efficiency in a wide temperature range. The absolute quantity of adsorbed CO2 as a function of equilibrium pressure at various temperatures was determined experimentally and fitted to isotherms of generalized Langmuir and Toth equations for PEI and AC. respectively. The adsorption of CO2 on PEI was favored with temperature revealing the endothermic nature of the process. On the other hand. CO2 adsorption on the AC was exothermic. The isosteric enthalpy of adsorption on PEI was about constant with CO2 loading at a value of 93 kJ.mol-1. confirming its chemical nature and corroboration with the Langmuir model. The corresponding isosteric enthalpy of the AC was in the range of ~-25 kJ.mol-1 and was continuously decreasing with CO2 loading; confirming the physisorption nature of the process and also that CO2/ CO2 interactions within the adsorption layer was significant.,True,9L_W0HwAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,15,http://repository.embuni.ac.ke/handle/123456789/1865,10964894583913064430,/scholar?cites=10964894583913064430,,http://repository.embuni.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/123456789/1865/the-hypoutilization-of-cardiac-rehabilitation-among-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-the-critical-role-of-th-2167-1168-1000e131.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The results satisfactorily fit the predictions of a mechanism based on nondissociative chemisorption of hydrogen on the oxygen vacancies at the surface of the hematite pellet. This chemisorption process activates the hydrogen molecule by substantially decreasing its bond energy and increasing its bond length. The calculated activation energy of the surface reaction over this temperature range was found to be much smaller than those reported earlier. The larger values are believed to have been affected by some diffusion control within the solid phase. as a result of the limitations of the weight loss technique which was used in those measurements.,True,9L_W0HwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,15,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022459696901759,7283967510914958563,/scholar?cites=7283967510914958563,,,0,0,0

The nano-catalyst was palladium/ceria supported on alumina prepared via a one-step solution-combustion synthesis (SCS) method. As confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HTEM). SCS preparative methodology resulted in segregating both Pd and Ce on the surface of the Al 2 O 3 support. Furthermore. HTEM showed that bigger Pd particles (5 nm and more) were surrounded by CeO 2. resembling a core shell structure. while smaller Pd particles (1 nm and less) were not associated with CeO 2. The intimate Pd-CeO 2 attachment resulted in insertion of Pd ions into the ceria lattice. and associated with the reduction of Ce 4+ into Ce 3+ ions; consequently. the formation of oxygen vacancies. XPS showed also that Pd had three oxidation states corresponding to Pd 0. Pd 2+ due to PdO. and highly ionized Pd ions (Pd (2+ x)+) which might originate from the insertion of Pd ions into the ceria lattice. The formation of intrinsic Ce 3+ ions. highly ionized (Pd 2+ species inserted into the lattice of CeO 2) Pd ions (Pd (2+ x)+) and oxygen vacancies is suggested to play a major role in the unique catalytic activity. The results indicated that the Pd-SCS nano-catalysts were exceptionally more active and stable than conventional catalysts. Under similar reaction conditions. the methane combustion rate over the SCS catalyst was~ 18 times greater than that of conventional catalysts.

Baghdad. The drinking water (DW) samples from 16 residential districts in Baghdad were chemically evaluated with reference to the raw water samples and water directly taken from the purification plants. In addition to the routinely measured parameters. 17 metals and 11 trihalomathane (THM) were measured. Generally. the samples of water analysed can be considered of good quality. The relatively high sulphate and aluminium contents results from the use of aluminium sulphate as flocculent. The ammonia and Nitrite concentrations were lower than the detectable limit. because ammonia is converted into chloramines and nitrite is converted into Nitrate during chlorination. This indicates no sewage contamination of the drinking water. The high chloride contents can be referred to the use of partially degraded hypo for the disinfection. The presence of THM's in the samples analysed is indicative of good disinfection process. The presence of these compounds is preferred better than bacterial contamination.

Experimental design is utilized here to plan for the practical work and analysis of the results. Batch wise experiments are carried out to equilibrate Cr and Pb solutions (250 mg/L) individually and simultaneously with montmorillonite (5 - 20 g/L) at various pH ranges (2 - 7.5) for 10 - 60 minutes. The results indicate perfect fit with the model used. Chromium adsorption is sensitive to pH changes being high at neutral medium. Lead is almost independent of the pH of the solution. In nearly neutral medium. the sorption capacity of Cr is 21.4 and that of lead is 24.3 mg/g. The optimum conditions for >96% Cr removal are 12 - 15 g clay/L. 40 - 50 minutes and a pH of 5 - 7. For lead. almost 100% removal can be attained using 12 - 15 g clay/L. 40 - 50 min. at a pH of 4 - 6. The effects of various operating parameters are discussed. Simultaneously. the lead shows a greater tendency to sorption than chromium and a ratio of 5:4 can best represent the occupation of the active surface of the clay. The most favorable conditions for simultaneous removing of Cr. 86% and Pb. 100% may be 12.5 g/L clay content and a pH of 7.5 within 30 minutes.

The process involves cutting the hide wastes intosmall pieces (1-2 cm2). and washing them with water to remove the dirt. The washedpieces are placed in the liming tank containing 10% of lime in water with stirring forfive weeks. After washing with water to remove the lime. the collagen is neutralizedto pH 7 with hydrochloric acid. The extraction is carried out in four stages using hotwater. The gelatin extracts are filtered. subjected to deionization and concentratedwith vacuum evaporator up to 20-35 wt%. The gelatin is then dried by two types ofdryers (tray dryer and spray dryer). Box-Wilson method is adopted to obtain a relationship between the three variables (temperature. time and pH) and gelatin yield in the first stage of extraction and twovariables (temperature and time) and the gelatin yield in the other third stages ofextraction process. The experimental data were fitted to second order polynomialmodels for all stages. The most favorable operating conditions for the extraction of gelatin are:-The First Stage: Temperature= 64 oC. Time= 5 hr. pH= 7The Second Stage: Temperature= 74 oC. Time= 3.72 hr. pH= 7The third Stage: Temperature= 84 oC. Time= 3.69 hr. pH= 7The fourth Stage: Temperature= 98 oC.

SO2 and a mixture of these two acid gases into urea solution in packed bed column. The absorption rate was studied as a function of absorbent temperature. urea concentration and acid gas concentration. The influence of liquid temperature between 10 - 40?C. urea concentration between 0.1 - 0.5 M and acid gas concentration NO2 between 100 - 1000 ppm (191 - 1910 mg/m3). SO2 between 500 - 2500 ppm (1310 - 6530 mg/m3) were investigated. The mass gas flow rate of 20.646 (kg/m2.min) at 25?C and the absorption rate were determined by measuring the NO2 and SO2 concentrations in the inlet and outlet streams of the absorptioncolumn. The absorption rate of SO2 increases with the decrease of temperature of absorbent (urea solution) and with the increase of the urea concentration. The presence of NO2 in the effluent gas stream lowers the absorption rate of SO2 in urea solution due to the fast reaction of NO2 with urea as compared with SO2. The absorption rate of NO2 decreases as the urea concentration exceeds 0.4 mol/l and for NO2 gas concentration of 100 ppm due to the decrease the diffusivity of the gas.

The crude oils are characterized with API gravity values in the range. 25 - 15. The V/Ni ratios for the studied crudes were in the range 3.7 to 5.4 and indicated a typical of the sapropelic-type organic matter. The Ni and V contents were correlated with API gravity where an increase of metal contents with the decrease in the API values could be observed. The plots of V and Ni versus sulfur indicated linear correlation. This is attributed to the increase of porphyrinic structures of the metals.

The dyes. which are commonly used for cellulose printing. are “reactive dyes” because of their high wet fastness and brilliant colors. The interaction of various dyes with the cellulose fiber depends upon the physiochemical properties that are governed by specific features of the dye molecule. The binding pattern of the reactive dye with cellulose fiber is called the ligand-receptor concept. In the current study. the three dimensional quantitative structure property relationship (3D-QSPR) technique was applied to understand the red reactive dyes interactions with the cellulose by the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) method. This method was successfully utilized to predict a reliable model. The predicted model gives satisfactory statistical results and in the light of these. it was further analyzed. Additionally. the graphical outcomes (contour maps) help us to understand the modification pattern and to correlate the structural changes with respect to the absorptivity. Furthermore. the final selected model has potential to assist in understanding the charachteristics of the external test set.

It is found that the emission properties of the polarity-sensitive (solvatochromic) naphthalimide derivative attached to three different thermoresponsive polymers are highly specific to the exact chemical structure of the macromolecule. While the dye emits very weakly below the LCST when incorporated into poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) or into a polyacrylate backbone bearing only short OEG side chains. it is strongly emissive in polymethacrylates with longer OEG side chains.

Mixtures of polyelectrolytes and surfactants show a highly complex association behavior. and often a cooperative adsorption of surfactants. following the Satake–Yang binding isotherm is observed. The binding of surfactants is a multistep process. where a non-cooperative adsorption is followed. at higher coverages. by a cooperative process. Accordingly. three processes are considered in the derivation of the ITC formalism: the non-cooperative and cooperative binding and. as the newly introduced contribution. the transition of non-cooperatively bound surfactants to cooperatively bound state.

Two membrane methods (ie Donnan dialysis-DD-and the pertraction in a multimembrane hybrid system-MHS) were used and compared. Related ionic fluxes and separation coefficients for uni-and divalent cations were measured and discussed. It was found that the DD as a simple membrane technique can be used to permeate Zn2+ and Cu2+ with high fluxes associated with fluxes of other cations (Na+. Ca2+. Mg2+). The selective recovery of Zn2+ at the presence of Mg2+. K+. and Na+ was reached in the MHS composed of cation-exchange membranes and a liquid membrane containing di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) or bis (2. 4. 4-trimethylpentyl) thiophosphinic acid (Cyanex 302) as a selective carrier. In the case of solutions remaining after zinc electroplating. the Zn2+ flux was 1.6 x 10-11 mol/cm2s. and separation coefficients αZn ΣM gained the value of 8-10. The use of the MHS for processing dissolved and acidified sludge (pH= 1) allowed recovery of Zn2+ with the transport stationary rate equal to 3.2 x 10-11 mol/cm2s. According to the D2EHPA properties. other cations such as Cr3* Fe3+. Cu2+. Mg2+. and Na+ were not transported to the stripping solution (1 MH2so4).

However. it is limited by the slow kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). which can be improved using catalysts. Covalent organic framework (COF)-derived porous carbon can serve as an excellent catalyst support. Here. we report high electrocatalytic activity of two composites. formed by supporting RuO2 on carbon derived from two COFs with closely related structures. These composites catalyze oxygen evolution from alkaline media with overpotentials as low as 210 and 217 mV at 10 mA/cm2. respectively.

1177390,Investigations into intermediate temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cell gas diffusion layers: when science meets art,2015,Amrit Singh Chandan,,,,,,Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) are a key technology to secure the future of the automotive sector. PEFCs are advantageous due to their low operating temperature (60-80 C). quick start up times and responsiveness to load change. However. the requirement for expensive platinum. difficulty of water management and heat dissipation means that further improvements are required. One way of reducing the impact of these challenges is to increase the cell operating temperature to above 100 C. In particular by operating the cell at 120 C. labelled as the Intermediate Temperature (IT)-PEFC. it becomes theoretically possible to simplify water and thermal management. In order to realise these benefits. further research is required into components of the Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs).  In this work. fundamental properties of the GDL have been investigated such as the influence of porosity on electronic conductivity. the influence of the microporous layer. the influence of hydrophobicity and the influence of GDL thickness. This has been done using a mixed methods approach consisting of simulation and experimental work. MEAs were simulated and hand-painted to test the GDL material properties. From this. recommendations for an ideal GDL for intermediate temperature conditions are suggested. for example. using a GDL with; a porosity of 40%. a permeability greater than 10 m. an MPL. hydrophobic treatment and as thin as possible.

Improving the intrinsic properties of the catalyst layer will enhance the performance of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and move this technology towards commercialization. This study looks at the optimization of the catalyst layer by the comparison of different catalyst-support conjugates/systems. The performance of Pt nanoparticles as electrocatalysts was compared on two different supports:(i) commercial Carbon Black (CB).(ii) reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO). Pt/rGO has been reported to show increased CO-tolerance in Direct Methanol FCs (DMFCs) and a high Electrochemical Active Surface Area (ECSA) which should improve the catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Depending on the technique employed to prepare catalyst-rGO system. it could be possible to attain higher ECSA and improved CO tolerance compared to conventional Pt/C. Ex-situ electrochemical characterizations suggest that the Pt/rGO should give the best performance in the fuel cell. Testing has shown that the ECSA is much higher for Pt/rGO than for Pt/C. These characteristics are expected to be enhanced under HT-PEFC conditions. further improving the kinetics.To this end. the microwave assisted polyol process (MWAPP) was employed as a one pot. ecofriendly. rapid production method for the Pt supported on carbon black and graphene oxide.

1177392,Investigating Electrodes for Intermediate Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (IT-PEFC): GDL Material Properties and their Influence,,Amrit Chandan and Neil Rees and Robert Steinberger-Wilckens and Valerie Self and John Richmond,,,,,,One of the ways Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) can be improved is by increasing their operating temperature (> 100 oC)[1]. commonly known as the Intermediate Temperature PEFC (IT-PEFC)(120 oC)[2]. This allows for the generation of high temperature heat. which allows more facile heat rejection. while simplifying water management as water will exist solely in the vapour phase. In order to optimise these IT-PEFCs. further improvement in the cell components are necessary. A combination of simulation and experimental methods has been used to investigate the material properties of the Gas Diffusion Layer so that ideal parameters can be suggested for intermediate temperature operation. Specifically. the porosity. permeability. electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity were investigated. The influence of the GDL thickness. the Microporous layer and hydrophobic treatment were also studied. Results have shown that the GDL porosity is a key factor of influence on the PEFC electrode. The balance between the mass transport capabilities and the electrical conductivity is very important to the success of the electrode. It was found that the cell performance was most sensitive to the GDL porosity when the cell was in the “standard operating” range of 0.7-0.5 V and that a porosity between 40-60% was best. The presence of a microporous layer and the hydrophobic treatment improve the MEA performance at intermediate temperature.

In particular. PEFCs will be important for use within the automotive sector. PEFCs are advantageous due to their low operating temperature (60-80 oC). quick start up times and responsiveness to load change. However. the requirement for expensive platinum. difficulty of water management and heat dissipation means that further improvements are required [1].One of the ways a PEFCs can be improved is by increasing their operating temperature (> 100 oC)[2]. commonly known as the Intermediate Temperature PEFC (IT-PEFC)(120 oC). This allows for the generation of high temperature heat. which can be used in a combined heat and power system thus enabling higher system efficiencies. while simplifying water management as water will exist solely in the vapour phase.,True,mJAkvOQAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C,0,https://www.comsol.dk/paper/download/182611/chandan_abstract.pdf,,,,https://www.comsol.dk/paper/download/182611/chandan_abstract.pdf,0,0,0

However. a bottleneck remains the poor understanding of the endosomal parameters that correlate with endosomal escape vs. cytotoxicity. To address this problem. we compared the endosomal distribution of six LNP-mRNA formulations of diverse chemical composition and efficacy in primary human adipocytes. Quantitative multi-parametric microscopic analysis revealed that total LNP uptake is a poor predictor of delivery. Prolonged uptake impaired endosomal acidification causing mRNA accumulation in compartments defective in cargo transport and unproductive for delivery. indicating parameters of cytotoxicity. In contrast. early endocytic/recycling compartments have the highest probability for mRNA escape. By super-resolution microscopy we could resolve single fluorescently labelled mRNA within sub-endosomal compartments and capture events of mRNA escape from Transferrin-positive recycling tubules.

We here describe a method for fluorescence labeling of RNAs of any length. via the enzymatic incorporation of the minimally perturbing and intrinsically fluorescent tricyclic cytosine analogue tCO. Using this approach. we demonstrate incorporation of tCO in up to 100% of all natural cytosine positions of a 1.2 kb mRNA encoding for the histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B:GFP). The resulting transcript is fully compatible with both in vitro transcription and subsequent in cell translation. Spectroscopic characterization of the in vitro transcribed mRNA. shows that the incorporation rate of tCO is on par with cytosine. facilitating efficient labeling and controlled tuning of labeling ratios for different applications. Using live cell confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. we show that the tCO-labeled mRNA is efficiently and correctly translated into H2B:GFP upon electroporation as well as lipid-mediated transfection of human Huh-7 cells; correct translation was further confirmed in cell-free systems. Importantly. the spectral properties of the tCO-modified transcripts and their translation product. in this case H2B:GFP. allow for their straightforward and simultaneous visualization in live cells.,True,FD6LgGAAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.172767v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/02/2020.07.01.172767.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this study we addressed the detection of QTL with effect on body weight. length and Fulton's condition factor. Eight families from two genetic breeding programs comprising 814 individuals were used to search for growth related QTL using the panel of microsatellites available for QTL screening. Two different approaches. maximum likelihood and regression interval mapping. were used in order to search for QTL. Up to eleven significant QTL were detected with both methods in at least one family: four for weight on LGs 5. 14. 15 and 16; five for length on LGs 5. 6. 12. 14 and 15; and two for Fulton's condition factor on LGs 3 and 16.

Integrating quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and next generation sequencing can greatly help to identify variation in candidate genes. which can result in marker-assisted selection and better genetic structure information. Turbot is a commercially important flatfish in Europe and China. with available genomic information on QTLs and genome mapping. Muscle and liver RNA-seq from 18 individuals was carried out to obtain gene sequences and markers functionally related to growth. resulting in a total of 20.447 genes and 85.344 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Many growth-related genes and SNPs were identified and placed in the turbot genome and genetic map to explore their co-localization with growth-QTL markers. Forty-five SNPs on growth-related genes were selected based on QTL co-localization and relevant function for growth traits. Forty-three SNPs were technically feasible and validated in a wild Atlantic population. where 91% were polymorphic. The integration of functional and structural genomic resources in turbot provides a practical approach for QTL mining in this species.

While quantitative genetic studies typically consider survival as an indicator for disease resistance (an individual’s propensity to avoid becoming infected or diseased). mortality rates of populations undergoing an epidemic are also affected by endurance (the propensity of diseased individual to survive the infection) and infectivity (ie the propensity of an infected individual to transmit disease). Few studies have demonstrated genetic variation in disease endurance. and no study has demonstrated genetic variation in host infectivity. despite strong evidence for considerable phenotypic variation in this trait.

Surviving an infectious challenge depends on two different host defense mechanisms. namely resistance (the ability of a host to avoid becoming infected or diseased) and endurance (the ability of an infected host to survive the infection). and both could be targeted for genetic improvement. However. it is currently not known how both traits contribute to survival. as reliable estimates of genetic parameters for both traits obtained simultaneously are scarce. A difficulty lies in obtaining endurance phenotypes for genetic analyses. In this study. we present the results from an innovative challenge test carried out in turbot whose design allowed disentangling the genetic basis of resistance and endurance to Philasterides dicentrarchi. a parasite causing scuticociliatosis that leads to very important economic losses in the aquaculture industry. A noticeable characteristic of the parasite is that it causes visual signs that can be used for disentangling resistance and endurance. Our results showed the existence of genetic variation for both traits (heritability = 0.26 and 0.12 for resistance and endurance. respectively) and for the composite trait resilience (heritability = 0.15). that includes both traits. The genetic correlation between resistance and resilience was very high (0.90) indicating that both are at a large extent the same trait but no significant genetic correlation was found between resistance and endurance.

We give computational arguments in favor of using the ring-current model over local indices. such as nucleus independent chemical shifts. for the determination of the magnetic aromaticity. Two approaches for estimating magnetically induced ring currents are employed for this purpose. one based on the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and the other where magnetically induced current densities (MICD) are explicitly calculated. We show that the two-zone aromaticity/antiaromaticity of a number of 3d metallic clusters (Sc3–. Cu3+. and Cu42–) can be explained using the QTAIM-based magnetizabilities.

This plant species is of great interest for its medicinal/pharmacological properties and its culinary uses. Its phytochemical importance relies on many bioactive components present in different organs and its cultivation can be of considerable economic value. Moreover. taxonomic identification of C. spinosa L. has been difficult due to its wide heterogeneity. and many authors fell into confusion due to the scarcity of genetic studies. The present review summarizes information concerning C. spinosa L. including agronomic performance. botanical description. taxonomical approaches. traditional pharmacological uses. phytochemical evaluation and genetic studies. This knowledge represents an important tool for further research studies and agronomic development on this indigenous species with respect to the emerging climatic change in the Eastern Mediterranean countries.

Bilirubin–HSA solution and plasma free of cucurbitacins were prepared as well as others containing serial concentrations of cucurbitacins. The concentration of unbound bilirubin was determined in bilirubin–HSA solution and the direct and total bilirubin concentrations were measured in plasma (with normal or elevated bilirubinemia) by Jendrassik and Grof method. In the conditions we adopted Cuc E and D (to a lesser extent). decreased the levels of unbound bilirubin in bilirubin–HSA solution and decreased direct bilirubin concentration and total bilirubin concentration in plasma in a dose-dependent manner while Cuc I had no effect. The effect of Cuc is related to the presence of native HSA.

Like agricultural residues. which are abundant. renewable. low cost raw materials. olive stones are mainly subjected to biotechnological or chemical modifications in order to be transformed into valuable products (biofuels. biofertilizers. animal feed and chemical feed-stock). In aim to valorize olive stones. we are trying to identify the presence of different phenolic compounds in their dilute-acid hydrolysate (DAH). Phenolic compounds (PC) are considered as toxic material for fermentation process. therefore. their behavior are studied under overliming treatment with distinct pH levels (10 and 12). temperature (25 and 60 C) and detoxification time (15. 30 and 60 min). Identification and quantification of phenolic compounds were performed by two chromatographic methods: Gas Chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). A liquid-liquid microextraction procedure is used in conjunction with silylation prior to the analysis of the compounds by GC-MS. Derivatives of benzoic acid. cinnamic acid. simple phenols. and aldehydes were identified. For all treatments combinations. pH 12 was more effective in reducing the total amount of phenolic compounds. Treatment of the hydrolysate with alkali at pH 12. 60 C and 60 min resulted in up to 29% decrease in the concentration of total phenolic compounds. Tyrosol. which was the main phenolic compound decreased by 73% under the same treatment.,True,rt71uPEAAAAJ:YFjsv_pBGBYC,23,http://free-journal.umm.ac.id/files/file/phenolic-compounds-from-diluted-acid-hydrolysates-of-olive-stones-effect-of-overliming-2329-8863.1000103.pdf,11289433053188961428,/scholar?cites=11289433053188961428,,http://free-journal.umm.ac.id/files/file/phenolic-compounds-from-diluted-acid-hydrolysates-of-olive-stones-effect-of-overliming-2329-8863.1000103.pdf,0,0,0

At lower overvoltage values. the dissolution process iscontrolled by activation. while at higher overvoltage values the dissolution process is controlled by diffusion. An increase of IM hydrochloric acid concentration and temperature led in all the cases to an increase of the corrosion rate. The inhibition of this carbon steel in the aqueous solutions of 1M hydrochloric acid was studied using three surfactants. Under the critical micelle concentration. the inhibition of those three surfactants is negligible. At a concentration higher than the critical micelle concentration. the inhibiting action of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide. tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide increases rapidly. The results indicate a strong dependence of the inhibition performance on the nature of the metal surface. in addition to the structural effects of amines. Inhibition is accomplished by amine adsorption on the metal surface without detectable changes in the chemistry of corrosion.

The electrochemical properties of poly(o-phenylene-diamine)films electrosynthesized from aqueous solutions containing different anions were studied by cyclic voltammetry and spectroscopy. The results indicate that the mechanism of the redox process is complex and may be governed by the diffusion of the cations and anions of the electrolyte. The kinetics of the processes can be monitored by changing the nature of the electrolyte and this may allow modulation of the electrical and optical properties of poly(o-phenylenediamine)(POPD)films.The polymer film consisted of more than two components.

They are also utilized for clinical treatment of pigmentary disorders such as melasma or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Whitening agents act at various levels of melanin production in the skin. Many of them are known as competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase. the key enzyme in melanogenesis. Others inhibit the maturation of this enzyme or the transport of pigment granules (melanosomes) from melanocytes to surrounding keratinocytes. In this review we present an overview of (natural) whitening products that may decrease skin pigmentation by their interference with the pigmentary processes.

Endogenously produced ROS contribute to damage leading to signs of chronological aging. Additional ROS generated by UV light in exposed body sites add to further and even greater damage to skin cells and tissue resulting in formation of the typical features of photoaging.

To study restoration of epidermal barriar. CSS (keratinocytes and fibroblasts attached to collagen sponges) were incubated in culture. and then grafted orthotopically to athymic mice.  Parallel samples (n=4) were analyzed biochemically by lipid fractionation (LF). biophysically by electrical capacitance (SEC). and ultrastructurally by TEM.  X-ray diffraction (XD) was performed at 2 years after grafting.  LF. SEC and TEM were performed on samples after 14 and 34 days in vitro. and 21 days and 4 months after grafting.  The data show that SEC (picoFarads.   pF   ± SEM) decreases in vitro to 63 ± 20 pF at day 14. and then increases to 216 ± 72 pF by day 34 (native human skin = 32 ± 5 pF).

M115. 661058,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Class IIa histone deacetylases repress transcription of target genes. However. their mechanism of action is poorly understood because they exhibit very low levels of deacetylase activity. The class IIa HDACs are associated with the SMRT/NCoR repression complexes and this may. at least in part. account for their repressive activity. However. the molecular mechanism of recruitment to co-repressor proteins has yet to be established. Here we show that a repeated peptide motif present in both SMRT and NCoR is sufficient to mediate specific interaction. with micromolar affinity. with all the class IIa HDACs (HDACs 4. 5. 7. and 9).

The catalytichydrolyses exhibit both saturation kinetics and inhibition by the pro‐TSA.

Often their reactivity relies on the Lewis acidity of the active sites on the surface of the catalyst. A recent report from our group showed that silica-supported Co(II) sites. prepared via surface organometallic chemistry. are active in both alkene hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation. possibly linked to the Lewis acidity of the Co(II) sites. Here we use molecular probes and analogues to both qualitatively and quantitatively model the Lewis acidity of the surface sites. Some sites do not bind probe molecules like carbon monoxide. tetrahydrofuran. and olefins. while others exhibit a continuum of Lewis acidities. This is consistent with variations in the coordination environment of Co. These results suggest that only the most Lewis acidic sites are involved in …,True,UrX3iCIAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,5,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.7b00443,5778871736673384763,/scholar?cites=5778871736673384763,,,0,0,0

One such example. alkane dehydrogenation. has recently become very important due to shortfalls in propene production and a large supply of cheap propane. However. current technologies are inefficient and have only moderate selectivity. In order to understand how to improve currently used catalysts. we must know more about the mechanism by which propane is dehydrogenated. We show here that Co(ii) sites on silica are good catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane. having high activity and selectivity that is reasonably stable over the course of 10 h.

Many of the catalysts that mediate these transformations consist of isolated metal ions on the surface of a metal oxide support. such as silica or alumina. Due to the complexity of these catalysts. studying the active site and mechanism of these reactions is difficult. Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) could offer a solution to this problem by allowing the synthesis of well-defined surface organometallic species. This approach has been used to study the reactions of light hydrocarbons with isolated metal species on silica and alumina surfaces.

Examples of these cystine mimics include dicarba. diselenide. thioether. triazole. and lactam bridges. Each has unique physicochemical properties that impact upon the resulting peptide conformation. Each also requires specific conditions for its formation via chemical peptide synthesis protocols. While the preparation of peptides containing two lactam bonds within a peptide is technically possible and reported by others. to date there has been no report of the chemical synthesis of a heterodimeric peptide linked by two lactam bonds. To examine the feasibility of such an assembly. judicious use of a complementary combination of amine and acid protecting groups together with nonfragment-based. total stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis led to the successful preparation of an analogue of the model peptide. insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3). in which both of the interchain disulfide bonds were replaced with a lactam bond.

According to morphology analysis. the m-PVDF membrane has less microphase separation than the PVDF blending with the PAN and PEO system (b-PVDF) which means that the PVDF-g-PAN copolymer can increase the compatibility of PVDF and PEO polymers. From the DSC analysis. introduction of PVDF-g-PAN effectively decreases the crystallinity of the PEO polymer in the m-PVDF membrane. which assists in lithium-ion transport. Moreover. m-PVDF shows high thermal stability up to 400 °C and good dimensional-stability under 150 °C. which can prevent the batteries from short-cutting and burning …,True,kkZAwjAAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,32,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/ra/c5ra26345j,13164006372540813204,/scholar?cites=13164006372540813204,,,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,Gomesin is an antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of the Brazilian spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana that contains two disulfide bridges Cys2‐15/Cys6‐11 and presents a β‐hairpin structure. To investigate the role of the disulfide bridges on gomesin conformation. bioactivities. and serum stability. structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies were conducted. Initially. gomesin and variants lacking one or both disulfide bridges were synthesized. CD studies showed that the gomesin structure is very rigid independently of the solvent environment. On the other hand. the linearized analogues adopted secondary structures according to the environment. while the monocyclic disulfide‐bridged peptides had a tendency to adopt a turn structure.

Decoralin analogs have been proposed. and the results indicated that when isoleucine at position 6 was substituted by phenylalanine residue. the peptides exhibited increased resistance towards enzymes action. Besides that. lower hemolytic activity was obtained for [Pro]4‐Decoralin‐NH2 and [Phe]6‐Des[Thr]11‐Decoralin‐NH2; this effect is probably due to their poor helical tendency.

Surgery. chemotherapy. radiotherapy. and hormone manipulation constitute the major treatment options for breast cancer. Here. we show that both a natural antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derived from wasp venom (decoralin. Dec-NH 2). and its synthetic variants generated via peptide design. display potent activity against cancer cells. We tested the derivatives at increasing doses and observed anticancer activity at concentrations as low as 12.5 μmol L− 1 for the selective targeting of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry assays further revealed that treatment with wild-type (WT) peptide Dec-NH 2 led to necrosis of MCF-7 cells. Additional atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements indicated that the roughness of cancer cell membranes increased significantly when treated with lead peptides compared to controls. Biophysical features such as helicity. hydrophobicity. and net positive charge were identified to play an important role in the anticancer activity of the peptides. Indeed. abrupt changes in peptide hydrophobicity and conformational propensity led to peptide inactivation. whereas increasing the net positive charge of peptides enhanced their activity.
