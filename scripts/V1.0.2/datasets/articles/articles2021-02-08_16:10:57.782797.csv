In this study. we found that substitution of a highly conserved tryptophan at position 1246 with cysteine (W1246C-MRP1) in the putative last transmembrane segment (TM17) of MRP1 eliminated 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG) transport by membrane vesicles prepared from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney cells while leaving the capacity for leukotriene C4- and verapamil-stimulated glutathione transport intact.

Studies with MRP-enriched membrane vesicles have demonstrated that the protein can bind and transport cysteinyl leukotrienes. as well as some other gluta-thione conjugates. with high affinity. In contrast. there is no direct evidence of the ability of MRP to bind or transport unmodified forms of the drugs to which it confers resistance. To facilitate studies of the physiological function (s) of MRP and its ability to cause multidrug resistance in vivo. we cloned and characterized the mRNA specifying its murine homolog. The murine MRP mRNA encodes a protein of 1528 amino acids that is 88% identical to human MRP. Although detectable by North-em blotting at variable levels in a wide range of tissues. in situ hybridization experiments revealed that MRP mRNA expres-sion in some tissues is cell-type specific. High levels of the mRNA were detected in epithelia lining bronchi and bronchioles. as well as stage-specific expression in the seminiferous epithelium of the testes. Comparison of the predicted hydrop-athy profiles of human and murine MRP suggests a highly conserved membrane topology. the most distinctive feature of which is an extremely hydrophobic NH2-terminal region contaming five or six potential transmembrane sequences.

A region corresponding to bp 3897-4471 of MRP cDNA is amplified. which encompasses approximately half of the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2). In two multidrug resistant (MDR) sublines of the HL-60 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line which overexpress MRP but not P-glycoprotein. the assay detects elevated levels of MRP mRNA (4-to 8-fold) relative to the drug-sensitive parental cells (designated HL-60/W). Blast cells from 24 patients with AML were also studied for MRP expression using this RT-PCR method. Expression of MRP was normalized for that of beta-actin in the blast cells. which was also determined by RT-PCR. All of these blast cell samples had MRP expression that was detectable after 35 PCR cycles. Eighteen of these patients samples had levels of expression of MRP mRNA equal to or less than that expressed by HL-60/W cells.

We tested the hypothesis that the protective effect of α-crystallin is mediated by changes in cellular glutathione (GSH) and elucidated the mechanism of GSH efflux. In α-crystallin overexpressing cells resistant to cell death. cellular GSH was >2 fold higher than vector control cells and this increase was seen particularly in mitochondria. The high GSH levels associated with α-crystallin overexpression were due to increased GSH biosynthesis. On the other hand. cellular GSH was decreased by 50% in murine retina lacking αA or αB crystallin. Multiple multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family isoforms were expressed in RPE. among which MRP1 was the most abundant. MRP1 was localized to the plasma membrane and inhibition of MRP1 markedly decreased GSH efflux. MRP1-suppressed cells were resistant to cell death and contained elevated intracellular GSH and GSSG. Increased GSH in MRP1-supressed cells resulted from a higher conversion of GSSG to GSH by glutathione reductase. In contrast. GSH efflux was significantly higher in MRP1 overexpressing RPE cells which also contained lower levels of cellular GSH and GSSG. Oxidative stress further increased GSH efflux with a decrease in cellular GSH and rendered cells apoptosis-prone. In conclusion. our data reveal for the first time that 1) MRP1 mediates GSH and GSSG efflux in RPE cells; 2) MRP1 inhibition renders RPE cells resistant to oxidative stress-induced cell death while MRP1 overexpression makes them susceptible and 3) the antiapoptotic …,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,52,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033420,10769758212967139592,/scholar?cites=10769758212967139592,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0033420,0,0,0

A Mab (1-7-1) specific for an epitope common to rat cytochromes P-450c (P4501A1) and P-450d (P4501A2) detected the corresponding munne species (P1-450/P3-450) in cells of the alveolar septa. including type II cells. as well as endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Cytochrome P1-450 (Mabs 1-31-2. 1-36-1) is localized in type II cells of the alveolar septa but is not found in endothelialcells. Patterns of immunoreactivity with the 3-MC-specific Mabs indicate that alveolar septal cells possess P1-450 and P3-450. whereas endothelial cells of the vasculature are not the sites of P1-450. but rather of P3-450.

Its transport mechanism is multifaceted. especially with respect to the participation of GSH.

Thus. the interactions between GSH and MRP1 are mechanistically complex.

Human MRP1 transports a wide range of natural product drugs and structurally diverse conjugated and unconjugated organic anions. Its closest relative is MRP3.

It is noteworthy that MRP1 transports glutathione (GSH) and GSH conjugates and displays GSH-stimulated transport of a number of unconjugated and conjugated compounds. In contrast. MRP3 does not transport GSH and is a poor transporter of GSH conjugates. However. both proteins transport glucuronide conjugates. such as 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide).

However. topoisomerase II is cytoplasmic under certain circumstances. indicating that it may undergo active nuclear export. We have examined the ability of Leu-rich potential nuclear export signal (NES) sequences present in human topoisomerase IIα and β to direct the export of a green fluorescent protein–glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein following microinjection into HeLa cell nuclei. Of 12 sequences tested. only one potential NES sequence from the comparable location in each isoform (αNES1018–1028 and βNES1034–1044) was active.

Glu521. and Glu535 markedly reduced MRP1 levels. Because three of these residues are predicted to lie at the interface of CL5 and the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2). a critical role is indicated for this region in the plasma membrane expression of MRP1.

At diagnosis. many tumour cellsappear to be intrinsically more responsive to chemotherapeutic agents than normal cells; however. upon clinical relapse. acquired drug resistance appears limited to the tumour cells. This problem in clinical oncology is difficult to study experimentally because many multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines developed in vitro prove to benon-tumourigenic in athymic mice and to have a differentiated or'normalized'phenotype (Biedler & Peterson. 1981; Remy et al.. 1984).

INC,The refinement of combination chemotherapy over the past two decades has significantly increased the median survival time of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)(1). However. acquired resistance to multiple drugs is a major obstacle to successful treatment. and despite improvements in survival. chemotherapy is responsible for the cure of less than 10% of patients.

The first successful attempts at achieving this involved the immortalization of human B lymphocytes with Ep-stein-Barr virus (EBV). Epstein-Barr virus is a B-lymphotropic herpes virus that causes polyclonal activation and immortalization of antibody-producing human B cells (1). Steinitz et al.(2) were the first to recognize that this capability could be used to establish permanent cell lines to produce human antibodies of predetermined specificity. By using lymphocytes from subjects with high natural anti-body titers to the synthetic hapten NNP (4-hydroxy-3. 5-dinitrophenacetic acid). they preselected antigen-binding lymphocytes and then established permanent lines by infection with EBV. Others (3-18) subsequently applied this technique to produce antibodies that react with a variety of specific antigens. It soon became apparent that there were major limitations with the EBV method. Although specific antibodies could be produced. the levels of immuno-globulin production were low (< 1 ug/ml). and antibody production declined rapidly with time (3). Furthermore. the lines were very difficult to clone (19).

Multidrug Resistance Protein (MRP) 2 (ABCC2) belongs to subfamily C of the ABC superfamily and when overexpressed in tumour cells. confers resistance to a wide variety of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. MRP2 is also an active transporter of organic anions such as methotrexate (MTX). estradiol glucuronide (E217βG) and leukotriene C4 (LTC4). and is located on the apical membrane of polarized cells including hepatocytes where it acts as a biliary transporter. We recently identified a highly conserved tryptophan residue in the related MRP1 that is critical for the substrate specificity of this protein. In the present study. we have examined the effect of replacing the analogous tryptophan residue at position 1254 of MRP2. We found that only non-conservative substitutions (Ala. Cys) of Trp 1254 eliminated [3 H] E217βG transport by MRP2. while more conservative substitutions (Phe. Tyr) had no effect. In addition. only the most conservatively substituted mutant (W1254Y) transported [ 3 H] LTC4. while all other substitutions eliminated transport of this substrate. On the other hand. all substitutions of Trp 1254 eliminated transport of [3 H] MTX. Finally. we found that sulfinpyrazone stimulated [ 3 H] E217βG transport by wild-type MRP2 4-fold. while transport by the Trp 1254 substituted mutants was enhanced 6-to 10-fold.

In many instances. drug resistance is observed to multiple agents which differ in structure as well as in their mechanism of action. Development of such multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle in the treatment of a variety of malignancies (Kaye. 1988). Although the altered expression of a number of pro-teins has been associated with MDR in different model systems. the overexpression of a 150-180 kDa glycoprotein has been the most consistent. This glycoprotein. termed P-glycoprotein. acts as an energy dependent efflux pump to reduce drug accumulation within the cell (Gerlach et al.. 1986a). While overexpression of P-glycoprotein is clearly re-sponsible for MDR in some cell systems. it is unlikely that P-glycoprotein by itself can account for the …,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:XD-gHx7UXLsC,6,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1971722/,11330243938764118762,/scholar?cites=11330243938764118762,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1971722/pdf/brjcancer00215-0022.pdf,0,0,0

Arsenic is a Group 1 (proven) human carcinogen which causes skin. lung. and bladder tumors. and is associated with numerous other adverse health effects. including neuropathy and cardiovascular dysfunctions. Multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs/ABCCs) mediate the cellular efflux of a chemically diverse array of endogenous and xenobiotic metabolites. Substrates include glutathione (GSH) conjugates of inorganic and methylated arsenic species and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV).

The present study tested the ATP-dependent vesicular transport of leukotriene C4 and 17β-estradiol 17-(β-D-glucuronide)(E217βG) mediated by the MRP1 and MRP2 transporters in the presence of six potential modulators from three different classes of GSH-conjugated catechol metabolites: the ecstasy metabolite 5-(glutathion-S-yl)-N-methyl-α-methyldopamine (5-GS-N-Me-α-MeDA); the caffeic acid metabolite 2-(glutathion-S-yl)-caffeic acid (2-GS-CA); and four GSH conjugates of 2-OH and 4-OH estrogens (GS-estrogens). MRP1-mediated E217βG transport was inhibited in a competitive manner with a relative order of potency of GS-estrogens (IC50< 1 µM)> 2-GS-CA (IC50 3 µM)> 5-GS-N-Me-α-MeDA (IC50 31 µM). MRP2-mediated transport was inhibited with a similar order of potency. except the 2-OH-4-GS-estradiol and 4-OH-2-GS-estradiol conjugates were approximately 50-and 300-fold less potent. respectively. Transport activity was unaffected by N-acetylcysteine conjugates of N-Me-α-MeDA and CA. The position of GSH conjugation appears important since all four GS-estrogen conjugates tested were potent inhibitors of MRP1 transport. but only the 2-OH-1-GS-estradiol and 2-OH-1-GS-estrone conjugates were potent inhibitors of MRP2-mediated transport.

There are two isoforms of topo II (a and b) that have limited functional redundancy. although their catalytic mechanisms appear the same. Using their COOH-terminal domains (CTDs) in yeast two-hybrid analysis. we have identified phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) as a binding partner of both topo II a and b. Although predominantly a plasma membrane protein involved in phosphatidylserine externalization. PLSCR1 can also be imported into the nucleus where it may have a tumour suppressor function. The interactions of PLSCR1 and topo II were confirmed by pull-down assays with topo II a and b CTD fusion proteins and endogenous PLSCR1. and by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous PLSCR1 and topo II a and b from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. PLSCR1 also increased the decatenation activity of human topo IIa. A conserved basic sequence in the CTD of topo IIa was identified as being essential for binding to PLSCR1 and binding of the two proteins could be inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to topo IIa amino acids 1430-1441.

Cells that survive this type of selection are often resistant to a wide variety of structurally and functionally unrelated. natural product drugs. in addition to the original selecting agent. In general. they also display an enhanced ability to efflux the drugs to which they are resistant and resistance can be reversed by verapamil and other membrane active agents that restore drug accumulation by inhibiting Pgp-mediated drug efflux (Ambudkar et al.. 1999; Deeley and Cole. 1997).

We have now assessed the functional importance of all polar and charged amino acids in this TM helix. Asn1100. Ser1097. and Lys1092. which are all predicted to be on the same face of the helix as to Glu1089. are involved in determining the substrate specificity of the protein. Notably. elimination of the positively charged side chain of Lys1092. increased resistance to the cationic drugs vincristine and doxorubicin. but not the electroneutral drug etoposide (VP-16).

In contrast. mutations of Asp1084 that eliminate the carboxylate side chain markedly decreased resistance to all drugs tested. as well as transport of both E217ßG and LTC4. despite the fact that LTC4 binding was unaffected.

MRP1. is a clinically important ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in which the three membrane spanning domains (MSD). which contain up to 17 transmembrane (TM) helices. and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD) are configured MSD1-MSD2-NBD1-MSD3-NBD2. In tumor cells. MRP1 confers resistance to a broad spectrum of drugs. but in normal cells. it functions as a primary active transporter of organic anions such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4). and 17β-estradiol 17β-(D-glucuronide)(E217βG). We have previously shown that mutation of TM17-Trp1246 eliminates E217βG transport and drug resistance conferred by MRP1 while leaving LTC4 transport intact. By mutating the eleven remaining Trp residues that are in predicted TM segments of MRP1. we have now determined that five of them are also major determinants of MRP1 function. Ala substitution of three of these residues. Trp445 (TM8). Trp553 (TM10) and Trp1198 (TM16). eliminated or substantially reduced transport levels of five organic anion substrates of MRP1.

Md.: Waverly Press,The Mr 190.000 multidrug resistance (MRP) confers resistance to a broad spectrum of natural. product drugs. However. it has not been possible to demonstrate that MRP can actively transport unmodified forms of these compounds. although the protein has been shown to transport structurally diverse glutathione (GSH)- and glucuronide-conjugated molecules. Previously. we showed that ATP-dependent uptake of vincristine by MRP-enriched. inside-out membrane vesicles could be stimulated by physiological concentrations of GSH (Loe et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 271: 9675-9687. 1996). We have-now established that the ATP/GSH dependent vincristine uptake is both proportional to the level of MRP in the membrane vesicles and can be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies shown previously to inhibit transport of established MRP substrates. such as leukotriene C4. We also show that short-chain alkyl derivatives of GSH …,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:bz8QjSJIRt4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11114116247868261291&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Using the Kaplan-Meier method. the log-rank test and the cox-regression model. we analysed the relation of IL-2 secretion in whole blood cell cultures from 52 patients with SCLC at the time of diagnosis to established prognostic factors relevant for survival in SCLC.Impairment of IL-2 secretion significantly influences survival In SCLC (p= 0.004). Further univariate and multivariate analysis showed that thus prognostic factor is independent from other factors of prognostic relevance rn SCLC. namely stage of disease. Neurone specific enolase (NSE). Lactate dehydrogenase(LDH). age. and sex. More important. the prognostic value of IL-2 secretion is comparable to the most predominant prognostic factors for survival in SCLC identified so far. In the final model of the cox regression analysis. the p-value for IL-2 secretion in relation to stage of disease was 0.012 and 0.019. respectively. In addition. the level of IL-2 predicts for response to chemotherapy(p= 0.037).

Levels of immunoreactive topoisomerase IIα are also reduced in H69AR cells.  In the present study. we found that cleaved complex formation in the presence of VP-16 was decreased in H69AR cells as compared with H69 cells.  In addition. the resistant cells contained lower levels of both topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ protein and mRNA.  However. these changes were not accompanied by a decrease in the P4-unknotting (strand-passing) activity of 0.67 M NaCl nuclear extracts of H69AR cells. nor was there any difference in VP-16 inhibition of unknotting activity in the H69 and H69AR nuclear extracts.

Steinitz et al.(2) were the first to recognize that this capability could be used to establish permanent cell lines to produce human antibodies of prede-termined specificity. By using lymphocytes from subjects with high natural antibody titers to the synthetic hapten NNP (4-hydroxy-3. 5-dinitrophenacetic acid). they preselected antigen-binding lymphocytes and then established permanent lines by infection with EBV. Others (3-18) subsequently applied this technique to produce antibodies that react with a variety of specific antigens. It soon became apparent that there were major limitations with the EBV method. Although specific antibodies could be produced. the levels of immuno-globulin production were low (< 1 ug/ml). and antibody production declined rapidly with time (3). Furthermore. the lines were very difficult to clone (19).

The access of circulating anti-sperm antibodies to the genital tract is not self-evident. but antibodies do affect the normal sperm/cervical mucus interaction (Bronson Ct d.. 1984; Parslow ct ul.. 1985). and a correlation exists between reduced fertility and auto-immunity to sperm (Ayvaliotis c't ul.. 1985).

In addition to two membrane spanning domains (MSDs) typical of most ABC transporters. MRP1 has a third MSD (MSD0) of unknown function. Unlike some topologically similar ABCC proteins. removal of MSD0 has minimal effect on function. nor does it prevent MRP1 from trafficking to basolateral membranes in polarized cells. However. we find that independent of cell type. the truncated protein accumulates in early/recycling endosomes. Using a real-time internalization assay. we demonstrate that MSD0 is important for MRP1 retention in. or recycling to. the plasma membrane. We also show that MSD0 traffics independently to the cell surface and promotes membrane localization of the core-region of MRP1 when the two protein fragments are coexpressed.

In nonmetastatic primarily enucleated RBs. we show expression ofpl7O in 3 of 18 samples and expression of multidrug resistance protein (MRP). the second protein associated with resistance to chemotherapy. in 1 of 18 samples. All three RBs that failed chemotherapy without cyclosporine expressed MRP with p170. All three RBs that were enucleated immediately when chemotherapy failed despite the addition of cyclosporine expressed only MRP. One RB enucleated 2years after failing chemotherapy with cyclosporine. despite radiation and salvage chemo therapy. expressed both p170 and MRP. Two metastatic RBs that ex pressed both p170 and MRP at diagnosis and at recurrence failed chem otherapy without cyclosporine. whereas one metastatic RB that expressed neither protein was cured by chemotherapy without cyclosporine. MRP may result in failure of chemotherapy despite the elimination of p170-expressing clones by cyclosporine.,True,IpzUezMAAAAJ:u-coK7KVo8oC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3199810488965741049&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

It acts as a cleansing solution. an ion reservoir. a lubricant and a buffer. In addition to its other host‐protective properties. saliva could constitute a first line of defence against free radical‐mediated oxidative stress. since the process of mastication and digestion of ingested foods promotes a variety of reactions. including lipid peroxidation. Moreover. during gingival inflammation. gingival crevicular fluid flow increases the change of saliva composition with products from the inflammatory response; this. in turn. could have some rôle in controlling and/or modulating oxidative damages in the oral cavity.

Internetscale applications. To meet their needs. these stores often sacrifice consistency for availability. Yet. few tools exist that can verify the consistency actually provided by a key-value store. and quantify the violations if any. How can a user check if a storage system meets its promise of consistency? If a system only promises eventual consistency. how bad is it really? In this paper. we present efficient algorithms that help answer these questions. By analyzing the trace of interactions between the client machines and a key-value store. the algorithms can report whether the trace is safe. regular. or atomic. and if not. how many violations there are in the trace. We run these algorithms on traces of our eventually consistent keyvalue store called Pahoehoe and find few or no violations. thus showing that it often behaves like a strongly consistent system during our tests.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:c_xDhezhKKUC,124,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotdep10/tech/full_papers/Anderson.pdf,1982725106058679511,/scholar?cites=1982725106058679511,,https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotdep10/tech/full_papers/Anderson.pdf,0,0,0

Autophagy provides a mechanism for the turnover of cellular organelles and proteins through a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway. The aim of this research was to study the role of autophagy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with periodontitis and gingival fibroblasts treated with a lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Autophagy-dependent mechanisms have been proposed in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders and in other diseases related to periodontitis. such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Thus it is important to study the role of autophagy in the pathophysiology of periodontitis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with periodontitis (n = 38) and without periodontitis (n = 20) were used to study autophagy. To investigate the mechanism of autophagy. we evaluated the influence of a lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis in human gingival fibroblasts. and autophagy was monitored morphologically and biochemically. Autophagosomes were observed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We found increased levels of autophagy gene expression and high levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with periodontitis compared with controls. A significantly positive correlation between both was observed. In human gingival fibroblasts treated with lipopolysaccharide from P. gingivalis. there was an increase of protein and transcript of autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12) and microtubule …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,99,https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-122,12622468061104575753,/scholar?cites=12622468061104575753,,https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-122,0,0,0

91525,Improved FIA-ABTS method for antioxidant capacity determination in different biological samples.,2004,Stefano Bompadre and Luciana Leone and Alessia Politi and Maurizio Battino,38,Free Radical Research,8,831-838,,In order to evaluate the actual antioxidant features of foods. beverages and also plasma from patients. a number of assays have been developed in the last few years to determine the so called total antioxidant activity (TAA). intended as the cumulative capacity of a biological sample to scavenge free radicals. Most of the assays partially failed in obtaining a good reproducibility when using plasma because it is composed of a large number of substances. some of which are present at very high concentrations and possess masking features. For these reasons we have improved the widely known ABTS method by means of a FIA system where both temperature and dispersion of sample and reagent were strictly controlled. We found that temperature may be a critical aspect in the measurement of plasma TAA whilst its influence may be less important in the assay of non-complex biological samples. We demonstrated that also the reaction time may be critical. depending on the nature of the substance employed. Data confirmed the high TAA of a methylsalicylate-containing mouthrinse as well as the negligible TAA offered by the chlorhexidine containing one. White wines (Verdicchio) also displayed interesting TAA values. The improved method was useful to screen rapidly. without dilution. with very limited handling of the sample and with high repeatability the TAA of plasma in addition to chemical products. beverages and non-complex biological mixtures.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,81,https://europepmc.org/article/med/15493456,9635702955920565080,/scholar?cites=9635702955920565080,,,0,0,0

Although the different diet fats used did not produce any effect on microsomes. it was possible to show that each experimental diet differently influenced the mitochondrial levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10. The highest mitochondrial CoQ content was found in case of a diet supplemented with corn oil. An endogenous oxidative stress induced by adriamycin was able to produce a sharp decrease in mitochondrial CoQ9 levels in the rats to which corn oil was administered.

Indeed. if nutritional components are also combined with a high standard of sensorial fruit quality. the perspective for consumer health can be further improved by encouraging more fruit consumption. Wild species are valued by strawberry breeders as sources of novel traits. especially for pest resistance and abiotic stress tolerance. Furthermore. previous investigations have shown improvements in fruit nutritional quality in breeding material that originated from Fragaria virginiana ssp. glauca (FVG) inter-species crosses. Recently. commercial varieties of strawberries have also shown interesting variability in fruit nutritional quality.   Results Strawberry fruit sensorial and nutritional qualities generated by Fragaria inter-species and intra-species crosses were evaluated on 78 offspring derived from 8 families: two that originated from F. × ananassa intra-species crossing; three from back-crossing of F1– FVG × F. × ananassa; and three from back-crossing of BC1– FVG × F. × ananassa. The genetic variability from the three types of cross combinations was analyzed by calculation of the correlations among the fruit sensorial and nutritional parameters. The results obtained show that two subsequent back-crossing generations from an inter-species crossing combination with F. virginiana ssp. glauca provides useful improvement of the fruit nutritional and sensorial qualities that is combined with agronomic standards that are close to those requested at the commercial level.

Information is reported in terms of guest-host mutual orientation and localization. The overall orientational anisotropy of guest ubiquinone molecules is described by a basic set of limiting orientation/localization modes. Assignments of the UV transitions of the ubiquinone chromophore were obtained by the liquid crystal-linear dichroism technique and molecular orbital (CNDO/S) calculations.

The CoQ concentration in mitochondria from different tissues was investigated by HPLC. By analyzing the rates of electron transfer as a function of total CoQ concentration. it was calculated that. at physiological CoQ concentration NADH cytochrome c reductase activity is not saturated. Values for theoretical Vmax could not be reached experimentally for NADH oxidation. because of the limited mis-cibility of CoQ10 with the phospholipids. On the other hand. it was found that CoQ3 could stimulate α-glycerophosphate cytochrome c reductase over three-fold. Electron transfer being a diffusion-coupled process. we have investigated the possibility of its being subjected to diffusion control.

The possibility to recognize alterations in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in pathological states and to improve this efficiency in order to correct diseases requires knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the rate of ATP synthesis. This task is hampered by uncertainties still existing on the organization and mechanism of the enzymes carrying out oxidative phosphorylation. The authors have collected experimental evidence that coenzyme Q concentration in the mitochondrial membrane phospholipids in physiologically not saturating for maximal electron-transfer rate: in fact the Km of the redox enzymic complexes. using the oxidized and reduced form of coenzyme Q. for these substrates. are in the range of their concentrations in the membrane. The addition of exogenous coenzyme Q enhances the respiratory turnover above the physiological rate but without reaching theoretical Vmax. owing to the limited miscibility of ubiquinones with the membrane phospholipids. On the contrary. a decrease of ubiquinone content in the membrane lowers electron-transfer activity in a reversible fashion. Taking account that the rate of lateral coenzyme Q diffusion in the membrane does not appear to control electron transfer. it is suggested that only ubiquinone concentration affects the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. with interesting pathological and pharmacological implications.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,60,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2276890,11556778949831130074,/scholar?cites=11556778949831130074,,,0,0,0

Antimycin A and myxothiazol inhibit glycerol-3-phosphate cytochromec oxidoreductase in a sigmoidal fashion. indicating that CoQ behaves as a homogeneous pool between glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and complex III. The inhibition of ubiquinol cytochromec reductase is linear at low concentrations of both inhibitors. indicating that sigmoidicity of antimycin A and myxothiazol inhibition is not a direct property of antimycin A and myxothiazol binding. Glycerol-3-phosphate cytochromec oxidoreductase is strongly stimulated by added CoQ3. indicating that endogenous CoQ is not saturating. Application of the pool equation for nonsaturating ubiquinone allows calculation of theK m for endogenous CoQ of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of 3.14mM.

The aim of the present study was to examine the phytochemical content and the antioxidant activity of Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) honey (STH) and its cytotoxic properties against human colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-116) and metastatic (LoVo) cell lines in comparison with Manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey (MH). Several unifloral STH and MH were analyzed for their phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein contents. as well as their radical scavenging activities. STH from the Berchidda area showed the highest amount of phenolic. flavonoid. amino acid and protein content. and antioxidant capacity compared to MH. Both STH and MH induced cytotoxicity and cell death in a dose-and time-dependent manner in HCT-116 and LoVo cells. with less toxicity on non-cancer cells. Compared to MH. STH showed more effect at lower concentrations on HCT-116 and LoVo cells. In addition. both honeys increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In HCT-116 cells. STH and MH induced similar ROS production but in LoVo cells STH induced a higher percentage of ROS compared to MH. Our results indicate that STH and MH can induce cell growth inhibition and ROS generation in colon adenocarcinoma and metastatic cells. which could be due to the presence of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties. These preliminary results are interesting and suggest a potential chemopreventive action which could be useful for further studies in order to develop chemopreventive agents for colon cancer.

Here we reproduced an age-dependent model of the periodontium. a fully physiological approach to periodontal conditions. to evaluate the impact of dietary fat type on gingival tissue of young (6 months old) and old (24 months old) rats.   Methods/FindingsAnimals were fed life-long on diets based on monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as virgin olive oil. n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6PUFA). as sunflower oil. or n-3PUFA. as fish oil. Age-related alveolar bone loss was higher in n-6PUFA fed rats. probably as a consequence of the ablation of the cell capacity to adapt to aging. Gene expression analysis suggests that MUFA or n-3PUFA allowed mitochondria to maintain an adequate turnover through induction of biogenesis. autophagy and the antioxidant systems. and avoiding mitochondrial electron transport system alterations.   ConclusionsThe main finding is that the enhanced alveolar bone loss associated to age may be targeted by an appropriate dietary treatment. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are related with an ablation of the cell capacity to adapt to aging. Thus. MUFA or n-3PUFA might allow mitochondrial maintaining turnover through biogenesis or autophagy. They might also be able to induce the corresponding antioxidant systems to counteract age-related oxidative stress. and do not inhibit mitochondrial electron transport chain.

Shortly after being discovered. it was recognized as an essential electron transport chain component in mitochondria where it is particularly abundant. Since then. more additional roles in cell physiology have been reported. including antioxidant. signaling. death prevention. and others. It is known that all cells are able to synthesize functionally sufficient amounts of CoQ under normal physiological conditions. However. CoQ is a molecule found in different dietary sources. which can be taken up and incorporated into biological membranes. It is known that mitochondria have a close relationship with the aging process. Additionally. delaying the aging process through diet has aroused the interest of scientists for many years. These observations have stimulated investigation of the anti-aging potential of CoQ and its possible use in dietary therapies to alleviate the effects of aging.

Among them. cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are responsible for a 47% of worldwide mortality. In general. preventive approaches modifying lifestyle are more cost-effective than treatments after disease onset. In this sense. a healthy diet could help a range of NCDs. such as cancer and CVDs. Traditional Mediterranean Diet (MD) is associated by the low-prevalence of certain types of cancers and CVDs. where olive oil plays an important role. In fact. different epidemiological studies suggest that olive oil consumption prevents some cancers. as well as coronary heart diseases and stroke incidence and mortality. Historically. the beneficial health effects of virgin olive oil (VOO) intake were first attributed to the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids. Nowadays. many studies indicate that phenolic compounds contained in olive oil have positive effects on different biomarkers related to health. Among them. phenolic compounds would be partially responsible for health benefits. The present work aims to explore. in studies published during the last five years. the effects of the main phenolic compounds isolated from olive oil on different cancer or CVD aspects. in order to clarify which compounds have more potential to be used as nutraceuticals with preventive or even therapeutic properties.

In this work. the content of total phenolic compounds. flavonoids. anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity (TEAC. FRAP and DPPH) of achenes and flesh were compared in non-digested as well as in gastric and intestinal extracts after in vitro digestion. Results showed that. despite strawberry achenes represent a small fraction of the fruit. their contribution to total fruit antioxidant content was more than 41% and accounted for 81% of antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Achenes have higher quantity and different quality of antioxidants in non-digested and digested extracts. Antioxidant release was higher in the in vitro gastric digested extracts. but digestion conditions did not only affect quantity but quality. resulting in differences in antioxidant capacity and highlighting the importance of simulating physiological-like extraction conditions for assessing fruit antioxidant properties on human health.

It was possible to confirm that the dietary fat induced higher phospholipid degradation in mitochondrial membranes; moreover an endogenous oxidative stress induced by adriamycin was able to increase the peroxidative effects. We have found that the peroxidative effects could sometimes induce an apparent enhancement of cytochrome oxidase activity due to a significant increase of cytochrome a+a3content. This finding lets us suppose that both changes in the lipid environment and some peroxidation damage could occur in the membrane as a consequence of the fat assumed.

In this respect. there is agreement about that nutritional status may be a modifying factor in the progression and healing of the periodontal tissues. Vitamins have been recommended as nutraceuticals for prevention and treatment of some pathological conditions. such as cardiovascular diseases. obesity or cancer. Thus. a systematic approach to determining how the different vitamin type could ameliorate periodontal risks or improve periodontal health is necessary to further the understanding of the potential benefits and risks of vitamins supplementation use. For this. a systematic review of English-written literature in PubMed until February 2018. which included both human and animal research on the relationship of each vitamin with periodontal disease. was conducted. Among all the analyzed vitamins those with antioxidant capacity and effects on immune system seem to be useful for prevention or improvement of periodontal disease. as well as those implicated in bone metabolism. In the first case. there are quite information in favor of various vitamins. mainly vitamin C. that is the most studied. In the second case. vitamin D seems to have the most relevant role.

Healthy dietary patterns. with abundant fruit and vegetable consumption. may prevent the onset of these risk factors due to the presence of phytochemical compounds. Strawberries are known for their high content of polyphenols; among them. flavonoids are the major constituents. and it is presumed that they are responsible for the biological activity of the fruit. Nevertheless. there are only a few studies that actually evaluate the effects of different fractions isolated from strawberries. In order to assess the effects of two different strawberry extracts (whole methanolic extract/anthocyanin-enriched fraction) on the lipid profile and antioxidant status in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. the triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol content. lipid peroxidation. intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and antioxidant enzymes’ activity on cell lysates were determined. Results demonstrated that both strawberry extracts not only improved the lipid metabolism by decreasing triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol contents. but also improved the redox state of HepG2 cells by modulating thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances production. antioxidant enzyme activity and ROS generation.

Their management is difficult and the development of antibiotic resistance by both planktonic and biofilm-associated bacteria necessitates the use of alternative treatments. The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of four honeys from different floral and geographical origins: Melipona beecheii honey (Cuba) and three Apis mellifera honeys [Manuka honey (New Zealand). Apis mellifera honey (Cuba). and African honey (Kenya)]. The physicochemical parameters were within the ranges reported for these honeys and M. beecheii honey stood out due to its acidic character. An agar incorporation technique was used to determine the minimum active dilution of each honey against 52 clinical isolates (34 Gram-positive. 17 Gram-negative. and 1 Candida albicans). The antibiofilm activity of honeys was tested by assessing their ability to inhibit biofilm formation and to disrupt preformed biofilms. Overall. M. beecheii honey had the highest antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity. although a marked disruption in preformed biofilms was shared by all tested honeys. Structural changes induced by M. beecheii honey on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy suggesting that this honey has a potent antimicrobial action and may be an excellent candidate for the development of topical preparations for the treatment of infected wounds.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:nqdriD65xNoC,23,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01378/full,16291182893431336944,/scholar?cites=16291182893431336944,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01378/full,0,0,0

Periodontal therapy has been traditionally directed at reduction of the bacterial load to a level that encourages health-promoting bacteria and maintenance of oral-hygiene. The role of nutrition in different chronic inflammatory diseases has been the subject of an increasing body of research in the last decades. In this sense. there has been an important increase in the volume of research on role of nutrition in periodontitis since the diet has known effects on the immune system and inflammatory cascades. Minerals play a key role in all these processes due to the multiple pathways where they participate. To clarify the role of the different minerals in the establishment. progression and/or treatment of this pathology. a systemically review of published literature cited in PubMed until May 2016 was conducted. which included research on the relationship of these elements with the onset and progression of periodontal disease. Among all the minerals. calcium dietary intake seems important to maintain alveolar bone. Likewise. dietary proportions of minerals that may influence its metabolism also can be relevant. Lastly. some observations suggest that all those minerals with roles in immune and/or antioxidant systems should be considered in future research.

Carambola (Averrhoa carambola L.) had the highest total phenolic. flavonoid. and total antioxidant capacity values. whereas guava fruits (Psidium guajava L.) had the highest vitamin C values. The main organic acids identified were lactic. citric. and acetic acids. and the highest amount of lactic acid was found in soursop fruits (Annona muricata L.). whereas Ecuadorian ivory palm (Phytelephas aequatorialis Spruce) and guava fruits had the highest acetic acid content. Guava also had the highest citric acid content; the highest concentration of oxalic acid was found in carambola. In terms of sugar content. giant granadilla (Passiflora quadrangularis L.) had the highest values of glucose. and red mombin (Spondias mombin L.) had the largest values for fructose and guava for sucrose. Chili pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacq) proved to be the main source of carotenoids. lutein. and β-carotene. anthocyanins. and vitamin C. The results here increase our knowledge regarding the composition of the main fruits consumed on the west coast of Ecuador to facilitate recommendations as potential sources of health-promoting compounds.

Male Wistar rats were maintained for 6 or 24 months on two diets varying in the fat source. namely virgin olive oil. rich in monounsaturated fatty acids. or sunflower oil. rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Both dietary fats were supplemented or not with coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10). Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated in the femur. Serum levels of osteocalcin. osteopontin. receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). osteoprotegerin (OPG). adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). as well as urinary F 2-isoprostanes were measured. Aged animals fed on virgin olive oil showed higher BMD than those fed on sunflower oil. In addition. CoQ 10 prevented the age-related decline in BMD in animals fed on sunflower oil. Urinary F 2-isoprostanes analysis showed that sunflower oil led to the highest oxidative status in old animals. which was avoided by supplementation with CoQ 10.

Serum osteocalcin. osteopontin. receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. ostroprotegerin. parathyroid hormone. urinary F 2-isoprostanes. and lymphocytes DNA strand breaks were also measured. BMD was lower in aged rats fed a diet without CoQ 10 respect than their younger counterparts. whereas older animals receiving CoQ 10 showed the highest BMD.

Supplementation with CoQ 10 prevented oxidative damage to lipid and DNA. in young and old animals. respectively. Reduced oxidative stress associated to CoQ 10 supplementation of this n-3 PUFA-rich diet might explain the higher BMD found in aged rats in this group of animals.

According to publication type. randomized-controlled trials. cohort. case-control and cross-sectional studies were included. Among all the analyzed components. those that have any effect on oxidative stress and/or inflammation seem to be the most interesting according to current evidence. On one hand. there is quite a lot of information in favor of a positive role of n-3 fatty acids. due to their antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. On the other hand. saturated fat-rich diets increase oxidative stress as well the as intensity and duration of inflammatory processes. so they must be avoided.

We investigated if chronic administration of CsA may have some effects on the lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant pattern of rat liver mitochondria and on their morphological structure. It seems that CsA administration does not statistically affect the redox status of the antioxidants investigated and their amounts (vitamin E. CoQ9. CoQ10. glutathione.uric acid and ascorbic acid) despite the variety of effects that this treatment produces at physiological and morphological levels.

When congestive heart failure is clinically overt. treatment is extremely difficult. It may improve symptoms for some time. but the therapies are not causal. Recent trials with ACE-inhibitors have offered the patients relief of symptoms and also better survival rates when compared to the classical antifailure principles. But the disease itself has not been cured and the general outlook is poor.Till this date. heart transplantation has been the only avenue to success regarding survival in patients with severe heart failure. However. serious problems remain with respect to the large number of potential recipients waiting. and dying. due to the limited donor availability. Therefore it is necessary to continue the efforts clinically and investigatively. to improve the classification and thereby the treatment of patients with dilated myocardial disease. Endomyocardial biopsy is a rather new technique enabling the obtainment of fresh cardiac muscle from patients with a variety of cardiac diseases.

The cultivar of each berry that showed the higher content of total phenols and flavonoids was selected to study its cytotoxic effect on human hepatoma cells. Digestion resulted in a high reduction (p˂ 0.05) of total phenolic. flavonoid and anthocyanin contents and total antioxidant capacity. in the “IN” samples compared to the “OUT” extracts. which represent the “serum-available” and the “colon-available” fractions. respectively. Incubation of the digested fraction for 24 h didn’t exert any effect on cellular viability. while a dose-and time-dependent cytotoxicity was observed after 48 h and 72 h of incubation for all the berries analyzed. Our results suggest that the approach proposed in this work may represent a rapid tool for evaluating and identifying new berries with increased phytochemical bioavailability. highlighting their antiproliferative agents after an in vitro digestion.

Although RA has been described in the medical literature for over two hundred years. its etiology and pathophysiology are insufficiently understood. The current treatment of RA is mainly empirical or based on drugs that interfere with generic steps of the immune response. with limited efficacy and/or significant side effects. Much of RA research has been traditionally based on animals and simplistic in vitro models. which have been shown to poorly recapitulate human RA etiopathogenesis and drug responses. A revolution in science and technology has produced a new generation of more relevant and predictive tools. These tools. which include patient-derived cells. innovative 3D cell culture systems. computational analyses and models. together with omics and large-scale epidemiological studies represent novel and exciting approaches to enhance and forward RA research in a human biology-based perspective. After considering some pitfalls and flaws of traditional models. in this review we discuss novel tools applicable to design human-oriented RA research. while fostering the need for a more holistic and preventative approach to the disease. Our goal is to stimulate discussion. both at scientific and public level. on the need to explore new avenues in RA research and to support a paradigm-shift from animal-based towards human biology-based systems to better understand human pathophysiology and to develop more effective targeted therapies for …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:60iIaj97TE0C,6,https://www.altex.org/index.php/altex/article/view/1434,9541876621075774439,/scholar?cites=9541876621075774439,,https://www.altex.org/index.php/altex/article/download/1434/1725,0,0,0

The fatty acids are considered to be responsible for these benefits of flaxseed. Herein. the in vitro effects of flaxseed extract on the growth and apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were investigated. The MCF-7 cells treated with flaxseed extract showed a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. The flaxseed extract induced reactive oxygen species and the flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that flaxseed fatty acids triggered apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. which was also shown by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase cascade reaction. Thus. the flaxseed extract regulated the growth of MCF-7 cells and induced apoptosis.

A DR model in C57BL/6 mice was established after intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). After intravitreal injection with TTR pAAV vector. MEG3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). scrambled shRNA. or MEG3. retinal imaging. retinal trypsin digestion. and fundus vascular permeability tests were performed. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8). transwell. and Matrigel assays were employed to detect the proliferation and migration of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRECs). The binding between long non-coding RNA of maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA-MEG3) and microRNA-223-3p (miR-223-3p) was observed by using luciferase reporter assays. while co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was employed to confirm the interaction between TTR and the target. In the DR mice model. retinal vascular leakage and angiogenesis were repressed by overexpressing TTR. In vitro. the added TTR promoted the level of lncRNA-MEG3 by interacting with poly (A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1). and then repressed proliferation and angiogenesis of hRECs. In vivo. silencing or overexpressing lncRNA-MEG3 significantly affected retinal vascular phenotypes. Additionally. the interaction between lncRNA-MEG3 and miR-223-3p was confirmed. and silencing of miR-223-3p revealed similar effects on hRECs as overexpression of lncRNA-MEG3.

Frequently. this bee product is contaminated with pesticides reducing its utility and causing the decline in its market. This study aimed to prove the effectiveness of an industrial-scale decontamination method in removing acaricides from beeswax. Chlorfenvinphos and coumaphos decrease was higher than 90%. whereas tau fluvalinate decrease was only 30%. No changes were observed in the beeswax content of hydrocarbons and monoesters. whereas a decrease in the concentrations of Ca. Fe. Zn. Hg. Mn and P. and an increase in the concentrations of As and Si were found after the decontamination. Filtration reduced total phenolics. flavonoids and the antioxidant capacity of the lipophilic extract. These results demonstrate that the industrial method used was as effective as the method previously tested on a laboratory scale. The study also contributes to a better knowledge and characterization of beeswax. specially related to trace and ultra-trace elements and antioxidant capacity.

With the emergence of molecular tools and post-genomics. high-resolution sequencing technologies. the gut microbiota has been emerging as a key moderator in the complex interplay between nutrients. human body. and infections. Much of the host–microbial and nutrition research is currently based on animals or simplistic in vitro models. Although traditional in vivo and in vitro models have helped to develop mechanistic hypotheses and assess the causality of the host–microbiota interactions. they often fail to faithfully recapitulate the complexity of the human nutrient–microbiome axis in gastrointestinal homeostasis and infections. Over the last decade. remarkable progress in tissue engineering. stem cell biology. microfluidics. sequencing technologies. and computing power has taken place. which has produced a new generation of human-focused. relevant. and predictive tools. These tools. which include patient-derived organoids. organs-on-a-chip. computational analyses. and models. together with multi-omics readouts. represent novel and exciting equipment to advance the research into microbiota. infectious diseases. and nutrition from a human-biology-based perspective.

The anti-inflammatory effects of cobalt metal complexes with ind and bum were assayed in lipopolysaccharide stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages by inhibition of nitric oxide production. Firstly. we determined the cytotoxicity and the anti-inflammatory potential of the cobalt compounds and ind and bum ligands in RAW 264.7 cells. Indomethacin-based metal complex was able to inhibit the NO production up to 35% in a concentration-dependent manner without showing cytotoxicity. showing around 6–37 times more effective than indomethacin. Cell cycle analysis showed that the inhibition of NO production was accompanied by a reversion of the differentiation processes in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. due to a decreased of cell percentage in G0/G1 phase. with the corresponding increase in the number of cells in S phase. These two materials have mononuclear structures and show slow relaxation of magnetization. Moreover. both compounds show anti-diabetic activity with low in vitro cell toxicities. The formation of metal complexes with bioactive ligands is a new and promising strategy to find new compounds with high and enhanced biochemical properties and promises to be a field of great interest.

This study aimed to investigate how dietary lipids varying in lipid profile (virgin olive oil. sunflower oil or fish oil) affected the heart of rats during aging. Heart histopathology. mitochondrial morphometry. and oxidative status were assessed. Typical histopathological features associated with aging. such as valvular lesions. endomyocardical hyperplasia. or papillary muscle calcification. were found at a low extent in all the experimental groups. The most relevant finding was that inflammation registered by fish oil group was lower compared to the other treatments. At the ultrastructural level. heart mitochondrial area. perimeter. and aspect ratio were higher in fish oil-fed rats than in those fed on sunflower oil. Concerning oxidative stress markers. there were differences only in coenzyme Q levels and catalase activity. lower in sunflower oil-fed animals compared with those fed on fish oil. In summary. dietary intake for a long period on dietary fats with different fatty acids profile led to differences in some aspects associated with the aging process at the heart.

91799,Total antioxidant capacity of olive oils,2006,Nicoletta Pellegrini and MAURIZIO Battino,,Olive oil and health,,66-71,CABI USA,Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated in the body during normal metabolic functioning or as part of the body defence against microorganisms (Battino et al.. 1999). Excessive production of ROS can cause oxidative damage to biological macromolecules such as DNA. lipids. carbohydrates and proteins (Halliwell and Gutteridge. 1999). Damage to these molecules has in turn been associated with increased risk of chronic diseases such as cancer. cardiovascular disease. eye disease and a number of immune and neuro-degenerative disorders (Halliwell and Gutteridge. 1999). The human body has evolved complex strategies to utilize oxygen and to minimize the deleterious effects of ROS; among such strategies. antioxidants are believed to be crucial in health maintenance through the modulation of oxidative processes in the body. The antioxidants within cells. cell membranes and extracellular fluids can be upregulated and mobilized to neutralize excessive ROS formation avoiding oxidative damage (Quiles et al.. 1994. 1999). Moreover. diet contains a large array of compounds that may function as antioxidants. including vitamins E and C. carotenoids. flavonoids and other phenolic compounds (Halliwell and Gutteridge. 1999). In recent years. epidemiological studies have demonstrated an inverse association between the intake of antioxidants from fruits and vegetables and the morbidity and mortality from coronary heart diseases (Cook and Samman. 1996; Stephens et al.. 1996) and cancer (Cohen et al.. 2000; La Vecchia et al.. 2001; Terry et al.. 2001).

Moreover. even the different ratio of fatty acid species in cardiolipin molecule could affect cytochrome oxidase properties. The influence of dietary fat and of endogenous lipid peroxidation with regard to cytochrome c oxidase activity and cytochrome a+ a3 concentrations in mitochondria from rat heart has been investigated. Whilst the endogenous oxidative stress led to increase the peroxidation products. detected by means of hydroperoxides and conjugated dienes determinations. the features of the lipid environment were not affected as shown by fluorescence polarization technique. However. the oxidative stress was able to induce a significant increase of cytochrome a+ a3 level even if the phenomenon did not reach the same extent as in the case of previous investigations on rat liver. Moreover. the results vary with the different fat source used and this might indicate a possible involvement of different dietary fats in peroxidation mechanisms.

The hydrophobic nature of Coll. suggests its localization inside the bilayer of cellular membranes. but till now the large number of physical studies as NMR. Calorimetry. X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic investigation did not clarify this point (see for example the book Coenzyme Q. Lenaz ed.. 1985). However. in order to better understand the biological behaviour of the ubiquinone and its action in the respiratory chain. it appears to be indispensable to know the localization sites and to determine the nature of its association with the membranes. Recently. some interaction models of CoQ. on liposomes systems have been proposed. including among others:(a) the localization of the coenzyme in the central part of the lipidic membrane. eventually sandwiched within the bilayer (Alonso et al.. 1981; Ulrich et al.. 1985; Quinn and Esfahani. 1980);(b) the arrangement in a micellar form inside the bilayer (Quinn and Katsikas. 1985);(c) the formation of a separate phase located outside the bilayer (Stidham et al.. 1984).

91817,The central role of mitochondria in the relationship between dietary lipids and cancer progression,2021,Alfonso Varela-López and Laura Vera-Ramírez and Francesca Giampieri and María D Navarro-Hortal and Tamara Y Forbes-Hernández and Maurizio Battino and José L Quiles,,,,,Academic Press,Evidence demonstrates the importance of lipid metabolism and signaling in cancer cell biology. De novo lipogenesis is an important source of lipids for cancer cells. but exogenous lipid uptake remains essential for many cancer cells. Dietary lipids can modify lipids present in tumor microenvironment affecting cancer cell metabolism. Clinical trials have shown that diets rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can negatively affect tumor growth. However. certain n-6 PUFAs can also contribute to cancer progression. Identifying the molecular mechanisms through which lipids affect cancer progression will provide an opportunity for focused dietary interventions that could translate into the development of personalized diets for cancer control. However. the effective mechanisms of action of PUFAs have not been fully clarified yet.

The mitochondria could be a therapeutic target to treat pathologies whose origin lies in mitochondrial dysfunctions or whose progression is dependent on mitochondrial function. We aimed to study the subcellular distribution of 2–4 nm iron nanoparticles and its effect on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mitochondrial function. and autophagy in colorectal cell lines (HT-29). Results showed that when cells were exposed to ultra-small iron nanoparticles. their subcellular fate was mainly mitochondria. affecting its respiratory and glycolytic parameters. inducing the migration of the cellular state towards quiescence. and promoting and triggering the autophagic process.

The main inflammatory deficiencies include oxidative stress and autophagic dysfunction. Mitochondria are the main source of reactive oxygen species; their impaired function is related to skin diseases and periodontitis. The mitochondrial function has been evaluated in PLS and mitochondria have been targeted as a possible treatment for PLS. We show for the first time an important mitochondrial dysfunction associated with increased oxidative damage of mtDNA. reduced CoQ10 and mitochondrial mass and aberrant morphologies of the mitochondria in PLS patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction. determined by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in PLS fibroblasts. was treated with CoQ10 supplementation. which determined an improvement in OCR and a remission of skin damage in a patient receiving a topical administration of a cream enriched with CoQ10 0.1%. We provide the first evidence of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and CoQ10 deficiency in the pathophysiology of PLS and a future therapeutic option for PLS.

The proposal of this study was to evaluate the role of diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol in some aspects of periodontal diseases in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of periodontal disease in rabbits and to assess the influence of a periodontal intervention on hyperlipidemia. atherosclerosis. and NAFLD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Male rabbits were maintained on a commercial standard diet or a diet rich in saturated fat (3% lard w/w) and cholesterol (1.3% w/w)(HFD) for 40 days. Half of the rabbits on each diet were treated 2 days per week with intragingival injections of LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Morphometric analyses revealed that LPS induced higher alveolar bone loss (ABL) around the first premolar in animals receiving standard diets. which was exacerbated by the HFD diet. A higher score of acinar inflammation in the liver and higher blood levels of triglycerides and phospholipids were found in HFD-fed rabbits receiving LPS. These results suggest that certain dietary habits can exacerbate some aspects of periodontitis and that bad periodontal health can contribute to dyslipidemia and promote NAFLD progression. but only under certain conditions.

Phosphorus and potassium were the main macrominerals. while iron was the principal micromineral. HDFa were preincubated with a crude pechiche extract (PCext) and then subjected to oxidative stress. The activity of five antioxidant enzymes. intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP levels and lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were used as markers of oxidative damage. Preincubation with PCext for 24 h allowed for the significant reduction of intracellular ROS levels. improved the intracellular ATP levels and protected lipids and proteins against oxidative damage (p 0.05). Additionally. preincubation with PCext was also able to significantly (p< 0.05) improve the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase. superoxide dismutase. glutathione peroxidase. glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase. compared to the stressed group without pretreatment. The results obtained in this study suggest the potential of pechiche as a source of bioactive compounds. as well as its beneficial effect against oxidative stress.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:v_tt_AnqfNMC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/2/109,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/2/109/pdf,0,0,0
91841,Coenzyme Q. mtDNA and Mitochondrial Dysfunction During Aging,2020,José L Quiles and Alfonso Varela-López and María D Navarro-Hortal and Maurizio Battino,,,,191-225,Springer. Cham,The main sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells are mitochondria. whose components would be primary targets of ROS. Both facts are responsible for the key role of these organelles in aging according to the “mitochondrial theory of aging”. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is especially important since it would have the longest-term consequences impairing mitochondrial function. This would lead to a decrease in ATP production. but also to an increased ROS generation. In turn. CoQ. which acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria. is an essential factor for cell bioenergetics and an equilibrated CoQ pool is expected to perform a better electron flow adaptation. Moreover. it is a lipid-soluble antioxidant and efficiently prevents oxidation of DNA along with other macromolecules. Other interesting attributed roles include interaction with cell signaling cascades. anti-inflammatory activities and …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:SrKkpNFED5gC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-45642-9_10,,,,,0,0,0
91842,Bioactive Phytochemicals and Functional Food Ingredients in Fruits and Vegetables,2020,Francesca Giampieri and Maurizio Battino,21,,9,3278,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Today. it is widely accepted that a plant-based diet produces wellbeing and prevents the onset of several human diseases [1–5]. In recent years. fruits and vegetables. thanks to their high contents and variety of bioactive compounds. have attracted the attention of the scientific community worldwide. as demonstrated by pivotal papers that have obtained a very high number of citations and that currently represent milestones in this field [6–15]. International Journal of Molecular Sciences has always emphasized this interesting topic: the Special Issue “Bioactive Phytochemicals and Functional Food Ingredients in Fruits and Vegetables” was first written in 2015. obtaining significant success with 31 published papers. and the same successful results were gained in subsequent editions in 2016 and 2017. For these reasons. we decided to update these topics in 2019 too. where ten outstanding papers. from experts in this field. provided a broad range of contributions. describing different aspects of polyphenol health benefits and highlighting potential mechanisms involved in their positive effects. The protective effects of dietary bioactive compounds and polyphenols against oxidative stress and inflammation. two processes that are implicated in the pathogenesis of several common diseases. have been widely evaluated in recent years [10. 16–18]. In this Special Issue. six research papers were assessed and confirmed these beneficial properties: for example. Kim et al. showed that pachypodol. a 4. 5-dihydroxy-3. 3. 7-trimethoxyflavone isolated from Pogostemon cablin Bentham (patchouli). exerts antioxidant activity and cytoprotective effects in HepG2 cells …,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:sbeIDTyQOFgC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/9/3278/htm,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/9/3278/htm,0,0,0

91850,The effect of an enzymatic digestion process on strawberry antioxidant capacity,2017,TY Forbes-Hernandez and M Gasparrini and S Afrin and M Battino and F Giampieri,,Acta Horticulturae,1156,413-418,International Society for Horticultural Science (ISHS),Strawberry represents the most important berry in the Mediterranean diet. It is the most consumed berry as both fresh and processed products. the most studied berry from the agronomic. genomic and nutritional point of view. and it is also a remarkable source of micronutrients and phytochemicals with a relevant biologically activity on human health. Although individual bioactive compounds present in strawberries have been studied for their biological activities. the mechanisms by which they are metabolized and exert their beneficial effects on human health are still unknown. For this reason. the first objective of this research is the development of an enzymatic in vitro system which simulates the gastrointestinal conditions that occur in vivo during the digestive process. Briefly. the method consists on an initial pepsin-HCl digestion for simulating gastric conditions (pH~ 1.7) followed by an intestinal digestion with pancreatin and bile salts through a dialysis membrane. The dialysates were concentrated under vacuum. resuspended in H2O2/glacial acetic acid and purified with a C-18 SepPaks Vac 6 cc cartridge. The strawberry cultivar chosen for the study is ‘Romina’. one of the most promising cultivars developed in the context of the European Euberry project. The total antioxidant capacity of both the fresh fruit and the digested fraction was tested through the DPPH. FRAP and TEAC assays.

The presence of some bacteria is the primary etiology of this disease; a susceptible host is also necessary for disease initiation. In this respect. the progression of periodontal disease and healing of the periodontal tissues can be modulated by nutritional status. To clarify the role of lipids in the establishment. progression. and/or treatment of this pathology. a systematic review was conducted of English-written literature in PubMed until May 2016. which included research on the relationship of these dietary components with the onset and progression of periodontal disease. According to publication type. randomized-controlled trials. cohort. case-control and cross-sectional studies were included. Among all the analyzed components. those that have any effect on oxidative stress and/or inflammation seem to be the most interesting according to current evidence. On one hand. there is quite a lot of information in favor of a positive role of n-3 fatty acids. due to their antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects.

91876,Mitochondrial dysfunction promoted by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide as a possible link between cardiovascular disease and periodontitis,2011,Pedro Bullón Fernández and Mario David Cordero Morales and José L Quiles and JM Morillo and Maria Carmen Ramirez Tortosa and Maurizio Battino,,,,,Elsevier Science,Oxidative stress is one of the factors that could explain the pathophysiological mechanism of inflammatory conditions that occur in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and periodontitis. Such inflammatory response is often evoked by specific bacteria. as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key factor in this process. The aim of this research was to study the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from periodontitis patients and to evaluate the influence of LPS on fibroblasts to better understand the pathophysiology of periodontitis and its relationship with CVD. PBMCs from patients showed lower CoQ10 levels and citrate synthase activity. together with high levels of ROS production. LPS-treated fibroblasts provoked increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by a decrease in mitochondrial protein expression. mitochondrial mass. and mitochondrial membrane potential. Our study supports the hypothesis that LPS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction could be at the origin of oxidative stress in periodontal patients. Abnormal PBMC performance may promote oxidative stress and alter cytokine homeostasis. In conclusion. mitochondrial dysfunction could represent a possible link to understanding the interrelationships between two prominent inflammatory diseases: periodontitis and CVD,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:ndLnGcHYRF0C,0,https://idus.us.es/handle/11441/82043,,,,https://idus.us.es/bitstream/handle/11441/82043/Bullon.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

In addition. plasma antioxidants (α-tocopherol and ubiquinone 9) were investigated as well as the possible oxidative modifications suffered by virgin olive and sunflower oils during the frying process. The frying process decreased the content of α-tocopherol and phenolics in the oils and increased total polar materials. Sunflower oil was affected to a greater extent than olive oil. In rats. the intake of fried oil led to higher levels of lipid peroxidation and a lower concentration of plasma antioxidants. Microsomal fatty acid and antioxidant profiles were also altered. It seems that a strong relationship exists between the loss of antioxidants and the production of toxic compounds in the oils after frying and the extent of the peroxidative events in microsomes. which were also different depending on the fat source. The highly unsaturated sunflower oil was less resistant to the oxidative stress produced by frying and led to a higher degree of lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes in vivo than virgin olive oil.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:Nw_I7GeUguwC,0,https://digibug.ugr.es/handle/10481/65997,,,,https://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/handle/10481/65997/the-intake-of-fried-virgin-olive-or-sunflower-oils-differentially.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
91892,Physical exercise affects the lipid profile of mitochondrial membranes in rats fed with virgin olive oil or sunflower oil,2007,José Luis Quiles Morales and Jesús Francisco Rodríguez Huertas and Mariano José Mañas Almendros and Maurizio Battino and José Mataix Verdú,,,,,Cambridge University Press,The effects of physical exercise on the lipid profile in mitochondrial membranes of liver and skeletal muscle were examined in rats fed with virgin olive oil or sunflower oil. Thirty male Wistar rats. 21 d old. were randomly assigned to four groups according to fat ingestion and physical activity over an 8-week period. For each type of oil. one group acted as a control group while rats from the other were trained to run for 40 min daily on a horizontal treadmill. at a speed of 35 m/min. The results show that diet affected the fatty acid profile of the mitochondrial membranes from skeletal muscle and liver. Physical exercise also modified the fatty acid profile of the mitochondrial membranes. Total monounsaturated fatty acids decreased (P < 0.001) in liver mitochondria of exercised animals. Total polyunsaturated fatty acids in mitochondrial membranes of liver increased (P < 0.005) after exercise but those in mitochondrial membranes of skeletal muscle decreased (P < 0.05). These changes due to the exercise may arise via several mechanisms. e.g. fluidity regulation; changes in the eicosanoid metabolism; differences in the availability or oxidation rate of the different fatty acids.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:inmFHauC9wsC,0,https://digibug.ugr.es/handle/10481/65902,,,,https://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/handle/10481/65902/physical-exercise-affects-the-lipid-profile-of-mitochondrial.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

The consumer is aware of the importance of looking for diets containing a large array of compounds that may help the organisms in the daily struggle against chronic diseases. If fruit intake is not sufficient to support the RDA for several micronutrients. an interesting help can be that of foods naturally enriched with antioxidants. The evaluation of Total Antioxidant Capacity of fruits is of pivotal importance in assessing the nutritional attributes of fruits and other horticultural products. By means of specific breeding programs it is possible to select antioxidant enriched fruit varieties. These features are susceptible to be improved through generations in order to release fruits with enhanced nutritional features.

91896,Changes in Tocopherol Composition of Edible Oils after Extreme Heat Exposure (Frying),2006,Maurizio Battino and José L Quiles,,The encyclopedia of vitamin E,,162,CABI Publishing,Frying is one of the most popular food preparation methods because it produces a desirable fried food flavour. golden brown colour and crisp texture. However. this culinary method has several disadvantages including the production. through several reactions. of cytotoxic aldehydes that may be harmful to health. These reactions may reduce the antioxidant content in the oils. decreasing its stability and producing new products which are responsible for a loss in the nutritional value and quality of the oils. Edible vegetable oils contain natural antioxidants such as-tocopherol for preventing oxidation and they are the main source of natural tocopherols for humans. Tocopherols are lost along with the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids during frying. as has been separately reported for a wide variety of oils. Pan-frying is a more stressful procedure concerning-tocopherol losses than deep-fat frying. and discontinuous frying leads to greater decreases in-tocopherol content than the continuous process. Heating (a different procedure from frying since it is performed in the absence of food) also leads to a fall in tocopherol. When-tocopherol was added to an antioxidant-poor refined olive oil. the total antioxidant capacity of this oil was improved. more-tocopherol was retained in the fried oil and lower oil degradation was observed. reaching similar levels to those found in antioxidant-rich extra virgin olive oil.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=yg6zzRaMHmYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA162&dq=info:lu6-D1yCWMYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=2DWlY6OG9-&sig=JuRp35lGHRnzRwwc_9KW-Wo395g,,,,,0,0,0

Huber.,Physical exercise induces oxidative stress. Dietary fat modulates lipid composition of plasma and fatty acid profile of mitochondrial membranes. Over 8 wk. two groups of rats were fed virgin olive oil or sunflower oil as the only fat sources. Both groups were divided into 4 subgroups according to exercise: one of sedentary rats and the other three of rats subjected to different exercises on a treadmill. There was a lower concentration of vitamin A and coenzyme Q in the plasma of animals subjected to exercise compared to the sedentary animals. The concentrations of these molecules in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria of animals exercised until exhaustion were higher than in sedentary animals. This can suggest the existence of a balance between plasma and mitochondrial membrane for these antioxidants as a response to an oxidative attack.

We have found that the presence of endogenous and exogenous COQ can protect mitochondrial membranes from peroxidative damages induced by irradiation treatment and that col. at concentration corresponding to average blood level. enhances the survival of 179 chinese hamster cell culture when irradiated. Moreover by means of a new chemiluminescence assay it has been pointed out that exogenous long chain Coq homologs are able to scavenge free radicals endogenously produced by mitochondria in presence of a saturating NADH concentration and of rotenone. In this situation Collo more effective than alpha-tocopherol in counteracting free radicals at least at very low concentration (10 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein) and as effective as Vit. E at higher concentrations. On the contrary short chain homologs acted as prooxidants enhancing the luminescence produced by oxygen active species. The molecular mechanisms leading to this behaviour is still unclear. but the obtained results. showing that CoQ10 may act as an antioxidant in situations mimicking physiopathological conditions are of considerable interest for their biochemical and biomedical implications.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:nWoA1JPTheMC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18092305687327668830&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Recent works (Battino et al.. 1989; Lenaz and Fato. 1986) indicate that the inner mitochondrial concentration of Coenzyme Q is able to affect electron transfer being in the range of the km for the enzyme complexes in the Ubiquinone region.A deficiency of the Q-pool molecules could have dramatic importance either for for the normal rate of the electron flow (ie the CoQ-pool becomes the limiting factor in the respiratory chain) or for its antioxidant properties and these situations are of great importance also for clinical implications.,True,Q1lR4AMAAAAJ:hfzGNhXhx5MC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8821512675008995306&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

In mitochondria. coenzyme Q (ubiquinone. Q) constitutes an indispensable redox link between flavoprotein dehydrogenases and the cytochrome bc. complex. Kinetic studies established that ubiquinone in mitochondria exists as a homogeneous mobile pool. shuttling electrons from each dehydrogenase molecule to each molecule of the bc. complex by lateral diffusion (3); similar kinetic behavior was found for quinones also in other energy-conserving membranes.

According to one view. Q constitutes a homogeneous pool connecting flavin-linked dehydrogenases to Complex III by free diffusion in the membrane; the alternative hypothesis depicts Q as a prosthetic group of the Q-enzymes. These are actually only two extreme situations among a series of different theoretically possible states. some of which are listed below.(a) The whole respiratory chain is constituted by large protein complexes randomly distributed in the plane of the membrane where they move freely by lateral diffusion; ubiquinone and cytochrome c (cyt. c) are also mobile electron carriers. possessing faster diffusion than the bulkier protein complexes. so that their diffusion-coupled collision frequencies are greater than the maximal tumover numbers of the chain.(b) The components of the chain are randomly distributed. but all rates are diffusion-controlled. so that the diffusions of the fastest components (Q and cyt. c) represent the rate-limiting steps for integrated electron transfer.(c) Electron transfer is ensured by diffusion and collision of protein complexes. each carrying bound Q as a prosthetic group; the bound quinone is in equilibrium with the pool by very fast association-dissociation. but the free pool does not directly participate in electron transfer.(d) The components of the chain are organized in a solid-state assembly. where electron transfer occurs via the fixed association of the redox components in the membrane.

Its pathophysiological mechanisms are difficult to identify and current drug therapies demonstrate limited effectiveness. Both mitochondrial dysfunction and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency have been implicated in FM pathophysiology. We have investigated the effect of CoQ10 supplementation. We carried out a randomized. double-blind. placebocontrolled trial to evaluate clinical and gene expression effects of forty days of CoQ10 supplementation (300 mg/day) on 20 FM patients. This study was registered with controlled-trials. com (ISRCTN 21164124). An important clinical improvement was evident after CoQ10 versus placebo treatment showing a reduction of FIQ (p< 0.001). and a most prominent reduction in pain (p< 0.001). fatigue. and morning tiredness (p< 0.01) subscales from FIQ. Furthermore. we observed an important reduction in the pain visual scale (p< 0.01) and a reduction in tender points (p< 0.01). including recovery of inflammation. antioxidant enzymes. mitochondrial biogenesis. and AMPK gene expression levels. associated with phosphorylation of the AMPK activity. These results lead to the hypothesis that CoQ10 have a potential therapeutic effect in FM. and indicate new potential molecular targets for the therapy of this disease.

The precise molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis are not fully understood. but several key elements to the disease are noteworthy. such as cell cycle aberration and oxidative stress. Cell cycle aberrations include the abnormal reentry of quiescent neurons into the cell cycle. while oxidative stress includes amyloid-ß accumulation that is certainly detrimental to cell functioning and survival. In neurons. these two factors lead to dysfunction. decay. and finally to cell death. Cell cycle disturbance and oxidative stress are not related solely to brain neurons but also to other tissues. such as peripheral blood lymphocytes. In peripheral blood lymphocytes. cell cycle disturbances in patients with AD led to centromere instability. especially premature centromere division. which determines the cell cycle phase. and can be used as a potential cytogenetic biomarker for AD (Spremo-Potparević et al.. 2008; Zivkovic et al.. 2013). The objectives of this project were to examine the degree of DNA damage. the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell energy metabolism by monitoring mitochondrial respiration. in lymphocytes of AD patients and healthy elderly subjects treated with antioxidants from food extracts (strawberry. honey and olive oil) to assess if antioxidants could improve the physiological status of these individuals.Strawberries (Fragaria X ananassa.

THE ROLE OF STRAWBERRY CONSUMPTION ON COENZYME Q AND OTHER ANTIOXIDANTS IN HUMANS,,M Battino and S Tulipani and S Romandini and F Capocasa and S Bompadre and F Busco and B Mezzetti,,,,,,Many epidemiological studies confirm that a high consumption of fruit is correlated with a lower incidence of several chronic diseases. mainly for the protective role against cardiovascular. degenerative and proliferative diseases. There is convincing evidence that the considerable health benefits of fruit are due to its specific chemical composition. particularly to compounds of nutritional relevance. For these reasons. the nutritional quality of fruit is presently becoming an attribute as important as the organoleptic-sensorial quality. and breeding and biotechnological approaches are currently used to increase the content of specific bioactive compounds in fruits.Strawberry fruit contains high levels of micronutrients. such as essential minerals and vitamins. and phytochemical compounds belonging to the huge class of phenolics. Most of these compounds exhibit antioxidant properties. and their bioactivity seems to be directly or indirectly linked to their relevant role in protecting essential biomolecules from free radicals and reactive oxygen species induced damages. In order to describe the role played by the genetic background on attributes that are essential for the nutritional qualities of the fruit. we compared a number of phytochemical parameters of a selected number of genotypes from the Italian strawberry breeding program. In particular. the total flavonoid. anthocyanin. vitamin C and folate contents were measured. and cultivar effects on the total antioxidant capacities (TAC) of strawberries were also tested.

Genome analysis provides a greatly improved fish gene catalogue. including identifying key genes previously thought to be absent in fish. Comparison with other vertebrates and a urochordate indicates that fish proteins have diverged markedly faster than their mammalian homologues. Comparison with the human genome suggests∼ 900 previously unannotated human genes.

91953,The leucine-rich repeat structure,2008,J Bella and KL Hindle and PA McEwan and SC Lovell,65,,15,2307-2333,SP Birkhäuser Verlag Basel,The leucine-rich repeat is a widespread structural motif of 20–30 amino acids with a characteristic repetitive sequence pattern rich in leucines. Leucine-rich repeat domains are built from tandems of two or more repeats and form curved solenoid structures that are particularly suitable for protein-protein interactions. Thousands of protein sequences containing leucine-rich repeats have been identified by automatic annotation methods. Three-dimensional structures of leucine-rich repeat domains determined to date reveal a degree of structural variability that translates into the considerable functional versatility of this protein superfamily. As the essential structural principles become well established. the leucine-rich repeat architecture is emerging as an attractive framework for structural prediction and protein engineering.

The small proteoglycan decorin is the archetypal SLRP. Decorin is present in a variety of connective tissues. typically “decorating” collagen fibrils. and is involved in important biological functions. including the regulation of the assembly of fibrillar collagens and modulation of cell adhesion. Several SLRPs are known to regulate collagen fibrillogenesis and there is evidence that they may share other biological functions. We have recently determined the crystal structure of the protein core of decorin. the first such determination of a member of the SLRP family.

It specifically digests single-stranded DNA in the 3ʹ to 5ʹ direction. The protein is composed of 479 amino acids. and it shares 47% sequence identity with E. coli Exo I. The crystal structure of MszExo I was determined to a resolution of 2.2 Å and it aligns well with that of E. coli Exo I. Comparative studies revealed that MszExo I and E. coli Exo I have similar metal ion binding affinity and similar activity at mesophilic temperatures (25–47°C). However. the optimum working temperature of MszExo I is 10°C higher. and the melting temperature is more than 4°C higher as evaluated by both thermal inactivation assays and DSC measurements. More importantly. two thermal transitions during unfolding of MszExo I were monitored by DSC while only one transition was found in E. coli Exo I. Further analyses showed that magnesium ions not only confer structural stability. but also affect the unfolding of MszExo I.

Due to the lack of a vaccine. patient therapy is heavily reliant on chemotherapy with praziquantel as the World Health Organization–recommended drug. but concerns over drug resistance encourage the search for new drug leads.   Methods and Findings The efficacy of the vinyl sulfone cysteine protease inhibitor K11777 was tested in the murine model of schistosomiasis mansoni. Disease parameters measured were worm and egg burdens. and organ pathology including hepato- and splenomegaly. presence of parasite egg–induced granulomas in the liver. and levels of circulating alanine aminotransferase activity as a marker of hepatocellular function. K11777 (25 mg/kg twice daily [BID]). administered intraperitoneally at the time of parasite migration through the skin and lungs (days 1–14 postinfection [p.i.]). resulted in parasitologic cure (elimination of parasite eggs) in five of seven cases and a resolution of other disease parameters. K11777 (50 mg/kg BID). administered at the commencement of egg-laying by mature parasites (days 30–37 p.i.). reduced worm and egg burdens. and ameliorated organ pathology. Using protease class-specific substrates and active-site labeling. one molecular target of K11777 was identified as the gut-associated cathepsin B1 cysteine protease. although other cysteine protease targets are not excluded.

Methods A partially automated. three-component phenotypic screen workflow is presented that utilizes at its apex the schistosomular stage of the parasite adapted to a 96-well plate format with a throughput of 640 compounds per month. Hits that arise are subsequently screened in vitro against adult parasites and finally for efficacy in a murine model of disease. Two GO/NO GO criteria filters in the workflow prioritize hit compounds for tests in the animal disease model in accordance with a target drug profile that demands short-course oral therapy. The screen workflow was inaugurated with 2.160 chemically diverse natural and synthetic compounds. of which 821 are drugs already approved for human use. This affords a unique starting point to ‘reposition’ (re-profile) drugs as anti-schistosomals with potential savings in development timelines and costs.  Findings Multiple and dynamic phenotypes could be categorized for schistosomula and adults in vitro. and a diverse set of ‘hit’ drugs and chemistries were identified. including anti-schistosomals. anthelmintics. antibiotics. and neuromodulators. Of those hits prioritized for tests in the animal disease model. a number of leads were identified. one of which …,True,yEGRdSIAAAAJ:SjuI4pbJlxcC,202,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000478,15037738322898427064,/scholar?cites=15037738322898427064,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000478,0,0,0

As an initial step in identifying possible functions of this enzyme in the life cycle of T. cruzi. and examining its potential as a target for rational drug design. two fluoromethyl ketone-derivatized cysteine protease inhibitors were studied for their effects of T. cruzi infection of mammalian cells. Both inhibitors are irreversible substrate analogues with high specificity for cysteine proteases and minimal toxicity to mammalian cells. While micromolar concentrations of inhibitors had some effect on replication of all parasite stages. the most dramatic arrest of parasite replication occurred at the transformation of trypomastigote to amastigote. and also from amastigote to trypomastigote.

One of the most remarkable examples of tissue migration is that of larvae of the nematode parasite Strongyloides stercoralis. which can move through tissue at speeds of up to 10 cm per hour. We have shown the Strongyloides L3 larvae secrete a potent histolytic metalloprotease to facilitate their rapid migration. This protease has elastase activity and catalyzes the degradation of a model of dermal extracellular matrix.

Leishmania spp.. responsible for leishmaniasis. and Trypansoma brucei. the causative agent of African Sleeping Sickness. Both T. cruzi and Leishmania parasites have an essential requirement for ergosterol. and are thus vulnerable to inhibitors of sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51). which catalyzes the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. Clinically employed anti-fungal azoles inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi. and specific azoles are also effective against both Trypanosoma and Leishmania parasites. However. modification of azoles to enhance efficacy and circumvent potential drug resistance has been problematic for both parasitic and fungal infections due to the lack of structural insights into drug binding.

To identify proteases most suitable for drug targeting. actual enzyme activity and not messenger RNA levels or immunoassay of protein is the ideal assay readout. An automated microtiter plate assay format was modified to allow detection of all four major classes of proteases in tissue samples. Fifteen sets of colorectal carcinoma biopsies representing primary tumor. adjacent normal colon. and liver metastases were screened for protease activity. The major proteases detected were matrix metalloproteases (MMP9. MMP2. and MMP1). ca-thepsin B. cathepsin D. and the mast cell serine proteases. tryptase and chymase. Matrix metallopro-teases were expressed at higher levels in the primary tumor than in adjacent normal tissue. The mast cell proteases. in contrast. were at very high levels in adjacent normal tissue. and not detectable in the metastases. Cathepsin B activity was significantly higher in the primary tumor. and highest in the metastases. The major proteases detected by activity assays were then localized in biopsy sections by im-munohistochemistry. Mast cell proteases were abundant in adjacent normal tissue. because of infiltration of the lamina propria by mast cells. Matrix metalloproteases were localized to the tumor cells themselves; whereas. cathepsin B was predominantly expressed by macrophages at the leading edge of invading tumors.

Although recent studies have elucidated some of the ways macrophages respond to these pathogens. the relationships between activation programs elicited by these pathogens and the macrophage activation programs elicited by bacterial pathogens and cytokines have not been delineated.  Methodology/Principal Findings To provide a global perspective on the relationships between macrophage activation programs and to understand how certain pathogens circumvent them. we used transcriptional profiling by genome-wide microarray analysis to compare the responses of mouse macrophages following exposure to the intracellular parasites T. cruzi and Leishmania mexicana. the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). and the cytokines IFNG. TNF. IFNB. IL-4. IL-10. and IL-17. We found that LPS induced a classical activation state that resembled macrophage stimulation by the Th1 cytokines IFNG and TNF. However. infection by the protozoan pathogen L. mexicana produced so few transcriptional changes that the infected macrophages were almost indistinguishable from uninfected cells. T. cruzi activated macrophages produced a transcriptional signature characterized by the induction of interferon-stimulated genes by 24 h post-infection.

Therefore. to identify potential target proteins for new avenues of drug discovery we have taken a comparative chemogenomics approach utilizing the putative proteome of Schistosoma mansoni compared to the proteomes of two model organisms. the nematode. Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruitfly. Drosophila melanogaster.

Transient RNAi has emerged as a straightforward and important technique to interrogate that information through decreased or loss of gene function and identify potential drug targets. To date. RNAi studies in schistosome stages infecting humans have focused on single (or up to 3) genes of interest. Therefore. in the context of standardizing larger RNAi screens. data are limited on the extent of possible off-targeting effects. gene-to-gene variability in RNAi efficiency and the operational capabilities and limits of RNAi.

Novel chemotherapy with the drug K11777 targets the major cysteine protease cruzain and disrupts amastigote intracellular development. Nevertheless. the biological role of the protease in infection and pathogenesis remains unclear as cruzain gene knockout failed due to genetic redundancy. A role for the T. cruzi cysteine protease cruzain in immune evasion was elucidated in a comparative study of parental wild type- and cruzain-deficient parasites. Wild type T. cruzi did not activate host macrophages during early infection (<60 min) and no increase in ∼P iκB was detected. The signaling factor NF-κB P65 colocalized with cruzain on the cell surface of intracellular wild type parasites. and was proteolytically cleaved. No significant IL-12 expression occurred in macrophages infected with wild type T. cruzi and treated with LPS and BFA. confirming impairment of macrophage activation pathways. In contrast. cruzain-deficient parasites induced macrophage activation. detectable iκB phosphorylation. and nuclear NF-κB P65 localization. These parasites were unable to develop intracellularly and survive within macrophages. IL 12 expression levels in macrophages infected with cruzain-deficient T. cruzi were comparable to LPS activated controls. Thus cruzain hinders macrophage activation during the early (<60 min) stages of infection. by interruption of the NF-κB P65 mediated signaling pathway.

The FP2 structure reveals two previously undescribed cysteine protease structural motifs. designated FP2nose and FP2arm. in addition to details of the active site that will help focus inhibitor design. Unlike most cysteine proteases. FP2 does not require a prodomain but only the short FP2nose motif to correctly fold and gain catalytic activity.

Adult worms live in the lymphatic system and cause a strong immune reaction that leads to the obstruction of lymph vessels and swelling of the extremities. Chronic disease leads to the painful and disfiguring condition known as elephantiasis. Current drug therapy is effective against the microfilariae (larval stage) of the parasite. but no drugs are effective against the adult worms. One of the major stumbling blocks toward developing effective macrofilaricides to kill the adult worms is the lack of a high throughput screening method for candidate drugs. Current methods utilize systems that measure one well at a time and are time consuming and often expensive.

Controls were exposed to water used to collect cercariae in an identical manner. and punctured to simulate cercarial tunnels. Fluid from both control and experimental samples was analyzed by LC/MS/MS using a linear ion trap in “triple play” mode. The coexistence of proteins released by cercariae and host skin proteins from epidermis and basement membrane confirmed that cercarial tunnels in skin were sampled. Among the abundant proteins secreted by cercariae was the cercarial protease that has been implicated in degradation of host proteins. secreted proteins proposed to mediate immune invasion by larvae. and proteins implicated in protection of parasites against oxidative stress. Components of the schistosome surface tegument. previously identified with immune serum. were also released.

Winnowing the database to 23 selected compounds. 12 non-covalent binding cruzain inhibitors with affinity values (Ki) in the low micromolar range (3–60 µM) acting through a competitive inhibition mechanism were identified. This mechanism has been confirmed by determining the binding mode of the cruzain inhibitor Nequimed176 through X-ray crystallographic studies. Cruzain. a validated therapeutic target for new chemotherapy for Chagas disease. also shares high similarity with the mammalian homolog cathepsin L. Because increased activity of cathepsin L is related to invasive properties and has been linked to metastatic cancer cells. cruzain inhibitors from the same library were assayed against it.

As a proof-of-concept. K11777. a potent inhibitor of cruzain. was found to effectively eliminate T. cruzi infection and is currently a clinical candidate for treatment of Chagas' disease.  Methodology/Principal Findings WRR-483. an analog of K11777. was synthesized and evaluated as an inhibitor of cruzain and against T. cruzi proliferation in cell culture. This compound demonstrates good potency against cruzain with sensitivity to pH conditions and high efficacy in the cell culture assay. Furthermore. WRR-483 also eradicates parasite infection in a mouse model of acute Chagas' disease. To determine the atomic-level details of the inhibitor interacting with cruzain. a 1.5 Å crystal structure of the protease in complex with WRR-483 was solved. The structure illustrates that WRR-483 binds covalently to the active site cysteine of the protease in a similar manner as other vinyl sulfone-based inhibitors. Details of the critical interactions within the specificity binding pocket are also reported.  Conclusions We demonstrate that WRR-483 is an effective cysteine protease inhibitor with trypanocidal activity in cell culture and animal model with comparable efficacy to K11777. Crystallographic evidence confirms that the mode of action is by targeting the active site of cruzain.

92116,Identification of the secreted neutral proteases from Anisakis simplex,1990,Judy A Sakanari and James H McKerrow,,The Journal of parasitology,,625-630,American Society of Parasitologists,Ingestion of larval nematodes (family: Anisakidae) can cause the human disease known as anisakiasis. After ingestion. Anisakis larvae can be invasive. penetrating host stomach or intestinal wall. Observation of larvae penetrating the tissue layers of human stomach in vitro by SEM showed tunnels and burrows were formed in the mucosa and submucosa. Based on these observations. we hypothesized that secreted proteases may be involved in the degradation of host tissue macromolecules to allow tunnel formation. Using a model of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). we found that as few as 5 Anisakis simplex larvae could degrade approximately 25% of the ECM in a 16-mm culture well in 24 hr.

RA synthesis during infection is poorly understood. Here. we show that retinal dehydrogenases (Raldh). required for the synthesis of RA. are induced during a retinoid-dependent type-2 immune response elicited by Schistosoma mansoni infection. but not during a retinoid-independent anti-viral immune response. Vitamin A deficient mice have a selective defect in TH2 responses to S. mansoni. but retained normal LCMV specific TH1 responses. A combination of in situ imaging. intra-vital imaging. and sort purification revealed that alternatively activated macrophages (AAMφ) express high levels of Raldh2 during S. mansoni infection.

Finally. in vivo derived AAMφ have an enhanced capacity to induce Foxp3 expression in CD4+ cells through an RA dependent mechanism. especially in combination with TGF-β.

One potential new target for Chagas' disease chemotherapy is sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51). a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in biosynthesis of membrane sterols.  Methodology/Principal Finding In a screening effort targeting Mycobacterium tuberculosis CYP51 (CYP51Mt). we previously identified the N-[4-pyridyl]-formamide moiety as a building block capable of delivering a variety of chemotypes into the CYP51 active site. In that work. the binding modes of several second generation compounds carrying this scaffold were determined by high-resolution co-crystal structures with CYP51Mt. Subsequent assays against the CYP51 orthologue in T. cruzi. CYP51Tc. demonstrated that two of the compounds tested in the earlier effort bound tightly to this enzyme. Both were tested in vitro for inhibitory effects against T. cruzi and the related protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. One of the compounds had potent. selective anti–T. cruzi activity in infected mouse macrophages. Cure of treated host cells was confirmed by prolonged incubation in the absence of the inhibiting compound. Discrimination between T. cruzi and T. brucei CYP51 by the inhibitor was largely based on the variability (phenylalanine versus isoleucine) of a single residue at a critical position in the active site.

Cysteine proteases are putative virulence factors of leishmania parasites. There are differences in the susceptibility of specific stages in different Leishmania species to cysteine protease inhibitors. Here. we establish a key role of cysteine proteases in growth. viability. and pathogenicity of Leishmania tropica by using a specific cysteine protease inhibitor (N-Pip-F-hF-VS Phenyl). Reduction or arrest of promastigote growth occurred at inhibitor concentration of 5 and 100 μM. respectively. This shows an essential role for cysteine proteases in viability and growth of L. tropica promastigotes. It confirms that the promastigote stage of L. tropica more closely resembles that of Leishmania major than that of Leishmania mexicana. which is refractory to this inhibitor.

Previous studies implicated tumour necrosis factor (TNF) as a potential mediator of macrophage recruitment and activation during schistosome infection. Here we demonstrate that signalling by TNF and its receptors can influence granuloma formation. but is ultimately dispensable for granuloma formation in this system. However. we identify a previously unrecognised role for TNF in limiting hepatocellular damage in response to schistosome eggs. Further. we show that this activity of TNF is independent of TNF receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2). Taken together. these data suggest that additional. as yet unrecognised receptors exist for TNF and that these receptors are capable of mediating important pathological effects in the liver.

Degradation by cercariae as a model for initial parasite invasion of host.,1983,JH McKerrow and WE Keene and KH Jeong and Z Werb,49,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2,195-200,,We have examined the ability of cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni to degrade a model extracellular connective tissue matrix produced by rat vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. In this model. connective tissue macromolecules are present in the interactive framework that characterizes their structure in vivo. Cercariae were stimulated to degrade the matrix by skin lipid or linoleic acid. At the maximally stimulating concentration of linoleic acid (25 micrograms/cm2). 68% of the total matrix was degraded. including 57% of the glycoprotein. 79% of the elastin. and 8% of the collagen. Degradation of the matrix and transformation of cercariae to schistosomula began within minutes of exposure to maximally stimulating concentrations of linoleic acid. Degradation continued for 24 hours and was dependent on the number of cercariae. Some degradation occurred without exogenous stimulants but at a slower rate than with skin lipid or linoleic acid. Degradation of matrix was inhibited by alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid inhibited degradation by unstimulated but not linoleic acid-stimulated cercariae. Preacetabular gland secretions collected from cercariae also degraded the matrix with an activity 86% of that of live cercariae. Preacetabular gland proteolytic activity was also inhibited by alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. soybean trypsin inhibitor. and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.

Digestion of nutrients from the host bloodstream is essential for parasite development and reproduction. A network of proteolytic enzymes (proteases) facilitates hydrolysis of host hemoglobin and serum proteins.  Methodology/Principal Findings We identified a new cathepsin L termed SmCL3 using PCR strategies based on S. mansoni EST sequence data. An ortholog is present in Schistosoma japonicum. SmCL3 was heterologously expressed as an active enzyme in the yeast. Pichia pastoris. Recombinant SmCL3 has a broad pH activity range against peptidyl substrates and is inhibited by Clan CA protease inhibitors. Consistent with a function in degrading host proteins. SmCL3 hydrolyzes serum albumin and hemoglobin. is localized to the adult gastrodermis. and is expressed mainly in those life stages infecting the mammalian host. The predominant form of SmCL3 in the parasite exists as a zymogen. which is unusual for proteases. This zymogen includes an unusually long prodomain with alpha helical secondary structure motifs. The striking specificity of SmCL3 for amino acids with large aromatic side chains (Trp and Tyr) at the P2 substrate position. as determined with positional scanning-synthetic combinatorial library. is consistent with a molecular model that shows a large and deep S2 pocket.

While these diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. there are few adequate treatments available. Sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51) in the parasite sterol biosynthesis pathway has been the focus of considerable interest as a novel drug target in Leishmania. However. its essentiality in Leishmania donovani has yet to be determined. Here. we use a dual biological and pharmacological approach to demonstrate that CYP51 is indispensable in L. donovani. We show via a facilitated knockout approach that chromosomal CYP51 genes can only be knocked out in the presence of episomal complementation and that this episome cannot be lost from the parasite even under negative selection. In addition. we treated wild-type L. donovani and CYP51-deficient strains with 4-aminopyridyl-based inhibitors designed specifically for Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51. While potency was lower than in T. cruzi. these inhibitors had increased efficacy in parasites lacking a CYP51 allele compared to complemented parasites. indicating inhibition of parasite growth via a CYP51-specific mechanism and confirming essentiality of CYP51 in L. donovani.

The newly synthesized tropoelastin monomer is highly susceptible to degradation by a number of proteinases. However. in this chapter the term elastase is reserved for those proteinases that can directly use fully cross-linked insoluble elastin as a substrate. Furthermore. an elastase must be associated with biological turnover of elastin. It should also be noted that. although most collagenases degrade only collagens. elastases will degrade nonelastin proteins. Therefore. an assay with an elastin substrate will unambiguously define an elastase but may not define the exclusive biological role of the proteinase.

Endoparasites may have evolved from ectoparasitic monogeneans of fish (Halton and Stranock. 1976; Halton. 1997). Monopisthocotylean members degrade fish skin by secreting enzymes extracorporeally. while further digestion is carried out intracellularly in cells lining a well-differentiated gut. Some polyopisthocotylean monogeneans. however. that resided within the vascularized gill chamber. took advantage of the availability of a more highly nutritious. consistent and renewable diet in the form of blood. and this represented the first major step in the evolution of endoparasitism (Halton and Stranock. 1976; Halton. 1997). This new nutritional relationship required many alterations to the parasite morphology. particularly at the interfaces of parasite and host where nutrients needed to enter. The external surfaces of endoparasitic flatworms are composed of a multifunctional syncytial tegument permeable to a variety of small organic solutes. and contain sugar and amino acid transporters for the facilitated or active uptake of these molecules and their distribution to various parasite tissues. The internal surfaces. or guts. of flatworm parasites are very well adapted to digesting host tissues. and are often lined with cells extruding long lamellae to increase the surface area for absorption. Within these cells. or gastrodermis. lies highly active machinery for synthesizing and secreting proteolytic enzymes (Dalton et al.. 2004).

By contrast. in mice deprived of T-cells and incapable of producing granulomata. egg-secreted proteins (ESP) induce acute hepatic injury and death. Previous work has shown that one such ESP. the T2 ribonuclease known as omega-1. is hepatotoxic in vivo in that specific antisera to omega-1 prevent hepatocyte damage.   Methodology/Principal Findings Using an in vitro culture system employing mouse primary hepatocytes and alanine transaminase (ALT) activity as a marker of heptocyte injury. we demonstrated that S. mansoni eggs. egg-secreted proteins (ESP). soluble-egg antigen (SEA). and omega-1 are directly hepatotoxic and in a dose-dependent manner. Depletion of omega-1 using a monoclonal antibody abolished the toxicity of pure omega-1 and diminished the toxicity in ESP and SEA by 47 and 33%. respectively.

Based mostly on data from animal models. it is currently thought that trypanosome entry into the brain occurs by initial infection of the choroid plexus and the circumventricular organs followed days to weeks later by entry into the brain parenchyma. However. Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms rapidly cross human brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and appear to be able to enter the murine brain without inflicting cerebral injury. Using a murine model and intravital brain imaging. we show that bloodstream forms of T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense enter the brain parenchyma within hours. before a significant level of microvascular inflammation is detectable. Extravascular bloodstream forms were viable as indicated by motility and cell division. and remained detectable for at least 3 days post infection suggesting the potential for parasite survival in the brain parenchyma. Vascular inflammation. as reflected by leukocyte recruitment and emigration from cortical microvessels. became apparent only with increasing parasitemia at later stages of the infection. but was not associated with neurological signs. Extravascular trypanosomes were predominantly associated with postcapillary venules suggesting that early brain infection occurs by parasite passage across the neuroimmunological blood brain barrier.

These small molecules can be used as starting points for drug discovery programs that target such mechanisms. A major challenge of the approach is the identification of the cellular targets. Here we report GNF7686. a small molecule inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi. the causative agent of Chagas disease. and identification of cytochrome b as its target. Following discovery of GNF7686 in a parasite growth inhibition high throughput screen. we were able to evolve a GNF7686-resistant culture of T. cruzi epimastigotes. Clones from this culture bore a mutation coding for a substitution of leucine by phenylalanine at amino acid position 197 in cytochrome b. Cytochrome b is a component of complex III (cytochrome bc1) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c by a mechanism that utilizes two distinct catalytic sites. QN and QP. The L197F mutation is located in the QN site and confers resistance to GNF7686 in both parasite cell growth and biochemical cytochrome b assays. Additionally. the mutant cytochrome b confers resistance to antimycin A. another QN site inhibitor. but not to strobilurin or myxothiazol. which target the QP site. GNF7686 represents a promising starting point for Chagas disease drug discovery as it potently inhibits growth of intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.15 µM. and is highly specific for T. cruzi cytochrome b.

Degradation by newly transformed and developing schistosomula.,1983,WE Keene and KH Jeong and JH McKerrow and Z Werb,49,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2,201-207,,We have studied the ability of schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni to degrade an extracellular connective tissue matrix synthesized by rat vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. Six to 12% of the total matrix was degraded by schistosomula from the time of transformation from cercariae to adult development in vitro. Most matrix degradation occurred during the first 24 hours of incubation and was dependent on the number of schistosomula and the type of medium in which they were incubated. The use of proteinase inhibitors indicated that schistosomula activity was distinctly different from that of cercariae. Newly transformed schistosomula expressed one activity that was similar in inhibition characteristics to that of cercarial preacetabular gland secretions and another activity that was unique to schistosomula. From 1 day after transformation to adulthood. the schistosomula-derived activity was the predominant activity detected. Schistosomula degraded a smaller percentage of the total matrix than did cercariae and showed a different substrate profile. Schistosomula degraded glycoprotein components of extracellular matrix but showed little or no activity against elastin or collagen. Matrix-degrading activity was also detected in schistosomula-conditioned medium. Sedimentation of the activity and lack of permeability through filter barriers suggest that the enzyme may be initially associated with membrane and then sloughed with membrane fragments. Since the schistosomula-derived activity initially overlaps with cercarial preacetabular gland proteolytic activity. the two activities may act in concert to facilitate skin penetration by newly transformed …,True,yEGRdSIAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC,42,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6876747,16724403412743275570,/scholar?cites=16724403412743275570,,,0,0,0

A putative mechanism of Auranofin action proposes that monovalent gold. Au(I). released from the drug. can bind to the redox-active dithiol group of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Au(I) binding in the active site is expected to prevent electron transfer to the downstream substrate thioredoxin (Trx). thus interfering with redox homeostasis in the parasite. To clarify the molecular mechanism of Auranofin action in more detail. we determined a series of atomic resolution X-ray structures for E. histolytica thioredoxin (EhTrx) and thioredoxin reductase (EhTrxR). the latter with and without Auranofin.

Praziquantel is employed for treatment and disease control. However. its efficacy spectrum is incomplete (less active or inactive against immature stages of the parasite) and there is a concern of drug resistance. Thus. there is a need to identify new drugs and drug targets.   Methodology/Principal Findings We show that RNA interference (RNAi) of the Schistosoma mansoni ortholog of human polo-like kinase (huPLK)1 elicits a deleterious phenotypic alteration in post-infective larvae (schistosomula or somules). Phenotypic screening and analysis of schistosomula and adult S. mansoni with small molecule inhibitors of huPLK1 identified a number of potent anti-schistosomals. Among these was a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) benzimidazole thiophene inhibitor that has completed Phase I clinical trials for treatment of solid tumor malignancies.
