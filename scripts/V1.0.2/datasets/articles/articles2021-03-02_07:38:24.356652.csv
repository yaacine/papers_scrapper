The dimensions of the rods and their speeds are similar to those of multiflagellar bacteria. The force along the rod axis. which is on the order of 10-14 N. is generated by the oxygen concentration gradient. which in turn produces an interfacial tension force that balances the drag force at steady state.

The supported zero-valent iron nanoparticles (“Ferragels”) rapidly separate and immobilize Cr(VI) and Pb(II) from aqueous solution. reducing the chromium to Cr(III) and the Pb to Pb(0) while oxidizing the Fe to goethite (α-FeOOH). The kinetics of the reduction reactions are complex and include an adsorption phase. About 10% of the iron in the material appears to be located at active surface sites. Once these sites have been saturated. the reduction process continues but at a much lower rate. which is likely limited by mass transfer.

On the bimetallic particles. the reaction occurs by nickel-catalyzed hydrodechlorination. As the iron actively corrodes. the cathodically protected nickel surface chemisorbs hydrogen ions. TCE adsorbed to the Ni surface is thus hydrogenated. This reaction competes kinetically with the evolution of molecular hydrogen. Hydrogenation of the C−Cl bond results in the formation of linear as well as branched saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. The final TCE degradation products are predominantly even-numbered …,True,NK94F4kAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,677,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm020737i,16414730403909429783,/scholar?cites=16414730403909429783,,https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mallouk-lab/files/2019/11/cm020737i.pdf,0,0,0

1093476,Perovskites by design: a toolbox of solid-state reactions,2002,Raymond E Schaak and Thomas E Mallouk,14,,4,1455-1471,American Chemical Society,In recent years. many soft-chemical reactions of layered perovskites have been reported. and they can be classified into sets of similar reactions. Simple ion-exchange and intercalation reactions replace or modify the interlayer cations of layered perovskites. and more complex metathesis reactions replace interlayer cations with cationic structural units. Topochemical condensation reactions that involve dehydration and reduction provide access to a variety of metastable structural features in three-dimensional perovskites. and similar reactions can be used to convert among higher order layered perovskite homologues. Other techniques. such as high pressure and anion intercalation/deintercalation. also yield interesting metastable phases.

The transport of Fe/C nanoparticles was studied by elution through columns packed with model soils from different regions of the USDA soil textural triangle. and was compared to that of unsupported Fe nanoparticles. The Fe/C and Fe/PAA particles form colloidal suspensions that settle very slowly (hours to days) in water. Their anionic surface charge facilitates transport through soil- and sand-packed columns.

In addition to acting as a dielectric mirror. the inverse opal photonic crystal caused a significant change in dye absorbance which depended on the position of the stop band. Absorbance was suppressed at wavelengths shorter than the stop band maximum and was enhanced at longer wavelengths. This effect arises from the slow group velocity of light in the vicinity of the stop band. and the consequent localization of light intensity in the voids (to the blue) or in the dye-sensitized TiO2 (to the red) portions of the photonic crystal. By coupling a photonic crystal to a film of TiO2 nanoparticles. the short circuit photocurrent efficiency across the visible spectrum (400−750 nm) could be increased by about 26%. relative to an ordinary dye-sensitized …,True,NK94F4kAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,627,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja034650p,3996527566508148432,/scholar?cites=3996527566508148432,,https://web.sas.upenn.edu/mallouk-lab/files/2019/11/ja034650p.pdf,0,0,0

Although there is no true finite-temperature phase transition. dirty superconducting films should display anomalous behavior below the BCS transition temperature and above an effective Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex unbinding temperature.

We discuss the Lindemann criterion. and argue that fluctuations in a flux crystal are highly anisotropic. so that an asymptotically two-dimensional melting transition is possible as the shear modulus drops toward zero for many sample geometries and field orientations. We then describe the ‘‘entangled flux liquid’’which arises at high-flux densities or thick samples. The statistical mechanics of this liquid is closely related to the physics of two-dimensional superfluids.

1093657,Fluctuations in membranes with crystalline and hexatic order,1987,DR Nelson and L Peliti,48,Journal de physique,7,1085-1092,Société française de physique,We study the interplay between crystalline (or hexatic) order and thermal fluctuations in membranes with vanishing surface tension. If the connectivity of the crystalline state is preserved. the membrane remains uncrumpled at low temperatures. When dislocations are allowed. however. screening of elastic stresses by buckling reduces dislocation energies. and promotes dislocation unbinding. When the resulting hexatic phase is stable. the stiffness associated with orientational correlations leads to a logarithmic enhancement of the bending rigidity which counteracts the thermal softening found in fluid surfaces. A finite temperature crumpling transition is predicted for crystalline membranes. and possibly for hexatic membranes as well.RésuméNous étudions les effets dûs à la coexistence de l'ordre cristallin (ou hexatique) et des fluctuations thermiques dans les membranes à tension superficielle négligeable.

Details are given of previously published results on the linear response of the film to a substrate oscillation. A key role is played by the diffusive motion of quantized vortices. which become free above the thermodynamic Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature T c but which only exist as bound pairs below T c. An analogy with a two-dimensional plasma is presented and used. Contact is made with experiments involving oscillating substrates. The nucleation of single vortices from pairs is calculated. and this process is balanced against pair recombination to calculate the rate of decay of superflow below T c.

In two dimensions. surfaces of constant negative curvature contain an irreducible density of point disclinations in a hexatic order parameter. Analogous defect lines in an icosahedral order parameter appear in three-dimensional flat space. Frustration in tetrahedral particle packings forces disclination lines into the medium in a way reminiscent of Abrikosov flux lines in a type-II superconductor and of uniformly frustrated spin-glasses.

Here. however. we observe chance effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in large microbial populations. Initially well mixed populations of two fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well defined. sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in a thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier.

We show that there is a range of polymer lengths in which the system is approximately translationally invariant. and we develop a coarse-grained description of this regime. From this description. general features of the distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore may be deduced. We also introduce a more microscopic model. This model provides a physically reasonable scenario in which. as in experiments. the polymer's speed depends sensitively on its chemical composition. and even on its orientation in the channel.

1093678,Effect of the solution refractive index on the color of gold colloids,1994,Sylvia Underwood and Paul Mulvaney,10,Langmuir,10,3427-3430,American Chemical Society,Results In Figure 1. solutions of gold sols are shown which have been prepared in water as well as a number of solvent mixtures of butyl acetate (n=1.38) and CS2 (n= 1.62). The color varies from pale red in water through to purple in the sample with the most CS2. The refractive indices of the five sols at the absorption band maxima are 1.336. 1.407. 1.481. 1.525. and 1.583. Similar color changes from red to purple to blue occur during the coalescence of gold sols. but that isnot the cause of the color changes inthis case.

In the case of latex particles. the two-dimensional structures have usually been produced by confining the concentrated dispersion between two glass plates. The samples were then examined with an optical microscope. We were interested to see whether nanosized metal particles can form ordered structures. Such structures may be useful models for electron transport across grain boundaries in metals. 6-8 In order to examine ordering in metal colloid systems. a well-defined electrostatic or steric barrier must be created at the metal particle surface to offset the large van der Waals attractive force between metal particles.(The Hamaker constants of gold and silver in …,True,BeJc50wAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,827,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/la00036a014,5945165096094755078,/scholar?cites=5945165096094755078,,https://oldwww.ippt.pan.pl/Repository/o6866.pdf,0,0,0

The film thickness is controlled by the number of dipping cycles and is measured by AFM. Each cycle results in approximately one monolayer of particles being deposited. The particle films are dense. but disordered. The optical properties of the resulting thin films have been analyzed as a function of the particle volume fraction. which is controlled through the silica shell thickness. We find that the surface plasmon peak position in films with volume fractions up to ϕ > 0.5 is accurately predicted by the Maxwell−Garnett model. The films exhibit remarkably uniform. transmitted colors and display metallic reflection at low angles of incidence. even at low volume fractions.

Solution spectra of dodecanethiolate MPCs (5.2 nm average diameter) reveal an 8-nm shift in plasmon band position as the solvent refractive index is varied from nd20 = 1.33 to 1.55. The spectral shift agrees with predictions of Mie theory when the alkanethiolate monolayer is accounted for in the calculations. Electronic charging of the MPC gold core by electrolysis. from its rest potential (−0.16 V) to +0.82 V vs a Ag quasi-reference electrode. causes a 9-nm (516 to 525 nm) shift in the surface plasmon band position.

Long-chain primary amines are found to be the most efficacious capping agents for CdSe QDs in nonpolar solvents. Primary alkylamines are superior to secondary and tertiary alkylamines. The kinetics of chemisorption and desorption in less polar solvents. such as hexane or chloroform. are temperature controlled and obey a Langmuir isotherm. Mercaptan adsorption also obeys a Langmuir isotherm. and alkylmercaptans rapidly displace amines. leading to luminescence quenching.

We find that the EGFR kinase domain can be activated by increasing its local concentration or by mutating a leucine (L834R) in the activation loop. the phosphorylation of which is not required for activation. This suggests that the kinase domain is intrinsically autoinhibited. and an intermolecular interaction promotes its activation. Using further mutational analysis and crystallography we demonstrate that the autoinhibited conformation of the EGFR kinase domain resembles that of Src and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). EGFR activation results from the formation of an asymmetric dimer in which the C-terminal lobe of one kinase domain plays a role analogous to that of cyclin in activated CDK/cyclin complexes.

1093781,Catalysis and Surface Science: What,2001,HJ Freund and M BAUMER and H KUHLENBECK,45,Advances in Catalysis: Impact of Surface Science on Catalysis,,333,Academic Press,From its beginning. surface science has largely been driven by the goal of understanding catalysis at the atomic level. with more recent work being motivated by the goals of understanding microelectronic and sensor materials and phenomena such as corrosion (1. 2). Adsorbates on metal single-crystal surfaces have been characterized with the aim of demonstrating some of the basic mechanisms of catalysis. eg. how small molecules such as H2. CO. NO. CO2. and N2 interact with structurally well-characterized surfaces. how the electronic and geometric structures of these molecules and the surface are changed as a result of the adsorbate-surface interactions. and how these interactions open pathways for reaction of the adsorbates with coadsorbed species. With the development of an arsenal of surface analytical tools. the past 35 years of surface science have witnessed major progress. although some of the early claims were unrealistic and much remains to be understood. Catalysis remains a strong driving force for surface science (2). and it is vital that the catalysis and surface science communities continue to interact with the goal of eventually being united.,True,G7PIb8oAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,492,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_lLoVM16ovwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA333&dq=info:2y0A8OoIJcgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=px_SNfQ2G9&sig=7qP8P0iIn1LfkbXmSahSHMkGRxU,14421943186865794523,/scholar?cites=14421943186865794523,,,0,0,0

1093783,Photochemistry on metal nanoparticles,2006,Kazuo Watanabe and Dietrich Menzel and Niklas Nilius and Hans-Joachim Freund,106,,10,4301-4320,American Chemical Society,The photochemistry of small molecules on well-defined metal surfaces has been the subject of intense research for more than three decades. 1 This field is of interest because it rests on the superposition of two influences. On one hand. new reaction channels can become possible by electronic excitation. which are usually not accessible by thermal activation. On the other hand. compared to molecular photochemistry in the gas phase. interactions of molecules with solid substrates open unique pathways of photoexcitation and photoreaction not accessible in homogeneous reactions. This is primarily due to the fact that the bonding interactions with the substrate modify not only the ground state but also the electronically excited states of the adsorbates.

The reaction kinetics on their surfaces is known to depend sensitively on numerous structural and chemical factors including the particle size and structure. the support or the presence of poisons and promotors. At the microscopic level. however. little is known about the microscopic origin of these effects. The main reason for this lack of knowledge is the vast complexity of typical heterogeneous catalysts and several experimental difficulties related to the application of modern surface science techniques to these systems.In this review. we summarize recent attempts to overcome these difficulties. based on the application of molecular beam methods to well-defined model catalysts.

Effect of phosphorus. sodium. and calcium on arsenic sorption,2002,Euan Smith and Ravendra Naidu and AM Alston,31,Journal of Environmental Quality,2,557-563,American Society of Agronomy. Crop Science Society of America. Soil Science Society,There are more than 10000 arsenic (As) contaminated sites in Australia. The ability of soils at these contaminated sites to sorb As is highly variable and appreciable amounts of As have been recorded in the subsurface soils. The potential risk of surface and ground water contamination by As at these sites is a major environmental concern. Factors that influence adsorption capacity of soils influence the bioavailability and subsequent mobility of As in soils. In the present study we investigated the effect of PO3−4 and Na+ and Ca2+ on the sorption of AsV and AsIII by an Oxisol. a Vertisol. and two Alfisols. The presence of P (0.16 mmol L−1) greatly decreased AsV sorption by soils containing low amounts of Fe oxides (<100 mmol kg−1). indicating competitive adsorption between P and AsV for sorption sites.

1093864,Role of metal-organic complexation in metal sorption by soils,1995,Robert D Harter and Ravendra Naidu,55,,,219-263,Academic Press,This chapter focuses on the nature of interaction among trace metals in soil solution. dissolved organics in soil solution. and solid surfaces. The interaction between metal cations and dissolved polyfunctional organic compounds of low molecular weight is important because of its role in mineral-weathering and soil-forming processes and its potential role in heavy metal contamination of soil and groundwater. The chapter presents the organics and metals in the soil solution. Dissolved organics that interact with soil constituents and trace metal ions are of two major kinds: a range of low-molecular-weight organic acids—including polyphenols. simple aliphatic acids. amino acids. sugar acids. and hydroxamate siderophores; and a series of soluble humic/fulvic acids. Numerous environmental issues arise in relation to the interaction of metal ions with soluble organics.

At this timely meeting. the first devoted entirely to all types of inclusion behaviour. the unanimous opinion of the participants was that every effort should be made to draw together in print the various threads from which the rich tapestry of Inclusion Chemistry is currently being woven.As a first step in this direction. the proceedings of the conference were published in special issues of the Journal of Molecular Structure (Volume 75. Number 1. 1981) and the Polish Journal of Chemistry (Volume 56. Number 2. 1982). However. to obtain a more global modern picture of Inclusion Chemistry it was apparent that an up-to-date Comprehensive Treatise would be necessary. In view of the rapid advances being made at present. it was clear that such a work could only be produced on an acceptable timescale. and with a sufficient depth of treatment of recent work. by inviting recognized international authorities to write on their own particular fields of interest.

Despite a lack of porosity of the material. guest transport through the solid occurs readily until a thermodynamically stable structure is achieved. In order to actively facilitate this dynamic process. the host molecules undergo significant positional and/or orientational rearrangement. This transformation of the host lattice is triggered by weak van der Waals interactions between the molecular components. In order for the material to maintain its macroscopic integrity. extensive cooperativity must exist between the molecules throughout the crystal. such that rearrangement can occur in a well-orchestrated fashion.

1093967,The behaviour of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in bisulfite sequencing,2010,Yun Huang and William A Pastor and Yinghua Shen and Mamta Tahiliani and David R Liu and Anjana Rao,5,PloS one,1,e8888,Public Library of Science,Background We recently showed that enzymes of the TET family convert 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA. 5-hmC is present at high levels in embryonic stem cells and Purkinje neurons. The methylation status of cytosines is typically assessed by reaction with sodium bisulfite followed by PCR amplification. Reaction with sodium bisulfite promotes cytosine deamination. whereas 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) reacts poorly with bisulfite and is resistant to deamination. Since 5-hmC reacts with bisulfite to yield cytosine 5-methylenesulfonate (CMS). we asked how DNA containing 5-hmC behaves in bisulfite sequencing.  Methodology/Principal Findings We used synthetic oligonucleotides with different distributions of cytosine as templates for generation of DNAs containing C. 5-mC and 5-hmC. The resulting DNAs were subjected in parallel to bisulfite treatment. followed by exposure to conditions promoting cytosine deamination. The extent of conversion of 5-hmC to CMS was estimated to be 99.7%. Sequencing of PCR products showed that neither 5-mC nor 5-hmC undergo C-to-T transitions after bisulfite treatment. confirming that these two modified cytosine species are indistinguishable by the bisulfite technique. DNA in which CMS constituted a large fraction of all bases (28/201) was much less efficiently amplified than DNA in which those bases were 5-mC or uracil (the latter produced by cytosine deamination). Using a series of primer extension experiments. we traced the inefficient amplification of CMS-containing DNA to stalling of Taq polymerase at sites of CMS modification. especially when two CMS bases were either adjacent to …,True,nxb5xhMAAAAJ:VaXvl8Fpj5cC,711,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008888,3247845083981402585,/scholar?cites=3247845083981402585,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0008888,0,0,0

1093983,A fast and robust algorithm for Bader decomposition of charge density,2006,Graeme Henkelman and Andri Arnaldsson and Hannes Jónsson,36,Computational Materials Science,3,354-360,Elsevier,An algorithm is presented for carrying out decomposition of electronic charge density into atomic contributions. As suggested by Bader [R. Bader. Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory. Oxford University Press. New York. 1990]. space is divided up into atomic regions where the dividing surfaces are at a minimum in the charge density. i.e. the gradient of the charge density is zero along the surface normal. Instead of explicitly finding and representing the dividing surfaces. which is a challenging task. our algorithm assigns each point on a regular (x. y. z) grid to one of the regions by following a steepest ascent path on the grid. The computational work required to analyze a given charge density grid is approximately 50 arithmetic operations per grid point. The work scales linearly with the number of grid points and is essentially independent of the number of atoms in the system. The algorithm is robust and insensitive to …,True,c72NG_sAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,5737,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025605001849,8222279328813983809,/scholar?cites=8222279328813983809,,,0,0,0

In the harmonic approximation to transition state theory this problem reduces to finding the set of low lying saddle points at the boundary of the potential energy basin associated with the initial state. as well as the relevant vibrational frequencies. Also. when full transition state theory calculations are carried out. it can be useful to know the location of the saddle points on the potential energy surface. A method for finding saddle points without knowledge of the final state of the transition is described.

While icosahedral ordering in ‘‘atomic’’systems is frequently ascribed to the energetic stability of icosahedral clusters. the present results show that icosahedral ordering can arise from packing constraints alone.

Both minimum-energy paths and classical dynamics trajectories were generated using density-functional theory to estimate the energy and atomic forces. In particular. the recombination of a subsurface H atom with adsorbed CH3 (methyl) or H at the surface was studied. The calculations do not show any evidence for enhanced CH4 formation as the H atom emerges from the subsurface site.

Such paths contain multiple intermediate minima connected by minimum energy paths on the energy surface emerging from the atomic interactions in the system. The challenge is to find which intermediate states to include and to construct a path going through these intermediates in such a way that the overall activation energy for the transition is minimal. In the numerical approach presented here. intermediate minima are constructed by heredity transformations of known minimum energy structures and by identifying local minima in minimum energy paths calculated using a modified version of the nudged elastic band method.

We find a surprisingly wide range of activation energies for descent of adatoms from atop islands. with the energy barriers not scaling simply with the energy of the initial and final states. Short and irregular island edges can have an order of magnitude lower descent barriers than long. straight edges. primarily due to the presence of corner atoms.

A general objective in such cases is an exploration of the high-dimensional input variable space as thoroughly as possible for its impact on observable system behavior. often with either optimization in mind or simply for achieving a better understanding of the phenomena involved. An important concern when undertaking these explorations is the number of experiments or modeling excursions necessary to effectively learn the system input → output behavior. which is typically a nonlinear relationship. Although simple logic suggests that the number of runs could grow exponentially with the number of input variables. broadscale evidence indicates that the required effort often scales far more comfortably.

Multivariate approximation is normally viewed as suffering from the curse of dimensionality as the number of sample points needed to learn the function to a sufficient accuracy increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the function.

In situ deposition of Pd in the same reaction chamber in which the sensing measurements were carried out ensured that the observed modification in behavior was due to the Pd functionalization rather than the variation in properties from one nanowire to another. Changes in the conductance in the early stages of metal deposition (i.e.. before metal percolation) indicated that the Pd nanoparticles on the nanowire surface created Schottky barrier-type junctions resulting in the formation of electron depletion regions within the nanowire. constricting the effective conduction channel and reducing the conductance.

The functional dependence of Hc on the aspect ratio fits the expression reported by Jacobs and Bean [Phys. Rev. 100. 1060 (1955)] for magnetization reversal by symmetric fanning.

Spectra were also simulated computationally. The observed and calculated near-field spectra consist of several resonances with highly location-dependent frequencies. The most highly resolved of these resonances correspond to individual surface plasmon (SP) normal modes. All of these features are only observable in the near field. Both theory and experiment also show that when excited by light in the SP region of the spectrum. the field-intensity distribution in the near field is very heterogeneous with most of the excitation concentrated in “hot spots” on the cluster surface that are strongly excitation-wavelength dependent.

One promising way of achieving this goal is by assembling colloidal inorganic nanocrystals as the novel building blocks of matter. This trend has been stimulated by significant advances in the wet-chemical syntheses of robust and easily processable nanocrystals in a wide range of sizes and shapes. The increase in the degree of structural complexity of solution-grown nanostructures appears to be one of the natural directions towards which nanoscience will increasingly orient.

A graded shell of larger band gap is grown around CdSe rods using trioctylphosphine oxide as a surfactant. Interfacial segregation is used to preferentially deposit CdS near the core. providing relaxation of the strain at the core/shell interface. The reported synthesis allows for variation of the shell thickness between one and six monolayers. on core nanorods ranging from aspect ratios of 2:1 to 10:1. After an irreversible photochemical annealing process. the core/shell nanorods have increased quantum efficiencies and are stable in air under visible or UV excitation.

Although dry O2 annealing improved saturation mobility (μsat) and subthreshold voltage swings (S). wet O2 annealing further improved them to μsat∼12cm2(Vs)−1 and S<0.12Vdecade−1 along with improvement of their uniformity. Desorption of OH-related species caused conductivity increase during thermal annealing at <310°C.

This commentary will examine the pharmacological mechanisms that underlie this selectivity. The study of steroid hormone pharmacology poses particular challenges. In viva. many steroids have pleiotropic activity. displaying a variety of effects in different tissues. Even in cell-based in vitro systems. attempts to investigate the molecular basis for steroid hormone action and the selectivity of this action are confounded by the fact that the genomic responses elicited by these ligands can be both primary and secondary (Le. cascade) responses.

1094206,Comparative QSAR analysis of estrogen receptor ligands,1999,Hua Gao and John A Katzenellenbogen and Rajni Garg and Corwin Hansch,99,,3,723-744,American Chemical Society,In recent years. the need for agents for the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers and the mechanistic toxicological studies of environmental pollutants have sparked a great deal of scientific interest and research into the chemical and biological interactions between estrogen receptors and their ligands. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and a major cause of cancer. 1 Since estrogens are known to play a role in the development and growth of many breast cancers. a logical approach for the treatment of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer is the use of antiestrogens that block the interaction of estrogens with their specific receptor. Several classes of antiestrogens have been developed for the treatment of breast cancer. but unfortunately. although the initial response of breast cancer to hormone therapy can be substantial. resistance to estrogen antagonist therapy often develops. 2. 3 Tamoxifen (Nolvadex). the antiestrogen most frequently used in breast cancer hormone therapy has mixed agonist-antagonist properties; other more recently developed antiestrogens. such as ICI 182.780. are pure antiestrogens and may prove to be more effective in breast cancer treatment. 4 Antiestrogens are also being studied as agents to prevent breast cancer in women at high risk. 5 Estrogens are also widely prescribed in menopausal women as hormone replacement therapy to maintain bone mineral density and preserve cardiovascular health.

We found that various molecular metal chalcogenide complexes can serve as convenient ligands for colloidal nanocrystals and nanowires. These ligands can be converted into semiconducting phases upon gentle heat treatment. generating inorganic nanocrystal solids.

Therefore. a mechanism that detects a single molecule of DNA represents the ultimate analytical tool. As a first step in the development of such a tool. we have explored using a nanometer-diameter pore. sputtered in a nanometer-thick inorganic membrane with a tightly focused electron beam. as a transducer that detects single molecules of DNA and produces an electrical signature of the structure.

BACKGROUNDHemoproteins participate in a wide variety of reactions. Some hemoproteins. such as the microsomal cytochrome b5 and the mitochondrial cytochromes b. c and c~ are electron transfer enzymes. They do not readily autoxidize when in the reduced form but instead function as an intermediary transferring electrons to another acceptor. These cytochromes do not have a reversible heme ligand and thus do not normally combine with such ligands as azide. oxygen. carbon monoxide or cyanide. Other hemoproteins. such as hemoglobin and myoglobin are fairly stable in the reduced (ferrous) form. They bind carbon monoxide or oxygen in easily reversible combinations. usually releasing the ligands without any redox change in the hemoprotein.

The limited chemical and oxidative stability of established COF linkages. such as boroxines and boronate esters. precludes these applications. and no 2D COF has demonstrated reversible redox behavior. Here we describe a β-ketoenamine-linked 2D COF that exhibits reversible electrochemical processes of its anthraquinone subunits. excellent chemical stability to a strongly acidic electrolyte. and one of the highest surface areas of the imine- or enamine-linked 2D COFs.

The first is the structure of the PLA2 from the venom of the Chinese cobra (Naja naja atra) in a complex with a phosphonate transition-state analogue. This enzyme is typical of a large. well-studied homologous family of PLA2S. The second is a similar complex with the evolutionarily distant bee-venom PLA2. The third structure is the uninhibited PLA2 from Chinese cobra venom. Despite the different molecular architectures of the cobra and bee-venom PLA2s. the transition-state analogue interacts in a nearly identical way with the catalytic machinery of both enzymes.

The enzyme phospholipase A2 is a well studied interfacial enzyme. and a discussion of its behavior at interfaces is the topic of this review. Knowledge gained from studies of phospholipases A2 can be applied toward the quantitative analysis of other interfacial enzymes. The kinetic analysis of these enzymes is greatly simplified if one establishes certain experimental conditions that limit the exchange of enzyme and substrate beM tween different substrate aggregates. With such constraints. the kinetics can be  nalyzed in terms of classical Michaelis-Menten theory adopted for the action of enzymes at interfaces.

1094412,The Collage of SN2 Reactivity Patterns: A State Correlation Diagram Model,2009,Sason S SHAIK,15,Progress in physical organic chemistry,,197,Wiley-Interscience,There is a continuing search in physical organic chemistry for models which can pattern the chemical data and thereby broaden our understanding of reactivity phenomena. This quest for understanding has led to the development of concepts and models which now constitute cornerstones in our chemical education (I-8). Indeed. many of these concepts have seemed for a long time to have sovereignty over much of the known reactivity patterns. With time. however. it has gradually become evident that some of these concepts like the Bell—Evans—Polanyi (BEP) principle (l—3). the Hammond—Lefﬂer postulates (5a. b) and the reactivity selectivity principle (RSP)(5c~ h) must at least be revised (Se. f; 9. 10) to account for the experimental findings within their own domains. Despite the sometimes harsh criticism (5e. f; l0a) there has always been a general feeling that rather than being abandoned. these concepts should be refined and their rigorous nucleus must be retrieved so that they may join the body of chemical concepts.In parallel to the development of these physical organic concepts (I-8). theoretical organic chemistry (II) has emerged as an independent scientific discipline that has anchored many of its predictions on more rigorously defined bonding concepts.

TSR is used to reconcile the dilemma of the consensus ‘rebound mechanism’ of alkane hydroxylation. which emerged from experimental studies of ultra-fast radical clocks. The dilemma. stated succinctly as ‘radicals are both present and absent and the rebound mechanism is both right and wrong’. is simply understood once one is cognizant that the mechanism operates by two states. one low-spin (LS) the other high-spin (HS). In both states. bond activation proceeds in a manner akin to the rebound mechanism. but the LS mechanism is effectively concerted. whereas the HS is stepwise with incursion of radical intermediates.,True,00k1P-YAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,315,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593102003630,6450289926312600454,/scholar?cites=6450289926312600454,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47606088/s1367-5931_2802_2900363-020160728-5250-1l82hcz.pdf,0,0,0

The phenomenon of two states of different multiplicities that determine the minimum‐energy pathway of a reaction is classified as two‐state reactivity (TSR). As an example. the ion/molecule reactions of ‘bare’ transition‐metal‐monoxide cations with dihydrogen and hydrocarbons have been analyzed in terms of the corresponding potential‐energy hypersurfaces. It turns out that. besides classical factors. such as the barrier heights. the spin‐orbit coupling factor is essential. since curve crossing between the high‐ and low‐spin states constitutes a distinct mechanistic step along the reaction coordinates. Thus. TSR may evolve as a new paradigm for describing the chemistry of coordinatively unsaturated transition‐metal complexes.

We describe a solution-phase reaction scheme that leads to the stoichiometric liberation of dihydrogen and dioxygen in consecutive thermal- and light-driven steps mediated by mononuclear. well-defined ruthenium complexes. The initial reaction of water at 25°C with a dearomatized ruthenium (II) [Ru(II)] pincer complex yields a monomeric aromatic Ru(II) hydrido-hydroxo complex that. on further reaction with water at 100°C. releases H2 and forms a cis dihydroxo complex. Irradiation of this complex in the 320-to-420–nanometer range liberates oxygen and regenerates the starting hydrido-hydroxo Ru(II) complex. probably by elimination of hydrogen peroxide. which rapidly disproportionates.

Comparison of resonance Raman spectra of heme proteins with mesoporphyrin IX analogs,1976,Thomas G Spiro and J Michael Burke,98,Journal of the American Chemical Society,18,5482-5489,American Chemical Society,Resonance Raman spectra are reported for derivatives of iron mesoporphyrin IX. chosen as analogues for the heme group in heme proteins. Attention is focused on high-frequency porphyrin ring modes which are sensitive to the conformation and electronic structure of the heme group. No protein influence on heme conformation is detectable for low-spin Fe (III) or Fe (II) derivatives nor for high-spin Fe (II) derivatives. For high-spin Fe (III) derivatives. a protein influence is detectable in hemoglobin and myoglobin. The porphyrin frequencies suggest a prophyrin conformation more characteristic of Fe (II) than Fe (III). The heme pocket apparently stabilizes the porphyrin conformation appropriate for high-spin Fe (II) and maintains it on oxidation. thereby contributing to the relatively low oxidation potentialof deoxyhemoglobin or myoglobin.

The exchange follows two mechanisms which are competitive. The determination of the pseudo-first-order rate constants for theexchange for various concentrations and temperatures allows the separation of both contributions to the exchange. In favorable cases. such as pro-pylene carbonate. it is possibleto determine the activation enthalpy and entropy for both processes. The mechanism is almost ex-clusively unimolecular in acetone. In pyridine. acetonitrile. and propylene carbonate. both mechanisms are in competition. Our results show that the unimolecular decomplexation is the product of several factors. the least of which is not the role of the solvent.

The complex series of cellular and molecular changes participating in cancer development are mediated by a diversity of endogenous and exogenous stimuli. One type of endogenous damage is that arising from intermediates of oxygen (dioxygen) reduction—oxygen-free radicals (OFR). which attacks not only the bases but also the deoxyribosyl backbone of DNA. Thanks to improvements in analytical techniques. a major achievement in the understanding of carcinogenesis in the past two decades has been the identification and quantification of various adducts of OFR with DNA. OFR are also known to attack other cellular components such as lipids. leaving behind reactive species that in turn can couple to DNA bases. Endogenous DNA lesions are genotoxic and induce mutations.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). are age-related disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal forms of specific proteins in the brain. AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Biochemical analysis of amyloid plaques revealed that the main constituent is fibrillar aggregates of a 39–42 residue peptide referred to as the amyloid-β protein (Aβ). PD is associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. One of the pathological hallmarks of PD is the presence of intracellular inclusions called Lewy bodies that consist of aggregates of the presynaptic soluble protein called α-synuclein.

1094706,Food oxidants and antioxidants: chemical. biological. and functional properties,2013,Grzegorz Bartosz,,,,,CRC press,Food antioxidants are of primary importance for the preservation of food quality during processing and storage. However. the status of food depends on a balance of antioxidants and prooxidants occurring in food. Food Oxidants and Antioxidants: Chemical. Biological. and Functional Properties provides a single-volume reference on the effects of naturally occurring and process-generated prooxidants and antioxidants on various aspects of food quality. The book begins with a general introduction to oxidation in food and then characterizes the main oxidants present in food. including enzymatic oxidants. Chapters cover oxidation potential. mechanisms of oxidation of the main food components (proteins and lipids). addition of exogenous oxidants during food processing. and the effects of physical agents such as irradiation. freeze-thawing. and high hydrostatic pressure during processing. The book also discusses the effects of oxidation on sensory characteristics of food components and analyzes how oxidation and antioxidants affect the nutritive and health-promoting features of food components. The text examines natural antioxidants in food. including lesser-known ones such as amino acids and polysaccharides. antioxidants generated in food as a result of processing. mechanisms of antioxidant activity. and measurement of antioxidant activity of food components. It explores the bioavailability of curcuminoid and carotenoids antioxidants and presents case studies on natural food antioxidants. presenting novel extraction methods for preservation of antioxidant activity.

In this paper. synthesis and characterization of the ternary copper (II) complexes of neocuproine (2. 9-dimethyl-1. 10-phenanthroline. Neo) and salicylate ligands (Sal) are reported. In addition. the crystal structures of ([Cu (H 2 O)(5-Cl-Sal)(Neo)](1).[Cu (μ-Sal)(Neo)] 2 (2). Cu 2 (μ-5-Cl-Sal)(5-Cl-HSal) 2 (Neo) 2]· EtOH (3)) were determined. In order to compare structural and biological properties of the prepared complexes. spectroscopic and biological studies were performed. Results of X-ray diffraction show that prepared complexes form three types of crystal structures in a given system: monomeric. dimeric and dinuclear complex.

The complexes 1 and 2 exhibited nuclease activity itself indicating the interaction of complexes with the DNA. It has been proposed that the enhanced destructive effect of the complexes 1 and 2 on the DNA is a result of two possible mechanisms of action:(i) the conversion of closed circular DNA (form I) to the nicked DNA (form II) caused by the copper complex itself and (ii) damage of DNA by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—products of the interaction of copper with hydrogen peroxide by means of Fenton reaction (hydroxyl radicals).

Copper meshes of various pore diameter (297. 251. 178 and 152 μm) were coated with extremely rough silicone elastomer films. Depositions of this polymer were carried out by aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition. The polymer coating rendered all meshes superhydrophobic. with static water contact angles of 152–167° depending on mesh diameter. The meshes were found to be exceptionally efficient in separating organic solvents (hexane. petroleum ether and toluene) from water. The dual-layered filtration system developed focuses on directing the transport of oil away from water with the highest efficiency.

A thermochromic window is a device that changes its reflectance and transmission properties at a specific critical temperature. At this temperature the material undergoes a semiconductor-to-metal transition—at low temperature the window will let in all of the sun's energy while above the critical temperature it will reflect the infrared portion of the sun's energy. Hence a thermochromic window could be used to significantly reduce air conditioning costs. which has consequential positive benefit in reducing electricity consumption and hence green house gas emissions.

Light shining on a crystal is first absorbed and the energy is then transported by the dye molecules inside the tubes to the desired part. Data on crystals in the size range of 30 nm up to 3000 nm are reported. The synthesis principle we are using is based on the fact that molecules can diffuse into individual channels. This means that given the appropriate conditions. they can also leave the zeolite by the same way. In some cases. however. it is desirable to block their way out. for stability reasons.

Powder neutron diffraction data from 10 to 450 K shows an essentially linear decrease in cell volume as a function of temperature. The intrinsic linear coefficient of thermal expansion from this data is −2.2×10−6K−1. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion measured on a ceramic bar of Sc2(WO4)3can be as negative as −11×10−6K−1due to microstructure changes as a function of temperature. Rietveld refinement as a function of temperature suggests that the intrinsic negative thermal expansion can be related to transverse vibrations of bridging oxygen atoms in the structure. The anharmonic nature of these vibrations leads to a coupled tilting of the quasi-rigid framework polyhedra.

Many gene promoter G-quadruplexes have physicochemical properties and structural characteristics that might make them druggable. and their structural diversity suggests that a high degree of selectivity might be possible.

These sequence motifs are located in telomeres as a repeated unit. and elsewhere in the genome. where their function is currently unknown. It has been proposed that G-quadruplexes may be directly involved in gene regulation at the level of transcription. In support of this hypothesis. we show that the promoter regions (1 kb upstream of the transcription start site TSS) of genes are significantly enriched in quadruplex motifs relative to the rest of the genome. with >40% of human gene promoters containing one or more quadruplex motif. Furthermore. these promoter quadruplexes strongly associate with nuclease hypersensitive sites identified throughout the genome via biochemical measurement.

We introduce oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-Seq). the first method for quantitative mapping of 5hmC in genomic DNA at single-nucleotide resolution. Selective chemical oxidation of 5hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) enables bisulfite conversion of 5fC to uracil. We demonstrate the utility of oxBS-Seq to map and quantify 5hmC at CpG islands (CGIs) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and identify 800 5hmC-containing CGIs that have on average 3.3% hydroxymethylation. High levels of 5hmC were found in CGIs associated with transcriptional regulators and in long interspersed nuclear elements. suggesting that these regions might undergo epigenetic reprogramming in ES cells.

The information for post-transcriptional regulation can lie within the sequence or structure of the RNA transcript and it has been proposed that G-quadruplex nucleic acid sequence motifs may regulate translation as well as transcription. Here. we have explored the incidence of G-quadruplex motifs in and around the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA. We observed a significant strand asymmetry. consistent with a general depletion of G-quadruplex-forming RNA. We also observed a positional bias in two distinct regions. each suggestive of a specific function. We observed an excess of G-quadruplex motifs towards the 5′-ends of 5′-UTRs. supportive of a hypothesis linking 5′-UTR RNA G-quadruplexes to translational control.

The chemical structures of modified silicas were studied in term of solid-state 29 Si NMR spectroscopy. The crosslink density of the composites was determined by swelling measurement. The development of organic functional groups on silica surfaces treated by coupling agents led to an increase in the crosslink density of the composites. resulting in increasing final thermal stability of the composites. The composites treated by MPS showed the superior crosslink density and thermal stability in these systems.

The physicochemical and mechanical interfacial properties of the DGEBA/ECO blends were investigated. As a result. the thermal stability of the cured epoxy blends showed a maximum value in the presence of 10 wt.‐% ECO content. which was attributed to the excellent network structure in the DGEBA/ECO blends. The storage modulus and glass transition temperature of the blends were lower than those of neat epoxy resins. The mechanical interfacial properties of the cured specimens were significantly increased with increasing the ECO content.

Extension or movement of mitochondria into dendritic protrusions correlates with the development and morphological plasticity of spines. Molecular manipulations of dynamin-like GTPases Drp1 and OPA1 that reduce dendritic mitochondria content lead to loss of synapses and dendritic spines. whereas increasing dendritic mitochondrial content or mitochondrial activity enhances the number and plasticity of spines and synapses. Thus. the dendritic distribution of mitochondria is essential and limiting for the support of synapses.

The mechanisms orchestrating these changes are not well understood. A plausible locus for the reorganization of synapse components and structure is actin. because it serves as both cytoskeleton and scaffold for synapses and exists in a dynamic equilibrium between F-actin and G-actin that is modulated bidirectionally by cellular signaling. Using a new FRET-based imaging technique to monitor F-actin/G-actin equilibrium. we show here that tetanic stimulation causes a rapid. persistent shift of actin equilibrium toward F-actin in the dendritic spines of rat hippocampal neurons.

The desolvation effects and intra‐protein interactions. which cause variations in pKa values of protein ionizable groups. are empirically related to the positions and chemical nature of the groups proximate to the pKa sites. A computer program is written to automatically predict pKa values based on these empirical relationships within a couple of seconds. Unusual pKa values at buried active sites. which are among the most interesting protein pKa values. are predicted very well with the empirical method.

Thus. various theoretical methods to determine ionization constants of residues in biological systems have been developed. One of the more widely used approaches for predicting pKa values in proteins is the PROPKA program. which provides convenient structural rationalization of the predicted pKa values without any additional calculations. The PROPKA Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a new tool for studying the pH-dependent properties of proteins such as charge and stabilization energy. It facilitates a quantitative analysis of pKa values of ionizable residues together with their structural determinants by providing a direct link between the pKa data. predicted by the PROPKA calculations. and the structure via the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) program. The GUI also calculates contributions to the pH-dependent unfolding free energy at a given pH for each ionizable group in the protein. Moreover. the PROPKA-computed pKa values or energy contributions of the ionizable residues in question can be displayed interactively. The PROPKA GUI can also be used for comparing pH-dependent properties of more than one structure at the same time. The GUI considerably extends the analysis and validation possibilities of the PROPKA approach.

The nucleation and growth of the platelets. which takes place at room temperature. is triggered by the injection of acetone in a mixture of precursors that would remain unreactive otherwise. The low growth temperature enables the control of the plate thickness. which can be precisely tuned from 3 to 5 monolayers. The strong two-dimensional confinement of the carriers at such small vertical sizes is responsible for a narrow PL. strong excitonic absorption. and a blue shift of the optical band gap by more than 0.47 eV compared to that of bulk CsPbBr3. We also show that the composition of the NPLs can be varied all the way to CsPbBr3 or CsPbI3 by anion exchange. with preservation of the size and shape of the starting particles.

We found that large polaron forms predominantly from the deformation of the PbBr3− frameworks. irrespective of the cation type.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common chronic inflammatory disease with an estimated prevalence of 0.2–1.2%(1–4). The disease typically starts during the third decade of life and has a substantial socioeconomic impact on the patient and society (5–7). Until recently. the treatment options for AS were limited. The mainstays of treatment were regular physical therapy and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)(8). In contrast. disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as well as corticosteroids. which are quite effective in some of the other chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). show only very limited or no efficacy in AS (9–11). Thus. in the past. a delayed diagnosis did not have much of an adverse consequence because of the lack of highly effective therapeutic choices. Most recently. it has been convincingly demonstrated that the tumor necrosis factor(TNF)–blocking agents infliximab and etanercept have a strong and prompt effect on almost all features of AS. such as clinical disease activity. physical function. spinal mobility. peripheral arthritis. enthesitis. and levels of acutephase reactants (12–19). In several studies of AS patients whose disease was refractory to NSAIDs and physical therapy. 50% of the patients have demonstrated at least a 50% improvement when treated with either of the two TNF-blocking compounds. It has also been shown that active juxtaarticular bony inflammation (“bone edema”). as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). can be suppressed (20. 21). and it is hoped that this kind of treatment will also favorably influence long-term outcome. including reduction or …,True,D5lVv10AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,614,http://hlab27.com/Portals/0/PDFs/21-The%20Challenge%20of%20Diagnosis%20and%20Classification%20in.pdf,17627667006991298479,/scholar?cites=17627667006991298479,,http://hlab27.com/Portals/0/PDFs/21-The%20Challenge%20of%20Diagnosis%20and%20Classification%20in.pdf,0,0,0

1094964,Cryptanalysis and security improvements of ‘two-factor user authentication in wireless sensor networks’,2010,Muhammad Khurram Khan and Khaled Alghathbar,10,Sensors,3,2450-2459,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,User authentication in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a critical security issue due to their unattended and hostile deployment in the field. Since sensor nodes are equipped with limited computing power. storage. and communication modules; authenticating remote users in such resource-constrained environments is a paramount security concern. Recently. ML Das proposed a two-factor user authentication scheme in WSNs and claimed that his scheme is secure against different kinds of attack. However. in this paper. we show that the ML Das-scheme has some critical security pitfalls and cannot be recommended for real applications. We point out that in his scheme: users cannot change/update their passwords. it does not provide mutual authentication between gateway node and sensor node. and is vulnerable to gateway node bypassing attack and privileged-insider attack. To overcome the inherent security weaknesses of the ML Das-scheme. we propose improvements and security patches that attempt to fix the susceptibilities of his scheme. The proposed security improvements can be incorporated in the ML Das-scheme for achieving a more secure and robust two-factor user authentication in WSNs.

An important aspect of many of these studies is the calculation of the electric. magnetic. and optical properties associated with the responses of a molecular electronic system to perturbations such as externally applied electromagnetic fields and nuclear magnetic and electric moments. In recent years. efficient techniques have been developed for the ab initio calculation of such properties. The molecular properties responsible for the generation of NMR spectrasthat is. the nuclear magnetic shielding constants and the indirect nuclear spinrspin coupling constantsswere identified and analyzed in terms of perturbation theory over 40 years ago by Ramsey. However. because of practical problems associated with the calculation of these properties. the early applications of ab initio methods to the study of NMR parameters were not particularly successful. In recent years. these obstacles have been overcomespartly as a result of a general improvement in ab initio techniques and computer technology. partly through the development of special methods and programs for the calculation of NMR properties.

Guided by the observed electric and magnetic fields. we represent the time‐dependent magnetospheric electric field during the SSC by an asymmetric bipolar pulse that is associated with the compression and relaxation of the Earth's magnetic field. We follow the electrons using a relativistic guiding center code. The test‐particle simulations show that electrons with energies of a few MeV at L> 6 were energized up to 40 MeV and transported to L≃ 2.5 during a fraction of their drift period. The energization process conserves the first adiabatic invariant and is enhanced due to resonance of the electron drift motion with the time‐varying electric field.

The results indicated that the adsorption is strongly dependent on pH but independent of ionic strength. A positive effect of HA/FA on Cu(II) adsorption was found at pH <7.5. whereas a negative effect was observed at pH >7.5. The adsorption isotherms can be described better by the Freundlich model than by the Langmuir model in the absence and presence of HA/FA. Adsorption isotherms of Cu(II) at higher initial HA/FA concentrations are higher than those of Cu(II) at lower FA/HA concentrations. The thermodynamic data calculated from temperature-dependent adsorption isotherms suggested that the adsorption was spontaneous and enhanced at higher temperature.

Using a model based on the standard radial diffusion equation. a prediction efficiency of 0.81 and a linear correlation of 0.90 were achieved for the years 1995–1996 for the logarithm of average daily flux. Model parameters based on the years 1995‐1996 gave a prediction efficiency and a linear correlation for the years 1995–1999 of 0.59 and 0.80. respectively. The radial diffusion equation is solved after making the diffusion coefficient a function of the solar wind velocity and interplanetary magnetic field.

This approximate analysis showed that longer and more effective decoupling “supercycles” could be constructed from primitive decoupling sequences according to an inductive “expansion procedure.” Waugh’s exact theory of periodic decoupling (II) further clarified the role of expansion procedures (12) in terms of the net rotation induced by the sequence of pulses.

First a trial pulse envelope is defined in terms of a finite Fourier series and its frequency-domain profile calculated through the Bloch equations. The result is compared with the desired target profile to give a multidimensional error surface. The method of simulated annealing is then used to find the global minimum on this surface and the result refined by standard gradient-descent optimization.

Its principal attribute is that the residual splittings on the observed resonances (usually carbon-13) are very small (less than 0.1 Hz) for a wide range of decoupler offsets (approximately −B2 < ΔB < +B2). Existing theories of broadband decoupling are used to calculate the effects of various possible instrumental imperfections on decoupling performance. It is concluded that spatial inhomogeneity of the B2 field has a perceptible influence near the extremes of the decoupler bandwidth.

Spectra of carbon-13 With the nuclear overhauser effect suppressed,1972,R Freeman and HDW Hill and R Kaptein,7,Journal of Magnetic Resonance (1969),3,327-329,Academic Press,One major impediment to the quantitative utilization of 13C NMR intensities is the largely unpredictable variation in the internuclear Overhauser enhancement factor (1) from one carbon site to the next. a consequence of the wide-band proton irradiation (2) used to simplify the r3C spectrum. This has focused attention on techniques for shortcircuiting the dipole-dipole relaxation mechanism responsible for the nuclear Overhauser effect. through addition of paramagnetic material which provides a more effective alternative relaxation path (3). Another application handicapped by the lack of knowledge of the Overhauser effect is the determination of enhancement factors in chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization experiments (4) on 13C. where the spectra of precursors and products at equilibrium are subject to the nuclear Overhauser effect. but not the transient highly polarized lines arising from free radical reactions. Paramagnetic doping would here seem to be inadvisable. It is possible to retain the spectral simplicity achieved by proton irradiation. and yet eliminate the Overhauser enhancement of 13C intensities by pulse modulation of the proton decoupler. taking advantage of the fact that the build-up of intensity is relatively slow. requiring a time of the order of the 13C spin-lattice relaxation time Tr. The effect has been demonstrated one line at a time in a frequency-sweep spectrometer (5). but is more simply realized in a pulse-excited Fourier transform instrument. where the proton irradiation is switched on just before the 90” excitation pulse for 13C. and extinguished immediately after acquisition of the free induction signal. maintaining a low …,True,4dDMfAoAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,456,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Talaat_El-Emary/post/Can_anyone_help_me_to_tell_me_any_online_website_to_check_13C_NMR_prediction/attachment/59d62e8679197b807798cb82/AS%3A354684893188107%401461574876707/download/PROTON-DECOUPLED+NMR.pdf,15325935974650589065,/scholar?cites=15325935974650589065,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Talaat_El-Emary/post/Can_anyone_help_me_to_tell_me_any_online_website_to_check_13C_NMR_prediction/attachment/59d62e8679197b807798cb82/AS%3A354684893188107%401461574876707/download/PROTON-DECOUPLED+NMR.pdf,0,0,0

For materials with the natural isotopic abundance (l%). it is sufficient to consider only pairs of interacting carbon-13 nuclei in any given molecule. so the corresponding spin systems are very simple: AX.

For example. Bodenhausen and Dobson (10) have made this the basis of methods to suppress singlet or doublet proton resonances. while Bax et al.(I 1) have used double-quantum coherence to single out signals from coupled pairs of carbon-13 spins in natural abundance while rejecting the much more intense signals from isolated carbon-13 nuclei.Multiple-quantum coherence has a characteristic dependence on the relative phases of the radiofrequency pulses used to excite and reconvert it into observable magnetization.

If the pulse envelope is rectangular. there are extensive sidelobes in the frequency-domain excitation pattern. whereas a Gaussian envelope gives a frequency-domain pattern (for the absolute-value mode) that is a slightly distorted Gaussian with no sidelobes. This affords much better selectivity. Furthermore the Gaussian pulse excites a signal with a phase angle which is almost a linear function of offset. The calculations are based on magnetization trajectories predicted by the Bloch equations. neglecting relaxation.

These “composite” pulses are built up from a small number of conventional pulses which rotate the nuclear magnetization vectors about different axes in the rotating frame. while in the intervals between pulses a limited amount of free precession may be allowed to occur. Insight into the way in which pulse imperfections are compensated is obtained by computer simulation of trajectories of families of nuclear spin “isochromats” representing a distribution of H1 intensity or resonance offset. Composite 90° pulses are suggested as a method of reducing systematic errors in spin-lattice relaxation times derived from progressive saturation or saturation-recovery experiments. and as the …,True,4dDMfAoAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,405,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022236480903273,8608120578534473940,/scholar?cites=8608120578534473940,,,0,0,0

When ω2 is set on a nondegenerate transition frequency and the rest of the spectrum recorded by sweeping the frequency of the investigating rf field. any transitions that have an energy level in common with the perturbed transition will be split into doublets.

These anomalies occur when the interval between pulses is made short in comparison with the spin-spin relaxation times. and they are associated with the establishment of a steady-state response where there are finite macroscopic transverse components of magnetization at the end of the pulse interval. The regular pulse sequence has the property of refocussing the isochromatic magnetization vectors that have been dispersed by field inhomogeneity. giving rise to a spin echo at the time of the next pulse.

The key feature of the model is that it considers the-framework and the-electrons separately and demonstrates that net favorable- interactions are actually the result of- attractions that overcome-repulsions. The calculations correlate with observations made on porphyrin- interactions both in solution and in the crystalline state. By using an idealized-atom. some general rules for predicting the geometry of favorable- interactions are derived. In particular a favorable offset or slipped geometry is predicted. These rules successfully predict the geometry of intermolecular interactions in the crystal structures of aromatic moleculesand rationalize a range of host-guest phenomena.

The advent of high-field superconducting spectrometers with computercontrolled decouplers has made the technique routine in application.

A control spectrum with the decoupler frequency offset is also acquired under the same conditions so that difference spectra and a reference spectrum can be obtained.

1095122,Ligand binding by butadiyne-linked porphyrin dimers. trimers and tetramers,1995,KM Jeremy,,"Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 1",18,2231-2245,Royal Society of Chemistry,The binding of oligopyridyl ligands to butadiyne-linked zinc porphyrin dimers. trimers and tetramers has been investigated in detail using NMR and electronic spectroscopy. Pyridine binds to zinc porphyrin monomers in CH2Cl2 solution at 300 K with binding constants of ca. 103 mol–1 dm3. while 4.4′-bipyridyl binds to the cyclic zinc porphyrin dimer with a binding constant of 1 × 109 mol–1 dm3. giving an effective molarity. or chelation factor. of 76 mol dm–3. The analogous linear dimer binds to this ligand 100 times less strongly. but adopts a similar conformation when bound. s-Tri(4-pyridyl)triazine has an affinity of ca. 1010 mol–1 dm3 for the cyclic zinc trimer. reflecting reasonably good host–guest complementarity. The affinity of 4.4′-bipyridyl for the trimer is ca. 105 mol–1 dm3. implying two-point binding accompanied by host distortion and strain which reduce the binding constant; the trimer is therefore an elastic …,True,_F3rBMgAAAAJ:zUl2_INMlC4C,211,https://pubs.rsc.org/az/content/articlehtml/1995/p1/p19950002231,17708333930584519122,/scholar?cites=17708333930584519122,,,0,0,0
