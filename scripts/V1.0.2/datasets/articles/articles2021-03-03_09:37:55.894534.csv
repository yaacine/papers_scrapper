During the Archaean era (before 2.5 Gyr ago). methanogens may have been important in regulating climate. because they could have provided sufficient amounts of the greenhouse gas methane to mitigate a severely frozen condition that could have resulted from lower solar luminosity 2 during these times. Nevertheless. no direct geological evidence has hitherto been available in support of the existence of methanogens in the Archaean period. although circumstantial evidence is available in the form of∼ 2.8-Gyr-old carbon-isotope-depleted kerogen 3.

Here we investigated the N 2 O-producing ability of a collection of 207 fungal isolates. Seventy strains producing N 2 O in pure culture were identified. They were mostly species from the order Hypocreales order—particularly Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma spp.—and to a lesser extent species from the orders Eurotiales. Sordariales and Chaetosphaeriales. The N 2 O 15 N site preference (SP) values of the fungal strains ranged from 15.8‰ to 36.7‰ and we observed a significant taxa effect. with Penicillium strains displaying lower SP values than the other fungal genera.

Although bearing a superficial resemblance to alveoli. the cause of this speckle has not been established. With a view to determining the mechanism for the formation of speckle. this paper details the results of propagation-based phase contrast experiments performed on mice lungs. together with packed glass microspheres used to emulate lung tissue. These experimental studies are compared to numerical simulations. based on wave propagation techniques. We find that speckle arises from focusing effects. with multiple alveoli acting as aberrated compound refractive lenses.

The phase-retrieval algorithm. based on the Transport-of-Intensity equation. utilizes propagation-based X-ray phase contrast images acquired at a single defocus distance for each tomographic projection. The method requires a priori knowledge of the complex refractive index for each material present in the sample. together with the total projected thickness of the object at each orientation. The requirement of only a single defocus distance per projection simplifies the experimental setup and imposes no additional dose compared to conventional tomography.

High-density micropores were observed in high-purity Al–Mg alloys. but their density and volume fraction were much lower in pure aluminum. Our results have revealed that the growth behavior of micropores is dominated by Ostwald ripening.

Although total hydrogen content is similar to that in the alloy. the ratio of hydrogen trapped in micropores is below 7% in pure aluminum. This difference is attributable to the lack of hydrogen precipitation sites in pure aluminium.

Sweden,1989,Lars E Holmer,,Fossils and Strata,,,,Phosphatic inarticulate brachiopods are easily obtainable in gre at quantities from many sequences of Lower Pal aeozoic limestones throughout the world (eg. Rowell. 1966). The majority of them may be dassified as microfos sils. because the maximum dimension is generally less than 2 mm. However. detailed studies using micropalaeonto logical techniques. such as isolation with weak acids. began only fairly recently (Bell 1946. 1948). and in many parts of the world such investigations have still not been under taken.During the Ordovician Period the inarticulate faunas reached their highest known generic diversity (Williams 1965. Fig. 150). In Sweden the Ordovician platform se quence was dominated by deposition of carbonate muds with a low ave rage rate of sedimentation (in the order of 1-5 mm per 1000 years; Lindstrom 1963;] aanusson 1973). Consequently. the total thickness of the Ordovician beds in this region is comparatively small. and phosphatic and organic microfossils are concentrated in the limestones by comparison with many other regions where the average rates of sedimentation were higher.

This interpretation is reflected in the major subdivision of the phylum into the classes Inarticulata and Articulata.

The organophosphatic shell is typically finely laminated and imprinted throughout with outwardly convex epithelial casts in the older cryptotretids. The greatest concentration of amino acids occurs in the shells of Ordovician Dictyonites but the higher level of aspartic acid/asparagine may not be related exclusively to the post-Cambrian age of the genus as the shell is uniquely 'perforate' through periodic reductions in phosphatic secretion. The quadrilobate larval dorsal valve. the interareas with delthyria and notothyria variably covered by homeodeltidia (or pseudodeltidia in some cryptotretids) and rarer homeochilidia suggest rhynchonelliform affinities as do mantle canal impressions and a musculature which included diductors implanted dorsally on the median plate within the notothyrium. Phylogenetic analysis with penecontemporaneous linguliforms and rhynchonelliforms as outgroups indicates that the paterinates are a sister group of the lingulates and consist of two subclades.

Organic petrology analysis has been conducted on these organic-rich shales in order to depict the shape of graptolite reflectance indicating surface (GRIS) and their organic maturity. Granular and non-granular graptolites have been observed in the studied sediments. and non-granular graptolites were the major graptolite species. The strong positive correlation between the maximum reflectance (Rmax) and bireflectance of graptolites indicates that the graptolites display stronger anisotropy with maturation.

Recurrent loss of pelvic appendages in sticklebacks has previously been linked to natural mutations in a pelvic enhancer that maps upstream of Pitx1. The sequence of this upstream PelA enhancer is not conserved to mammals. so we have surveyed a large region surrounding the mouse Pitx1 gene for other possible hind limb control sequences. Here we identify a new pelvic enhancer. PelB. that maps downstream rather than upstream of Pitx1. PelB drives expression in the posterior portion of the developing hind limb. and deleting the sequence from mice alters the size of several hind limb structures. PelB sequences are broadly conserved from fish to mammals. A wild stickleback population lacking the pelvis has an insertion/deletion mutation that disrupts the structure and function of PelB. suggesting that changes in this ancient enhancer contribute to evolutionary modification of pelvic appendages in nature.,True,VGtukwYAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,16,https://elifesciences.org/articles/38555,15280139570370881081,/scholar?cites=15280139570370881081,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/38555.pdf,0,0,0

The dataset included 41.678 SNPs spanning all 38 autosomes and the x-chromosome after removing SNPs that had call rates of< 90%. were heterozygous in> 60% of individuals or could not be successfully reproduced. We then assessed the data for a large number of phenotypes.Among the most interesting traits we have focused on is disproportionate dwarfism or chondrodysplasia. a defining trait for at least nineteen breeds such as the Corgi. Dachshund and Basset Hound. Multi-breed GWAS revealed a single major locus associated with the trait. Homozygosity mapping. second generation sequencing. and cDNA analysis identified a conserved. expressed retrogene that segregates exclusively with the phenotype. In an effort to find the original source of the retrogene. we sequenced a number of dog breeds as well as a set of wolves from around the world. While the retrogenes is not present in any of the wolf populations. we do find the combination of gene and haplotype necessary to create the original retrotransposition in wolves from Europe and the Middle East. This combination was not found in any of the modern dogs breeds suggesting that the original chondrodysplastic mutation predated the formation of breeds and the …,True,VGtukwYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,10,https://www.academia.edu/download/49632163/S14-03_From_trait_to_base_pairs_Parallel20161015-6663-1e5kzyc.pdf,3672258557775866589,/scholar?cites=3672258557775866589,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49632163/S14-03_From_trait_to_base_pairs_Parallel20161015-6663-1e5kzyc.pdf,0,0,0

Hstx2 modulates the extent of Prdm9-dependent meiotic arrest and harbors two additional factors responsible for intersubspecific introgression-induced oligospermia (Hstx1) and meiotic recombination rate (Meir1). To facilitate positional cloning and to overcome the recombination suppression within the 4.3 Mb encompassing the Hstx2 locus. we designed Hstx2-CRISPR and SPO11/Cas9 transgenes aimed to induce DNA double-strand breaks specifically within the Hstx2 locus.

Despite their broad range and long history of ecological observations. there are no whole-genome data available for Apodemus. hindering our ability to further exploit the genus in evolutionary and ecological genomics context. Here we present results from the double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) on 72 individuals of A. flavicollis and 10 A. sylvaticus from four populations. sampled across 500 km distance in northern Poland. Our data present clear genetic divergence of the two species. with average p-distance. based on 21377 common loci. of 1.51% and a mutation rate of 0.0011 - 0.0019 substitutions per site per million years. We provide a catalogue of 117 highly divergent loci that enable genetic differentiation of the two species in Poland and to a large degree of 20 unrelated samples from several European countries and Tunisia. We also show evidence of admixture between the three A. flavicollis populations but demonstrate that they have negligible average population structure. with largest pairwise FST<0.086.

Haplotypes and linkage are central to genetics and underpin virtually all genetic and selection analysis. And yet. genomic data often lack haplotype information. due to constraints in sequencing technologies. Here we present ""haplotagging"". a simple. low-cost linked-read sequencing technique that allows sequencing of hundreds of individuals while retaining linkage information. We apply haplotagging to construct megabase-size haplotypes for over 600 individual butterflies (Heliconius erato and H. melpomene). which form overlapping hybrid zones across an elevational gradient in Ecuador. Haplotagging identifies loci controlling distinctive high- and lowland wing colour patterns. Divergent haplotypes are found at the same major loci in both species. while chromosome rearrangements show no parallelism. Remarkably. in both species the geographic clines for the major wing pattern loci are displaced by 18 km. leading to the rise of a novel hybrid morph in the centre of the hybrid zone. We propose that shared warning signalling (Müllerian mimicry) may couple the cline shifts seen in both species. and facilitate the parallel co-emergence of a novel hybrid morph in both co-mimetic species.

With new whole-genome sequencing technologies and the explosion of data. deciphering the genomic basis of complex traits that are ecologically relevant is becoming increasingly feasible. Here we study the genomic basis of wing shape in two Neotropical butterflies that inhabit large geographical ranges. Heliconius butterflies at high elevations have been shown to generally have rounder wings than those in the lowlands. We reared over 1100 butterflies from 71 broods of H. erato and H. melpomene in common-garden conditions and show that wing aspect ratio. i.e. elongatedness. is highly heritable in both species and elevation-associated wing shape differences are maintained. Genome-wide associations with a published dataset of 666 whole genomes from across a hybrid zone. uncovered a highly polygenic basis to wing shape variation in the wild. We identify several genes that have roles in wing morphogenesis or wing shape variation in Drosophila flies. making them promising candidates for future studies. There was little evidence for molecular parallelism in the two species. with only one shared candidate gene. nor for a role of the four known colour pattern loci. except for optix in H. erato.

However. the distribution of larger CNVs in the general population remains largely unexplored. We identify large variants in ∼2500 individuals by using Illumina SNP data. with an emphasis on “hotspots” prone to recurrent mutations. We find variants larger than 500 kb in 5%–10% of individuals and variants greater than 1 Mb in 1%–2%. In contrast to previous studies. we find limited evidence for stratification of CNVs in geographically distinct human populations. Importantly. our sample size permits a robust distinction between truly rare and polymorphic but low-frequency copy number variation. We find that a significant fraction of individual CNVs larger than 100 kb are rare and that both gene density and size are strongly anticorrelated with allele frequency.

A missense mutation. I304N. has been found to result in an unusually severe phenotype. We show here that normal FMRP associates with elongating polyribosomes via large mRNP particles. Despite normal expression and cytoplasmic mRNA association. the I304N FMRP is incorporated into abnormal mRNP particles that are not associated with polyribosomes. These data indicate that association of FMRP with polyribosomes must be functionally important and imply that the mechanism of the severe phenotype in the I304N patient lies in the sequestration of bound mRNAs in nontranslatable mRNP particles.

We found evidence for DNA loss from large-scale rearrangements. but most of the difference in genome size can be attributed to hundreds of thousands of small deletions. mostly in noncoding DNA and transposons. Analysis of deletions and insertions still segregating in A. thaliana indicates that the process of DNA loss is ongoing. suggesting pervasive selection for a smaller genome.

The project initially used a random strategy to select clones from a large number of cDNA libraries from diverse tissues. Candidate clones were chosen based on 5′-EST sequences. and then fully sequenced to high accuracy and analyzed by algorithms developed for this project. Currently. more than 11.000 human and 10.000 mouse genes are represented in MGC by at least one clone with a full ORF. The random selection approach is now reaching a saturation point. and a transition to protocols targeted at the missing transcripts is now required to complete the mouse and human collections. Comparison of the sequence of the MGC clones to reference genome sequences reveals that most cDNA clones are of very high sequence quality. although it is likely that some cDNAs may carry missense variants as a consequence of experimental artifact. such as PCR. cloning. or reverse transcriptase errors.

1128334,The ecology of adaptive radiation,2000,Dolph Schluter,,,,,OUP Oxford,Adaptive radiation is the evolution of diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage. It can cause a single ancestral species to differentiate into an impressively vast array of species inhabiting a variety of environments. Much of life's diversity has arisen during adaptive radiations. Some of the most famous recent examples include the East African cichlid fishes. the Hawaiian silverswords. and of course. Darwin's Gal--aacute--; pagos finches.. This book evaluates the causes of adaptive radiation. It focuses on the'ecological'theory of adaptive radiation. a body of ideas that began with Darwin and was developed through the early part of the 20th Century. This theory proposes that phenotypic divergence and speciation in adaptive radiation are caused ultimately by divergent natural selection arising from differences in environment and competition between species. In The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation the author re-evaluates the ecological theory. along with its most significant extensions and challenges. in the light of all the recent evidence.

These alternative sources of beneficial alleles can result in different evolutionary dynamics and distinct genetic outcomes. Compared with new mutations. adaptation from standing genetic variation is likely to lead to faster evolution. the fixation of more alleles of small effect and the spread of more recessive alleles. There is potential to distinguish between adaptation from standing variation and that from new mutations by differences in the genomic signature of selection. Here we review these approaches and possible examples of adaptation from standing variation in natural populations.

Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger. allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than. and nested within. tropical taxa. and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions.

Mechanisms of speciation by selection fall into two broad categories: ecological and mutation-order. Under ecological speciation. divergence is driven by divergent natural selection between environments. whereas under mutation-order speciation. divergence occurs when different mutations arise and are fixed in separate populations adapting to similar selection pressures. Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation. trait-based assortative mating. and reproductive isolation by active selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict.

To answer this question. I focus on gmax. the multivariate direction of greatest additive genetic variance within populations. Original data on threespine sticklebacks. together with published genetic measurements from other vertebrates. show that morphological differentiation between species has been biased in the direction of gmax for at least four million years. despite evidence that natural selection is the cause of differentiation. This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time.

Natural selection on a morphologically variable species of stickleback fish was contrasted in the presence and absence of a close relative. Selection was nondirectional when the target species was alone. whereas addition of the second species favored individuals most different from it morphologically and ecologically. Disproportionately severe competition between similar phenotypes indicates frequency-dependent selection. verifying a crucial element of theory of competition and character divergence. The findings help resolve outstanding debates on the ecological causes of diversification and the evolutionary consequences of competitive interactions.,True,ESm6OYYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,510,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/266/5186/798.abstract,2920437442686329831,/scholar?cites=2920437442686329831,,http://courses.bio.unc.edu/Biol258/fall03/Schluter%201994.pdf,0,0,0

Are the same genetic changes seen in cases of parallel evolution? Despite long-standing interest in these questions. they have been difficult to address. particularly in vertebrates. We have analyzed the genetic basis of natural variation in three different aspects of the skeletal armor of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus): the pattern. number. and size of the bony lateral plates. A few chromosomal regions can account for variation in all three aspects of the lateral plates. with one major locus contributing to most of the variation in lateral plate pattern and number. Genetic mapping and allelic complementation experiments show that the same major locus is responsible for the parallel evolution of armor plate reduction in two widely separated populations.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the rapid turnover of sex chromosomes. including the transposition of an existing sex-determination gene. the appearance of a new sex-determination gene on an autosome. and fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes. To better understand these evolutionary transitions. a detailed comparison of sex chromosomes between closely related species is essential. Here. we used genetic mapping and molecular cytogenetics to characterize the sex-chromosome systems of multiple stickleback species (Gasterosteidae). Previously. we demonstrated that male threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have a heteromorphic XY pair corresponding to linkage group (LG) 19. In this study. we found that the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) has a heteromorphic XY pair corresponding to LG12. In black-spotted stickleback (G. wheatlandi) males. one copy of LG12 has fused to the LG19-derived Y chromosome. giving rise to an X1X2Y sex-determination system. In contrast. neither LG12 nor LG19 is linked to sex in two other species: the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and the fourspine stickleback (Apeltes quadracus).

Because hormones mediate the dynamic regulation of suites of phenotypic traits [2. 3. 4]. evolutionary changes in hormonal signaling pathways might contribute to adaptation to new environments. Here we report changes in the thyroid hormone signaling pathway in stream-resident ecotypes of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). which have repeatedly evolved from ancestral marine ecotypes [5. 6. 7. 8]. Stream-resident fish exhibit a lower plasma concentration of thyroid hormone and a lower metabolic rate. which is likely adaptive for permanent residency in small streams. The thyroid-stimulating hormone-β2 (TSHβ2) gene exhibited significantly lower mRNA expression in pituitary glands of stream-resident sticklebacks relative to marine sticklebacks.

Such rapid turnover of sex chromosomes can occur by several mechanisms. including fusions between an existing sex chromosome and an autosome. These fusions can result in a multiple sex chromosome system. where a species has both an ancestral and a neo-sex chromosome. Although this type of multiple sex chromosome system has been found in many fishes. little is known about the mechanisms that select for the formation of neo-sex chromosomes. or the role of neo-sex chromosomes in phenotypic evolution and speciation.

We addressed this problem by testing for selection against naturally occurring hybrids in two sympatric species pairs of benthic and limnetic threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). If post‐zygotic isolation is a significant reproductive barrier. the relative frequency of hybrids within a population should decline significantly across the life‐cycle.

Given its widespread occurrence. it is likely that cerebral lateralization confers a fitness advantage. It has been hypothesized that this advantage takes the form of enhanced cognitive function. potentially via a dual processing mechanism whereby each hemisphere can be used to process specific types of information without contralateral interference. Here. we examined the influence of lateralization on problem solving by Australian parrots. The first task. a pebble-seed discrimination test. was designed for small parrot species that feed predominately on small seeds. which do not require any significant manipulation with the foot prior to ingestion.

Despite a high degree of conformity in the development of lateralization among the tetrapods. some variation exists. The mechanisms underlying this variation remain largely unresolved. We exposed fish from regions of high and low predation pressure to a series of visual experiences. including viewing an empty compartment. a novel object and a live predator. Fish from each region differed in their preferential use of each eye to view the scenes. For example. fish from high predation regions viewed a live predator by using their right eye. whereas fish from low predation sites showed no eye preference.

A huge amount of variation was observed in dispersal tendency between shoals. Surprisingly. no significant correlations were found between group exploratory behavior and average group personality scores. which suggests that the movement of the shoal was not generated by group conformity. However. our analysis revealed correlations between group exploration and the activity score of the least active member of a group and the sociality index of the most social member of a group.

This collection of essays on learning in fishes is timely for at least two reasons. First. it is now over 10 years since the last substantive survey of the role of learning in fish behaviour (Kieffer and Colgan 1992) had been conducted. and the intervening period has witnessed a relative explosion of interest in this topic. James Kieffer and Patrick Colgan. in writing their comprehensive review. were able to draw on some 70 published papers on fish learning. a substantive advance on earlier reviews by Thorpe (1963) and Gleitman and Rozin (1971). In comparison. the articles in this special edition collectively refer to well over 500 such papers. the majority of them being published in the last few years. Both the sheer number of articles and the breadth of the research addressed leaves summarising what is now known about learning in fishes beyond the scope of a single paper. and a challenge that would tax all but the most wide-ranging of authors. Whether it be a concern with the genetic. neural. physiological. psychological. behavioural. ecological or evolutionary aspects of learning. researchers from a broad range of disciplines are. at long last. giving due recognition to the fact that learning plays a critical role in the development of fish behaviour.Secondly. this escalation in interest coincides with asea change'in conceptions of the psychological and cognitive abilities of fishes.

The authors critically review the proposed evolutionary explanations for sex differences in spatial cognition and conclude that most of the hypotheses are either logically flawed or. as yet. have no substantial support. Few of the data exclusively support or exclude any current hypotheses. The hypothesis with the strongest support proposes that range size was the selection pressure that acted to increase spatial ability.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1462,71-76,The Royal Society,‘Good genes’ models of sexual selection suggest that elaborate male sexual ornaments have evolved as reliable signals of male quality because only males of high genetic viability are able to develop and maintain them. Females benefit from choosing such individuals if quality is heritable. A key prediction is that the offspring of males with elaborate mating displays will perform better than those of less elaborate males. but it has proved difficult to demonstrate such an effect independently of the effects of differences in parental investment. We tested for ‘good genes’ linked to male ornamentation in the three–spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus using in vitro fertilization to generate maternal half–siblings. which were raised without parental care.

Only very recently have neuroanatomical studies revealed that teleost fish possess similar pain-processing receptors to higher vertebrates. Research has also shown that fish neurophysiology and behaviour are altered in response to noxious stimulation. In the light of this evidence. and in combination with work illustrating the cognitive capacities of fish. it seems appropriate to respond to a recently published critique (Rose 2002) in which it is argued that it is not possible for fish to experience fear or pain and that. therefore. they cannot suffer. Whilst we agree with the author that fish are unlikely to perceive pain in the same way that humans do. we believe that currently available evidence indicates that fish have the capacity for pain perception and suffering. As such. it would seem timely to reflect on the implications of fish pain and suffering. and to consider what steps can be taken to ensure the welfare of the fish that we exploit.,True,PBef-lUAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,143,https://eeb.tamu.edu/files/2018/11/Braithwaite_2004.pdf,5143761788854626068,/scholar?cites=5143761788854626068,,https://eeb.tamu.edu/files/2018/11/Braithwaite_2004.pdf,0,0,0

A strong correlation between the two assays was revealed such that fish that emerged from shelter sooner were also more likely to approach a novel object. This is indicative of a boldness personality axis acting across both behavioural contexts. Fish from high‐predation areas were bolder than those from low‐predation areas and males were bolder than females.

Noxious stimulation of these nociceptors—specialised pain receptors—in the skin around the snout of fish generates neural activity that can be electrophysiologically recorded. and induces a number of behavioural and physiological changes. To determine whether changes in behaviour are more than simple responses to the noxious stimulation it is necessary to demonstrate that higher order cognitive processes such as mental state or ‘affective state’are involved.

It is widely distributed in boreal and temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and inhabits coastal marine waters. brackish waters. and a wide array of freshwater habitats. Its broad geographical and ecological distribution and the fragmentation of its gene pool into many thousands of isolated or semiisolated demes in freshwater habitats have generated an extraordinary range of phenotypic diversity. In some instances. divergent populations have acquired the isolating mechanisms that characterize biological species. This phenotypic diversity offers an exceptional opportunity for analysis of evolu-tionary mechanisms.The highly ritualized behaviour of the threespine stickleback has also established it as a frequent subject for behavioural research.

A classic example of repeated evolution is the loss of pelvic hindfins in stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Repeated pelvic loss maps to recurrent deletions of a pelvic enhancer of the Pitx1 gene. Here. we identify molecular features contributing to these recurrent deletions. Pitx1 enhancer sequences form alternative DNA structures in vitro and increase double-strand breaks and deletions in vivo. Enhancer mutability depends on DNA replication direction and is caused by TG-dinucleotide repeats. Modeling shows that elevated mutation rates can influence evolution under demographic conditions relevant for sticklebacks and humans. DNA fragility may thus help explain why the same loci are often used repeatedly during parallel adaptive evolution.,True,fIHqeBEAAAAJ:eflP2zaiRacC,78,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6422/81.abstract,3562838935751893090,/scholar?cites=3562838935751893090,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6677656/,0,0,0

Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution. recent DNA‐based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples.

1128465,Quantification of damage in DNA recovered from highly degraded samples–a case study on DNA in faeces,2006,Bruce E Deagle and J Paige Eveson and Simon N Jarman,3,Frontiers in zoology,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Poorly preserved biological tissues have become an important source of DNA for a wide range of zoological studies. Measuring the quality of DNA obtained from these samples is often desired; however. there are no widely used techniques available for quantifying damage in highly degraded DNA samples. We present a general method that can be used to determine the frequency of polymerase blocking DNA damage in specific gene-regions in such samples. The approach uses quantitative PCR to measure the amount of DNA present at several fragment sizes within a sample. According to a model of random degradation the amount of available template will decline exponentially with increasing fragment size in damaged samples. and the frequency of DNA damage (λ) can be estimated by determining the rate of decline. The method is illustrated through the analysis of DNA extracted from sea lion faecal samples. Faeces contain a complex mixture of DNA from several sources and different components are expected to be differentially degraded. We estimated the frequency of DNA damage in both predator and prey DNA within individual faecal samples. The distribution of fragment lengths for each target fit well with the assumption of a random degradation process and. in keeping with our expectations. the estimated frequency of damage was always less in predator DNA than in prey DNA within the same sample (mean λpredator = 0.0106 per nucleotide; mean λprey = 0.0176 per nucleotide).

In metabarcoding of animals. the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene is frequently used as the marker of choice because no other genetic region can be found in taxonomically verified databases with sequences covering so many taxa. However. the accuracy of metabarcoding datasets is dependent on recovery of the targeted taxa using conserved amplification primers.

We evaluate the usefulness of DNA-based faecal analysis in a dietary study on chick-rearing macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) at Heard Island. Conventional stomach-content data was also collected. allowing comparison of the approaches.Methodology/Principal FindingsPrey-specific PCR tests were used to detect dietary DNA in faecal samples and amplified prey DNA was cloned and sequenced. Of the 88 faecal samples collected. 39 contained detectable DNA from one or more of the prey groups targeted with PCR tests. Euphausiid DNA was most commonly detected in the early (guard) stage of chick-rearing. and detection of DNA from the myctophid fish Krefftichthys anderssoni and amphipods became more common in samples collected in the later (crèche) stage. These trends followed those observed in the penguins' stomach contents. In euphausiid-specific clone libraries the proportion of sequences from the two dominant euphausiid prey species (Euphausia vallentini and Thysanoessa macrura) changed over the sampling period; again. this reflected the trend in the stomach content data. Analysis of prey sequences in universal clone libraries revealed a higher diversity of fish prey than identified in the stomachs. but non-fish prey were not well represented.Conclusions/SignificanceThe present study is one of the first to examine the full breadth of a predator's diet using DNA-based faecal analysis.

The diet of this species is generally studied by visual analysis of stomach contents; or ratios of isotopes of carbon and nitrogen incorporated into the penguin from its food. There are significant limitations to the information that can be gained from these methods. We evaluated population diet assessment by analysis of food DNA in scats as an alternative method for ecosystem monitoring with Adélie penguins as an indicator species. Scats were collected at four locations. three phases of the breeding cycle. and in four different years. A novel molecular diet assay and bioinformatics pipeline based on nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequencing was used to identify prey DNA in 389 scats. Analysis of the twelve population sample sets identified spatial and temporal dietary change in Adélie penguin population diet. Prey diversity was found to be greater than previously thought. Krill. fish. copepods and amphipods were the most important food groups. in general agreement with other Adélie penguin dietary studies based on hard part or stable isotope analysis. However. our DNA analysis estimated that a substantial portion of the diet was gelatinous groups such as jellyfish and comb jellies. A range of other prey not previously identified in the diet of this species were also discovered. The diverse prey identified by this DNA-based scat analysis confirms that the generalist feeding of Adélie penguins makes them a useful indicator species for prey community composition in the coastal zone of the Southern Ocean.

Here. we use this approach in the interior spruce (Picea glauca x P. engelmannii) hybrid complex. a group likely to suffer from high mutation load and in which hybrids exhibit local adaptation to intermediate conditions. We used PROVEAN to bioinformatically predict whether non-synonymous alleles are deleterious. based on conservation of the position and abnormality of the amino acid change. As expected. we found that predicted deleterious alleles were at lower average allele frequencies than alleles not predicted to be deleterious.

When present. asymmetrical sexual isolation may provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for the evolutionary change in mate signaling traits. In particular. Kaneshiro’s hypothesis suggests that divergence in sexual characters between populations may arise in allopatry when ‘derived’ founding populations are subject to severe population bottlenecks. accompanied by a relaxation of sexual selection relative to ‘ancestral’ source populations. In the present study. we tested predictions of asymmetrical sexual isolation between two allopatric species of Hawaiian Laupala crickets. representing ‘ancestral’ (L. makaio) and ‘derived’ (L. nigra) taxa.

1128500,The genetics of adaptation and speciation in threespine stickleback species pairs (Gasterosteus aculeatus species complex),2014,Gina Louise Conte,,,,,,Description Ecological speciation appears to be a common process by which new species arise and the genetics underlying the process can substantially affect its outcome. Replicate ‘benthic and limnetic’pairs of threespine stickleback species are an ideal system with which to study the genetics underlying ecological speciation. My first question was: what genetic mechanisms link divergent natural selection to reproductive isolation during ecological speciation? In chapter 2. I present an experiment designed to determine what genetic mechanism links divergent selection on body size to assortative mating by body size in the Paxton Lake species pair. I found that body size functions as a mate signal trait and determines female mate preference via phenotype matching. This implies that genes under divergent selection are the same as those underlying both components of assortative mating. a mechanism that should facilitate ecological speciation with gene flow. My second question was: what is the genetic architecture of adaptation during ecological speciation? In chapter 4. I used QTL mapping to discover the genetic architecture underlying a large number of parallel morphological differences in the Paxton and Priest Lake species pairs and found it to be polygenic and widespread throughout the genome in both. This suggests that many loci underlying ecologically important traits have diverged (and/or divergence has persisted) during ecological speciation despite homogenizing gene flow. My third question was: how predictable are the genetics of adaptation during ecological speciation and in general?

1128501,The probability of genetic parallelism and convergence in,,Gina L Conte and Matthew E Arnegard and Catherine L Peichel and Dolph Schluter,,,,,,Genomic and genetic methods allow investigation of how frequently the same genes are used by different populations during adaptive evolution. yielding insights into the predictability of evolution at the genetic level. We estimated the probability of gene reuse in parallel and convergent phenotypic evolution in nature using data from published studies. The estimates are surprisingly high. with mean probabilities of 0.32 for genetic mapping studies and 0.55 for candidate gene studies. The probability declines with increasing age of the common ancestor of compared taxa. from about 0.8 for young nodes to 0.1–0.4 for the oldest nodes in our study. Probability of gene reuse is higher when populations begin from the same ancestor (genetic parallelism) than when they begin from divergent ancestors (genetic convergence). Our estimates are broadly consistent with genomic estimates of gene reuse during repeated adaptation to similar environments. but most genomic studies lack data on phenotypic traits affected. Frequent reuse of the same genes during repeated phenotypic evolution suggests that strong biases and constraints affect adaptive evolution. resulting in changes at a relatively small subset of available genes. Declines in the probability of gene reuse with increasing age suggest that these biases diverge with time.,True,mAMd_fMAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://research.fredhutch.org/content/dam/stripe/peichel/other/big/Conte_et_al_2012.pdf,,,,https://research.fredhutch.org/content/dam/stripe/peichel/other/big/Conte_et_al_2012.pdf,0,0,0

Are the same genetic changes seen in cases of parallel evolution? Despite long-standing interest in these questions. they have been difficult to address. particularly in vertebrates. We have analyzed the genetic basis of natural variation in three different aspects of the skeletal armor of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus): the pattern. number. and size of the bony lateral plates. A few chromosomal regions can account for variation in all three aspects of the lateral plates. with one major locus contributing to most of the variation in lateral plate pattern and number. Genetic mapping and allelic complementation experiments show that the same major locus is responsible for the parallel evolution of armor plate reduction in two widely separated populations.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the rapid turnover of sex chromosomes. including the transposition of an existing sex-determination gene. the appearance of a new sex-determination gene on an autosome. and fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes. To better understand these evolutionary transitions. a detailed comparison of sex chromosomes between closely related species is essential. Here. we used genetic mapping and molecular cytogenetics to characterize the sex-chromosome systems of multiple stickleback species (Gasterosteidae). Previously. we demonstrated that male threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have a heteromorphic XY pair corresponding to linkage group (LG) 19. In this study. we found that the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) has a heteromorphic XY pair corresponding to LG12. In black-spotted stickleback (G. wheatlandi) males. one copy of LG12 has fused to the LG19-derived Y chromosome. giving rise to an X1X2Y sex-determination system. In contrast. neither LG12 nor LG19 is linked to sex in two other species: the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and the fourspine stickleback (Apeltes quadracus).

Domestic pigeons have striking variation in foot feathering within a single species. providing a tractable model to investigate the molecular basis of skin appendage differences. We found that feathered feet in pigeons result from a partial transformation from hindlimb to forelimb identity mediated by cis-regulatory changes in the genes encoding the hindlimb-specific transcription factor Pitx1 and forelimb-specific transcription factor Tbx5. We also found that ectopic expression of Tbx5 is associated with foot feathers in chickens. suggesting similar molecular pathways underlie phenotypic convergence between these two species. These results show how changes in expression of regional patterning genes can generate localized changes in organ fate and morphology. and provide viable molecular mechanisms for diversity in hindlimb scale and feather distribution.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12115.001,True,eCnWWmYAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,46,https://elifesciences.org/articles/12115,15411444244605021324,/scholar?cites=15411444244605021324,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/12115.pdf,0,0,0

Regularities in evolution suggested that common functional or developmental rules governed the transforma-tion of structures. Parallelism is one such example. If different groups share a similar set of developmental mechanisms. then the parallel evolution of similar designs will be a frequent event in the history of life. Similarly. convergent adap-tations can arise from the biomechanical or kinematic demands placed by selection on different taxa. Indeed. the selective and developmental explanations for trends are not mutually exclusive.The reptilian limb offers an excellent opportunity to explore the persistence of. and mechanisms behind. morphological trends. The origin of new adaptive designs. from ﬂight to cursoriality. involves changes in the shape. proportion. and number of bones in the limb. More often than not. bones are lost during the adaptive evolution of new designs. In fact. among living amniotes. only Sphenodonand some lizards retain the ancestral phalangeal formula (Romer 1956; Hopson 1995). Reduction is a common mode of limb evolution in other groups as well. being the predominant pattern of morphological change not only in reptiles but also in salamanders. frogs. and synapsids (including mammals).

As Charles Darwin observed. the morphological differences among breeds can rise to the magnitude of variation typically observed among different species. Nevertheless. different pigeon varieties are interfertile. thereby enabling forward genetic and genomic approaches to identify genes that underlie derived traits. Building on classical genetic studies of pigeon variation. recent molecular investigations find a spectrum of coding and regulatory alleles controlling derived traits. including plumage color. feather growth polarity. and limb identity.

Allele-specific expression differences in NDP indicate cis-regulatory divergence between ancestral and melanistic alleles. Sequence comparisons suggest that derived alleles originated in the speckled pigeon (Columba guinea). providing a striking example of introgression. In contrast. barless rock pigeons have an increased incidence of vision defects and. like human families with hereditary blindness. carry start-codon mutations in NDP.

Among domestic bird species. pigmentation variation in the rock pigeon (Columba livia) is particularly diverse. To determine the potential contribution of Mc1r variants to pigment diversity in pigeons. we sequenced Mc1r in a wide range of pigeon breeds and identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms. including a variant that codes for an amino acid substitution (Val85Met). In contrast to the association between Val85Met and eumelanism in other avian species. this change was associated with pheomelanism in pigeons. In vitro cAMP accumulation and protein expression assays revealed that Val85Met leads to decreased receptor function and reduced cell surface expression of the mutant protein.

1128535,Evidence that mutation is universally biased towards AT in bacteria,2010,Ruth Hershberg and Dmitri A Petrov,6,PLoS Genet,9,e1001115,Public Library of Science,Mutation is the engine that drives evolution and adaptation forward in that it generates the variation on which natural selection acts. Mutation is a random process that nevertheless occurs according to certain biases. Elucidating mutational biases and the way they vary across species and within genomes is crucial to understanding evolution and adaptation. Here we demonstrate that clonal pathogens that evolve under severely relaxed selection are uniquely suitable for studying mutational biases in bacteria. We estimate mutational patterns using sequence datasets from five such clonal pathogens belonging to four diverse bacterial clades that span most of the range of genomic nucleotide content. We demonstrate that across different types of sites and in all four clades mutation is consistently biased towards AT. This is true even in clades that have high genomic GC content. In all studied cases the mutational bias towards AT is primarily due to the high rate of C/G to T/A transitions. These results suggest that bacterial mutational biases are far less variable than previously thought. They further demonstrate that variation in nucleotide content cannot stem entirely from variation in mutational biases and that natural selection and/or a natural selection-like process such as biased gene conversion strongly affect nucleotide content.,True,Kh9REfEAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,372,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001115,12985212057547716368,/scholar?cites=12985212057547716368,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001115,0,0,0
1128536,Pervasive natural selection in the Drosophila genome?,2009,Guy Sella and Dmitri A Petrov and Molly Przeworski and Peter Andolfatto,5,,6,e1000495,Public Library of Science,Over the past four decades. the predominant view of molecular evolution saw little connection between natural selection and genome evolution. assuming that the functionally constrained fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence from Drosophila. reviewed here. suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection. and thus of functional importance. and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that. in Drosophila. adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields. from conservation genetics to bioinformatics. and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.,True,Kh9REfEAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,355,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000495,9640428511243420783,/scholar?cites=9640428511243420783,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000495,0,0,0

This variation cannot be explained by differences in organismic complexity (the C value paradox).

However. when selection pressures are highly variable along a species' range or through time adaptive alleles may persist at intermediate frequencies for long periods. So called “balanced polymorphisms” have long been understood to be an important component of standing genetic variation. yet direct evidence of the strength of balancing selection and the stability and prevalence of balanced polymorphisms has remained elusive. We hypothesized that environmental fluctuations among seasons in a North American orchard would impose temporally variable selection on Drosophila melanogaster that would drive repeatable adaptive oscillations at balanced polymorphisms. We identified hundreds of polymorphisms whose frequency oscillates among seasons and argue that these loci are subject to strong. temporally variable selection. We show that these polymorphisms respond to acute and persistent changes in climate and are associated in predictable ways with seasonally variable phenotypes. In addition. our results suggest that adaptively oscillating polymorphisms are likely millions of years old. with some possibly predating the divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Taken together. our results are consistent with a model of balancing selection wherein rapid temporal fluctuations in climate over generational time promotes adaptive genetic diversity at loci underlying polygenic variation in fitness related phenotypes.,True,Kh9REfEAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,324,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004775,2660321805112428509,/scholar?cites=2660321805112428509,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004775,0,0,0

In contrast to a hard selective sweep. in which a single adaptive haplotype rises to high population frequency. in a soft selective sweep multiple adaptive haplotypes sweep through the population simultaneously. producing distinct patterns of genetic variation in the vicinity of the adaptive site. Current statistical methods were expressly designed to detect hard sweeps and most lack power to detect soft sweeps. This is particularly unfortunate for the study of adaptation in species such as Drosophila melanogaster. where all three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft selective sweeps and where there is evidence that the effective population size relevant for recent and strong adaptation is large enough to generate soft sweeps even when adaptation requires mutation at a specific single site at a locus. Here. we develop a statistical test based on a measure of haplotype homozygosity (H12) that is capable of detecting both hard and soft sweeps with similar power. We use H12 to identify multiple genomic regions that have undergone recent and strong adaptation in a large population sample of fully sequenced Drosophila melanogaster strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). Visual inspection of the top 50 candidates reveals that in all cases multiple haplotypes are present at high frequencies. consistent with signatures of soft sweeps.

The most direct and unbiased method of studying spontaneous mutations is via mutation accumulation (MA) lines. Until recently.

This model is different from both adaptive and junk DNA models of genome size evolution in that it does not assume that genome size is maintained either by positive or stabilizing selection for the optimum genome size (as in adaptive theories) or by purifying selection against too much junk DNA (as in junk DNA theories). Instead the genome size is suggested to evolve until the loss of DNA through more frequent small deletions is equal to the rate of DNA gain through more frequent long insertions. The empirical basis for this theory is the finding of a strong correlation and of a clear power-function relationship between the rate of mutational DNA loss (per bp) through small deletions and genome size in animals. Genome size scales as a negative 1.3 power function of the deletion rate per nucleotide.

1128545,Evidence that adaptation in Drosophila is not limited by mutation at single sites,2010,Talia Karasov and Philipp W Messer and Dmitri A Petrov,6,PLoS Genet,6,e1000924,Public Library of Science,Adaptation in eukaryotes is generally assumed to be mutation-limited because of small effective population sizes. This view is difficult to reconcile. however. with the observation that adaptation to anthropogenic changes. such as the introduction of pesticides. can occur very rapidly. Here we investigate adaptation at a key insecticide resistance locus (Ace) in Drosophila melanogaster and show that multiple simple and complex resistance alleles evolved quickly and repeatedly within individual populations. Our results imply that the current effective population size of modern D. melanogaster populations is likely to be substantially larger (≥100-fold) than commonly believed. This discrepancy arises because estimates of the effective population size are generally derived from levels of standing variation and thus reveal long-term population dynamics dominated by sharp—even if infrequent—bottlenecks. The short-term effective population sizes relevant for strong adaptation. on the other hand. might be much closer to census population sizes. Adaptation in Drosophila may therefore not be limited by waiting for mutations at single sites. and complex adaptive alleles can be generated quickly without fixation of intermediate states. Adaptive events should also commonly involve the simultaneous rise in frequency of independently generated adaptive mutations. These so-called soft sweeps have very distinct effects on the linked neutral polymorphisms compared to the standard hard sweeps in mutation-limited scenarios.

In the euchromatic part of the genome. each family is present in a small number of copies (5–150 copies). with individual copies of TEs often present at very low frequencies in populations. This pattern is likely to reflect a balance between the inflow of TEs by transposition and the removal of TEs by natural selection. The nature of natural selection acting against TEs remains controversial. We provide evidence that selection against chromosome abnormalities caused by ectopic recombination limits the spread of some TEs. We also demonstrate for the first time that some TE families in the Drosophila euchromatin appear to be only marginally affected by purifying selection and contain many copies at high population frequencies.

We demonstrate that genes that have generated duplicates in the C. elegans and S. cerevisiae genomes were 25%–50% more constrained prior to duplication than the genes that failed to leave duplicates.

Here. we analyze adaptation in ~1300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9900 proteins conserved in all sequenced mammalian genomes. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins within the cellular functions they interact with and that (ii) despite this high constraint. virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories. including both immune and non-immune functions.

Although associated bacterial communities might be important for many aspects of Drosophila biology. knowledge about their diversity. composition. and factors shaping them is limited. We used 454-based sequencing of a variable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene to characterize the bacterial communities associated with wild and laboratory Drosophila isolates. In order to specifically investigate effects of food source and host species on bacterial communities. we analyzed samples from wild Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans collected from a variety of natural substrates. as well as from adults and larvae of nine laboratory-reared Drosophila species. We find no evidence for host species effects in lab-reared flies; instead. lab of origin and stochastic effects. which could influence studies of Drosophila phenotypes. are pronounced. In contrast. the natural Drosophila–associated microbiota appears to be predominantly shaped by food substrate with an additional but smaller effect of host species identity. We identify a core member of this natural microbiota that belongs to the genus Gluconobacter and is common to all wild-caught flies in this study. but absent from the laboratory. This makes it a strong candidate for being part of what could be a natural D. melanogaster and D. simulans core microbiome.

Here. we study this question by identifying for the first time the favored codons in 675 bacteria. 52 archea. and 10 fungi. We use a number of tests to show that the identified codons are indeed likely to be favored and find that across all studied organisms the identity of favored codons tracks the GC content of the genomes. Once the effect of the genomic GC content on selectively favored codon choice is taken into account. additional universal amino acid specific rules governing the identity of favored codons become apparent.

Because sex chromosomes (X and Y in male heterogametic systems. Z and W in female heterogametic systems) differ in their selective. mutational. and demographic environments. those differences provide a unique opportunity to dissect the evolutionary forces that drive chromosomal fusions. We estimate the rate at which fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes become established across the phylogenies of both fishes and squamate reptiles. Both the incidence among extant species and the establishment rate of Y-autosome fusions is much higher than for X-autosome. Z-autosome. or W-autosome fusions. Using population genetic models. we show that this pattern cannot be reconciled with many standard explanations for the spread of fusions. In particular. direct selection acting on fusions or sexually antagonistic selection cannot. on their own. account for the predominance of Y-autosome fusions. The most plausible explanation for the observed data seems to be (a) that fusions are slightly deleterious. and (b) that the mutation rate is male-biased or the reproductive sex ratio is female-biased. We identify other combinations of evolutionary forces that might in principle account for the data although they appear less likely.

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of plasma sodium concentrations under a seawater challenge experiment identified a significant QTL on chromosome 16. To identify candidate genes within this QTL. we first conducted RNA‐seq and microarray analysis on gill tissue to find ecotypic differences in gene expression that were associated with plasma Na+ levels. This resulted in the identification of ten candidate genes …,True,_HbRGj0AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,38,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13875,4893694184704105976,/scholar?cites=4893694184704105976,,,0,0,0

Previous genomic studies on young species pairs have revealed peaks of divergence and heterogeneous genomic differentiation. Yet less known is how localised peaks of differentiation progress to genome-wide divergence during the later stages of speciation in the presence of persistent gene flow. Spanning the speciation continuum. stickleback species pairs are ideal for investigating how genomic divergence builds up during speciation. However. attention has largely focused on young postglacial species pairs. with little knowledge of the genomic signatures of divergence and introgression in older stickleback systems. The Japanese stickleback species pair. composed of the Pacific Ocean three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the Japan Sea stickleback (G. nipponicus). which co-occur in the Japanese islands. is at a late stage of speciation. Divergence likely started well before the end of the last glacial period and crosses between Japan Sea females and Pacific Ocean males result in hybrid male sterility. Here we use coalescent analyses and Approximate Bayesian Computation to show that the two species split approximately 0.68–1 million years ago but that they have continued to exchange genes at a low rate throughout divergence. Population genomic data revealed that. despite gene flow. a high level of genomic differentiation is maintained across the majority of the genome.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the rapid turnover of sex chromosomes. including the transposition of an existing sex-determination gene. the appearance of a new sex-determination gene on an autosome. and fusions between sex chromosomes and autosomes. To better understand these evolutionary transitions. a detailed comparison of sex chromosomes between closely related species is essential. Here. we used genetic mapping and molecular cytogenetics to characterize the sex-chromosome systems of multiple stickleback species (Gasterosteidae). Previously. we demonstrated that male threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have a heteromorphic XY pair corresponding to linkage group (LG) 19. In this study. we found that the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) has a heteromorphic XY pair corresponding to LG12. In black-spotted stickleback (G. wheatlandi) males. one copy of LG12 has fused to the LG19-derived Y chromosome. giving rise to an X1X2Y sex-determination system. In contrast. neither LG12 nor LG19 is linked to sex in two other species: the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and the fourspine stickleback (Apeltes quadracus).

The resulting recombination maps exhibit discrete domains of high and low recombination. as in C. elegans. indicating these are a general feature of Caenorhabditis species.

To identify the types of genetic differences that might initiate speciation. it is useful to study inter-population (intra-species) hybrids that exhibit reduced fitness. In Caenorhabditis briggsae. a close relative of the nematode C. elegans. such minor genetic incompatibilities have been identified. One incompatibility between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes reduces the fitness of some hybrids. To understand the nuclear genetic architecture of this epistatic interaction. we constructed two sets of recombinant inbred lines by hybridizing two genetically diverse wild populations. In such lines. selection is able to eliminate deleterious combinations of alleles derived from the two parental populations. The genotypes of surviving hybrid lines thus reveal favorable allele combinations at loci experiencing selection. Our genotype data from the resulting lines are consistent with the interpretation that the X alleles participate in epistatic interactions with autosomes and the mitochondrial genome. We evaluate this possibility given predictions that mitochondria-X epistasis should be more prevalent than between mitochondria and autosomes. Our empirical identification of inter-genomic linkage disequilibrium supports the body of literature indicating that the accumulation of mito-nuclear genetic incompatibilities might initiate the speciation process through the generation of less-fit inter-population hybrids.,True,9s4A4kQAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,7,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00481/full,4556904528099294077,/scholar?cites=4556904528099294077,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00481/full,0,0,0

1128591,The ebb and flow of heteroplasmy during intra-species hybridization in Caenorhabditis briggsae,2019,Shadi Adineh and Joseph Ross,,bioRxiv,,623207,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Mitochondria are typically maternally inherited. In many species. this transmission pattern is produced by sperm-borne mitochondria being eliminated either from sperm before fertilization or from the embryo after fertilization. In the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae. repeatedly backcrossing hybrids to genetically diverse males can elicit paternal mitochondrial transmission. Studies of other taxa also suggest that hybridization increases paternal mitochondrial transmission. Thus. hybrid genotypes might disrupt the systems that normally prevent paternal mitochondrial transmission. Given the reliance of a number of genetic analyses on the assumption of purely maternal mitochondrial inheritance. it would be broadly valuable to learn more about the processes embryos employ to prevent sperm-borne mitochondria from persisting in offspring. as well as the circumstances under which paternal transmission might be expected to occur. To quantify the tempo of paternal mitochondrial transmission in hybrids. we assessed the presence of paternal mitotypes in replicate lines at three timepoints spanning fifteen generations. All lines exhibited paternal mitochondrial transmission. However. this heteroplasmy always then resolved to homoplasmy for the maternal mitotype. Additionally. one nuclear locus exhibited allele transmission ratio distortion that might reflect mito-nuclear co-evolution.

1128593,Predicting and classifying effects of insertion and deletion mutations on protein coding regions,2016,Joseph Ross,3,CourseSource,,,,Mutations in genes can affect the encoded proteins in multiple ways. and some of these effects are counterintuitive. As for any other knowledge. students must create their own deep understanding of the Central Dogma. Students may not develop this understanding because they have limited opportunity to practice manipulating DNA sequences and classifying their effects. Such practice can improve student appreciation for the myriad possible effects of DNA change (mutation) on amino acid sequence. In this Lesson. a series of scaffolded exercises provides this opportunity. Students first identify gene sequences from an online database. create their own insertion/deletion mutations. and predict the effects. Students then use a web-based tool to translate and observe the effect of the mutation on protein sequence. Subsequent comparison of predicted and observed effects employs the chi-square test. Discussion of results with peers involves categorizing the types of possible effects. The lesson concludes with an exercise asking students to create a mutation with an intended effect on the protein. Together. the exercises integrate quantitative reasoning and statistical analysis. information literacy. and multiple Bloom’s learning levels. Student progress is monitored using three formative and three summative assessments.,True,9s4A4kQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,1,http://zimmer.fresnostate.edu/~jross/pdfs/2016RossCourseSource.pdf,968929007541784598,/scholar?cites=968929007541784598,,http://zimmer.fresnostate.edu/~jross/pdfs/2016RossCourseSource.pdf,0,0,0

Although closely related species often have different sex-chromosome systems. it is unknown whether sex-chromosome turnover contributes to the evolution of reproductive isolation between species. Here we show that a newly evolved sex chromosome contains genes that contribute to speciation in threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We first identified a neo-sex chromosome system found only in one member of a sympatric species pair in Japan.

Although there are many examples of sex chromosome turnover. we know little about the functional roles of sex chromosome turnover in phenotypic diversification and genomic evolution. The sympatric pair of Japanese threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) provides an excellent system to address these questions: the Japan Sea species has a neo-sex chromosome system resulting from a fusion between an ancestral Y chromosome and an autosome. while the sympatric Pacific Ocean species has a simple XY sex chromosome system. Furthermore. previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping demonstrated that the Japan Sea neo-X chromosome contributes to phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation between these sympatric species. To investigate the genomic basis for the accumulation of genes important for speciation on the neo-X chromosome. we conducted whole genome sequencing of males and females of both the Japan Sea and the Pacific Ocean species. No substantial degeneration has yet occurred on the neo-Y chromosome. but the nucleotide sequence of the neo-X and the neo-Y has started to diverge. particularly at regions near the fusion. The neo-sex chromosomes also harbor an excess of genes with sex-biased expression.

Yet adaptive divergence between different environments. habitats or niches does not occur in all lineages. For example. the colonization of freshwater environments by ancestral marine species has triggered adaptive radiation and phenotypic diversification in some taxa but not in others. Studying closely related lineages differing in their ability to diversify is an excellent means of understanding the factors promoting and constraining adaptive evolution. A well-known example of the evolution of increased phenotypic diversification following freshwater colonization is the three-spined stickleback. Two closely related stickleback lineages. the Pacific Ocean and the Japan Sea occur in Japan. However. Japanese freshwater stickleback populations are derived from the Pacific Ocean lineage only. suggesting the Japan Sea lineage is unable to colonize freshwater.

However. in most examples of adaptive radiation the mechanistic basis of ecological divergence remains unclear. A classic example is seen in the young benthic and limnetic stickleback species pairs of British Columbia. In each pair the benthic species feeds on littoral macroinvertebrates whereas the limnetic feeds on pelagic zooplankton. Previous studies indicate that in both short-term feeding trials and long-term enclosure studies. benthics and limnetics exhibit enhanced performance on their own resource but fare more poorly on the other species’ resource. We examined the functional basis of ecological divergence in the stickleback species pair from Paxton Lake. BC. using biomechanical models of fish feeding applied to morphological traits. We examined the consequences of morphological differences using high speed video of feeding fish. Benthic stickleback possess morphological traits that predict high suction generation capacity. including greatly hypertrophied epaxial musculature.

Abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in 21 Swiss lakes,2015,Nadine Czekalski and Radhika Sigdel and Julia Birtel and Blake Matthews and Helmut Bürgmann,81,Environment international,,45-55,Pergamon,Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging environmental contaminants. known to be continuously discharged into the aquatic environment via human and animal waste. Freshwater aquatic environments represent potential reservoirs for ARG and potentially allow sewage-derived ARG to persist and spread in the environment. This may create increased opportunities for an eventual contact with. and gene transfer to. human and animal pathogens via the food chain or drinking water.

Niche construction theory posits that organism‐mediated modifications to the environment can change selection pressures and influence the evolutionary trajectories of natural populations. While there is broad support for this proposition in general. there is considerable uncertainty about how niche construction is related to other similar concepts in ecology and evolution. Comparative studies dealing with certain aspects of niche construction are increasingly common. but there is a troubling lack of experimental tests of the core concepts of niche construction theory.

Large differences in the size structure of prey between habitats could strengthen disruptive selection on generalist predators and lead to a divergence in trophic position among species in an adaptive radiation. Using threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in freshwater lakes as a model system. we examined whether divergence in habitat use coincides with shifts in trophic position. We examined the habitat use and trophic position of individual sticklebacks from divergent lake environments that have only one stickleback species (allopatric lakes) and from lakes that have a pair of benthic and limnetic stickleback species (sympatric lakes).

For bacterial communities. the 16S rRNA gene is the phylogenetic marker gene of choice. but most studies select only a specific region of the 16S rRNA to estimate bacterial diversity. Whereas biases derived from from DNA extraction. primer choice and PCR amplification are well documented. we here address how the choice of variable region can influence a wide range of standard ecological metrics. such as species richness. phylogenetic diversity. β-diversity and rank-abundance distributions. We have used Illumina paired-end sequencing to estimate the bacterial diversity of 20 natural lakes across Switzerland derived from three trimmed variable 16S rRNA regions (V3. V4. V5). Species richness. phylogenetic diversity. community composition. β-diversity. and rank-abundance distributions differed significantly between 16S rRNA regions. Overall. patterns of diversity quantified by the V3 and V5 regions were more similar to one another than those assessed by the V4 region.

A likely cause of macrophage death is accumulation of free cholesterol (FC) in the ER. leading to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)–induced apoptosis. Here we show that p38 MAPK signaling is necessary for CHOP induction and apoptosis. Additionally. two other signaling pathways must cooperate with p38-CHOP to effect apoptosis. One involves the type A scavenger receptor (SRA). As evidence. FC loading by non-SRA mechanisms activates p38 and CHOP. but not apoptosis unless the SRA is engaged. The other pathway involves c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)2. which is activated by cholesterol trafficking to the ER. but is independent of CHOP. Thus. FC-induced apoptosis requires cholesterol trafficking to the ER. which triggers p38-CHOP and JNK2. and …,True,YUb-nMsAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,371,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/171/1/61/51962,8566294177901144115,/scholar?cites=8566294177901144115,,https://rupress.org/jcb/article/171/1/61/51962,0,0,0

Many asymmetric traits show population bias. but little is known about the genetic and environmental sources contributing to inter-individual variance. Anatomic asymmetry has been observed in Old World monkeys. but the evidence for the direction and extent of asymmetry is equivocal and only one study has estimated the genetic contributions to inter-individual variance. In this study we characterize a range of qualitative and quantitative asymmetry measures in structural brain MRIs acquired from an extended pedigree of Old World vervet monkeys (n = 357). and implement variance component methods to estimate the proportion of trait variance attributable to genetic and environmental sources. Four of six asymmetry measures show pedigree-level bias and one of the traits has a significant heritability estimate of about 30%.

1128782,γ-MYN: a new algorithm for estimating Ka and Ks with consideration of variable substitution rates,2009,Da-Peng Wang and Hao-Lei Wan and Song Zhang and Jun Yu,4,Biology direct,,20,,Over the past two decades. there have been several approximate methods that adopt different mutation models and used for estimating nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (Ka and Ks) based on protein-coding sequences across species or even different evolutionary lineages. Among them. MYN method (a Modified version of Yang-Nielsen method) considers three major dynamic features of evolving DNA sequences–bias in transition/transversion rate. nucleotide frequency. and unequal transitional substitution but leaves out another important feature: unequal substitution rates among different sites or nucleotide positions. We incorporated a new feature for analyzing evolving DNA sequences–unequal substitution rates among different sites–into MYN method. and proposed a modified version. namely γ (gamma)-MYN. based on an assumption that the evolutionary rate at each site follows a mode of γ-distribution. We applied γ-MYN to analyze the key estimator of selective pressure ω (Ka/Ks) and other relevant parameters in comparison to two other related methods. YN and MYN. and found that neglecting the variation of substitution rates among different sites may lead to biased estimations of ω. Our new method appears to have minimal deviations when relevant parameters vary within normal ranges defined by empirical data. Our results indicate that unequal substitution rates among different sites have variable influences on ω under different evolutionary rates while both transition/transversion rate ratio and unequal nucleotide frequencies affect Ka and Ks thus selective pressure ω.

Direct,,13,,Mammalian genome sequence data are being acquired in large quantities and at enormous speeds. We now have a tremendous opportunity to better understand which genes are the most variable or conserved. and what their particular functions and evolutionary dynamics are. through comparative genomics. We chose human and eleven other high-coverage mammalian genome data–as well as an avian genome as an outgroup–to analyze orthologous protein-coding genes using nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates. After evaluating eight commonly-used methods of Ka and Ks calculation. we observed that these methods yielded a nearly uniform result when estimating Ka. but not Ks (or Ka/Ks). When sorting genes based on Ka. we noticed that fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes often belonged to different functional classes. with respect to species-specificity and lineage-specificity. In particular. we identified two functional classes of genes in the acquired immune system. Fast-evolving genes coded for signal-transducing proteins. such as receptors. ligands. cytokines. and CDs (cluster of differentiation. mostly surface proteins). whereas the slow-evolving genes were for function-modulating proteins. such as kinases and adaptor proteins. In addition. among slow-evolving genes that had functions related to the central nervous system. neurodegenerative disease-related pathways were enriched significantly in most mammalian species.

A remarkable fraction of vertebrate introns have a minimal size of about 100 bp. while majority of introns expand to several kilobases even megabases in length.  Principal Findings We carried out analyses on the evolution and function of minimal introns (50–150 bp) in human and mouse genomes. We found that minimal introns are conserved in terms of both length and sequence. They are preferentially located toward 3′ end of mRNA and non-randomly distributed among chromosomes. Both the evolutionary conservation and non-random distribution are indicative of biological relevance. We showed that genes with minimal introns have higher abundance. larger size. and tend to be universally expressed as compared to genes with only large introns and intron-less genes. Genes with minimal introns replicate earlier and preferentially reside in the vicinities of open chromatin. suggesting their unique nuclear position and potential relevance to the regulation of gene expression and transcript export.  Conclusions Based on these observations. we proposed a nuclear-export routing model. where minimal introns play a regulatory role in selectively exporting the highly abundant and large housekeeping genes that reside at the surface of chromatin territories. and thus preventing entanglement with other genes located at the interior locations.,True,6RwgxScAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,33,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010144,11081767304534835854,/scholar?cites=11081767304534835854,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010144,0,0,0

According to their origins. sequence characteristics. and ways of propagation. repetitive sequences are divided into transposable elements (TEs) and satellite sequences (SSs) as well as related subfamilies and subgroups hierarchically. The combined changes attributable to the repetitive sequences alter gene and genome architectures. such as the expansion of exonic. intronic. and intergenic sequences. and most of them propagate in a seemingly random fashion and contribute very significantly to the entire mutation spectrum of mammalian genomes.Our analysis is focused on evolutional features of TEs and SSs in the intronic sequence of twelve selected mammalian genomes.

1128791,Both size and GC-content of minimal introns are selected in human populations,2011,Dapeng Wang and Jun Yu,6,PloS one,3,e17945,Public Library of Science,Background We previously have studied the insertion and deletion polymorphism by sequencing no more than one hundred introns in a mixed human population and found that the minimal introns tended to maintain length at an optimal size. Here we analyzed re-sequenced 179 individual genomes (from African. European. and Asian populations) from the data released by the 1000 Genome Project to study the size dynamics of minimal introns.   Principal Findings We not only confirmed that minimal introns in human populations are selected but also found two major effects in minimal intron evolution: (i) Size-effect: minimal introns longer than an optimal size (87 nt) tend to have a higher ratio of deletion to insertion than those that are shorter than the optimal size; (ii) GC-effect: minimal introns with lower GC content tend to be more frequently deleted than those with higher GC content. The GC-effect results in a higher GC content in minimal introns than their flanking exons as opposed to larger introns (≥125 nt) that always have a lower GC content than that of their flanking exons. We also observed that the two effects are distinguishable but not completely separable within and between populations.   Conclusions We validated the unique mutation dynamics of minimal introns in keeping their near-optimal size and GC content. and our observations suggest potentially important functions of human minimal introns in transcript processing and gene regulation.,True,6RwgxScAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,19,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017945,1539558676790551379,/scholar?cites=1539558676790551379,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017945,0,0,0

Despite previous investigations on the features of their conservation and gene organization. the functional relationship among DPGs in a given species and lineage has not been thoroughly clarified. Here we report a network-based comprehensive analysis on human DPGs and our results indicate that the two members of the DPGs tend to participate in different biological processes while enforcing related functions as modules. Comparing to randomly paired genes as a control. the DPG pairs have a tendency to be clustered in similar “cellular components” and involved in similar “molecular functions”. The functional network bridged by DPGs consists of three major modules. The largest module includes many house-keeping genes involved in core cellular activities. This module also shows low variation in expression in both CNS (central nervous system) and non-CNS tissues.

1128803,Enrichment in conservative amino acid changes among fixed and standing missense variations in slowly evolving proteins,2020,Mingrui Wang and Dapeng Wang and Jun Yu and Shi Huang,8,PeerJ,,e9983,PeerJ Inc.,The process of molecular evolution has many elements that are not yet fully understood. Evolutionary rates are known to vary among protein coding and noncoding DNAs. and most of the observed changes in amino acid or nucleotide sequences are assumed to be non-adaptive by the neutral theory of molecular evolution. However. it remains unclear whether fixed and standing missense changes in slowly evolving proteins are more or less neutral compared to those in fast evolving genes. Here. based on the evolutionary rates as inferred from identity scores between orthologs in human and Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta). we found that the fraction of conservative substitutions between species was significantly higher in their slowly evolving proteins. Similar results were obtained by using four different methods of scoring conservative substitutions. including three that remove the impact of substitution probability. where conservative changes require fewer mutations. We also examined the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by using the 1000 Genomes Project data and found that missense SNPs in slowly evolving proteins also had a higher fraction of conservative changes. especially for common SNPs. consistent with more non-conservative substitutions and hence stronger natural selection for SNPs. particularly rare ones. in fast evolving proteins.

About 42.2% of the genome was in exact 20-nucleotide oligomer repeats. and most of the transposons were in the intergenic regions between genes. Although 80.6% of predicted Arabidopsis thaliana genes had a homolog in rice. only 49.4% of predicted rice genes had a homolog in A. thaliana.

Tested against a nonredundant collection of 19.079 full-length cDNAs. 97.7% of the genes are aligned. without fragmentation. to the mapped super-scaffolds of one or the other genome. We introduce a gene identification procedure for plants that does not rely on similarity to known genes to remove erroneous predictions resulting from transposable elements. Using the available EST data to adjust for residual errors in the predictions. the estimated gene count is at least 38.000–40.000. Only 2%–3% of the genes are unique to any one subspecies. comparable to the amount of sequence that might still be missing. Despite this lack of variation in gene content. there is enormous variation in the intergenic regions. At least a quarter of the two sequences could not be aligned. and where they could be aligned. single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates varied from as little as 3.0 SNP/kb in the coding regions to 27.6 SNP/kb in the transposable elements. A more inclusive new approach for analyzing duplication history is introduced here. It reveals an ancient whole-genome duplication. a recent segmental duplication on Chromosomes 11 and 12. and massive ongoing individual gene duplications. We find 18 distinct pairs of duplicated segments that cover 65.7% of the genome; 17 of these pairs date back to a common time before the divergence of the grasses.

However. comprehensive analyses of DNA methylation in SSA and MSI cancer have not been conducted. With an array-based methylation sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP) method we analyzed 8 tubular (TA) and 19 serrated (SSA) adenomas. and 14 carcinomas with (MSI) and 12 without (MSS) microsatellite instability. MS-AFLP array can survey relative differences in methylation between normal and tumor tissues of 9.654 DNA fragments containing all NotI sequences in the human genome. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the genome-wide hypermethylation alterations revealed no major differences between or within these groups of benign and malignant tumors regardless of their location in intergenic. intragenic. promoter. or 3′ end regions. Hypomethylation was less frequent in SSAs compared with MSI or MSS carcinomas. Analysis of variance of DNA methylation between these four subgroups identified 56 probes differentially altered.

Extensive research into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis has led to the characterization of oncogenes and tumour suppressors that are key elements in cancer growth and progression. as well as that of other important elements like microRNAs. These genes and miRNAs appear to be constitutively deregulated in cancer. To identify signatures of miRNA-mRNA interactions potentially conserved in essential cancer pathways. we have conducted an integrative analysis of transcriptomic data. also taking into account methylation and copy number alterations.

Genome–wide association studies (GWAS) are useful for identifying such genetic susceptibility factors. However. the single loci so far associated with CRC only represent a fraction of the genetic risk for CRC development in the general population. Therefore. many other genetic risk variants alone and in combination must still remain to be discovered. The aim of this work was to search for genetic risk factors for CRC. by performing single-locus and two-locus GWAS in the Spanish population.  Results A total of 801 controls and 500 CRC cases were included in the discovery GWAS dataset. 77 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s from single-locus and 243 SNPs from two-locus association analyses were selected for replication in 423 additional CRC cases and 1382 controls. In the meta-analysis. one SNP. rs3987 at 4q26. reached GWAS significant p-value (p = 4.02×10−8). and one SNP pair. rs1100508 CG and rs8111948 AA. showed a trend for two-locus association (p = 4.35×10−11). Additionally. our GWAS confirmed the previously reported association with CRC of five SNPs located at 3q36.2 (rs10936599). 8q24 (rs10505477). 8q24.21(rs6983267). 11q13.4 (rs3824999) and 14q22.2 (rs4444235).

Feeding rodents with amino acid defined and methyl-imbalanced diet decreases hepatic SAM and causes liver cancers. RIZ1 (PRDM2 or KMT8) is a tumor suppressor and functions in transcriptional repression by methylating histone H3 lysine 9. Here we show that a methyl-balanced diet conferred additional survival benefits compared to a tumor-inducing methyl-imbalanced diet only in mice with wild type RIZ1 but not in mice deficient in RIZ1.

If remain undetected. sCRC can progress to more advanced stages seriously aggravating patient prognosis. We studied the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of Japanese patients with sCRCs who underwent surgery for primary CRC and received exhaustive perioperative surveillance. We recruited 1005 patients with surgically resected CRCs between January 2007 and December 2011. The associations of clinical and pathological factors with sCRC development were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Eighty-four patients (8.4 %) developed sCRCs. 16 of them (19.0 %) harboring three or more cancers. Companion sCRCs were smaller and earlier stage than the index lesion (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis. advanced age (odds ratio (OR) 1.03 per year; P = 0.009) and left colon tumor location (OR 1.78; P = 0.013) are associated with higher risk of sCRCs. particularly in females. Overall survival did not differ between solitary CRC and sCRC (P = 0.62). Our results highlight the importance of perioperative colonoscopy examination to ensure the absence of sCRCs that. being small and early staged. are more difficult to detect.

Y2. which are responsible for the transformation of styrene into phenylacetic acid (styrene upper pathway). This novel cassette confers to phenylacetic acid-degrading bacteria the ability to grow efficiently on styrene as the sole carbon and energy source. By combining both the sty cassette and the archetypal pWW0 TOL plasmid into the well-known Pseudomonas putida F1 aromatic biodegrader. we have constructed a novel derivative strain that shows one of the largest degradative potentials so far described for aromatic hydrocarbons. because it is able to use BTEX compounds (benzene. toluene. ethylbenzene and xylenes) and styrene as a source of carbon and energy.

We identified a pericentromeric repeat element called SST1 frequently hypomethylated (> 5% demethylation compared with matched normal tissue) in several cancers. including 28 of 128 (22%) CRCs. SST1 somatic demethylation associated with genome damage. especially in tumors with wild-type TP53. Seven percent of the 128 CRCs exhibited a higher (“severe”) level of demethylation (≥ 10%) that co-occurred with TP53 mutations. SST1 demethylation correlated with distinct histone marks in CRC cell lines and primary tumors: demethylated SST1 associated with high levels of the repressive histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mark and lower levels of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Furthermore. induced demethylation of SST1 by 5-aza-dC led to increased H3K27me3 and reduced H3K9me3. Thus. in some CRCs. SST1 demethylation reflects an epigenetic reprogramming associated with changes in chromatin structure that may affect chromosomal integrity. The chromatin remodeler factor. the helicase lymphoid-specific (HELLS) enzyme. called the “epigenetic guardian of repetitive elements”. interacted with SST1 as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. and down-regulation of HELLS by shRNA resulted in demethylation of SST1 in vitro. Altogether these results suggest that HELLS contributes to SST1 methylation maintenance.

We outline a robust and innovative strategy to identify the most stably expressed control genes in a given set of tissues. and to determine the minimum number of genes required to calculate a reliable normalization factor. We have evaluated ten housekeeping genes from different abundance and functional classes in various human tissues. and demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalization leads to relatively large errors in a significant proportion of samples tested.

To better understand the ecology of these microorganisms. we investigated the relative abundance. distribution. and phylogenetic composition of Archaea in the Santa Barbara Channel. Significant amounts of archaeal rRNA and rDNA (genes coding for rRNA) were detected in all samples analyzed. The relative abundance of archaeal rRNA as measured by quantitative oligonucleotide hybridization experiments was low in surface waters but reached higher values (20 to 30% of prokaryotic rRNA) at depths below 100 m. Probes were developed for the two major groups of marine Archaea detected. rRNA originating from the euryarchaeal group (group II) was most abundant in surface waters. whereas rRNA from the crenarchaeal group (group I) dominated at …,True,89bio_EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,668,https://aem.asm.org/content/63/1/50.short,12099749685767359217,/scholar?cites=12099749685767359217,,https://aem.asm.org/content/aem/63/1/50.full.pdf,0,0,0

The average size of an inactive bacterium was 0.055 pm3 while the average size of an active bacterium was 0.12 pm3. This average size was constant even after 3 d of incubation in dialysis bags placed in situ. which increased the percentage of active bacteria in the community from 6 to ca 43%.

This recognized importance contrasts with our ignorance of the taxonomic composition of this functional group. which remains mostly unidentified by microscopical and culturing approaches. Recent molecular marine surveys based on 18S rDNA genes have retrieved many sequences unrelated to cultured organisms and marine stramenopiles were among the first reported uncultured eukaryotes.

Here we combined an extensive literature analysis with expert opinions to update publicly available estimates of major taxa in this marine ecosystem and to revise and update several species lists. We also assessed overall spatial and temporal patterns of species diversity and identified major changes and threats. Our results listed approximately 17.000 marine species occurring in the Mediterranean Sea. However. our estimates of marine diversity are still incomplete as yet—undescribed species will be added in the future. Diversity for microbes is substantially underestimated. and the deep-sea areas and portions of the southern and eastern region are still poorly known. In addition. the invasion of alien species is a crucial factor that will continue to change the biodiversity of the Mediterranean. mainly in its eastern basin that can spread rapidly northwards and westwards due to the warming of the Mediterranean Sea. Spatial patterns showed a general decrease in biodiversity from northwestern to southeastern regions following a gradient of production. with some exceptions and caution due to gaps in our knowledge of the biota along the southern and eastern rims.

The combination of simple to use bench-top flow cytometers and highly fluorescent nucleic acid stains allows fast and easy determination of microbe abundance in the plankton of lakes and oceans. The different dyes and protocols used to stain and count planktonic bacteria as well as the equipment in use are reviewed. with special attention to some of the problems encountered in daily routine practice such as fixation. staining and absolute counting. One of the main advantages of flow cytometry over epifluorescence microscopy is the ability to obtain cell-specific measurements in large numbers of cells with limited effort. We discuss how this characteristic has been used for differentiating photosynthetic from non-photosynthetic prokaryotes. for measuring bacterial cell size and nucleic acid content. and for estimating the relative activity and physiological state of each cell.

It contains the largest pool of microbes in aquatic systems. harboring nearly 75% and 50% of the prokaryotic biomass and production. respectively. of the global ocean. Genomic approaches continue to uncover the enormous and dynamic genetic variability at phylogenetic and functional levels.

These traditional methods have low spatial and temporal resolution and are relatively labour intensive per unit area/time that they cover. To implement the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). European Member States are required to improve marine monitoring and design monitoring networks. This can be achieved by developing and testing innovative and cost-effective monitoring systems. as well as indicators of environmental status. Here. we present several recently developed methodologies and technologies to improve marine biodiversity indicators and monitoring methods. The innovative tools are discussed concerning the technologies presently utilized as well as the advantages and disadvantages of their use in routine monitoring. In particular. the present analysis focuses on: (i) molecular approaches. including microarray. Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). and metagenetic (metabarcoding) tools; (ii) optical (remote) sensing and acoustic methods; and (iii) in situ monitoring instruments.

Growth enhancement by light has repeatedly been demonstrated in laboratory experiments with AAP isolates. However. the ecological advantage of light utilization is unclear. as it has never been proven in the natural environment. Here. we conducted manipulation experiments in the NW Mediterranean and found that AAP bacteria display high growth rates which are controlled to a large extent by intense grazing pressure and phosphorous availability.

However. our knowledge on how the composition of the microbial community and the different types of electron transfer to the anode affect the performance of these bioelectrochemical systems is far from complete. To fill this gap of knowledge. we designed a set of three MFCs with different constrains limiting direct and mediated electron transfer to the anode. The results obtained indicate that MFCs with a naked anode on which a biofilm was allowed unrestricted development (MFC-A) had the most diverse archaeal and bacterial community. and offered the best performance. In this MFC both. direct and mediated electron transfer. occurred simultaneously. but direct electron transfer was the predominant mechanism. Microbial fuel cells in which the anode was enclosed in a dialysis membrane and biofilm was not allowed to develop (MFC-D). had a much lower power output (about 60% lower). and a prevalence of dissolved redox species that acted as putative electron shuttles. In the anolyte of this MFC. Arcobacter and Methanosaeta were the prevalent bacteria and archaea respectively. In the third MFC. in which the anode had been covered by a cation selective nafion membrane (MFC-N). power output decreased a further 5% (95% less than MFC-A).

In recent years. the accumulation of molecular data led to a new evolutionary understanding. in which all eukaryotic diversity has been classified into five or six supergroups. Yet. the composition of these large assemblages and their relationships remain controversial.Methodology/Principle FindingsHere. we report the sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for two species belonging to the supergroup Rhizaria and present the analysis of a unique dataset combining 29908 amino acid positions and an extensive taxa sampling made of 49 mainly unicellular species representative of all supergroups. Our results show a very robust relationship between Rhizaria and two main clades of the supergroup chromalveolates: stramenopiles and alveolates. We confirm the existence of consistent affinities between assemblages that were thought to belong to different supergroups of eukaryotes. thus not sharing a close evolutionary history.ConclusionsThis well supported phylogeny has important consequences for our understanding of the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. In particular. it questions a single red algal origin of the chlorophyll-c containing plastids among the chromalveolates.

Such supermatrices of sequence data are preferred over single gene alignments as they contain vastly more information about ancient sequence characteristics. and are thus more suitable for resolving deeply diverging relationships. However. as alignments are expanded. increasingly numbers of sites with misleading phylogenetic information are also added. Therefore. a major goal in phylogenomic analyses is to maximize the ratio of information to noise; this can be achieved by the reduction of fast evolving sites. Here we present a batch-oriented web-based program package. named AIR that allows 1) transformation of several single genes to one multigene alignment. 2) identification of evolutionary rates in multigene alignments and 3) removal of fast evolving sites. These three processes can be done with the programs AIR-A ppender. AIR-I dentifier. and AIR-R emover (AIR). which can be used independently or in a semi-automated pipeline. AIR produces user-friendly output files with filtered and non-filtered alignments where residues are colored according to their evolutionary rates.

To establish the sequence of events when animals evolved from unicellular ancestors. and understand those key evolutionary transitions. we need to establish which choanozoans are most closely related to animals and also the evolutionary position of each choanozoan group within the opisthokont phylogenetic tree. Here we focus on Ministeria vibrans. a minute bacteria-eating cell with slender radiating tentacles. Single-gene trees suggested that it is either the closest unicellular relative of animals or else sister to choanoflagellates. traditionally considered likely animal ancestors.

We compared the effects of UV radiation on the bacterial use of DOM in a wide range of lakes. Although complex DOM was converted in all irradiated samples into carboxylic acids that are readily utilized by bacteria. irradiation in several lakes resulted in a decreased ability of DOM to support bacterial growth. The effect of irradiation on the ability of DOM to promote bacterial growth was a positive function of the terrestrial humic matter. and a negative function of indigenous algal production.

Microalgae are important sources of organic matter in most aquatic systems. because they transform solar energy into reduced carbon compounds. It is clear that autochthonous DOM of algal and macrophyte origin is an important contributor to the total pool of organic matter in most aquatic environments. Production of DOM from aquatic algae and macrophytes occurs by several different mechanisms: predatory grazing. cell death and senescence. viral lysis. and extracellular release.

This shift offers opportunities for a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes and services. In this paper. we highlight studies that have focused on BEF of microbial communities with an emphasis on integrating trait-based approaches to microbial ecology. In doing so. we explore some of the inherent challenges and opportunities of understanding BEF using microbial systems. For example. microbial biologists characterize communities using gene phylogenies that are often unable to resolve functional traits. Additionally. experimental designs of existing microbial BEF studies are often inadequate to unravel BEF relationships. We argue that combining eco-physiological studies with contemporary molecular tools in a trait-based framework can reinforce our ability to link microbial diversity to ecosystem processes. We conclude that such trait-based approaches are a promising framework to increase the understanding of microbial BEF relationships and thus generating systematic principles in microbial ecology and more generally ecology.,True,8I3ASaEAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,250,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00251/full,10574287913733563166,/scholar?cites=10574287913733563166,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00251/full,0,0,0

Validating the new setups is a crucial part of conducting rigorous scientific research. Here we report on the reliability and biases of performing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform. We designed a protocol using 50 barcode pairs to run samples in parallel and coded a pipeline to process the data. Sequencing the same sediment sample in 248 replicates as well as 70 samples from alkaline soda lakes. we evaluated the performance of the method with regards to estimates of alpha and beta diversity. Using different purification and DNA quantification procedures we always found up to 5-fold differences in the yield of sequences between individually barcodes samples. Using either a one-step or a two-step PCR preparation resulted in significantly different estimates in both alpha and beta diversity. Comparing with a previous method based on 454 pyrosequencing. we found that our Illumina protocol performed in a similar manner – with the exception for evenness estimates where correspondence between the methods was low. We further quantified the data loss at every processing step eventually accumulating to 50% of the raw reads. When evaluating different OTU clustering methods. we observed a stark contrast between the results of QIIME with default settings and the more recent UPARSE algorithm when it comes to the number of OTUs generated.

This review summarizes different mechanisms and the principal steps involved in chitin degradation at a molecular level while also discussing the coupling of community composition to measured chitin hydrolysis activities and substrate uptake. Ecological consequences are then highlighted and discussed with a focus on the cross feeding associated with the different habitats that arise because of the need for extracellular hydrolysis of the chitin polymer prior to metabolic use.

1129029,Tropical freshwater ecosystems have lower bacterial growth efficiency than temperate ones,2013,André Megali Amado and Frederico Meirelles-Pereira and Luciana De Oliveira Vidal Vidal and Hugo Sarmento Sarmento and Albert Suhett and Vinicius Fortes Farjalla and James Cotner and Fabio Roland,4,,,167,Frontiers,Current models and observations indicate that bacterial respiration should increase and growth efficiency (BGE) should decrease with increasing temperatures. However. these models and observations are mostly derived from data collected primarily in temperate regions. and the tropics are under-represented. The aim of this work was to compare bacterial metabolism. namely bacterial production (BP) and respiration (BR). bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) and bacterial carbon demand (BCD) between tropical and temperate ecosystems via a literature review and using unpublished data. We hypothesized that (i) tropical ecosystems have higher metabolism than temperate ones and. (ii) that BGE is lower in tropical relative to temperate ecosystems. We collected a total of 498 coupled BP and BR observations (Ntotal = 498; Ntemperate = 301; Ntropical = 197). calculated BGE (BP/(BP+BR)) and BCD (BP+BR) for each case and examined patterns using a model II regression analysis and compared each parameter between the two regions using non parametric Mann–Whitney U test. We observed a significant positive linear regression between BR and BP for the whole dataset. and also for tropical and temperate data separately. We found that BP. BR and BCD were higher in the tropics. but BGE was lower compared to temperate regions. Also. BR rates per BP unit are at least two fold higher in the tropics than in temperate ecosystems.

Whereas there is consensus that in most of the systems the CO2 emitted by streams represents C fixed in the terrestrial ecosystem. the pathways delivering this C to streams are still not well understood. We assessed the contribution of direct soil CO2 injection versus the oxidation of soil-derived dissolved organic C (DOC) and CH4 in supporting CO2 supersaturation in boreal streams in Québec. We measured the concentrations of CO2. CH4 and DOC in 43 streams and adjacent soil waters during summer base-flow period.

In marine environments. parasite-host interactions contribute substantially to shaping microbial communities. but their nature and complexity remain poorly understood. In this study. we examined the relationship between Perkinsea parasitoids and bloom-forming dinoflagellate species. Our aim was to determine whether parasite-host species interactions are specific and whether the diversity and distribution of parasitoids are shaped by their dinoflagellate hosts. Several locations along the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean Sea) were sampled during the blooms of five dinoflagellate species and the diversity of Perkinsea was determined by combining cultivation-based methods with metabarcoding of the V4 region of 18S rDNA. Most known species of Parviluciferaceae. and others not yet described. were detected. some of them coexisting in the same coastal location. and with a wide distribution. The specific parasite-host interactions determined for each of the studied blooms demonstrated the host preferences exhibited by parasitoids in nature. The dominance of a species within the parasitoid community is driven by the presence and abundances of its preferred host(s).The absence of parasitoid species. often associated with a low abundance of their preferred hosts. suggested that high infection rates are reached only under conditions that favour parasitoid propagation. especially dinoflagellate blooms.,True,v6jlDXgAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.17.431570v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/02/17/2021.02.17.431570.full.pdf,0,0,0

Several physiological roles have been proposed for EVs in marine environment. including excretion. cellular communication. gene transfer. phage resistance. toxicity. carbon cycling and actually it is well known that vesicles can contain DNA. RNA. protein and polypeptides. The isolation and characterization of EVs represents a technological challenge not fully solved; despite several protocols have been proposed it is still not clear what is the best method. moreover there are no protocol dedicated to marine eukaryotes. For these reasons. our first aim was to establish an efficient protocol of EVs isolation. We used a model organism already cultured in our lab: Alexandrium minutum (from now on A. minutum). A. minutum is a dinoflagellate that blooms regularly along the Catalan coast and it is of particular interest since this specie can produce toxins dangerous for human health; it is important to highlight that based on numerous evidences in prokaryotes. it has been suggested that the overwhelming majority of toxin released from cells is encapsulated in EVs.

The latter are also called diatom-diazotroph associations. or DDAs. Up to now. the prokaryotic partners have been morphologically and genetically characterized. and the phylogenetic reconstruction of the well conserved nifH gene (encodes for the nitrogenase enzyme) placed the symbionts in 3 clusters based on their host-specificity. ie het-1 (Rhizosolenia-R. intracellularis). het-2 (Hemiaulus-R. intracellularis). and het-3 (Chaetoceros-C-rhizosoleniae).

The ecological question of when and where they are controlled by resource availability (bottom-up). protistan and viral losses (top-down) or temperature has long intrigued us.

Samples were collected from the surface down to 4000 m depth at 109 stations across the Atlantic. Indian and Pacific Oceans. We found a systematic negative relationship between bottom-up and temperature controls only lost under strong top-down control. Control by temperature could be seen as a gap opened in the solid wall of bottom-up and top-down regulation. peaking at moderate values of these two opposing controls. Our analysis also unveiled a remarkable latitudinal pattern in temperature control. which increased polewards regardless of the oceanic basin.

Radiolaria has traditionally been divided into four main groups based on morphological characters; i.e. Polycystina. Acantharia. Nassellaria and Phaeodaria. But recent 18S rDNA phylogenies have shown that Phaeodaria belongs within Cerocozoa. and that the previously heliozoan group Taxopodida should be included in Radiolaria. 18S rDNA phylogenies have not yet resolved the sister relationship between the main Radiolaria groups. but nevertheless suggests that Spumellaria. and thereby also Polycystina. are polyphyletic. Very few sequences other than 18S rDNA have so far been generated from radiolarian cells. mostly due to the fact that Radiolaria has been impossible to cultivate and single cell PCR has been hampered by low success rate. Here we have therefore investigated the mutual evolutionary relationship of the main radiolarian groups by using the novel approach of combining single cell whole genome amplification with targeted PCR amplification of the 18S and 28S rDNA genes. Combined 18S and 28S phylogeny of sequences obtained from single cells shows that Radiolaria is divided into two main lineages: Polycystina (Spumellaria+Nassellaria) and Spasmaria (Acantharia+Taxopodida).

In contrast to earlier studies that have employed eukaryote-wide PCR design. we identified a large and unknown diversity of phylotypes and the first rigorous evidence for several freshwater species. altogether comprising 91 unique sequences. Phylogenies of these and publicly available sequences showed 20 statistically supported sub-clades as well as several solitary phylotypes with no clear phylogenetic affiliation. Most of these sub-clades were composed of phylotypes from different geographic regions. By using specific PCR primers we reveal a much larger diversity of Telonemia from environmental samples than previously uncovered by eukaryote-wide primers. The new data substantially diminish the geographic structuring of clades identified in earlier studies.

These hypotheses are evaluated in this thesis by using environmental sequencing and molecular phylogeny. Three groups of unicellular eukaryotes. representing very different lifestyles. are investigated; the cryptomonads; photosynthetic flagellates. the alveolates; intracellular parasites. and the heterothrophic flagellates of the phylum Telonemia. The level of cross-colonization. i.e gene-flow. between freshwater and marine habitat. and the level of geographic distribution within the marine habitat is used to test the hypotheses.

This organism was susceptible to most antibiotics in the 1970s. It has now become a major cause of hospital-acquired infections worldwide due to its remarkable propensity to rapidly acquire resistance determinants to a wide range of antibacterial agents. Here we use a comparative genomic approach to identify the complete repertoire of resistance genes exhibited by the multidrug-resistant A. baumannii strain AYE. which is epidemic in France. as well as to investigate the mechanisms of their acquisition by comparison with the fully susceptible A. baumannii strain SDF. which is associated with human body lice. The assembly of the whole shotgun genome sequences of the strains AYE and SDF gave an estimated size of 3.9 and 3.2 Mb. respectively. A. baumannii strain AYE exhibits an 86-kb genomic region termed a resistance island—the largest identified to date—in which 45 resistance genes are clustered. At the homologous location. the SDF strain exhibits a 20 kb-genomic island flanked by transposases but devoid of resistance markers. Such a switching genomic structure might be a hotspot that could explain the rapid acquisition of resistance markers under antimicrobial pressure. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses confirm that most of the resistance genes found in the A. baumannii strain AYE have been recently acquired from bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas. Salmonella. or Escherichia. This study also resulted in the discovery of 19 new putative resistance genes.

Here. we investigate the evolutionary processes that shaped the genomes of the genus. The reconstruction of ancestral genomes indicates that their last common ancestor contained more genes. but already possessed most traits associated with cellular parasitism. The differences in gene repertoires across modern Rickettsia are mainly the result of differential gene losses from the ancestor. We demonstrate using computer simulation that the propensity of loss was variable across genes during this process. We also analyzed the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes (Ka/Ks) calculated as an average over large sets of genes to assay the strength of selection acting on the genomes of Rickettsia. Anaplasmataceae. and free-living γ-proteobacteria. As a general trend. Ka/Ks were found to decrease with increasing divergence between genomes. The high Ka/Ks for closely related genomes are probably due to a lag in the removal of slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations by natural selection. Interestingly. we also observed a decrease of the rate of gene loss with increasing divergence. suggesting a similar lag in the removal of slightly deleterious pseudogene alleles. For larger divergence (Ks > 0.2). Ka/Ks converge toward similar values indicating that the levels of selection are roughly equivalent between intracellular α-proteobacteria and their free-living relatives. This contrasts with the view that obligate endocellular microorganisms tend to evolve faster as a consequence of reduced effectiveness of selection …,True,UWvVSgoAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,192,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030014,14103675770333671134,/scholar?cites=14103675770333671134,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030014,0,0,0

The strain TY-2482 sequenced from this outbreak allowed the discovery of its closest relatives but failed to resolve ways in which it originated and evolved. On account of the previous statement. may we expect similar upcoming outbreaks to occur recurrently or spontaneously in the future? The inability to answer these questions shows limitations of the current comparative and evolutionary genomics methods.   Principal Findings The study revealed oscillations of gene exchange in enterobacteria. which originated from marine γ-Proteobacteria. These mobile genetic elements have become recombination hotspots and effective ‘vehicles’ ensuring a wide distribution of successful combinations of fitness and virulence genes among enterobacteria. Two remarkable peculiarities of the strain TY-2482 and its relatives were observed: i) retaining the genetic primitiveness by these strains as they somehow avoided the main fluxes of horizontal gene transfer which effectively penetrated other enetrobacteria; ii) acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes in a plasmid genomic island of β-Proteobacteria origin which ontologically is unrelated to the predominant genomic islands of enterobacteria.   Conclusions Oscillations of horizontal gene exchange activity were reported which result from a counterbalance between the acquired resistance of bacteria towards existing mobile vectors and the generation of new vectors in the environmental microflora.

Decomposition of plants. algae and animals creates anaerobic environments that facilitate growth of C. botulinum. which may then enter into food webs leading to intoxication of animals. Via saprophytic utilization of nutrients. the bacteria rapidly sporulate. creating a reservoir of highly robust spores. In the present review. we focus on the occurrence of C. botulinum in non-clinical environments. and examine factors influencing growth and environmental factors associated with botulism outbreaks. We also outline cases involving specific environments and their biota. In wetlands. it has been found that some C. botulinum strains can associate with toxin-unaffected organisms—including algae. plants. and invertebrates—in which the bacteria appear to germinate and stay in the vegetative form for longer periods of time.

Their major plastid type with the accessory pigment peridinin is found in the vast majority of photosynthetic species. Some species of dinoflagellates have other aberrantly pigmented plastids. We sequenced the nuclear small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of the “green” dinoflagellate Gymnodinium chlorophorum and show that it is sister to Lepidodinium viride. indicating that their common ancestor obtained the prasinophyte (or other green alga) plastid in one event.

Since then. one of us (DK) has carried out electron microscopy on several clones of C. huxleyi. One fact emerging from this work is that there are two morphologically distinct types of eoccolith-free cells. both of which reproduce their own kind in laboratory culture for indefinite periods. We propose to restrict the term 57 ceil to one of them; this cell type was used in the experimental investigation (Paasche and Klaveness. 1970) but has not previously been subjected to electron microscopy.

The two lakes involved differ in trophic status and in concentration and composition of dissolved organic matter. one being a typical dystrophic bog lake. the other a less humus influenced. eutrophic lake. In the dystrophic lake. the toxic effect is determined mainly by the free cadmium activity. In the eutrophic. less humus influenced lake. however. the toxic effect shows considerable seasonal variations with a toxicity far exceeding what would be expected according to the estimated free ion activity during summer.

The two cell types did not differ significantly with regard to cell volume and protein content. A 10–13% smaller chlorophyll a content of the naked cells was matched by a uniform lowering of photosynthetic rates at all light intensities.

Such transfers drastically change the environment of the plastids and hence the selection regimes. presumably leading to changes over time in the characteristics of plastid gene evolution and to misleading phylogenetic inferences. About half of the dinoflagellate protists species are photosynthetic and unique in harboring a diversity of plastids acquired from a wide range of eukaryotic algae. They are therefore ideal for studying evolutionary processes of plastids gained through secondary and tertiary endosymbioses. In the light of these processes. we have evaluated the origin of 2 types of dinoflagellate plastids. containing the peridinin or 19′-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (19′-HNOF) pigments. by inferring the phylogeny using “covarion” evolutionary models allowing the pattern of among …,True,2AL0hX4AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,54,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/23/8/1504/967491,8195792250171242328,/scholar?cites=8195792250171242328,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/23/8/1504/967491,0,0,0

The answer lies in the allometric diet breadth,2010,Carmen Rojo and Guillem Salazar,653,Hydrobiologia,1,91-102,Springer Netherlands,In an attempt to explain ‘Why are there so many kinds of animals?’ G.E. Hutchinson highlighted the food web context to suggest that diversity of primary producers should allow consumer richness to be maintained as a result of their adaptive foraging. Co-existence of consumers is then made possible when species differ in body size and thus only a minor diet overlap occurs. All these ideas are still major topics in ecological research and some have been re-examined in order to provide mechanistic explanations of species richness versus connectance relationships in food web structure. The effect of body size as a determinant of diet. jointly with the assumption that individuals are adapted to switch their diet in order to maximise energy gain. have been combined in recent years to develop the Allometric Diet Breadth Model (ADBM). This model. successful for plankton communities. enables us to determine the …,True,EeXnRd0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-9908-2_8,683096976032822581,/scholar?cites=683096976032822581,,,0,0,0

The serum metabolome of insulin-resistant individuals is characterized by increased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). which correlate with a gut microbiome that has an enriched biosynthetic potential for BCAAs and is deprived of genes encoding bacterial inward transporters for these amino acids. Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus are identified as the main species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAAs and insulin resistance. and in mice we demonstrate that P. copri can induce insulin resistance. aggravate glucose intolerance and augment circulating levels of BCAAs.

This species blooms in very cold. often ice-covered waters. and is responsible for a significant fraction of the production in that region. Dormancy. temperature. oxygen and light were studied as factors potentially controlling the germination of S.hangoei resting cysts. Laboratory-stored and field-collected cysts began to germinate in December following a mandatory dormancy period lasting 6 months. Germination after this maturation interval was maximal when temperatures were within a 0–9°C ‘window’. Mandatory dormancy is therefore the primary factor regulating the timing of germination in this species. as temperatures in the natural environment normally fall within this range at the time when S.hangoei cysts deposited the preceding year have …,True,l-7EKhoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,136,https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article-abstract/22/7/1311/1519343,6593495110509303114,/scholar?cites=6593495110509303114,,https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/22/7/1311/1519343,0,0,0

Analysis of approximately 3500 spring bloom samples from the Baltic Sea monitoring programs revealed (i) that within the major basins the proportion of dinoflagellates varied from 0.1 (Kattegat) to >0.8 (central Baltic Proper). and (ii) substantial shifts (e.g. from 0.2 to 0.6 in the Gulf of Finland) in the dinoflagellate proportion over four decades. During a recent decade (1995–2004) the proportion of dinoflagellates increased relative to diatoms mostly in the northernmost basins (Gulf of Bothnia. from 0.1 to 0.4) and in the Gulf of Finland. (0.4 to 0.6) which are typically ice-covered areas. We hypothesize that in coastal areas a specific sequence of seasonal events. involving wintertime mixing and resuspension of benthic cysts. followed by proliferation in stratified thin layers under melting ice. favors successful seeding and accumulation of dense dinoflagellate populations over diatoms. This head-start of dinoflagellates by the onset of the spring bloom is decisive for successful competition with the faster growing diatoms. Massive cyst formation and spreading of cyst beds fuel the expanding and ever larger dinoflagellate blooms in the relatively shallow coastal waters. Shifts in the dominant spring bloom algal groups can have significant effects on major elemental fluxes and functioning of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. but also in the vast shelves and estuaries at high latitudes. where ice-associated cold-water dinoflagellates successfully compete with diatoms.,True,l-7EKhoAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,135,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021567,16535174092251744147,/scholar?cites=16535174092251744147,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021567,0,0,0

Significant genetic differentiation (FST) between northern and southern locations was correlated to geographical distance. However. instead of discrete genetic units or continuous genetic differentiation. the analysis of population structure suggests a complex and partially hierarchic pattern of genetic differentiation.

Existing data are. however. restricted geographically and by limited sequencing depths. Our analysis of 79.090 nitrogenase (nifH) PCR amplicons encoding 7.468 unique proteins from surface samples (ten DNA samples and two RNA samples) collected at ten marine locations world-wide provides the first in-depth survey of a functional bacterial gene and yield insights into the composition and diversity of the nifH gene pool in marine waters. Great divergence in nifH composition was observed between sites. Cyanobacteria-like genes were most frequent among amplicons from the warmest waters. but overall the data set was dominated by nifH sequences most closely related to non-cyanobacteria. Clusters related to Alpha-. Beta-. Gamma-. and Delta-Proteobacteria were most common and showed distinct geographic distributions. Sequences related to anaerobic bacteria (nifH Cluster III) were generally rare. but preponderant in cold waters. especially in the Arctic. Although the two transcript samples were dominated by unicellular cyanobacteria. 42% of the identified non-cyanobacterial nifH clusters from the corresponding DNA samples were also detected in cDNA.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of elevated DOM on a coastal pelagic food web from the coastal northern Baltic Sea. in a 32-day mesocosm experiment. In particular. the study addresses the response of bacterioplankton to differences in character and composition of supplied DOM. The supplied DOM differed in stoichiometry and quality and had pronounced effects on the recipient bacterioplankton. driving compositional changes in response to DOM type. The shifts in bacterioplankton community composition. was especially driven by the proliferation of Bacteroidetes. Gemmatimonadetes. Planctomycetes. and Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria populations. The DOM additions stimulated protease activity and bacterial production. but not abundance. suggesting that DOM was actively processed. However. no difference between DOM types was detected in these functions despite different community compositions. Extensive release of re-mineralized carbon. nitrogen and phosphorus was associated with the bacterial processing. corresponding to 25 - 85 % of the supplied DOM. The DOM additions had a negative effect on phytoplankton with decreased Chl a and biomass. particularly during the first half of the experiment.
